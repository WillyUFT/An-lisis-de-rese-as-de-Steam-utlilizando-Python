I see similar fun puzzle rooms with similar intrigue and similar attention to detail in the narrative, but the culmination of everything feels so...clumsy and shlocky.\n\n'Shlock' is a good word for it - it feels so over the top in service of very little. The Zero Escape series is no stranger to violence of all kinds, but never has it felt so unnecessarily pronounced and shoehorned in there. Why is the solution to this \"open a door\" puzzle a grenade launcher? Why is the solution to this \"open a panel\" puzzle a shotgun? Well, so that unstable people can have a weapon handy for incidental murder!\n\nIt's just...dumb. And not in the fun way! Characters' morality is flipped on and off as is needed to advance the plot, something that especially hurts the final \"Decision Game\" which involves a moral dilemma the group has been actively ignoring for the entire game. And it's clear nobody could remember how to write for the 999 characters. I sincerely don't mind characters changing and growing over time (e.g. I had no problems with any of the VLR characters), but damn did they do Jumpy dirty in this game.\n\nVLR set up the Dcom Experiment as a fascinating puzzle box, but unfortunately it really feels like the writers couldn't figure out what was supposed to be inside it.\n\nIronic for a puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1700257760, "timestamp_updated": 1700257760, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150304264": {"recommendationid": "150304264", "author": {"steamid": "76561199441526602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 1850, "last_played": 1700418851}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game maybe isn't as great as the first 2 in the series, it's a good game in and of itself.

Let me get this out of the way first, the puzzle rooms are fine, so is the music.\nEverything else is pretty shit. The animations look like shit, characters constantly have their hair clipping through their shoulders and emotional moments sometimes look like a complete joke because of the models. VLR did mostly fine with its models(only having one or two strange faces) so what happened here?! \n\nAnd then there is the writing. Oh my god the writing. Its so fucking bad. Most of the cast is extremely boring and the twists either come off as half baked or just straight up stupid. Sometimes if feels like bad fanfiction. I could go on and on about how bad it is but I really just don't feel like it. I can't believe this garbage is in the same series as 999 and VLR. \n\nAnd then there is the formatting. Unlike the other two games each segment is completely separated from each other because the characters are always injected with memory erasing drugs and each group stays the same throughout the game. Plus there are like 3 different main characters instead of just one. This makes it hard to get invested in anything that is going on since you're constantly bouncing around to fragments of different routes, each completely irreverent to the last one you played besides maybe giving you a password or something. \n\nAnd then the main gimmick of this game. The decision game! These are just basic yes or no choices most of the time that just are basically just result in death or not death. One of them is particularly pointless where the characters are worrying about whether the antidote to a poison is also poisoned and they make you decide whether or not to take the antidote or not, but the characters are dying anyway! It doesn't fucking matter if its poisoned!

And I thought Virtues Last Reward was a decent sequel minus the lame ending and the retconing of Alice. \nZero Time Dilemma was supposed to wrap it all up but failed.\n\nPros:\n- Rooms/Puzzles are challenging, if you are below 100 IQ you have no chance of beating this game.\n- New characters are intriguing and entertaining.\n- Sigma is Top G.\n\nCons:\n- Junpei and Akane are unrecognizable compared to their personalities in 999 and VLR, this isn't \"character growth\" they are just completely different characters from what they used to be.\n- Depending on which branch you go down you can run into situations where you can tell the developers didn't account for your choices, and as a result you have to go back and forth through timelines and hear the same dialogue and it just gets boring. Obviously the point of the game is to jump between timelines but it was done better in the first two. Confusing the player for no reason other than you didn't pick the right timeline first isn't good story telling.\n- I've always thought the Radical-6 virus was a lame plot device and I never felt like it was implemented well into the story.\n- VLR had some uncanny valley vibes with the characters faces but ZTD takes the cake. Many cringe moments when a characters face just freezes after they stop talking.\n\nKotaro Uchikoshi has great talent when it comes to designing puzzles and escape rooms but you can tell he has trouble developing satisfying conclusions to his stories. 999 is a fantastic build up of suspense and mystery but the ending leaves a few big questions unanswered which we assumed would be answered in VLR. In VLR we got the most interesting character; Alice, retconned into an annoying bitch with the lamest backstory ever and so much potential squandered. VLR didn't really answer the questions from 999 it just gave us more and ZTD does the same. It places itself in the middle of 999 and VLR and basically at the end it comes down to, \"OH we shifted back to the timeline where we won the dumb coin flip so Radical-6 won't spread but for some dumb reason mankind will still go extinct (???). And this was all done so we would take 'saving the world' seriously.\" What are these characters fucking retarded?! This is the same logic the Saw movies use; \"Oh we have to subject you to insane torture cause you smoke cigarettes, now that you suffered so much you'll appreciate life.\" Its just lame and bad story telling. Fans wanted closure after VLR and all we got was filler.

A majority of the characters were charming and I wanted to know more about them. I didn't really feel that way about Zero Time Dilemma. You already know lots of the characters, and really only one of them has changed between entries. The new characters for the most part, state their motivations and defining character traits straight off the bat. I honestly didn't really like any of the new characters, I guess Diana is okay but that's because she's paired with Sigma and Phi, who were some of my favorites from Virtue's Last Reward. \n\nBesides the characters, I felt like this entry had so little to say in terms of themes. I don't even know the point of this game, spoilers ahead but, we already know most of what happens in this experiment. We know Phi and Sigma were infiltrating and the only surprise is that Junpei and Akane are there too. It doesn't really fulfill any promises it was setting up. The Radical-6 plot line is basically relegated to one branch from Q-teams flowchart. I thought that solving the Radical-6 crisis was the whole point but I felt like they barely mentioned it, and when it did come up, you finished out that fragment pretty quickly and the characters forgot about it. \n\nBIG SPOILER\n\nI guess the twist that Phi is Sigma's daughter is neat, but there was almost no pay off for when she learns that. There was one hug between Sigma, Phi and Diana, but otherwise it doesn't really matter. Same with the reveal that Mira is a serial killer. It was relevant I think twice and then she gets off scot free. What was the point? Dio was the villain of the characters in VLR and he was such a prick and made it fun to hate him. Mira is just, kind of rude sometimes, and only scary in like two scenes. \n\nAs for the gameplay, I thought the puzzles were fine. The repetition of being put to sleep by Zero and the characters remarking on it got really annoying. I didn't feel any tension like I did from escape rooms in 999 and VLR. The teams idea is okay in principle but it thoroughly restricts character interaction. They should have had the characters meet up much sooner on in the story. Jumping from fragment to fragment is kinda cool but it was much more frustrating to understand what was needed to unlock new fragments. Especially when you need to see the executions of all the teams. I went back to make sure every team voted for every other team, but I didn't understand that I technically hadn't seen the executions, so I had to look up online what I was missing. \n\nAnyway idk it's prob like a 5/10, definitely prefer 999 and VLR, but if you like those, you can play this and have the same feelings I do I guess. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1696726992, "timestamp_updated": 1696726992, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555957674980163574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147830397": {"recommendationid": "147830397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296190431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1616903493}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish I could like it, I really do, it's puzzle game, the mystery is interesting and just a cool concept.

La vida es injusta, y eso es algo que este juego se esforzar\u00e1 por demostrarte.\n\nLa historia, como en todos los dem\u00e1s juegos de la serie, est\u00e1 incre\u00edblemente bien hecha. La gran mayor\u00eda de puntos est\u00e1n hilados de una forma en la que todo tiene sentido, y la forma en la que se enfrentan al controvertido tema de \"Viajes en el tiempo\" me parece una de las mejores maneras de llevarla a cabo. Como siempre, el plot twist de este juego, como en los dem\u00e1s de la serie, es algo que te deja boquiabierto, aunque quiz\u00e1 no en tanta medida como en Virtue's Last Reward, pero sigue siendo bastante efectivo.\nQuiz\u00e1 alguno de los nuevos personajes no resuene tanto con la audiencia como lo hicieron los dem\u00e1s grupos de los juegos anteriores, pero le dan una perspectiva a los hechos que resulta muy interesante.\n\nSin embargo, aunque la historia es una maravilla, la forma de contarlo no lo es tanto. Debido a problemas de presupuesto, las animaciones de las escenas sufrieron un gran golpe de calidad. Es algo que se nota muy r\u00e1pidamente, y aunque el estilo art\u00edstico de Virtue's Last Reward definitivamente era algo a lo que acostumbrarse, la rigidez de los movimientos en este juego son algo mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de tragar.\n\nEl otro punto importante del juego son los puzles. Como en los otros dos t\u00edtulos, son Escape Rooms bastante bien hechas, y en general tienen la dificultad justa para darle vueltas las veces necesarias sin que se haga un dolor de cabeza. \nHay excepciones, por supuesto: en algunos casos, los comentarios de los dem\u00e1s personajes durante estas partes te pueden dar tantas pistas que acaban por trivializar el puzle (como en 999), y en otras ocasiones, la complejidad de algunas mec\u00e1nicas puede ser bastante abrumadora.\n\nLa banda sonora es una absoluta genialidad.

Additionally the game barely gives you anything to formulate questions with.\n999 is very upfront with information and still pulls off a twist with you, VLR is cagey about giving answers but it gives SO much info and so many mysteries and plot-lines, but this game feels like you are an observer to events and you need to wait and see where it's going at all more than anything. There's some individual mysteries, concepts or threads with characters, but the game generally doesn't have a lot for you to go on for what're the grander things at play.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694384463, "timestamp_updated": 1694384463, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146015569": {"recommendationid": "146015569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176048386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1694488626}, "language": "english", "review": "I am only about 50% (9 hrs in) through the story so far but it is quite good! \n\nIf you don't like blood and gore though, this game may not be for you!\n\nThis is the third game in the series and some of the plot lines only make sense if you play the other games first.

But man, it might be one of the most entertaining farces I've experienced in video game storytelling. Things will just happen, you'll be tossed around the timeline, flopping and gasping for context like a fish. The visuals will do their best to convey scenes, but be just shy of par. And honestly? It was delightful for me.\n\nBut hey, it's not all ironic enjoyment here. There ARE story beats I genuinely enjoy (mostly in D-Team, which  [spoiler]features cast members from Virtue's Last Reward[/spoiler]), and the escape rooms, I'd argue are marginally better than most of Virtue's Last Reward's. And personally, I really enjoyed the ending beat. Not the twist preceding it, felt that was a little much.  [spoiler]The ending itself, however, has a nice resolution that meshes with the Decision mechanic of the game, and the epilogues provided for some characters were nice.[/spoiler]\n\n\nAs a whole, Zero Time Dilemma is a game I think all Zero Escape fans need to experience. It's especially enhanced by going in unspoiled. Now, if you love it? Hate it? Find a sick ironic enjoyment in it? That's your decision to make. Personally I'm somewhere in the middle of all three, but I wouldn't trade the experience I had here for the world.

and truly i do appreciate the existence of this game and how it only came to be because of the dedicated fans of this franchise. however.... unless you are like me who feels the need to play a whole series just to get the full story and closure, i would NOT recommend this game. honestly, if you do play this game, please instead view it as a comedy because it becomes way more enjoyable as one than as an actual narrative.\n\ni will not fully review this game because i am tired and don't really want to detail ALL of its faults, but to briefly sum it up - this game is bad. zero escape writing can go off the walls sometimes, however this was just so unbearably insane, with so many inexplicable moments that NOTHING in this game felt like i could truly become invested or emotionally connected to any part of it. the mastermind reveal twist was both boring and predictable, the characters are generally lacklustre (though i did enjoy carlos and diana, c team too as a whole was a class comedy act and very entertaining) and the game is also incredibly ugly. i can excuse bad visuals and interesting writing, but this doesn't have the writing to help me look past the awful visuals lol. despite all this, there are some redeeming moments, and i did personally find the game very entertaining and funny - even if for the wrong reasons. but, generally, i would not recommend this game to any average and non dedicated player - because in my opinion it is just not worth it. go play the other two games and experience joy.\n\nalso, this happened to my buddy eric", "timestamp_created": 1693088672, "timestamp_updated": 1693088672, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145017166": {"recommendationid": "145017166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096315705", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1353, "last_played": 1692834671}, "language": "english", "review": "W impregnation", "timestamp_created": 1693001744, "timestamp_updated": 1693001852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499748826026916504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144923450": {"recommendationid": "144923450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329687469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 650, "last_played": 1692444972}, "language": "english", "review": "Characters are either extremely annoying or extremely lame, just like real life", "timestamp_created": 1692888865, "timestamp_updated": 1692889492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710184037685394287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144500183": {"recommendationid": "144500183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350054650", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1692894755}, "language": "english", "review": "Is always fun to play", "timestamp_created": 1692377126, "timestamp_updated": 1692377126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144135627": {"recommendationid": "144135627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194312774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1215, "last_played": 1691972356}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very good and entertaining game, although I found it disconcerting at times in terms of the story.\nBe aware that it's extremely dark and violent, sometimes a tad depressing.

It has a much darker theme and scenes compared to previous games of the trilogy but it feels justifiable and it is still very satisfactory to see just how messed up some timelines can get.\n\nIf you have played the previous games of the trilogy I would say the last game is a must, if only to see the end of the story as a whole.

But just like the other reviews for this game, make sure you play the other games in the series, they're absolutely amazing as well, but practically necessary to play this game. It would be incredibly confusing for someone playing this without the previous knowledge of the other games.\n\nFirst of all the voice acting is amazing. There are some incredible voice actors casted in this game! From Matthew Mercer, Evan Smith and for the Japanese dub Daisuke Ono, the voice actor behind Jotaro from Jojo's among many other iconic video games and anime. They really went above and beyond for the voice acting!\n\nSecondly the story is amazing! Minus some parts which admittedly weren't telegraphed too well, it's a really enjoyable plot which takes up right after the last couples of games! Which is both a positive and a negative, for players unfamiliar with the series they would be absolutely confused at what is happening, which could scare someone off of the series, unlike the previous games 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. 999 is the first game so it doesn't have this problem, and VLR manages to get away with a lot despite the context of the previous game, and you don't need to have the knowledge of 999, you can still enjoy it a lot, although you might not catch the references to the past game. As someone who played the other games I enjoyed it because it swiftly got into the story elements of the previous series without having the relearn them again, which was nice! But from a newcomer to the series it would be really confusing.\n\nThird, the puzzles! The puzzles are just as fun in this game as the others, although some times I had to use a guide, the majority of puzzles are challenging, yet solvable!\n\nUnfortunately it's come to the negatives.\n\nThe game looks bad, like really bad. For a game released in 2016 it looks awful, but this is because the game was basically made for the 3DS and was then ported to other platforms, this is why the game looks pretty awful. The character designs and models look amazing though, aswell as the character portraits, but the environments and the dog Gab just look mushy and rough, which is a huge shame.\n\nSome of the story elements come out of left field, anyone who played the game knows about THAT twist I'm talking about. Although the story is really good sometimes it fails to telegraph specific things that lead to plot twists, which ultimately just confuses the player. Although it wasn't great I still enjoyed it.\n\nFinally, the fragment selection screen. It's difficult to explain it without spoilers, but in other games you have a branching timeline that dictates the story, you start at the start, go through different choices and hit an ending. Most people are probably familiar with this. With ZTD though, it makes \"fragments\", you play out a small section of characters talking, escaping from a room or/and making a story changing decision. Although I like the change in some ways, it's ultimately really confusing initially, as things that happen in one seem to contradict in the others. Later on in the game when you finally start piecing bits together and the overall timeline starts to become more apparent it makes sense, but it was really confusing watching one major thing happen in a fragment just for it to not affect another one. But then again, it adds to the whole mystery of whats going on, and adds to that mechanic that I can't talk about because of spoilers.\n\nDespite the negatives this game is absolutely fantastic, this game series is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone, despite it's flaws.\n\nI wish I could forget everything about this series and play it again, although I'm not sure I could do that it 90 minutes! :D\n\nThank you Zero Escape team for the wonderful game series, this was an amazing send off for Zero Escape, and I'm really looking forward to what comes next!

The other Zero Escape games had their frustrating moments or frustrating characters, but that's all ZTD is - trying to get over yet another bullshit plot contrivance or yet another awful character choice with really nothing of value to tie any of it together. Characters can be neatly divided into broadly tolerable (D team), predictably annoying (C team), or so genuinely insufferable that they make the game worse for every minute you're forced to interact with them (Q team). Oh, plus a healthy dose of gratuitous, unpleasant, over-the-top brutality and gore, with character deaths being far, *far* frequent than any other ZTD and usually portrayed on-screen complete with agonized screams. And as far as the ending goes, this is the most unsatisfying conclusion to a story I've ever seen. Calling it a twist is being WAY too charitable - a twist needs to actually make sense. This is just three Deus Ex Machinas stacked on top of each other wearing a trench coat and yelling about morphogenetic fields in the final act.\n\nOh, and I hope you didn't like any of the worldbuilding or narrative from 999 or VLR, because ZTD retcons or re-frames nearly every interesting element of this franchise into a worse version of itself.

While I personally still prefer 999 and vlr, this game is still definitely a mustplay for fans of the zero escape series.\nThe puzzles and decision making in this game are quite fun. The majority of puzzles are fun to solve, although there were a few that made me lose my mind. The decision making aspect of the game feels like an expanded version of the AB game from vlr, and it's honestly probably better than the AB game. I like that every Game Over and every ending feel unique and different. There were also some decisions that were pretty hard to make because of how terrible I felt making them.\nThe story is well-done, with one specific reveal that definitely shocked and surprised me (if you've played it you know what I'm talking about). The characters are good for the most part, although I don't really like what they did with Junpei as they made him a cringey \"edgelord\", and Eric and Mira were not very likable either. Q, Diana, and Carlos, the newcomers to this game, were probably my favorite, although Sigma and Phi were pretty good as well, even if Phi was pretty underutilized. The ending does feel a little underwhelming, but I still was engaged with the story overall\nThe graphical style in this game is, simply put, not the greatest. Character animations are super stiff, and it had me miss the more 2-D visual novel style that 999 had. Although, to be fair, the escape room sections do look great, although there aren't as many escape room sections as previous zero escape titles.\nOverall, while this game might not be as great as 999 and vlr, I still had a lot of fun with it and found it very engaging. The puzzles are just as great as ever, and I found the story to be very captivating, occasionally on the edge of my seat waiting for what would happen next.

Buuuut, it still managed to suck me in just like the first 2 eventually. It has some fine twists and turns, some of the reveals genuinely impressed me. The puzzle rooms are good, though I was quite disappointed in the lack of an \"endgame\"-type room(FFS, the QCD is RIGHT there). \n\nCharacters are a mixed bag; D-team was great across the board, the boy is absolutely precious, and as obviously hateable as Eric is(and how hard his backstory is to take seriously), he somehow found a way to invoke sympathy in me at times. On the other hand, edgelord Junpei really didn't work for me(though he still had plenty of trademark Junpei moments lol), Mira is plain forgettable and nowhere close to the charisma machine that was Lotus, or even Alice, and Akane and Carlos were just plain serviceable. And as others have said, the Zero plot twist really is kinda stupid and unsatisfying, though admittedly the signs ARE there if you're perceptive enough.\n\nI'm glad this game was able to be made, it's just a damn shame they had to do so with such hefty constraints. Credit where it's due, they did a fine job with what they had. But I can only really recommend you play this if you're truly ride-or-die with the Zero Escape series and have played both previous games already.", "timestamp_created": 1686618729, "timestamp_updated": 1686618729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519704461097717285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139919110": {"recommendationid": "139919110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163177372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1625, "last_played": 1687217266}, "language": "english", "review": "I think it's worth playing if you like the other games.

Before I get into those, I want to say I like the tone a lot more than that of Virtue's Last Reward. It is a lot darker and doesn't have all those stupid jokes. The presentation is compelling; i.e. the cinematography, the sound, music and voice acting. All of which have quirks, that one can get used to. For example, the lack of inbetween animations is compensated with lots and lots of cutaways. Or that the lighting on the characters does not fit the atmosphere. Also, some voiced lines don't quite sound right. Especially from Akane. Nonethless, the cutscenes are entertaining. I did not expect it to become so dramatic and emotional because VLR had none of that.\n\nWhen you get into this game, you better have played the two previous titles. Even if you did, be ready to get thoroughly confused right from the get go. You will then have to do one escape room after the other, because all other content is locked away. After that phase, you need to jump around in the flow chart to watch all iterations events could have occured. So the story becomes the puzzle at that point. Once you did that, there is a long stretch of watching story. I don't believe there is any other way to end this story other than getting 100%.\n\nNow... I'm afraid the story is not very good. The whole plot is pointless and leaves a lot of stuff unanswered. For example what the deal with Mira is. Why was this entire exercise even necessary? The motives of the villain are muddy and are based on assumptions impossible to comprehend, because it's all based on a MacGuffin. Thinking of the Radical-6 angle here. And the themes are all over the place. It doesn't become cohesive; there are too many balls in play. Typical pretentious Japanese writing if I ever saw it. The writers read something in a book and just threw it in there because they found it interesting, whether it fits organically or not. Characters become strawmen for that and quote complex detailed text passages from memory. All of that is very contrived. By the way, the unsatisfying ending has to do with the way all of that story was conceived and planned. For a mystery story, you as the writer need to know the mystery in its entirety before writing anything. Then you sprinkle clues over the narrative. If you throw in some things that only appear mysterious to be figured out later, and if you need to withhold information that later comes out of the blue then you get a mess like this. That is the JJ Abrams mystery box approach, which is bad writing.\n\nHaving said that, I don't believe all of this game's narrative is bad per se. It just feels ill-conceived and rushed. There are some nicely done revelations and character depths.

Stumbled on the first phase of gameplay but really pushed through halfway into the game. Story-wise, I liked its bridge and answers between its prequels but it's not amazing or anything of the sort. All I can say is, Zero was lame as hell and Junpei is an edgelord here\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY [/b]\nZTD is a game that gets messy with their \"fragmented memories\" and the separated groups. If its purpose during the initial phase of the game is to thoroughly confuse you then they did an amazing job. The puzzles have the charm of 999 and are still challenging. I believe it's even better than VLR, especially with the way it makes you scour for the answers and keep you up on your toes. Quick-time events and choices keep your blood pumping, but not too much to be annoying and stressful. It's still a great casual game.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nThis game is an interesting \"middle ground\" between 999 and VLR. There were times where you go \"Oh shit, so that's why\" but if [u]you have to commit to finishing the game as quickly as possible or you'll have a hard time following it[/u]. There will be moments where you didn't think much about this one plot point but it turned out to be incredibly relevant. There isn't a summarized version of events on a single timeline, you'll just have to check the flowchart or put a mental pin on it. Having played it, the twists are incredibly rewarding. Though, the twist about Zero is lame as hell. In fact, of all the Zeroes between the three games, this guy is the lamest Zero of all.

But honestly, it's not a patch on 999 or VLR. (from Zero Escape: The Nonary Games)\n\nZero Time Dilemma switches up the flowchart timeline mechanics and gives some interesting story implications to explain it, but overall it gets messy. There's also some hacky moments with the story progression and the plot devices introduced, and of course, there's that one infamously bad twist, which plays out like it's a gag... but nope, it's canon. I won't give too much away, but let's just say it's to do with how they play around with the franchise's cliche of: \"the mastermind is one of us!\". Poorly alluded to (very obscure, forgettable hints), and frustrating how it locks progression until you solve it.\n\nAside from that, the character writing was off in some places - Junpei comes off being pretty insufferable, Mira and Eric don't have any meaningful character arc by the end - just some backstory and a lot of erratic behaviour from Eric... The rest are fine for the most part, but sadly a lot of the heartfelt moments end up being spoilt by the hilariously bad animations. I understand this started as a 3DS game and was the first game from the series that went so heavy on animated cut-scenes... but there were so many parts that made me wish they'd stuck to text dialogue/ voice acting alongside character portraits.\n\nAt any rate, the game was still entertaining.

Filled with many plot holes as well as the most amount of absurd bullshit compared to the other two, ZTD definitely has many moments of cheesy scenes and convenient explanations for certain mysteries as a result of laziness or rushed storytelling. \n\nZTD also has the most amount of cutscenes, because rather than the traditional visual novel style of gameplay like the previous two games, ZTD opted to go with more animated scenes over still panels. But when comparing to the actual gameplay of ZTD, which is the puzzle solving, it felt like there was a lower amount. The final stretch is essentially multiple long cutscenes to wrap the story up. This could be a positive or negative for people as I can only assume many really enjoyed the game for some of the interesting puzzle design, but for others, it probably stood in the way of seeing more of the plot unfold.\n\nYet, despite this new approach to how the game is presented, the animations were comically bad at many points, if not, the majority of the game. From the desync'd lip animations (I played the game with Japanese voice acting so it wasn't due to the language) to the hilarious walking scenes, the game suffers from terrible or funny presentation which can lower the serious tone the story intends to tell. \n\nSo with all this criticism, why am I even bothering to recommend the game? Well, for one, I still enjoyed the game a lot regardless of any issues I had. ZTD had its awful moments for sure, quite a bit of them, especially if we keep comparing to its predecessors, but it also had its peak moments that were equal or surpassed those of the previous two as well. I thought the plot was becoming predictable in the halfway point of the game but once everything was revealed, I was genuinely shocked at many points.\n\nBut it wasn't only because of that, but also due to the fact that we even got this game in the first place. It still served as a conclusion to this ridiculous but also amazing trilogy, and I think it was still more than good enough to leave feeling satisfied rather than be a disgrace and better to not exist at all.\n\nEspecially knowing the context that ZTD was originally going to be cancelled, but was brought back to life from the fan support, you can't help but be grateful in the end that this game was allowed to exist, even if it ended up being a slight disappointment for fans of the other two games, as it's still a conclusion to the series that would've never existed in another timeline.\n\nLife is unfair sometimes, and not every game with ambition will get the funding it deserved, and I think if ZTD had a higher budget, even one that matched the budget of its predecessors, this game could've had so much potential. But the result that exists today still left me overall satisfied, and is proof that a good story can still standout despite a poor presentation. \n\nI definitely recommend the game, but remember that this is the third instalment.

Does it live up to it's hype? No. I still find it amazing. It just never reaches the heights of Virtue's Last Reward, and the setup. This game does it's best to tie up the first two games, and finish the trilogy, and it wasn't an easy task. In my opinion it managed to do it.\n\nOne of the controversial things about this game was its move to full 3D with everything being shown as cutscenes, similar to Walking Dead or something like that. The quality of the assets used is rather low, anytime the camera zooms to something you can see pixels on the textures blown up to giant sizes. The animations aren't of the highest quality as well, and characters mostly stand stiff. There are many cuts to hide animations they didn't manage to create... But it's still leagues better than Pokemon games, which don't even try to animate anything. I got used to the presentation within 15 minutes, and it didn't bother me most of the time. The new presentation, and having everything voiced, means there's also less story to be had than in the other 2 games.\n\nThe game also takes interesting approach to the storytelling. Instead of branching story like usual the player is presented with fragments, which might happen anytime in any of the branches. You might first select something that happens near the end, and only later learn what happened before. Somehow the game manages to be perfectly comprehensible despite this solution. That said this also means to a bit of each fragment starting the same. The characters wake, then they wonder if they were waken up before or if it's their first time. Since they don't keep the memories between fragments they also don't get much of character development until the very end.\n\nThe game also divides characters into 3 teams from the very beginning, and they are kept that way. So you won't have interactions between Junpei from team C and Sigma from team D, which could have been really cool. Members of each team are quite closely connected, even if it's not obvious at the start. And all teams are more connected than expected. You learn of it slowly as you progress trough the game. \n\nDespite initial open order to progress trough fragments you might get locked out from some progress by lock icons, which you unlock by exploring other fragments. You might stumble into a lock quite fast, and then it might take hours before you're able to unlock it, by the time you might not even remember what happened in the branch. Two flowcharts are there to assist you, so it's manageable. At one point I had pretty much everything unlocked in my branches and couldn't progress, so I had to go trough random dead ends just to unlock a lock for no apparent reason.\n\nThe game also stops your progress few times with passwords you need to know. You learn them in other fragments. Even if you're like me and played this game twice before, and know the passwords, you can't really break out of the expected progress. Even if you answer the password properly you'll get a lock icon until you explore proper fragments.\n\nEach fragment starts with just few minutes of talking, then it goes into escape room. All branches happen after you escape the room so you never have to repeat any room. This is quite good solution and improves the pace at which you can explore the game. The rooms themselves are much easier than VLR. There's only one difficulty, there's no alternate answer to any of the rooms. I only got stuck once, when I didn't see a box of matches on the ground.\n\nOut of the three teams the D-team is the best written and characterised. The endings you get with this team are the best, and most epic and heart wrenching. Sigma and Phi come from VLR, and their story is well continued here. The C-team has Junpei and Akane. The newcomer Carlos seems quite out of place in their team, and only in one of the endings you'll learn what his purpose was. Q-team is the strangest bunch.\n\nThe game reuses a lot of VLR music, and that means the music is great. The sound effects are still pleasure to listen to.\n\nMany fans were disappointed with the twist, and the ending, and felt the game did a middle finger to VLR. I think the game managed to tie up VLR quite properly. The final structure that is built makes perfect sense. The villain motives, which are many and complicated, also are satisfying once you start thinking about that. Near the end [spoiler]the game decides SHIFTing is akin to murder and tries to make it into some kind of moral dilemma. Even though trough whole VLR the player removes tons of Sigmas and Phis dead all over the complex, then trough half of VLR we shift a lot. Suddenly 5 minutes before the game ends it becomes \"a murder\" and we have to consider if we're ready to sacrifice other selves. This is what we were doing past 2 games, I felt completely no remorse or guilt, or any other special feelings related to the \"last decision\".[/spoiler]\n\nThis one is also the most brutal of all the games, with unsettling deaths happening everywhere. The characters don't kill each other so much, usually it's just the game killing them. The game explores some more real-and-fake physics, probability, mind parasites, the placement of soul, and many other things. It's built in into the script more naturally than in 999. The game also quickly reintroduces ideas from the previous two games as a reminder. In case 10 years passed since you played the other 2 games.\n\nOne thing the game fails at, is telling you there are additional epilogues available in your documents section after you beat the game. Without them the ending might feel incomplete, and the game doesn't inform you about them in any way. Once you finish the story you're thrown into flowchart, from which you can't even access the documents section. \n\nAll in all, a very bold and strong entry in the franchise. In my opinion it's better than Steam version of 999 and worse than DS version of 999.

The game's also really ugly, has wonky animations, and is a bit of a mess early on.\n\nBefore I begin, if it isn't obvious, if you've not played 999 and VLR, do not touch this game with a ten foot pole as it is not for you.\n\nThe best way I can summarize this game in a single sentence is that it will make you miss the last two games dearly, and this is coming from someone that did not like VLR that much, mostly playing it because I wanted to laugh at crazy fake science. To begin with, as you can tell by the steam screenshots, ZTD is not exactly a pleasant looking game, which is admittedly, a huge problem in a game where when you're not solving puzzles, are just looking at cutscenes. I wish I could tell you the animations make up for this, but they're stiff as all hell. I absolutely understand that this game was on a tight budget, but if you're going to be on such a budget, at least use it more effectively or design your game so it can work around set budget. I wish I could say my audiovisual woes end there, but so much of this game's music is just reusing old tracks, which while fine, gets a little too tiring as this game sorta lacks in original tracks outside of a few gems and the escape room tracks.\n\nNow that I'm done saying how this game's an audiovisual mess in 20 different ways, lets talk about the characters, which are, well, interesting. Junpei and Akane have some pretty stark shifts in character, particularly Junpei who goes from incredibly likable in 999 to an edgelord who thinks it'd be kinda funny if a bunch of people died. Akane, is more in line with her original self, including the crazy parts, but she's just... much less fun in this game; rather than going through all the small little ways she's done wrong, all I'll say is that she does not utter the nickname \"Jumpy\" a single time in this game. As for the other returning characters Sigma and Phi, they're handled well enough in this game, but I didn't particularly love them in VLR so that's more just a pleasant note than anything. As for the new characters, they're all generally... fine, some even having a few great moments here and there, though they can be annoying from time to time.\n\nNow for the writing; this game's 1st third is a bit of a mess, since you spend it doing a bunch of puzzles and seeing a bunch of out of context scenes. For what was decidedly the worse, the game takes a very non linear approach to story telling, and it really drags things down as you're just doing puzzles, getting a little bit of generally inconsequential decision making here and there, and going back in again. The game's next third is actually kinda good and made me wonder if it was better than VLR, as it centered on the characters abusing the fake science mechanics of the universe, and had some of the better character moments too, now as for the last third... when the game reaches its big Uchikoshi twist, it torpedoes down, down, down, so hard that I went from having a positive opinion of this mess to just outright hating this game. It's a mystery that breaks the rules of mysteries and was presented in an incredibly unfair fashion, and ultimately came off as an \"Ahaha, look at this twist, I'm smart!\" then something actually clever. It also undermines the entire game because if this mystery was presented in a fashion that was remotely fair, you'd figure out who the big baddy is immediately, completely undermining whatever merits the rest of the game had for me.\n\nIf you're here because you're dying to know what happens after VLR, you're better off making it up or imagining it.

The story is quite different when you compared to the previous games. It is a puzzle itself. Instead of following your typical beginning, middle and end, formula, the story is told from the point of view of three different groups. Moreover, you do not know what point of the story you are playing. For instance, at certain points, you get to know that a characters is dead, but you do not know why that happened. To make it simple, the story is told from three different perspectives, three teams, and at the same time, it is broken down since you play different points of those perspectives of each team. You do not play the perspective of each team from beginning to end. You play a part of the story. \n\n\nSurely, they did it on purpose, but so far nearly 8 hours and I kind of hate.

Where to even start?\n\nThe plot and stories are bad. One of the biggest issues with the story is that scenes don't progress in a straight narrative like they did in the prior two games. In this one, you might be in timeline 1 scene 3, then do timeline 2 scene 2, then do timeline 3 scene 4. You never have any real clue what's going on for the current scene you're in or what led up to it.\n\nI got stuck at multiple points trying to figure out what I needed to do to continue on (and so have many other people). The game very poorly illustrates what scenes you've truly completed and hides a few of them from the flowchart. Probably the two worst scenes to complete are the dice roll and gun. One scene has you rolling dice, needing to get three 1s (1 in 216 chance) or you die. It's pretty safe to assume the game isn't going to make you roll the dice 216 times or more, so you make the safe assumption that something will occur in a different timeline to let you succeed. Another scene states you have a 50/50 shot of shooting someone. I shot the person, replayed the scene 2 more times, shooting them again each time. So I figured you probably needed to do something else in the story to continue down that path. Turns out the dice one you need to play 3 total times and you'll always succeed on the third try. There is nothing to indicate this will happen. Turns out the gun is actually a 50/50 chance. I had to do that scene 10 times before I finally got the blank. So I was one of the 1/1024 who had to do that. I feel bad for the poor luck folk out there that had to replay that scene 15-20 times to get the other outcome.\n\nThe characters are all poorly written, especially Eric. The 9 characters get permanently split up into three teams of three people. Four of the characters are from the previous games: Junpei, Akane, Sigma, and Phi. Junpei and Akane are unrecognizable and act nothing like they previously did. When it comes down to you making decisions in scenes, characters in each group act pretty much the exact same way. You make the decision as character A, character B will always want you to kill/screw over everyone else, character C will always want you to not kill/screw over everyone else. Junpei and Sigma are homicidal maniacs in this game.\n\nThe escape segments are fine for the most part, though they greatly overuse the 'place the puzzle pieces into their proper spots' puzzles.\n\nI'm one of those people who don't care about graphics in games. This is one of the few games I've played where I can actually say that the graphics/animations hurt the quality of the game. The 3D aspect of Virtue's Last Reward was a bit jarring at first, but you got used to it after a bit. You'll never get used to how awful the graphics and animations look in this. \n\nCharacters faces and expressions look particularly bad. There was one scene where they kept showing a closeup of Eric's face, and his expression made me keep bursting into laughter. Other characters aren't quite as bad as Eric, but they're pretty bad. This kills the tone of scenes when you can't take what's happening seriously due to the stupid expressions.\n\nEven the makers of this know how bad the animations are. Every cutscene involving a character being injured has the camera point up at nothing as it's happening, then cutting back to the aftermath. I assume this was because they originally had animations for these things, saw how ridiculously bad they looked, and decided to fix it by having the camera point at the ceiling/wall. One of my favorite animations that made me laugh is a scene which shows Junpei walking out of a room; He's doing big knees while he's walking out the door. It's absurd watching his knees going up to his waist as he's walking.\n\nZero Escape: ZTD is a giant leap back in pretty much every way from the previous two games. It's as though they simply didn't care about this and pushed it out the door rushed and unfinished. The plot, stories, and dialogue are bad. The characters, graphics, and animations are horrible. The only semi-decent part of this are the puzzles. You're going to play this just to finish the series. You really shouldn't. Stop NOW! DO NOT GET THIS!

VLR at least had you follow a logical path based on choices. This just throws random pictures up on a dart board for you to go at.

Some returning characters feel like completely different persons though, so might as well consider them new ones. You know the one.\n\nThe \"decision game\" is less of a game than the AB game was.

first two games instead of focusing on the brain melting plot points along with the fact that this game tries to clear up a lot of mysteries that were presented in the first two which I think does this game favours in the story department and in my opinion makes it head and shoulders above the rest in the franchise, sadly the same can not be said about the escape rooms and characters.\n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n\nThe characters are not nearly as fleshed out or likeable as the first two games,Sigma and Phi are still lovable and make D team easily my favourite team to play Carlos and Diana are nice ,if not slightly boring, additions to the game but both grew on me very quickly and Q is alright if not a little annoying at times but the main issues I have with the characters in this game are the drastic change in akane and junpei's personalities which put me off of playing their section of the game (however it is excusable because there are in lore reasons for these changes) but by far the most infuriating characters ever put in this game series, Mira and Eric makes Q team horrible to play due to how unbearable they both are.\n\n[b]Escape rooms / Gameplay[/b]\nThe escape rooms are easily the weakest part of this game and they lose a lot of the complexity and intrigue when compared to 999 and VLR becoming seemingly an afterthought that was put into the game in the last section of development.\n\n[b]Overall [/b] \nEven though I have complained quite a bit in the review this game is still fantastic due to the story and worldbuilding that is included in it, as said before in my opinion the Story is great, probably the best in the franchise and although Q team and the escape rooms do pull the overall experience down a bit I would say if you are a fan of the zero escape series or visual novel games in general this game is an underrated gem and you would be doing yourself a favour buying the Nonary games collection (if you dont already have it) and this game!", "timestamp_created": 1663097792, "timestamp_updated": 1663097792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

But let's not kid ourselves. You're not playing this game in a vacuum, for its merits alone. You're playing this game because it's the third game in the Zero Escape series and you want to know what happens. Maybe you want some more escape rooms. Well, at those things, ZTD does an okay job.\n\nIf VLR ended a little more conclusively, I'd consider ending there. But it doesn't. ZTD should probably have been part of VLR. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate this game, but there were very few moments where I was not forced to confront the fact that ZTD is a pure step down from the previous two.\n\nIn classic Zero Escape fashion, the art style has changed, so the returning characters look totally different. And you know what? I really like the look of the character models... until they start moving. Then they look like awkward robots. Chunsoft decided to animate all the scenes like a Telltale game rather than using the classic visual novel look of displaying a reaction pose like the previous two games. I'm not a fan of this approach. The art style and direction works, and I have no problem with it, but the animation doesn't just look wonky: it takes so much longer to watch because you can't progress the text whenever you want.\n\nThe characters took a step down overall, which is a bummer because the previous two have such charming characters with great development. Some of the returning characters have different personalities for weak reasons, and some of the new characters are just plain unpleasant, lacking any kind of real character development. The way the game is structured, I often found myself avoiding certain options because I just didn't care about the participating characters. Voice work is good though, no complaints there.\n\nStory-wise, I wasn't nearly as enthralled. There's a decent progression between the three games, and I generally like how the world changes and escalates, but the writing and presentation don't have quite the same charm this time. Some plotlines are kind of shoehorned in, and some of the mysteries just feel cheap. It's upsetting when a big mystery is uncovered and you go back to think about all the hints scattered around, but you still walk away thinking about how unconvincing and uncompelling it is. Where previous Zero Escape games were sometimes a little too convenient, ZTD inspires eye rolls. Often I found myself laughing [i]at[/i], not [i]with[/i], the dialogue, or saying \"OKAY. SURE.\" out loud to my monitor. And that's not to even touch on the fundamental structure of the story, and how you experience it. I won't spoil it, but navigating the narrative is super clunky. They're clearly going for something, and I can respect that, but I can also hate it. The way they structured the narrative pieces doesn't feel good, and makes me care a lot less about what's happening in any individual moment. It takes way too long for the story to get to a place where I'm experiencing content I have reason to care about at a good rate. And at that point I was focused on how I wasn't super thrilled with how the mystery was being solved.\n\nI can't believe I didn't think about the puzzle rooms earlier. They are way worse, and reflect an overall change in the game's design: ZTD is less about \"solving\" and more about \"finding\". Story-wise, there were times where I completed all available plotlines, and had no indication from the UI what I needed to do to progress. I'd just click around the flow chart guessing, hoping that re-watching something I've already seen unlocks something new (surprise, it does! Is it a bug? Who knows). There are some pretty good puzzle rooms, but ZTD also features the most unpleasant puzzle rooms of the whole series. I have no idea how they managed to have both of these problems, but for some rooms I had 0 clues for any puzzles, and had to move on to clicking on things that don't even look interactable so I could finally get started, and for others I kept finding clues for braindead \"puzzles\" I already solved a long time ago. Like I said, more about finding than solving. They just don't feel as well tested as the first two games. ZTD has also decided that it would be fun to make their puzzles more annoying. Here's a puzzle where the trick is you have to remember to press a button every few seconds. Here's a puzzle you need a pen and paper to solve, have fun using the in-game etch-a-sketch with limited ink. There are a lot of puzzles that take you out of the game, and even more that seem to intentionally make things annoying for you. In VLR you'd have a flashback and can really easily look up where the answer is, but in ZTD it's structured to be a total pain in the butt to look anything up, which is awful for a game featuring a disproportionate amount of \"insert the exact right numbers/letters that you hopefully wrote down earlier\" moments. Gross. More than once, a mystery was so in-your-face obvious that I was scared of solving it correctly because the characters had no good reason to know that information. It's just not great.\n\nSo yeah. You're playing this because the first two games established characters and a world you care about.

Baffled. Discombobulated.\n\nI'm writing this review not because it can be relevant at this point, but because I am so utterly shocked after playing it that I need to vent, somehow. Even if it is to a void, in the reviews page for a game released six freakin years ago. That is how appalled I am.\n\nYou need to understand, I was ready to let it go. I swear. Not the first shock turd I've experienced in my gaming life, and it won't be the last. And I usually move along and forget about it. But then, these unskippable, masturbatory credits  with this dramatic music started, like the game is taking the piss one last time and wasting just a little bit more of my time, and I couldn't just take it while it happens. I needed some feeling of retribution, some sense of recovering the cosmic order of things. So, where do we start...\n\nFirst of all... This is, without a doubt, the biggest regression in quality in a direct sequel that I have ever seen. All accross the board, almost every element is worse than it was in Virtue's Last Reward. Visual quality? Yes, worse. Expressions and animations? Yup. Music? Of course. Structure and pacing? Absolutely. Story? Ooooh pal, you don't even KNOW.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves here, because I can already hear you, hypothetical, non-existent reader, going \"Wait, how can it be worse visually than Virtue's Last Reward? ZTD was released four years later! Surely it should look better, being four years more modern.\" \nWell I'm glad you (didn't) ask, because it is very easy to explain... You know the clunky 3D style that they used in VLR? Well, they [i] doubled down on it. [/i] Yes, they doubled down on the worst change they made from the first game of the series to the second. And they made it [i] much worse [/i].\n\nYou see, in VLR, they went almost-full 3D in what was an ill-advised decision, but they still somewhat salvaged the visuals and made them work, because they didn't go crazy trying to do a lot with them. They still had a talking head style, with only a few dedicated expressions and poses for each character, and not much more. So they could still make each of them look kinda decent.\n\nBut in ZTD? Well, it is very appropriate that this game deals with memory loss, because apparently, someone forgot they were working on a visual novel, and decided to go all cInEmAtIc, with full 3D real time cutscenes for everything! And they also forgot, they lacked the time, talent or budget to make it look decent! And you know what happens when you try to do a serious, narrative heavy game without  the time, talent and budget to have decent faces, facial animations, and animation in general? It ends up looking unintentionally creepy, awkward and hilarious. The conclusion to the epic narrative uber dramatic saga, and this fucker is walking around with a derpy semi-grimace that is a smile but isn't during a pivotal moment. Fantastic.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nBut ok, ok. You say to yourself, dammit, the characters look like warped up dolls in a microwave. And I didn't recognize some of the characters of the previous games until they said their name. And it sure looked awkward when this character went to interact with another and they cut to a view of the ceiling because they couldn't make the animation in between. But... but, the writing will save it, the story will save it. Let's get on with it-\n\nThat's when you realize, you press the skip dialogue for the next line. And it doesn't skip.\n\nThe character goes on, slowly reciting their lines (in japanese, because of course you have switched from the extremely awkward english voiceover by this point). You already read the line in half a second, and have spent the next 5 looking for the skip button, slowly coming to the panicked realization that... no... none of them work... surely they didn't... surely they weren't [i] that [/i] stupid...\n\nAnd, suddenly, it hits you, like a [i]  truck [/i]. Due to the new cinematic style, skipping unread lines halfway through is not a thing anymore.\n\nIt sounds like a super specific and super small issue, but, if you have played games of this type before, you know how devastating that can be to the pacing and flow of the game. Especially considering that in this game you have several different scenes that convey similar (or even identical) information to one another, and you are sitting there going \"I already fucking know this pleeeaaaaaaase\". \n\nYour only hope is enabling the option that you weren't supposed to use in the previous games, universal skip mode. But this comes with its own sets of issues: \nFirst, lines are tied to small animations. So a character will start slowwwly walking towards one another, you will be like, come on, let's move it along, skip to the end of the walk (because again, bad animation) and suddenly, bam, they are in the middle of a conversation. Because [i] the line was tied to the end stretch of the walk animation. You were supposed to wait for them to walk for two seconds for the line to appear. [/i] Because it's [i] cinematic. [/i]  So, to the log you go! The game has slayed the evil monsters of pacing and momentum once again!\nSecond, because the function is meant to be held to skip large amounts of lines, if you press it half a second too long, BAM, you have now skipped two lines. So, to the log you go!\nAnd third, the implication that, if the hold skip can be a thing, [i] why can't there be a single press skip for individual lines.[/i] You know, like in the previous games of [i] the same series?[/i] The ones that were [i] actually good?[/i]\n\nFuck, you rarely see a game so damaged by a decision such as this game going for that cutscene style. Jesus.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nAnyway, you have endured the ordeal that is the delivery of the story, and what do you get? Two of the fucking most bullshit twist/reveals in the history of media. I couldn't! I couldn't! I thought I missed something! I had to go online to confirm that I didn't miss something and it was that utterly stupid! I started maniacally laughing, imagining the several meetings and discussions and several writing sessions during which everybody must've been \"duuuude this reveal will be sooo good holy shiiiiit\" and having lost all hope for the future of humanity as a rational species.\n\nThe game hinges on a Shyamalan-level asspull. No, not even that, a [i] Heavy Rain [/i] - tier asspull. It is an achievement! It should be in a museum! The asking price is too low for experiencing the level of dumbfoundedness that you will get from the end stretch. But please record yourself with a camera for posterity. Otherwise, nobody will ever believe that time that you yelled \"Fuck you game you wasted my time fuck you that is cheating basic logic and everything I have seen with my own two eyes throughout the game that is fucking bullshit how did you dare to even pull this\".\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nAnyway the credits have ended, I had more to say but you know what fuck it, this doesn't get one more second of my time.\n\nDecent game, would maybe recommend.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1657310903, "timestamp_updated": 1657310903, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599551975727081299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118431745": {"recommendationid": "118431745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110020613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1188, "last_played": 1657575160}, "language": "english", "review": "There are two reviews I could write: a review for the game, and a review for the conclusion of the Zero Escape series.

This game does not live up to the promise of VLR and has far too many loose ends and problems to be \"good\". But there's really nothing else quite like this series that aims so high and is definitely a unique experience in its own right.\n\nUnfortunately, there are so many problems that aren't just the story. To get it out of the way, the story just doesn't form a cohesive narrative and just isn't as insane as VLR got to ignore those problems. It doesn't tie up most of the loose ends from VLR and adds new holes that are fairly egregious. While a lot of people say this devolves into nonsense, I'd say this doesn't go nearly as hard into the crazy as VLR did and that brings the game down a lot for me. It's far too serious in my opinion. In terms of pure gameplay, the UI is outright bad and the game just looks terrible. So many weird gameplay choices that I just cannot condone. The timeline is a massive pain to navigate and you have to resort to hunting for the next section, made more difficult by how unintuitively it is organised. The memo and file system is really irritating to navigate and a lot of the time you need to have both open and the game just doesn't let you. The memo system has added a new \"ink\" system that keeps going down the more you write on screen which was already useless and limiting but for SOME REASON, ERASING MAKES THE METER GO DOWN TOO. There's also some abject garbage with certain choice paths where you need to type in something instead of being given a MCQ, but sometimes the text to unlock some paths is not communicated at all which completely halts your progress because you don't know what you're supposed to be doing. The puzzle rooms are all of middling quality and maybe 3/13 rooms were actually interesting enough. It just devolves into either a \"click everything\" fest or a linear \"follow the instructions\" snooze.\n\nThe game also just looks terrible. They went for a fully 3D modelled aesthetic but the textures are really horrible and ugly. The PS4 version has a much better lighting system that adds dynamic shadows that fixed a lot of glaring problems with the art style but that's completely missing from this version. The music, while great, is largely simply tracks from VLR and I didn't recognise any new tracks.\n\nAll the good in the story and the sheer ambition does not outweight the facts that the game looks bad, plays bad and ends bad. If you're a VLR fan, you're probably invested enough that you'll play it anyway.

The ending was good, although nothing that got me emotional - I wasn't super impressed like I was with 999 but to be fair it's very difficult to top that. A good majority of my questions were answered and the post-payoff files after completing the game were a nice touch. Junpei and Carlos were easily my favourites in ZTD although I wasn't really expecting to care about Carlos at all when I first started playing. But Eric, oh man, the whole game I felt like screaming at my monitor telling him to shut up despite being voiced by Keith Silverstein the legend himself.

The non-linear storytelling makes the first parts an exercise in frustration - you make a lot of decisions that don't seem to matter and don't connect to anything else that happens. And it is really, really gory, which combined with the frustrating decision making, means it feels like a lot of the time you're making the correct decisions and watching the characters die horribly anyway.\nIt's fun to see characters from the first two games appear, but I don't love some of the characterization. It kind of works to see that Junpei was genuinely messed up by the events of the first game (because oh my god), but it doesn't make him fun company. And Akane's uwu moe act wears very thin very fast when you know how ruthless she can be ([spoiler] Ma'am, you revenge exploded a man to death, you don't get to play moral high ground [/spoiler]).\nSo why am I recommending it? The escape rooms are still really fun and I ended up quite liking all three protagonists. Plus, one you see start to see how all the elements come together, the story does get more engaging.

Spoiling the plot ruins the entire experience just like the previous two games.\n\nSpike chunsoft does it again. When I completed 999 I did not expect VLR to be superior. When I completed VLR I did not expect ZTD to be better and yet here we are. This series (especially with the events of this game) has single handedly taken my heart and made this series jump to my favorite story of time. This story has it all from suspense to curiosity, to even love and friendship that exist and go deeper [spoiler]than one reality[/spoiler] The cast that is spread throughout all three games feel like family. They feel real and some of them will always hold a place in my heart.\n           ZTD in a way is a big love letter to the fans with the way the\" true ending\" is handled. It is extremely bittersweet though with the way [spoiler] Shifting works and how each timeline still actually does exist so only the one group gets to walk away unscathed and not dead but at least they can work towards a brighter future where Sigma and Akane do not host the A/B game that occurs in VLR and Phi gets to not only learn about her true parents but they are both alive and well and they can all be a family together even with delta involved should they choose so[/spoiler]\n           Graphically it is the best in the series of course being the one title that isn a handheld port. The artstyle is interesting as characters like Akane and Junpei are difficult to recognize but then others like Sigma and Phi look even better than their previous models. The puzzles get even more difficult and the gameplay is extremely disorientating but that is by design of course the memories are supposed to be non linear. I also give them massive props for [spoiler] handling the entire overarching story without serious plot holes. Everything is designed to be a loop in terms of the story of Sigma and Phi and even Akane and Junpei. They even foreshadowed the events of the true ending in the ending of VLR with how a character told Sigma inside of Kyle's body that the events of VLR do work it just happens in a different timeline and that they cannot tell Sigma how and why because it would break the cycle and then that reality would cease to exist.[/spoiler]\n          On top of that this game explores and reveals the connection between Sigma and Phi and we finally learn the truth between them [spoiler] Which is that Sigma and Diana (yes the Diana that Sigma lived with for 3 years in the original timeline and would eventually model Luna after) in another reality during the events of ZTD would be trapped after Akane wins and for basically almost a year were together alone and would develop feelings for each other and lead to the birth of a pair of twins. One of the twins being Phi the other being Delta ( Zero in ZTD and also Q). They would end up getting sent to the past as unfortunately they have ran out of food and basically starved to death. Delta would grow up and then proceed to ensure him and his sister would be born with their specific powers by becoming zero and causing the events of ZTD to not only have that happen but to produce a reality where everyone lives with the knowledge of ZTD so that they have the fuel to prevent the messed up future we see in VLR[/spoiler] \n      At first I was angry at Zero because why would you do these things especially to [spoiler] Your mother , father and sister. But had he not then Phi nor him would exist and the bittersweet true ending future would not come to fruition[/spoiler] And so my anger left my mind and was filled with much sadness as it was a necessary evil. Would you not do the same so that you too [spoiler] Could even exist ? or even produce a future with a fighting chance. Theres even a possibility of you now living with your family that could never be. I only wished zero had a system in place or something that would give food to that reality of sigma and diana where they had kids so after they used the machines they would not starve or let them leave at the least[/spoiler]\n      This game does one important thing as well. I thought this series was the story of Junpei and Akane but no. This is the story of Sigma Klim and his never ending struggle to save the world. I do not expect a game to ever touch me again like this one did and frankly im okay with that. This is a beautiful and tragic story that deserves to be known and its criminal that its not as well known I can only hope one day it gets its reconition perhaps through films or shows so that it can become mainstream but I do really feel this story can humble many people it has no doubt changed the way I view things and for the better. i implore any real gamer to play this series especially if you are a fan of visual novels, puzzles or loved something like danganronpa. \n       \n", "timestamp_created": 1652465628, "timestamp_updated": 1652465628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115400106": {"recommendationid": "115400106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000752379", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1227, "last_played": 1652464755}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Peak Uchikoshi y peak Zero Escape, recomendad\u00edsimo si disfrutaste los Nonary Games.", "timestamp_created": 1652465029, "timestamp_updated": 1652465029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115363681": {"recommendationid": "115363681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127591041", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1185, "last_played": 1603154473}, "language": "english", "review": "Shit Doesnt Make Any Sense and the Character Act like Fucking Idiots", "timestamp_created": 1652394021, "timestamp_updated": 1652394021, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502611279487609863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115356288": {"recommendationid": "115356288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021039068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1652381396}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really bad.

The player also has a sense of whiplash and complete bewilderment that compliments the story well (and the characters' position within it).\n\nWhere this game really falls down is the production value. There was a clear step down in budget between Virtue's Last Reward, resulting in stilted character animations and not a lot of new music, but I don't think that this gets in the way of the story and engaging with the characters nearly as much as people make out.\n\nIn terms of the story and characters, it's a mixed bag. Some of the new additions are great (Carlos, Q, Diana) and those returning from past titles are just as good as you remember them (Phi, Sigma, Junpei, Akane). That being said, Mira and Eric are both some of the worst characters I've ever seen in a visual novel/adventure game.\n\nZero's plan in this final installment is also a little... underwhelming.

If you are a creator you should find lots of inspiration to create fan material. The bad animations still bother me like A LOT. Especially when it gets serious and dramatic I literally have to look away. While the voice actors do their best to convey the emotions the animations completely ruin it. I saw the credits a few times by now and if I am not mistaken there were a few people working on it but I still refuse to believe that.\n\nWhy am I now \"recommending\" it? \n1)\t [b] [i] \u03a3   b o o b a s [/i] [/b]\n2)\tCause the story gets explained and you finally know everything. I love the character arts and designs (except for a few choices in design for some... LOOKING AT YOU Junpei, Akane and Sigma). With the first two their wrong hair and eye color STILL bother me so much. In Sigma's case they just replaced him with his brother or something. No way this Sigma and the one from VLR looks similar in ANY way besides their height and buffer body and I fully agreed with Diana when she said [i] \"You have a strong chest\" [/i] ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) I see you ma gurl. Furthermore, some older characters have been butchered some lore-wise. \n\n[u] [b]Examples:[/b] [/u]\na) [b] Junpei [/b]: [spoiler] In his young years is a kind and good person. In this game we get to learn that this has changed a lot in a span of a year and how. The traumatic experiences he had in a year were a bit too over the top and made it sound too surreal. A little bit too cringe like those \"this is deep and i am 14\" posts. It hurts since I love him a lot. For some reason he now also says\u2026 [i] interesting [/i] things that no one wanted to hear\u2026 [/spoiler] \n\nb) [b] Akane: [/b] [spoiler] While she is a rather intelligent person that leads a WHOLE organization, you're going to tell me that she is still as naive and \"simple thinking\" as she was as a kid? Best example: Blaming Junpei's death INSTANTLY on Carlos instead of thinking rationally and think about other possabilities like what could have happened if they had already wakened up before? Nah screw your super brain power GO INSANE INSTEAD. Try to kill someone else and then blame yourself if they kill themselves to protect you even though you tried to kill them first. [/spoiler]\n\nAm still confused about Sigma\u2019s [i] consciousness [/i]. [spoiler] It is old (keep that in mind) and while I am happy that this absolute alpha chad kept his [strike] perverted [/strike] humor it still feel as bit\u2026 off at times [i] \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s big. Take your shirt off Diana.\u201d [/i] Yes it\u2019s exactly what you think it is about and I get your point Sigma but [b] [i] w  h y [/i] [/b] . Next thing is that I feel so bad for him. Wasn\u2019t his old self single for his whole life? It feels as bit weird since him and Diana have some chemistry going on and she is in her 20s or 20 while he is [i] 67 [/i]. Not sure it would be the same with his original body so Fs in the chat my boys. But that just as a small thing I had in mind. [/spoiler]\n\nBefore you comment: Yes, I did have nothing better to do then write his book of a recommendation and yes, it was fun.\n\n\n\n[h1]OLD REVIEW:[/h1] I have not played the game for too long yet (40 min) but I lowkey regret asking my friend to get this for me instead of the Steam ports of the first two games, which I had already played before (love them! Two of the best games I played with such simple functions!). The credits said that multiple people worked on the animation. Tell my why some models look like the most basic standard library models? Why are the colors + designs of some known faces so terribly.. off. I am not a professional by any means but I have worked with SFM before and I think that my bad noob animations looked better. There is no shading no nothing? As if they forgot to tick on the option for shading, rendered and then just used it that way. [b]H o w   can this happen to a  c o m p a n y ???[b]\n\nIt hurts my eyes I am so sorry for the people who worked on it. When I saw the menu for the first time I already thought \"Oh, oh. Why does it feel and look so cheap?\". The characters seems so... flat... And some voiced parts are a bit awkward. Now combine that with the super awkward animations and your bones will invert from the eternal pain. Wished they kept it in the Virtue's Last Reward style. Would have at least made the graphics more appealing. For the 40 minutes I played so far I kept asking myself \"Where is the skip button? When can I finally save and quit?\".\n\nNow the premise of switching to the different characters is a very cool idea but I feel as if this part is a slap to all the players who loved the first two games. The cover art looked so promising and dark just like the intro clip where they show some credits. But don't let yourself be deceived since they are nothing but real big & disgusting bait in my opinion. \n\n[b]It physically hurts me. Make it stop![b]\n\nPS. I recently finished the second game so I had some expectations for the third one... I'll edit this thing once I finish the game (if I will...).\n", "timestamp_created": 1649023990, "timestamp_updated": 1659908856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402261257171630859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113262694": {"recommendationid": "113262694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426629180", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1648969378}, "language": "english", "review": "Has man tits and lady tits it and if you aren't into either there's a cute doggo", "timestamp_created": 1648969653, "timestamp_updated": 1648969653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670267045497894287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113190814": {"recommendationid": "113190814", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989717647", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1205, "last_played": 1648855428}, "language": "english", "review": "Life is simply unfair, don't you think?", "timestamp_created": 1648858655, "timestamp_updated": 1648858655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558605551719665527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113188930": {"recommendationid": "113188930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986569114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 320, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 589, "last_played": 1662150754}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todos odiamos al clown del grupo", "timestamp_created": 1648855260, "timestamp_updated": 1648855260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113049138": {"recommendationid": "113049138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106403178", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1283, "last_played": 1648427302}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun story to play with friends, some of the puzzles are infuriating but like 95% of them are doable without hints.", "timestamp_created": 1648606425, "timestamp_updated": 1648606425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112777707": {"recommendationid": "112777707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053865210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 612, "last_played": 1515220134}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute dog water", "timestamp_created": 1648173929, "timestamp_updated": 1648173929, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425066202878952026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112672494": {"recommendationid": "112672494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064530381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1295, "last_played": 1647999362}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun premise, but the end is a slog.

This game sucks eggs, its a big wet shit stuck together with sawdust and glue. All the new characters aren't interesting at all and The returning characters are whatever or they ruin old characters. The puzzles I think are the only redeeming quality about the game and EVEN THEN the puzzles range from good to really annoying or boring.\n\nFor some reason they thought it would be a good idea to 'animate' every scene that would, in previous games, be visual novel reading segments with 3D models or portraits. The animation looks terrible and you can sort of tune it out after a few hours but I just have no idea why they thought it would be a good idea to do that instead of making all the player models have 10 polished poses and have reading sections. It wouldn't have changed anything other than making it look better.\n\nSpoilers for the game: They make Junpei some edgy boring bastard, its an absolute personality one eighty that he does, hes just not the same character at all. In the second game at least it was reasonable how different his character was because he had lived his *whole life* and was an old man, this game takes place like 1 year after the first one.

I 100% agree that it's a mix of incredible highs and dismal lows. Zero Time Dilemma does a lot of things right, but it also does a lot of things wrong. \n\nThe Good:\n-- Coherently concludes the previous two games\n-- Develops several reoccurring characters in very interesting ways (Junpei is now super nihilistic and this drastically affects his relationship with Akane in a way that I greatly enjoyed)\n-- Almost every new character is well written\n-- D-Team segments are phenomenal\n-- The main antagonist is well written and their complex motives add to the story\n--[spoiler]Fitting extension of the narrative of the previous games (999 had sending information to the past, VLR had sending personalities to the past, ZTD sends entire people to the past)[/spoiler]\n\n--Zero II's reveal is really well done.\n-- Diana is cool and awesome\n-- The escape rooms are very well designed and a lot of fun\n-- Decision games are very fun and there's lots of gore\n-- Good voice acting on some of the characters\n-- Has room for a sequel but feels relatively complete as a trilogy\n\nThe Bad:\n-- Some of the characters are unlikable. Eric sucks ass and there was only one scene where he was even remotely likable. Mira is a character that is really interesting and has a lot of room to explore her character but ends up being really stale and generic. \n-- Dio is not in this game\n-- There aren't many decision games that are that fun. I went in expecting SAW-esque death traps but a lot of the games were very basic and were just based around getting the right answer. A good portion were entirely scripted and felt like they didn't matter. You'd make a decision, and some unforeseen consequence emerges and gives you a game over. There's no real choice there.\n-- Much shorter than either of the Nonary Games. I think this boils down to the fact that this game is not a visual novel but instead uses cutscenes. This affects the game length as writers can put a lot more information and dialogue in text per minute of gameplay compared to voice dialogue. I don't hate the cutscenes, but I feel like it holds the narrative back. VLR had some very good descriptive writing (Sigma's description of death, for example) and the cutscene format makes it harder to pull of good descriptive writing without telling the audience out loud.\n--Uchikoshi promised that a lot of unanswered questions about VLR would be answered here. They were not.\n--The escape rooms are bunched up in the earlier bits of the story. It sucked being 70% through the game and getting an achievement saying that I beat all of the escape rooms.\nThe Ugly: \n--God damn is this game ugly. The original Resident Evil on the PS1 has better animations and atmosphere. \n\n\nOverall I'd say its a 8.5 out of ten. This game has some pretty huge flaws but when it shines it's almost ethereal. \n\nAlso,[spoiler]Zero II is literally Professor X.

Therefore, it is best you only read if you too have not played other Zero Escape games.\n\nI bought this game because the premise sounded much like the Saw films, of which I am a fan of.  I also like many films that are similar to those such as Cube, The Employer, Breathing Room and many more.  I played the first Saw game more than a decade ago and really enjoyed it.  The presence of a sinister-looking villain named Zero further enhanced my expectations that Zero Time Dilemma would be similar.  The way Zero introduces the games instantly reminds one of Jigsaw, and indeed it is strange that no one else seems to have made this comparison.\n\nThe beginning is very much along the lines of the Saw-like films I have mentioned.  But straight away, after a relatively short cut scene, the player has to make a choice.  To me, this felt like a twist on a formula I'm familiar with.  No problems so far.\n\nOnce past the intro segment, the format of this game is non-linear, however.  And the way that is implemented in the game is to divide the nine characters into three teams and then divide the individual \"games\" into segments.  Some of the \"segments\" at least can be played by each team.  This allows the player to manipulate the outcomes to see the differing branches of the story.  This has obviously been done because the game would need to be replayed lots of times in order to see all the paths and endings.\n\nUnfortunately, the game's design makes the experience of playing very convoluted and involving repetition.  Added to this, there are long, boring dialogue exchanges that seem to go on for about 15 minutes at a time, before we get to the actual \"game\" in that segment.  Imagine going through that three times for a single segment, once for each time, and you will soon get annoyed.  And all this dialogue all seems to hinge on the player understanding what the previous games in the series are about.  If, like me, ZTD is your first excursion into the series, the dialogue will seem like a load of incoherent nonsense.  The voice acting is monotone, making matters worse.\n\nThe \"escape room\" puzzles had the potential to be great, but are harmed by the lack of a hotspot reveal system of the kind you generally find in modern point-and-click adventure games.  It's easy to miss something if you are not clicking on everything in the room.  And that means it feels like a pixel hunt, which is tedious, and only serving to slow the pace of the game down further.\n\nBeyond the basic premise of people being trapped in an underground facility of some kind, and having to play a series of Saw-like games, I really cannot tell you anything else about the story.  I could not follow it.  And it bored me trying to do so.\n\nI'm sure that one day someone will make a game that is similar to the films I have mentioned and is implemented in a manner more akin to Saw: The Video Game, which is excellent.  That game, unlike this one, doesn't bore the player to death with endless dialogue.  Its plot is easy to follow.  The \"games\" are each very tense to play and keep the player on their toes.  I'm struggling to think of anything I disliked in that game, except the annoying circuit puzzle.\n\nUnfortunately, ZTD is not the game I thought it was.  Boredom, coupled with the convoluted gameplay, ruined what little enjoyment I got out of it.  I had Zero Escape: The Nonary Games on my wishlist for well over a year.

I find the content of this game to be a bit more dark and gory than the previous two, but I don't imagine many squeamish people got this far. I honestly think it'd be a shame not to play this title if you've played 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. It'd be shame to play this game first too. There are many components that would confuse new players to the series.\n\nGameplay wise, it is a little strange to have animated cut scenes instead of having the game be more visual novel style. I also found that the rooms were less challenging than VLT, but that also meant that I was stuck less. There was a lot less puzzles that relied on chance too, so that's definitely a plus.\n\nThe soundtrack is very similar to VLT, but I found it drew on my fond memories for the other game.\n\nIn terms of content, I found it to be a bit stigmatizing towards mental health, but a lot media doesn't shine the greatest of lights on that topic matter. I understand why those choices were made for the story, but I can't help but wish it went a different way. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend it. If you enjoyed VLT, you're in for a treat.", "timestamp_created": 1644774101, "timestamp_updated": 1644774101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109945202": {"recommendationid": "109945202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244278668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1210, "last_played": 1644479106}, "language": "english", "review": "Satisfying conclusion \nHowever I couldn't unlock 2 chapters from Q team, I had to look online to get the passwords to get to the ending", "timestamp_created": 1644527429, "timestamp_updated": 1644527429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513108611106872559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109762218": {"recommendationid": "109762218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185978625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1210, "last_played": 1644274869}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the third (and currently last) game in the Zero Escape series, so I would not recommend starting here if you have not played the first two. This game is meant as a continuation and conclusion to both games, so either play 9 Persons, 9 Hours, 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward, or the Nonary Games bundle on your own first before thinking of trying this one out.\n\n\nFor those already invested in Zero Escape, ZTD follows up on VLR's ending with a group of time travelers infiltrating a Mars simulation sight to stop the spread of an apocalyptic virus, and meeting faces old and new. That's what happened last week, anyway. Instead, we open in media res as the participants of the DCOM simulation wake up imprisoned by yet another Zero, who forces them to play the Decision Game in teams as they face escape rooms and Saw-esque choices to make it out of the bunker alive.\n\nZero Time Dilemma is heavily story-based, if you are only interested in the puzzles, ZTD is not for you. The game isn't a true visual novel either, instead it is presented like a movie or tv show, and over half of the game is cut-scenes. Several of the rooms are also more difficult than past games. The game's other gimmick is you can play scenes out of order, as the characters forget what's happened every ninety minutes, letting you jump all over the timeline piecing things together slowly.\n\nThis game was originally cancelled, and petitioned back into existence by the fanbase. As a result, its animations are pretty limited but this can be forgiven. If you enjoyed the first two, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.

If you have any of the following triggers you probably shouldn't play this game (being as vague as I can without spoiling it for people): [spoiler] suicide depictions/mentions (not surprising to anyone who played VLR), r*pe (there were a couple scenes where it was mentioned, and another where it was only \"attempted\" and not completed and intent was not there, but it was messed up that this was a plot point tbh and many other kinds of scenes could have replaced this one), child harm, animal harm (there were \"reasons\" for this but none mentioned in-game, which made it worse tbh), depictions/mentions of abuse of all kinds, among other things but I think I've covered most of the big ones here. [/spoiler]\n\nThis IS a horror/escape room game so expect death, kidnapping, and other things of the sort, obviously, but it is worth mentioning the above triggers and concerns for those of us with triggers who wish to avoid them. I felt that some of it was lazy writing, and could have been done differently; there is no reason to include some of these things, and with a bit of creativity they could have been avoided and it still could have been a fully fleshed out horror game. If you played VLR some of it comes as no surprise, though.\n\nAlso, I have a bit of an issue with the flirting with Phi in VLR now because that is pretty gross, all things considered; if you decide to play ZTD you'll understand why I say this. All of Sigma's pervy behavior towards characters in VLR is super icky anyway and I almost didn't play this game because of it. Just because it's a common trope doesn't mean it should be perpetuated. \n\nWith the social issues out of the way, now come the technical and gameplay critiques. I also noticed ZTD had almost but not quite as many graphics issues as VLR. VLR looked like an absolute rush job re: mouth movement and the like. This one is slightly better, but not by a whole lot. Still, there are quite a lot of glitches with Akane's hair where it moves around and twitches on its own at random during cutscenes even when they are paused when you go to the menu. My favorite game is 999 in the series because it manages to avoid most of the social issues while still being a great horror game. Would it be better if all of it was fully animated? Yes, but it also doesn't necessarily need it. The sequels being animated is cool, but they would be better if they were fully finished. These games don't look quite finished, which is a bummer when you're paying money for them.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's mostly fine. But, my ADHD brain struggled with the Team Select menu and trying to sort out what scenes to play in which order. If you intend on playing this game, definitely take advantage of the flowchart and use that as your guide for where to begin and where to go next. I think VLR and 999 did a better job in some ways with this and with the various endings being a bit more detailed and not just a quick \"game over\"/\"bad end\" sequence. I would have added a few more incentives than already offered for completing all the dead ends; maybe you find more info in them, and use it in the next jump. Makes it a lot more worth it for completionists, as this game took me several days to complete (real-life stuff included, because I like most people couldn't speed through this in a day or two). In addition, the memo screen having limited ink and erasing counting towards that ink used bar were a major and unnecessary annoyance.\n\nI was disappointed we didn't see Kyle in this one. I know his extra ending in VLR isn't canon, but it would have been nice to see him return.\n\nIf more games in this series are ever made I don't know that I'll be playing them. The social issues were enough to put me off of it, and I almost didn't finish this game because of them. I just wanted to know how the story ended. If you look past those, it is suspenseful and interesting. But the gameplay isn't as good as previous games imo aside from the extra camera angles when you rotate around in an escape room.", "timestamp_created": 1642499929, "timestamp_updated": 1642499929, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438977330923080444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108243084": {"recommendationid": "108243084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013617850", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1041, "last_played": 1642472970}, "language": "english", "review": "the best part about this game is that you can basically focus on finishing (almost) all of the escape room first and then concentrate on enjoying the story", "timestamp_created": 1642473050, "timestamp_updated": 1642473050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108133618": {"recommendationid": "108133618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025502946", "num_games_owned": 1264, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1550, "last_played": 1642336728}, "language": "english", "review": "Final part of the nonary games trilogy, which continues the story of the first two games.

However, I must add this entry has more fault than good which is unfortunate, as it is the finale of the Zero Escape trilogy, an amazing series. \n \nI would like to keep this review brief and spoiler free. Bare with me and let's begin. \n\nMentioned before, Zero Time Dilemma is the finale to a trilogy, the last game in it's series.  Honestly this is one of the very few reasons why I recommend it. It's the end and a good story needs an ending. \nSO, IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST ZERO ESCAPE GAME, STOP NOW! I BEG YOU!! Go and purchase it's previous duel package \"Zero Escape: The Nonary Games\". Trust me those games are fantastic, worth every penny and you'd hate to spoil yourself. \n\nOkay? Good. As for a real justification I'd check this entry out, is for it's flowchart. This may be debatable among players, but I personally found myself quite engaged in the scrambled and fractured timelines. By not knowing exactly where or when you are, the game is setting up mystery to both the player and characters. Also with the way ZTD's story is executed, having everything jumbled, going back place to place to place, this is very fitting. Ha ... and ... these are puzzle games, therefore I think it works rather well. . . . oh yeah . . . This was a puzzle game. Hmm\n\nInto some cons I guess. The puzzles within ZTD were a little too easy especially compared to its  predecessor, Virtues Last Reward, where admittedly I had to cheat at some point. Nothing stood remotely unique or challenging in any of the escape sequences. If you want to get through it quick, sure its great. I mean, the rooms were pretty cool but to me what came with them felt shallow just like some of new characters. I Don't want to get too into it for spoilers sake, but to be frank, I hated some of these new characters. They felt cliche, the writing was lazy and I wish there were more to them in the end. As for the re-occurring characters, they were fine and it was fun seeing them all again, they were definitely a pro.  \n\nThe game itself is boring to partake in but hey it plays more like a movie this time around  right? *Exhales* it looks hilarious. To be fair they were being ambitious for a small budget project, but I don't think they should have stepped away from the visual novel aspect. Events that occurred were cool and all, filled to the brim with violence and shock value, but gosh, it could have been better and...maybe even cheaper to have a wall of text thoroughly present us with detailed imagery and emotion. You can see what the creators wanted yet its a shame it almost fails.\n\nAnd last the story. My, my, did the game have its up and downs. Things felt so rushed and instant you'll find yourself just accepting things as they happen. \"Oh okay, they are dead now. Moving on.\" like that. However if you played VLR you know your end goal for ZTD and this game will tell you your answer. It was satisfying in it's later sections. When our characters finally start piecing together the best thing from this game, the puzzle of the flowchart, its kinda hype yet you need some patience. The first half's writing is mediocre at best, not as well woven as past games. Just let the ball get rolling to get to the good bits.\n\nZTD overall felt like a 6.5/10, an okaaay game.

Of the returning characters (C-team) seem a bit out of character and is given a cheap sounding explanation as to why, and as for the new (Q-team) well they are mostly just terrible and fairly boring people. The biggest problem(aside from a failure to wrap it all up) is the lack of focus in the narrative, in the previous games we were focused on one person and their perspective on events, here we jump around all over the place between 3 groups, and this along with the knockout gas just makes it all pretty difficult to follow.\n\nFor a game that was set to wrap up the franchise and tie up loose ends I will say it fails, since it doesn't wrap it all up into a nice bow and adds a few more loose ends of it's own.

The voice acting is alright as I've seen worse, the music ranges from good down to either repetitive or uninspired. The in-game animations are poor.\n\nAs for the game itself, progression often takes a while as you look at a flow chart trying to work out what you didn't do, despite the flow chart showing that you have done all you could. It's not very intuitive in showing what you haven't yet done. Some of the outcomes are based on RNG, so even doing it \"correctly\" isn't possible for multiple attempts, which does not help when factoring in how un-intuitive it is to know if something was done correctly or not. Headbutting the same thing for a different outcome is straight up stupid. There was also a point in time where an answer was two words separated by a space, however to input the answer you needed to omit the space. Further in, there is an answer that does require a space. I can only assume this was a localisation issue, but it's shoddy non-the-less. There are also heavy inconsistencies in the game, most made notable by how a grenade launcher worked at one point, and then in a subsequent story-line past its initial use. It was incredible nonsensical, and downright shoddy.\n\nAs for the plot, as spoiler free as I can make this, it's inconsequential due to the subject matter at hand. There is no threat. At some points character motivations and their subsequent actions just don't line up at all.\n\nThat being said, there were some genuine moments of greatness in the story too, though they were few.

Unlike the first two games, this game takes place from the perspective of multiple characters, specifically, it is divided into three teams of three: C Team, Q Team. and D Team. You go through portions of the story called \u201cTime Fragments\u201d to play each scene out and experience that portion of the story, and more fragments unlock as you clear more escape rooms and Decision Games. To be frank, though, for a game that prides itself on the choices the player makes throughout the journey, I honestly don't feel like the player's choices matter in this game all that much compared to the previous two, even if there is more variety in the Decision Games than \"Pick a door to go through\" or \"Select whether to Ally or Betray another player\". For what it\u2019s worth, the game still has a number of endearing scenes that will tug the player\u2019s emotions in all sorts of directions, particularly the endings, though that does not negate the issue of the plot feeling scattered at times. Since the game's story is ultimately split up into time fragments that are scarcely connected to each other, the decisions end up not mattering as much as before when the player 9 times out of 10 is just going to either replay each decision to get all of the outcomes (admittedly, also an issue in the previous installment, though it wasn\u2019t as bad there as it is here) or move on to the next time fragment and complete its puzzle. Because of this, I also don't feel like there is much of a sense of progression to the game until the player completes all of the escape rooms and gets to the game's endings. On top of that, the presentation is god awful. While the game admittedly looks fine on a handheld like the Nintendo 3DS or the PlayStation Vita, on more advanced software like a PC or the PlayStation 4, it really becomes apparent how poor the animations and graphics are. The backgrounds look fine regardless of the system you\u2019re playing on, but character models were clearly designed with the handheld releases in mind, and weren\u2019t properly upscaled as well as they could for the PC and console releases. Frankly, even compared to other 3DS titles released the same year (Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, Ace Attorney: Spirit of Justice), I still feel this game\u2019s animation quality is inexcusably horrendous. The music, on the other hand, is definitely better. A decent chunk of the music comprises remixes of songs from VLR, with a handful from 999, and though I prefer the original versions compared to ZTD\u2019s rearrangements, I still feel the returning songs are done well in this game. The new songs are also composed rather well, too, with the ending theme being one of my favorites. The escape rooms are also still as good as before, even if there are fewer than the last two times, some of the puzzles feel like the kind you find at a children\u2019s toy shop, and they have a tendency to end abruptly. Despite this, I still had plenty of fun solving the many puzzles the game throws at the player, and I never felt any of them had any especially cheap moments, nor did I need to use a walkthrough to solve any. Ultimately, while I do consider this game as arguably the weakest of the trilogy, I do still recommend playing it, both to enjoy it on its own merits and to wrap up the trilogy. Time will tell if we end up getting Zero Escape 4 or not, but until then, I'm still glad I got to play these three games.

I'm actually impressed by the amount of effort that was spent on writing every single detail of this ginormous pile of garbadge. Congratulations to everyone involved. \n\nThe disjointed narrative structure makes it impossible to care about anything. Characters will constantly reference things you haven't seen yet or specifically chose not to do. Imagine if someone told you to direct a movie. But you've never read the script before until they hand it to you one page at a time and completely out of order. There's basically no coherent story up until maybe the last 25% of the game.  At which point it all comes together on the premise that nothing mattered anyways, that there was never supposed to be any story in the first place. The arbitrary decision points and branches just boil down to a check list. Sometimes it even feels like you're playing a 90s Sierra game: \"Do you want to go left or right?\". \"Left\". \"An anvil drops on your head! Game over\".\nEven more ridiculous concepts like alien time machines are constantly introduced for the sole reason of clumsily tying the plots of the previous two games into this mess. And that's considering the fact that the entire series is already built on the shakiest foundation with its selective amnesia nonsense.\nThe big plot twist is so unbelievably bad, mismanaged and on top of that pointless, it eclipses the one from Virtue's Last Reward. That one was just as cheap but at least served a purpose. At the end there's still no tangible explanation why any these stupidly complex setups (particularly the escape room puzzles) and plans spanning hundreds of years were necassary or possible or why any of these specific people were even involved.\nBut the most vexing thing is that, realistically, nothing should even happen in this game. Because at least two characters have already figured out how all of this works and should never even run into any these weird situations. Yet for some reason they have to relearn everything over the course of the 20+ hour story.\n\nAnd all that's nothing to say about the rest of the game. The graphics, specifically the animations, are extremely rough. More often than not the camera pans away to convey all the action by sound alone. Lip syncing is also nowhere to be found. Although that wouldn't really save the horrible dialogue scenes either. The script is considerably trashier than a B-movie. Every single time someone dies it turns into an unintentional comedy, both because the scenes are usually completely ridiculous and out of left field and because the characters overact so hard.\n\nEven the puzzles are worse than the previous games'. In fact, to me personally Zero Time Dilemma feels more like a glorified hidden object game in many cases. More often than not the goal in any of the escape rooms is to spend 10 minutes spinning the camera around in a 3D environment trying to figure out which exact pixel the developers wanted you to click on to advance. \n\nThe soundtrack is still fine but mostly reused from previous entries.\n\nAll in all I don't recommend Zero Time Dilemma it to anyone, but especially not to those who liked the first or the first two games. The conclusion to this story is idiotic and full of gaping plot holes that are just impossible to ignore.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1638392181, "timestamp_updated": 1638392181, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543309211730957031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104647663": {"recommendationid": "104647663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071013226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1154, "last_played": 1613683306}, "language": "english", "review": "Snails suck.", "timestamp_created": 1638156280, "timestamp_updated": 1638156280, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104622761": {"recommendationid": "104622761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001574357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1638141347}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really hooked on the first 2 zero escape games (999 and VLR), and I couldn't put them down.

This does not make a  lot of sense to me, as some \"wrong\" choices literally feel pointless to do\n\n- Similarly, like in the previous game, although way worse, sometimes you just unlock some random \"!\" somewhere after doing something, and there is no where to find that out apart from checking every single available scene. They also are often not visible in the main decision tree view, which is strange\n\n- The fact that the player is not any character this time really confuses the experience from the beginning, as you have no idea what team is going to get unlock next and where, until later when you start seeing the connections eventually\n\n- [b]The puzzle rooms this time were really disappointing because:[/b]\n\n -  They often contained all kinds of uninteractable scenery objects which were not marked in any way, so as a player you'd think why can't I click this or do more with it\n\n -  As per previous games, there is no way to highlight what spots in a room are interactable, and this makes the experience really frustrating, as some larger objects are invisibly divided into smaller clickable parts. Sometimes this goes so far that I had to look some puzzles up, because I just was not clicking the correct pixel apparently.\n\n-   There were illogicalities with many of the puzzles, for example the puzzle where half of the room is dark and other half is lit. You cannot interact with things in the dark, EXCEPT one thing, for no reason.\n\n-    Overall movement in the puzzle rooms was feeling really slow and tedious, and the camera angles shifted really bothersomely: Sometimes I clicked just past the target and the camera zoomed so I can no longer see the target and have to zoom out first, Also, if clicking on one item and then it zooms in and there is another item visible in the zoomed view  which is not part of the same \"item block\" in the code, you cannot click it, despite it being visible!\n\n - Other kinds of issues with some items only being clickable at a certain perceived distance\n\n- Apart from puzzles, we had a way of writing notes, similar to before. This was good and necessary, but it contains a bug. There is a \"highly unnecessary\" count of how much one can draw on one notepad (does not relate to how full it is, only counts when a pen is being used). The main problem with this is that it also counts when you ERASE text, so writing two sentences worth of stuff, and then erasing them counts as writing 4 sentences worth of stuff. Also just moving the eraser back and forth without erasing anything counts as text limit increase.

In summary, while this game has a ton of problems, it will at least let you leave the series with a better taste in your mouth than VLR ever would if you decided to just stop there; I personally hated VLR, and while this doesn't change that, at least it closes the series out in a more acceptable manner. \n\nPersonally, I'm gonna keep this one simple. D-Team hard-carries this game, but there's a lot of great stuff there, so overall, it's worth it if you are already so deep into the series. And that's it. For every other positive point, I can say a negative one that detracts from the experience just as much as the positive adds.\n- The voice acting is absolutely great (A+, really!) / The animations are outright terrible (the models are better than VLR when in a still picture, but when moving, BOY it is actually a lot worse, not just in how it looks, but it's full of \"bugs\" where people will have their animations reset last second, dead people will blink, etc.)\n- C-Team has its good moments (Carlos is great!) / Q-Team is awful (Just... everything about them...)\n- The puzzles are fun / The story has an enormous amount of problems and holes\n- The OST is pretty good / There's a lot of scenes that go for pure shock value and felt ridiculously exaggerated and unnecessary quite often\nEtc.\nIt really is D-Team that, as I mentioned, makes this worth to play through, at least in my opinion. I truly loved and cared about them, and their parts of the story are pretty damn good. \n\nSo, overall, I personally would recommend playing 999 only. But if you play VLR as well (considering it's already bundled with 999 on Steam), then you should definitely play this one (ZTD) too and finish the series.

It fails to be a truly compelling conclusion to the Zero Escape trilogy, and it also fails to stand out in most other aspects. \n\nI believe there are a lot of fans of the Nonary Games who will hate this game simply for not being as good as those earlier entries, and I will give them exactly that. If you're someone who can't tolerate a game that is rough around the edges, or you're hoping for answers to questions you may have actually posed after finishing VLR, turn around now. Do not play this game. It isn't going to be worth your time, and I can't put that any more nicely. Maybe play it if you're interested in seeing what a clusterfuck it can be, as it can be an exceedingly hilarious experience with friends, but know that I warned you.\n\nIf you're someone who's willing to 'hear Uchikoshi out', so to speak, this game might be for you. I personally think this game has some ideas in it that are good in concept, and probably would have made for a pretty good addition if the \"original\" vision of this game actually released. Despite the utter ridiculousness of the game's general plot and premise, it manages to stay pretty consistent with itself. No matter how stupid the plot twists are, they are undeniably foreshadowed, and even the plot contrivances that are present to make them happen aren't much worse than some of Uchikoshi's other games.\n\nThe fragment system is truly a \"love it or hate it\" scenario. While I will say that it almost objectively robs the game's deaths of any possible emotional impact, it is nonetheless fundamental to what Zero Time Dilemma is. I think the concept leads to a pretty interesting dynamic within the game's plot. Some fragments manage to retain their emotional impact despite being potentially rendered null and void in the next fragment you play, which coupled with the game's pretty okay overall plot shows the true potential of the idea, and it's something I ended up enjoying in the end.\n\nI will say that my opinion is informed very deeply by an appreciation of ideas and potential, and the passion put into this stupid little game. If this all seems like useless mumbo-jumbo, and you'd rather just be playing an actually well constructed game, you can go ahead and skip this one. I don't blame you! I just have my own reasons to respond 'Yes' to the question of whether I recommend this game. If you're someone like me, someone who wants to see all of Uchikoshi's ideas, including the ridiculously bad and the painfully mediocre, I do wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nAlso, this game is really, really funny.

The execution of those cutscenes is where the problems lie. It is bad: facial animations are pretty much non-existent and general animations are clunky. After a while you get used to it, but it's still a big problem.\n[*] The puzzles makes a good balance between 999's school-level and VLR's mastermind level. The game makes you feel smart when you solve it without making you feel dumb when you can't solve it.\n[*] The voice acting is very good, which makes clunky cutscenes at least listenable. Some lines sound off, but there are very few of them. Sound design is kinda bad, a lot of things either sound off ([spoiler]gunshot is not loud enough[/spoiler]) or don't make a sound at all (tapping a metal box).\n[*] The story is not very climactic to feel like an ending to a series, but it's very good. The strengths of this series still stay: foreshadowing the hell out of reveals, confusing moments being perfectly explained, characters asking questions the player is interested in, etc. Characters are cool, but some of them feel one-sided. Some twists don't add anything to the story other than shock-value (they are still fun and interesting, just not really meaningful).\n[/list]\n\n[i] (Sadly, just) a good finale to a great series.

The writing across the whole series was never great, often suffering from \"anime syndrome\". However, the plot itself was strong enough, and the twists interesting enough, to be worth the payoff at the end.\n\nNot so with ZTD. The writing is as weak as ever, but now the plot is nowhere near good enough to save it. By the 2nd act of the game, the protagonists acquire a power (or realize that they had that power all along?) that essentially gives them a get-out-of-jail-free card for any situation they face, completely deflating any dramatic tension.\n\nI pushed on through the game, in hopes that \"the big plot twist\" payoff would be worth it. It was not to be. It's hard to explain how egregious the Deus Ex Machina was without giving spoilers. Closest analogy I can think of without giving too much away is: imagine the movie The Sixth Sense, but they had included a scene where the mother and Bruce Willis played patty cake prior to the big reveal.\n\nPlot problems aside, the game also has some gameplay and user interface problems.\n\nIn VLR (and possibly 999, though I can't quite recall), you acquire \"files\" that contain info that is necessary to solve the puzzles. The info from the file alone is not sufficient: you often need to combine the info from the file with info from the scene you're in. A typical example would be some graffiti on the wall that's encoded, and the file contains the key to decypher the code. VLR includes a \"note\" feature where you can scribble arbitrary notes to yourself using the mouse. This feature isn't strictly necessary, because you could always play the game with a physical pen and pad of paper by your side, but I definitely appreciated it as a Twitch streamer, because it allowed my viewers to see exactly what notes I was taking and they could follow my thought process as I worked through the puzzles.\n\nZTD downgrades this feature in two specific and inexplicable ways. First of all, they made it so that you cannot open the notes while viewing your files. That means if you were trying to take notes from the file so that you could later combine that info with what you saw in the scene, you'd have to click on \"menu\", then \"file\", then click on the file you wanted to look at, memorize some of the info, click on \"exit\" to return to the scene, then click on \"menu\" again and then click on \"note\", and then reselect the color you wanted (since it always resets to green when you re-open the notes), write down the info you wanted, click on \"exit\" to return to the scene, click on \"menu\" again, click on \"file\" again, click on the file you wanted to see again, memorize a bit more info, click on \"exit\" again, click on \"menu\" again, click on \"notes\" again, re-select your color, and then draw a bit more, and repeat until you've copied over all the info you intend to extract from the note.\n\nSecond of all, they added an \"ink\" mechanic such that you can run out of ink when taking notes, and then you have to completely discard all your notes to get a fresh cartridge of ink.\n\nThese downgrades are inexplicable in that again, you could just play with a physical pad and paper to take notes. They don't make the \"non-streamer\" experience any more difficult, but they just make things more annoying for people who want to Twitch stream the game.\n\nI also disliked in ZTD the \"3 robots/bomb disarming\" puzzle. It's difficult to go into details of the problem with the puzzle without spoiling the solution to them. So instead, I'll say that in both 999 and VLR, every puzzle made sense to me, and I managed to solve them eventually without ever looking up the solutions online or resorting to trial and error. But this was not the case for this puzzle. And even after seeing the solution, it was still unclear to me how you were supposed to arrive at this solution with the info available to you.\n\nThere is also a \"narrative puzzle\" in ZTD which I found extremely unsatisfying. Again, I'll be a bit vague to avoid spoilers, but it's structurally similar to the following analogy: Zero gives you two potions to drink, and they say neither of them are poisoned. So which one do you drink? The characters start off by reasoning that if neither of them are poisoned, it doesn't make a difference which one you drink. But then one character asks \"What if Zero was lying about whether or not the red potion is poisoned? In which case, we should definitely drink the blue potion!\" Hopefully it's obvious why this reasoning beggars belief: If Zero was willing to lie about whether or not the red potion was poisoned, why wouldn't they be willing to lie about whether or not the blue potion was poisoned as well? For people who have already played the game or who don't mind spoilers, what I'm getting at is if we're willing to entertain the idea that Zero lied about [spoiler]being able to predict people's decisions[/spoiler], why wouldn't Zero also lie about [spoiler]whether Radical 6 is a cure for Fanatic Bio R[/spoiler], or [spoiler]whether Fanatic Bio R even exists[/spoiler], or [spoiler]whether the vials contain Radical 6 as opposed to just straight poison[/spoiler], or any number of other possibilities. There's a reason logic puzzles axiomatically assume that the rules of the puzzle are not lied about: if you allow for the possibility that the person telling you the rules of the puzzle might have lied about what the rules are, then all reasoning goes out the window.\n\nAll that said, ZTD does bring some interesting innovations to the series. I think the idea where ZTD asks you to directly type in an answer is pretty clever, and it was [i]mostly[/i] well executed. However, there was one puzzle where I found they stumbled. Again, to avoid spoilers, I'll give analogy. Imagine the game asks you \"What do you call your mother's mother?\" Naturally, you would type in \"grandmother\", but the game tells you you are incorrect. So you scratch your head, and try other answers like \"nana\" or \"granny\" or \"grandparent\", all of which gets rejected. In desperation, you try all sorts of variations until you finally find out the game wanted \"grand mother\" instead of \"grandmother\". I feel like the possible answers were distinct enough that the game should have accepted your answer if you were within 1 or 2 Levenshtein distance of the \"true\" answer.\n\nThe other thing I liked about the game was that it was a nice introduction to several topics that people might not otherwise encounter, like the Sleeping Beauty problem, the Newcomb problem, and alternatives to causal decision theory. Their handling of time travel was pretty sloppy -- they almost manage to touch upon the Novikov self-consistency principle, but fall short -- but most works of fiction handle time travel sloppily, so I can't fault them too much for this. That said, don't expect a very rigorous treatment of these topics either. They fall prey to the laymen mistake of overvaluing the concept of of \"identity\" (specifically, the idea that in alternate timelines, there is a well define set of atoms that corresponds to the \"you\" of this timeline), and underestimating just how infinite the number of \"infinite alternative timelines\" is in the multiworld interpretation of quantum dynamics (in the game's narrative, they say there's an infinite number of alternative timelines, but then act like there's only about 12 alternative timelines).\n\nSo yes, the game has its positives, but let's be honest here: The only reason anyone would play ZTD is because they played 999 and VLR, and they want to see how it all ends. I honestly do not think ZTD will give those players that satisfaction. If anything, it is more likely to disappoint and enrage those players. And so I do not recommend anyone play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1626364373, "timestamp_updated": 1626364373, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529281020164489746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95681213": {"recommendationid": "95681213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419183593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1080, "last_played": 1580687958}, "language": "english", "review": "this is not a good game. like objectively its rather terrible, the animations are stilted and uncomfortable, the plot is a confusing mess, the puzzles are even more irritating to get through than VLR's. but holy hell has it stuck with me after over a year since i first played it. there's just something so deliciously sublime in the way every individual piece comes together to form a grotesque abomination of something vaguely resembling a video game. i love the parts that are bad and hate the parts that are good. i am recommending this in the same way that someone would recommend a schlocky B-movie, in that you absolutely should not go in expecting anything but a burning pile of trash, but if you hold your nose and don't get too close you will become entranced by the sheer spectacle of it all. this is one disaster of a game, but it's a beautiful disaster nonetheless.\n\ntl;dr \"It makes no damn sense!

Certain content/story had to be cut due to these new and major restrictions to the developers time and funds.\nJust don't expect too much I guess. \nAnd don't expect every single plot point left unsolved from VLR to be resolved in this one.\nIf you enjoyed the other games of this series I don't see a reason why you shouldn't play it.\nFor anyone else it might be a miss rather than a hit.\n(Then again, it might also be a miss for fans as well.)", "timestamp_created": 1625493815, "timestamp_updated": 1625494082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95095937": {"recommendationid": "95095937", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068694834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1625478220}, "language": "english", "review": "If I could go back and only buy the first two games, I would.

The animation in this one is pretty dull and not expressive enough.

"playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1625719472}, "language": "english", "review": "i\u2019ll briefly sketch outlines of three views of free will in this steam review. the first is that of \u201clibertarian agency\u201d. while many off-the-cuff definitions of free will seem to quickly descend into tautology, by far the most cogent definition of free will that i\u2019ve come across was offered by apologist j.p. moreland. the second position that i\u2019ll discuss (the dissenting view) is the deterministic position. in brief: we \"do not have\" free will. finally, i\u2019ll take a moment to introduce the compatibility position, which states that determinism can be reconciled with free will. this is the position taken by many modern naturalist philosophers. in the essay \u201cnaturalism and libertarian agency\u201d, moreland describes his \u201clibertarian\u201d view of free will. he insisted that our actions do not have prior causes: you are the ultimate cause of your own actions. you can initiate and stop yourself from initiating any action. we are all \u201clittle gods\u201d, or \u201cunmoved movers\u201d. now, you may ask why i'm citing an apologist to define free will. well, theologians tend to spend a lot of time thinking about free will, as it is central to theodicy and many other works of apologetics. i'll be dealing primarily with libertarianism for the purposes of this talk, but i\u2019ll briefly discuss a different, compatibilist view of free will later on. libertarian agency is also called contra-causal free will, because it holds that our decisions are not bound to our brains (which are made of matter), it is difficult to imagine how our thoughts could be completely free, or causally unbound. for this reason, free will is often linked with dualism. within this framework, the \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d (which is not composed of matter, and is therefore freed from causation) is the \u201cfree agent\u201d in decision making. determinism holds that we live in a causal universe, and that we are not somehow exempt from that web of causality. our thoughts and deeds are fully caused. our decisions are the effects of prior causes, and the causes of future effects. put simply, determinism is the position that your choices, like all other aspects of the macroscopic universe, have causal antecedents; that is to say, given the same options and the same set of preconditions, you will always make the same choice. but we still make choices. if you\u2019re at the caf\u00e9 for lunch, and you decide to get a regular cum soda instead of your usual diet cum soda, there was a reason for that: probably many reasons, that all came together in that one decision. in fact, the question, \u201cwhy did you do that?\u201d really only makes sense within a deterministic framework. remember: determinism doesn\u2019t say that you\u2019re some sort of mindless automaton with no mental life. you still deliberate over choices, your past experiences still play a role, you\u2019ll still sometimes make a snap judgement based on your emotions instead of thinking things through- but all of these factors are fully caused, and causally affect your decision-making process in turn. determinism does constrain you, but it only constrains you to act within your own character- which, upon reflection, doesn\u2019t seem so bad. within a deterministic framework, your decision may be influenced by a multitude of factors. some of these factors may be consciously recognized, while you may be completely unaware of others. regardless, from the determinist perspective, your decisions are the result of a calculus. a whole bunch of variables go in, and a decision comes out. let\u2019s contrast this with contra-causal free will: you are waiting to cross the street, and the light says \u201cdon\u2019t walk\u201d. perhaps you\u2019re running late for a meeting, perhaps you\u2019ve been standing in line all day and you\u2019re feeling impatient, and perhaps you were recently issued a citation by a police officer for jaywalking. does any of this factor in to your decision to cross against the light? if you\u2019re a \u201clibertarian agent\u201d, the answer must be \u201cno\u201d. if you are an unmoved mover, you simply choose. in many ways, a free choice is a meaningless choice. when you\u2019re weighing your options, this is a deterministic process. in fact, \u201cweighing\u201d one\u2019s options is an excellent analogy for the way decision-making works within a deterministic framework. even though it might seem like a close call, thirty grams of lead and fifteen grams of gold will always weigh more than five grams of silver and thirty five grams of copper. if you weighed them a second time, could things come out differently? i\u2019ll expand a little on the example that i used earlier (which i stole from the guys at reasonable doubts, by the way). let\u2019s say you\u2019re ordering lunch, and you\u2019re trying to choose whether you\u2019re going to have a cum soda or a diet cum soda. your decision may be influenced by how you\u2019re feeling about yourself, by whether your spouse has recently made a comment about your waistline, by whether you have a strong dislike for the aftertaste common to diet cum, by whether you suffer from diabetes or chronic hypoglycaemia, by whether you have a sweet tooth, by whether your father used to drink a diet cum soda while he worked on the car, by whether you just saw a magazine with a really slim model on the cover, by whether you are a huge gay queer, or by whether you\u2019ve decided that aspartame is part of a secret government mind-control project (which it is). do we have options in a deterministic universe? does it make sense to say that you chose the diet cum soda over the cum soda? doesn\u2019t that imply that things could have worked out differently? well, in a sense, things could have worked out differently- had a different set of contingencies been in play. when choices or options are presented to us, we don\u2019t necessarily know which we will choose, but that doesn\u2019t make our choice free from causal influence. there are some definitions of free will that are compatible with determinism. rather than asserting that a decision could have come out differently even had all of the contingencies been the same (the libertarian position), compatibilists may define \u201cfree will\u201d simply as an agent\u2019s capacity to act in a manner that is not coerced or restrained. daniel dennett articulates his two-stage model of decision making in his essay, \u201con giving libertarians what they say they want\u201d- \"when we are faced with an important decision, a consideration-generator whose output is to some degree undetermined produces a series of considerations, some of which may of course be immediately rejected as irrelevant by the agent... ultimately serve as predictors and explicators of the agent\u2019s final decision.\" \n\nthat\u2019s not only compatible with determinism, that is determinism.", "timestamp_created": 1625028067, "timestamp_updated": 1625028067,

I would recommend this game, but with some caveats. First, don't even consider playing this game without playing the other games first. Zero Time Dilemma is heavily reliant on prior knowledge of 999 and VLR, especially the latter. Second, keep in mind that ZTD is the weakest game in the trilogy by a considerable margin. Temper your expectations accordingly. The game is still worth playing for some of its interesting ideas and some really cool moments, but if you loved Virtue's Last Reward and want everything set up there to be resolved satisfactorily, you may come away disappointed. If you keep these things in mind, you can still have a good experience. It has its moments, as long as you go in completely blind. \n\nLike the other games in the series, Zero Time Dilemma is half visual novel, half escape the room puzzle game. This may come down to personal taste, but visually, I think this game is the worst in the series. The 3D models somehow look even worse than in Virtue's Last Reward, with stiff, amateurish animations and facial expressions on top of that. The English voice acting is pretty hit or miss, but it's tolerable and some characters give decent performances. Music is about on par with the other games in the series. \n\nWhen it comes to the story, ZTD may have the most experimental structure in the series. Sometimes, this works out well and there are some great moments where everything seems to click and come together. However, without spoiling how it works, I question whether it was entirely worth it. In Virtue's Last Reward, the game's unique narrative structure really enhanced the game, but in ZTD, it often came off as more confusing than interesting. Zero Time Dilemma also has the huge narrative problem of having to resolve everything established in VLR, which I don't think it does very well by the end. VLR set up too much, and this game wasn't up to the task, unfortunately, particularly with one twist that I strongly disliked. The game is still worth it because some of the game's highs do live up to 999 and VLR, but it doesn't maintain that quality for the entire runtime. \n\nZTD's puzzles are generally inoffensive. They're more difficult than in 999, but easier than in VLR on hard, which might be for the best. VLR's moon logic puzzles could sometimes be frustrating without any hints, while 999 was so easy that the puzzles solved themselves. ZTD gives you hints the longer you take, but won't be as quick to outright give you the answer as 999. I found this to be a nice balance.\n\nOverall, I would give a lukewarm recommendation for Zero Time Dilemma. If you loved the first two games, you should play this game, but without setting your expectations too high.

The story about nine individuals who were kidnapped and trapped in an underground facility, they were divided into three teams:\n\n[list][*] Team C: Carlos (Leader) Akane, Junpei.\n[*] Team D: Diana (Leader) Sigma, Phi.\n[*] Team Q. Q (Leader), Eric, Mira.\n[/list]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494811511\n\nYou choose which team to play and witness an event from their point of view, once this section ended, you can go to the second team and play through the same event or a different one, you'll also get to see the outcome of what other teams did which will effect on their colleagues. The story is very interesting and the more you play, the more you'll be hooked. I liked the puzzles so much, some of them are quite difficult and you could easily die. I didn't like the gore, sadly you have no option to disable it as it is a necessity of the story. \n\nThe voice-overs are good, some of the voice actors are very well known. I liked the graphics style, however, I'm not very keen on some of the characters' designs. The soundtracks are nice, I liked the one that plays whenever there is an emotional part. The characters personalities are different from each other, I understand that the games, in general, make all types of characters to please all audiences, but one of them got on my nerves to the point that I was willing to skip his part. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494807577\n\nThe best thing about this VN is that you can go back and forth between the events, choosing the cutscene or the part where you need to decide something. You can keep on replying to get different outcomes. There is a chart for each team or a global one, you can keep a track of the story and what else you must unlock.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2507056232\n\nThere is a backlog of the conversation, and a section where you can take notes on any screen you choose as evidence or something that'd help you to solve a puzzle. You can also view all files and everything you've collected so far. \n\n\nPros:\n+Interesting story.\n+Excellent writing.\n+Interesting characters \n+Good soundtracks.\n+Chellenging puzzles.\n+Multiple endings and routes. \n+Manual save.\n+Good game length.\n+Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n-Quite repetitive at the beginning, but it becomes very interesting after the first part. \n\nHighly recommended to gamers who enjoyed Visual Novels, puzzles, mystery, and psychological horror. Keep in mind that there is a good amount of gore in this game that you can't disable. \n\n[I]Other Reviews[/i]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/477740/]Zero Escape: The Nonary Games Review[/url]\n\n\n[quote]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc50\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32399565/]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e'\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc36\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1622809540, "timestamp_updated": 1671038605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808591723442077637", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93125000": {"recommendationid": "93125000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084537619", "num_games_owned": 676, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1252, "last_played": 1622745049}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, ending is a bit silly tho", "timestamp_created": 1622747841, "timestamp_updated": 1622754359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93075344": {"recommendationid": "93075344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030514338", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1241, "last_played": 1606848629}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR; play it for the puzzles, not the story.\n\nIt's hard to recommend this game as a sequel to the previous two entries. If you like the escape room content of the other games, you'll like it here too, but the story is less satisfying. I can't explain exactly why without spoiling the game, but I'll say this much:\n\nA) it plays out in \"fragments\", so you don't know at first when each event occurs. It's interesting, but I ultimately feel it didn't pay off compared to the unfolding mystery along branching paths of the previous two games.\n\nB) the game is generally much bleaker than the previous two entries. After playing the previous two entries, I felt like I'd \"won\". The true ending here did not leave me with that feeling. Maybe I wouldn't have mind so much if the tone wasn't so different from the other two games otherwise, or if the concept had been explored as a standalone game rather than a VLR sequel. But, basically, I didn't get what I was hoping for.\n\nAlso, the decision to shift from 2d character art/sprites to full 3D models was a bad one.

With both new and returning characters it manages to feel new and fresh while still staying true to the themes of the previous games.\n\nThe puzzles in this entry are just as challenging yet rewarding as the previous games but with just a little more polish due to a better engine.\n\nStory wise a little lacking but makes up for it with an astounding atmosphere and feeling of mystery that the series delivers on while simultaneously allowing you to explore it in anyway you'd like with its contined use of the intersected yet branching story paths the series is well known for. Plus like the previous games when you start to figure put what is going on (it is a mystery game afterall) the story ramps up QUICK and hits HARD.\n\nWith the nonary games being visual novels ZTD relies heavily on you having knowledge of the events of the other games in the franchize, so if you see this game thinking you'd like to play some cool escape rooms i would urge you to wait on this and play those first. (once again this is the conclusion to a story spanning 3 games) plus 1 and 2 are in a bundle for dirt cheap.\n\nIn conclusion: great ending to a mind fuck of series \nPlus if you have played the previous games and youre  still here it means you're already invested in the series in which case why havent you bought it and are already playing it yet?\n\nOverall 8/10 game but an absolutely vital part of a 10/10 story", "timestamp_created": 1622564756, "timestamp_updated": 1622564756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92919475": {"recommendationid": "92919475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972562723", "num_games_owned": 591, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1622800830}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good so far.

If you have not played the first two, go play them first (Zero escape: the nonary games). If you don't, this game will not make much sense and you will miss out on many of the \"Oh sh** moments\". If you have played the first two games, and don't know whether or not to buy this one, I hope that I can supply enough information to help your decision. \n\nStarting from the top,\n\n------Eating the frog first------\nIf this is not the first review your reading longer than a paragraph, or you haven\u2019t seen the monstrosity that is about 2 minutes and 9 seconds into the trailer, then you already know one thing. The graphics in this game, are, well, bad. Look, I liked the game, it was fine, but there's no denying that the graphics suck. Graphics never really bothered me, I could play some really questionable-looking games with no problem, but these graphics did break the experience for me from time to time. During most parts (escape rooms, menus, UI, hand-drawn art) the game looks sleek and beautiful, it is only the 3d modeling that is the problem. During most cutscenes like the \u201coh here is some information about some random 1995 philosophical theory\u201d bits, it\u2019s fine, but during the scenes with a lot of action, emotion, or violence, it really showed. I don\u2019t want to spend to long on this topic, as it has already been done to death, but there is one thing I would like to say that I do not see people talk a lot about when they review this topic. The zero escape team was not originally funded enough money to make a third entry, but fans really pushed them to nonetheless. The team was put in a tight spot, and they really had to cut down on the price for modeling to release the game. Honestly, when it comes down to story, length, or animation, I would want the animation to be the first thing to have a price cut, which is what they did. Plus, zero escape was never really known for its super-realistic art style (Far from it, albeit), and way more known for its stories and characters, so I can understand why they cut this first.\n\n------Murica\u2019 moment------\nGotta love America. Many people may not know this, but the first two games did not sell well at all in Japan, so the devs decided to make this one much more American. This can be good or bad, for those of you peeps who rode the Danganronpa wave over here and want to see your favorite waifus get rolled over by a bulldozer, then this is going to be a little different. The game has a much darker and gritty theme to it and playing it reminded me more of \u201csaw\u201d than anything else. The two main obvious changes to please us westerners are the new cinema mode, and the characters. Let\u2019s start with the cinema mode. This game is like a movie now, they moved away from the \u201cclick to progress\u201d style and made all the cutscenes cinematic. They apparently did this because Americans can\u2019t read, but it most definitely feels a lot less like your typical visual novel this way. There are still subtitles, but for those of you who like to read through text really fast (such as myself) are going to struggle a tad here. It\u2019s not that bad, most of the cutscenes are fast and to the point but for longer parts, it can get veeeerrryyy long. As long as your ok with sitting back with some popcorn from time to time, it\u2019s nothing experience-breaking. Second, the characters. Let\u2019s start with the elephant in the room, Carlos. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Carlos is a great character, but I just wanted to talk about him for a bit. First, this dude is pure ye haw redneck Truckin American. Well, he\u2019s not that American, but it is obvious that he was meant to connect to the western audience. I ended up really liking him, but I know many people felt he did not bounce off other characters that well. They also changed many of the other existing characters to be more American as well, which I know many people did not like either. I know all of this may seem trivial, but the reason I bring it up is that this is not your average visual novel, if you came here for the stuff like danganronpa or even the previous zero escapes, you may like it less. If the more western style doesn\u2019t bother you, then it will probably not make a difference to the experience. \n\n------Decisions decisions, all of them wrong------\nOooohhh yay! A new gimmick! You can\u2019t just pump out the same game 3 times in a row, everyone knows this (Except for EA, apparently) so you gotta toss some new spice into the mix for each entry. This game\u2019s gimmick is the decision game. Everyone once and a while the game will put you in a situation where you have to make a, you guessed it, decision. I won\u2019t say much due to spoiler reasons, but I think this was a really good addition to the game. It made the timeline splits feel much more meaningful than \u201cOh I went through door A instead of door B\u201d. I know that there were decisions like that in the last game, but most of them were like \u201coh haha pick the right one or die\u201d. While some of those are like that, many of the decisions lead to a different timeline. The game also does a good job of making your decisions feel impactful, even though you can just go back and change it. I\u2019m not really sure how they do this, but a lot of the time I would really think through my decisions, and the impacts they would cause, even if I could just go back and change them. This may be because (Spoilers unless you played the first two games) they really liked to do the whole time jump thing, so I never really knew what to expect.\n\n------Because 60 minutes wasn\u2019t enough------\nOh, wait, another gimmick? It cannot be! Well, this time it\u2019s the fragments, a less well-received gimmick than the previous ones. Basically, the characters in the game have their memory erased every 90 minutes, so you play the game in \u201cfragments\u201d. This means that every 90 minutes is isolated from the rest of the game, each time the characters wake up dazed and confused, and can only remember the first little bit of the game (no matter how far through they actually are). This means that it\u2019s up to you to think through where you think these things would fall on the timeline as your playing them. *usually* it\u2019s pretty obvious where it is on the timeline because you can just compare the shape of the fragment flow chart with the global flow chart and you can find it. This also means you play the story mostly out of order. There is not exactly a clear path, and you can start (almost) wherever you want to on the timeline. I never really had a problem with it, and made it much easier to find stopping points, but I know a lot of people hated it. I can\u2019t really do much else besides explaining it, because it never really stuck out to me as a big thing, but I do know many people do not like it, so keep that in mind.\n\n\n\n------Better than nothing------\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, then I\u2019m sure this looks like a lot of negative things, but that\u2019s because I can\u2019t really go over the positive things without major spoilers. The game\u2019s strengths is all in the story. The story is just as good as the previous games and never failed to surprise me with plot twists or funny moments. And I\u2019ll say this, the game is better than nothing. I\u2019m glad that we got an official conclusion to the game, rather than having it hang off at VLR. Yeah, it\u2019s not the best, but endings are hard, and this is one of the better ones I\u2019ve seen. The team didn\u2019t *have* to make this, but they still did, and I feel like they don\u2019t get enough respect for that. The community knew they didn\u2019t have funding, and should have expected lower quality than before, but the writing is still beautiful, and it provides a reasonable and satisfying conclusion to the series.", "timestamp_created": 1621718247, "timestamp_updated": 1621718247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92428007": {"recommendationid": "92428007", "author": {"steamid": "76561199119059932", "num_games_owned": 1880, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1194, "last_played": 1621711550}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game series.

Hot trash. The dirtiest, greasiest burger of the VN world. So dirty and greasy that it's... kind of good.\n\nI'll try to cover the four parts of the game that I think are worth discussing. \n\n1. The format. Unlike the previous instalments where you followed fairly clear, fairly linear timelines, ZTD is presented to the player as a series of chunks or \"story fragments\" that you have to follow in order to unlock more fragments and, ultimately, endings. It's a fresh-ish approach to the series, matching the experience of the characters, all of whom are forced to wake for 90 minute periods, retaining no memories of previous periods. You also play as three separate teams with no direct contact to one another, which could have been an interesting dynamic were it not for the sheer difficulty of juggling nine sort-of protagonists. And unfortunately, even when you can see the fragments forming into their linear timelines, there is little sense of progress. More often than not, the game feels quite senseless. One thing ZTD does have over 999 and VLR is (some) better dilemmas. Because the format and the timeline branches are freer than in previous games, there are more meaningful and problematic decisions to be made than just \"Ally/Betray\", \"Take/Give this one item\" or \"Pick a door.\"\n\n2. To continue that thought, then: the story. ZTD is an incredibly cruel game. Not in the sense of 999 or VLR which required difficult choices and set out clear motives of characters working for the \"greater good\"; ZTD is, in parts, just torture porn. It's clear that the popularity of DanganRonpa has been an utterly catastrophic influence on the development of this game. Much of the story has no more artistic or narrative merit than the latter Saw films. So if you actually like DR, congratulations, you got a fourth one at ZE's expense. That's not to say it's all bad; you can tell the [spoiler]Diana/Sigma/Phi[/spoiler] branches were written first because they are actually exceptional by the game's standards. They hit the same sweet spot that VLR consistently hit in terms of crazy, stupid, yet fun twists. It is almost solely on this basis that I recommend the game: as an add-on to VLR. (It does also inherit VLR's unfortunate side effect of shitting on 999. [spoiler]Junpei and Akane[/spoiler] are warped almost beyond recognition for much of the game, and ZTD does a sloppy job of trying to explain itself.) Similarly, when the game tries to stand on its own feet, it fails quite drastically. At one point I seriously considered the possibility that the dog might be Zero, because that's how bloody stupid the game was getting. But if you needed closure on VLR, then it's probably worth going through the rest of it anyway. Phi said in VLR, \"Not even Jupiter can find a lost opportunity,\" but if you squint hard enough you can just about find the one in this game.\n\n3. The graphics. Holy shit are they bad. That's not graphics-whorism; they really are awful. The character models look worse than VLR's, and the cutscenes are just clunky, uncanny messes. I guess they thought the VN-format was too anime-ish to be popular (weird given how it tries to emulate DR in so many other places) but I guess nobody told them bad graphics are unpopular too. I don't know too much about the technicalities of 3D modelling, but I have DS games that look better than this. That said, you do kind of get used to it somehow.\n\n4. The escape rooms. They're a mixed bag. I think there are thirteen in all; there were probably two or three that I thought were incredible and some of the best in the series, and then one that was so dull I just followed a walkthrough. The rest I remember as being fairly serviceable puzzles, if a little samey as the series has used up most themes for rooms you could think of (Maybe if there's a fourth game we can get an aquarium escape room? HMU for more details Spike Chunsoft). 999 only had eight rooms in total, and the UI is pretty dated, so ZTD probably has it beat, but in this respect (as in most others) VLR is still king.", "timestamp_created": 1621194364, "timestamp_updated": 1621194364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518950462341308594", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92062668": {"recommendationid": "92062668", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966519374", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1331, "last_played": 1621095234}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

Going into detail about it would mean a wall of black text for this review and is better saved for a discussion among fans, so I will just say that it felt weaker in execution relative to 999 and VLR.\n\nin interest of fairness, i remember the puzzles being generally fun: it's been a while since i've played, so the only one i particularly remember fondly at the top of my head is the one that implemented a probability paradox concept, which played into the story as well (skip this text if you don't want to be spoiled: [spoiler] specifically, the one with the monty hall problem [/spoiler]).\n\noverall, though, i feel that (re)playing 999 and VLR would be a better use of your time, pretending this game didn't exist. please don't read this to mean i hate the developer: I don't mean ill-will towards the people who have worked on this game and i hope the best for them (i enjoyed their later game AI: The Somnium Files!).\n\nfun(?) fact: this came out on my birthday. what...a gift?", "timestamp_created": 1620676293, "timestamp_updated": 1620676293, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316417217254639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91741630": {"recommendationid": "91741630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241372268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1036, "last_played": 1646105506}, "language": "english", "review": "While not as universally acclaimed as the titles included in [i] The Nonary Games, Zero Time Dilemma [/i] still holds interesting themes and provides (in my opinion) a satisfactory conclusion to the Zero Escape franchise as it exists now.

Three games that will definitely blow your mind if you look deep enough into the story.\nIf I would rank all 3 Games it would be VLR > 999 > ZTD (But that doesn\u2019t mean ZTD is bad, its ending just feels not as satisfying as 999 and VLR and yeah the animations are also not the best part of the game in comparison to its predecessors )\n\nIf you haven\u2019t play The Nonary Games (999/VLR) I would highly recommend you to play thoses first and then hop into ZTD.\nHow would I describe Zero Escape: SteinsGate and the Saw Movies made a baby and so little baby Zero Escape got born. :D", "timestamp_created": 1619465336, "timestamp_updated": 1619467557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90778371": {"recommendationid": "90778371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061218196", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1626609975}, "language": "english", "review": "launched the game\nTossed a coin\nWon\nGame ends\nTry again\nTossed a coin\nWon\nGame ends\nTry again\nTossed a coin\nWon\nGame ends\nGame easy", "timestamp_created": 1619183566, "timestamp_updated": 1619183566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750313222408294678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90710222": {"recommendationid": "90710222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053448086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1613099210}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was easy, i just flipped a coin and it ended. i wonder what the whole snail thing was about, though.", "timestamp_created": 1619060697, "timestamp_updated": 1619060697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841267168521881104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90603994": {"recommendationid": "90603994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836499214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1147, "last_played": 1613697148}, "language": "english", "review": "If you loved the first two Zero Escape games this is a good follow up.\nIs it kind of cringey, over the top, and absurd?

But compared to 999 and VLR it gave me some mixed feelings. \n\nThe Good:\n- The plot in itself is intriguing, everyone has their own goals and back story. \n- The system with achronological episodes was refreshing and didn't interrupt the gaming experience.\n- The 3d-modells are rather pretty. As long as they don't move.\n- The rest of the art style is consistent with the other games of the series.\n- You can choose between Japanese and English voice acting. \n- The pairing we've all been waiting for finally gets their shit together. \n- The music is lit as always. The game is just as atmospheric as 999 and VLR.\n- It clears up things from VLR. \n\n\nThe Bad:\n- Mental illness ex machina. Why does the murderer murder people? Because murdering is fun! *vomits*\n- You like blood? Then this game is for you. \n- The ending? Will certainly be a surprise. This an be a good or a bad thing, depending on how ridiculous you expect the reveal to be. \n- Compared to 999, pseudo-science in here sometimes annoyed me because it felt so ... far-fetched? In 999, young me believed every \"scientific\" idea explained there. It felt somewhat real, somewhat understandable.\nBut here, realism is thrown out the window, which is kind of sad. I guess nothing can top 999 after all. ^^'\n- Sometimes the riddles were really hard. I mean, yes, they are supposed to be challenging, but sometimes I got stuck in an escape room hysterically clicking everything to then realize that I missed that one exact pixel. Watch out to adapt your cursor speed, pals!\n- Akane isn't as smart as she used to be. \n- No Aoi in here. Me very sad. \n- The rough animation and funky standing around and staring into space.

TL:DR at the bottom. \n\nHoly shit where do I begin, this game has some promising elements but they all gets drowned out my everything else. It's a fine game at times and frustratingly bad at other times. One of the only consistently  good things I can say about it was the art-style in the first game, and I say first game because they get rid of it in the 2nd and 3rd games for some pretty crappy 3d models, so even that's not consistent, The voice acting is sometimes good, and at other times half-assed. The puzzles are sometimes fun, and at other times tedious, repetitive, and bullshit. The plot is decent at it's best moments, and underwhelming, predictable, full of holes, and boring a lot of the time. The game is filled with so many annoying control-elements and feels like shit to play. \nI can sense that there are some talented individuals that worked on this, and I don't mean to be rude, but these games really took a turn for the worse. I'm only being harsh on this game because I can see some of the good in it and want to hold it to a high-standard, but it just isn't fun in the end. I really hope that AI: The Somnium Files is better than this and I can see their talent shine on it. Go play games like Phoenix Wright or Danganronpa if you are interested in this type of game and haven't played them yet. They have their problems, but are much more enjoyable in the end.\n\n\nTL:DR: I really want to like this game, and while there are some things I like, I just can't like this series. The controls, graphics, story, voice acting, characters, and puzzles, all are decent at the best times, and horrible at worst.

Sadly, in this occasion, this results in a very complex story that keeps getting more and more convoluted while delivering a somewhat disappointing ending.

And don't get me wrong, the story and its branches do have a lot of things going for them, but the resolution doesn't live up to the huge backstory. \nThere are big parts of the game, [spoiler] specially the ending, [/spoiler] where it practically abandons the puzzle aspect and is mostly a lot of cut scenes. If you're like me, you've most likely played it in a short span of time, which makes the explanations very repetitive. You can fast forward through them, so it's not an impediment, but it's still cumbersome and takes you a bit out of the narrative if you're constantly having recaps. Long recaps.\n\nAll in all, I was left disappointed. Too many hours spent on a hard story to follow, not enough payoff. If you're into escape-the-room games, I'd just go for those sections and stop after the \"complete all quests\" achievement. If you don't mind being left with some questions un-answered, the story can still be very interesting. \n\nVERY SPOILER TO ENDGAME, MUCH COMPLAINING: [spoiler] I will still die mad about not having a scene where Mira tells Eric who she really is... and still mad that they never talk about Eric's mom long enough for the both of us to come to the conclusion the game implies. Also mad that Delta says that killing Gab is good news without saying why. And if someone can tell me why on the library sequence if you type Delta when given the choice, Shaun literally turns to camera and shoots us. I mean, were they aware there was an old man just chilling there called Delta? Are we supposed to believe Delta can just erase himself from everyone's consciousness and that's why he doesn't appear for most of the game?

The partial transition to 3d in VLR is bad enough, but clearly they didn't get the memo. \nThe use of a 3D engine made this game look and feel MUCH more outdated than its 2D counterparts, despite being fairly more recent. Animations are choppy, expressions are unrealistic, and models are not as well rendered. There's a lot of moon logic moments in escape rooms as well, [spoiler]such as where the TP room requires you to click BELOW the hologram text to enter the secret code with no clear signs whatsoever, [/spoiler] not to mention the clunky controls and no option to rebind keys (as well as lack of basic features such as swapping items without going into the menu screen). \nThe structure is, while innovative, full of flaws. Due to the segmented nature, a lot of lengthy expositions are retold over and over again. I don't have to be told that they'll be forced asleep in 90 minutes for every. last. escape room I do. Certain announcements are also heard repeatedly with equally long explanations from Zero each time you play a different team that encounters it, and of course there's no way to skip them. I'd have let it slip if each team actually exhibited any different behaviors/attitudes, but no, they tend to just listen to Zero with barely any notable remarks. This obviously also lends itself to the story's terrible pacing. Often leads don't add up and you have to jump to disparate parts of the story and search aimlessly while extra leads just pile on with no real answers in sight. \nOverall, the story is not absolutely terrible, and you might enjoy it if you are willing to overlook the mechanical and narrative downfalls, but I think your time will be much better spent with just the two previous games (in Zero Escape: The Nonary Games package on Steam).", "timestamp_created": 1613478199, "timestamp_updated": 1613478220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86713640": {"recommendationid": "86713640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028003400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1613394946}, "language": "english", "review": "Only finished the games because I really liked the first two, bad 3d, bad acting, this is not worth it", "timestamp_created": 1613395052, "timestamp_updated": 1613395052, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86689589": {"recommendationid": "86689589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087117657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1091, "last_played": 1608018205}, "language": "english", "review": "Man....\n\n3/10", "timestamp_created": 1613370984, "timestamp_updated": 1619588052, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86588260": {"recommendationid": "86588260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383177558", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1613655573}, "language": "english", "review": "So...

All you can do in this one is watch cutscenes, make a few choices you are forced to and play the escape room puzzles. A story told in a non-linear manner, yet not in the best way. Also, since 999 the voice acting has gotten worse and worse.

Even though I didn't care for the second one, I [i]loved[/i] the first one, so I was hoping this game would redeem the series in my eyes. It did not. It did just the opposite, in fact.\n\nI'll start by saying the switch from visual novel to animated cutscenes was a poor decision. With VNs, I can go as fast as I want, but with cutscenes I have to [i]sit through[/i] all of them, which was rather annoying. This is made worse by the fact that the 3D models are so, [i]so,[/i] ugly, embarrassingly so. They somehow look even worse than the already ugly models of the last game. I think the cherry on top of what makes me hate the cutscenes though is the lack of escape rooms.\n\nThis is a series of games about escape rooms, it's in the title, Zero [i]Escape[/i], but this game does not have enough of them. It has less than both of the last games. This game is about 40% escape rooms, and 60% godoforsaken slow, ugly, cutscenes.\n\nThe flowchart is also very hard to follow. With the last two games, you start at the begining of a branch, and you play it until pretty much the end, maybe returning with a password. In this game the branches are split up into a ton of different parts, all of which are played out of order. You might play something at the beginning of one branch, then the end of another, and then the middle of yet another. It makes the story ridiculously hard to follow.\n\nIt's also needlessly bloody. The last two games had hardly any blood, just as much as was needed, but this game can be kind of a gorefest at times. Trying to copy Danganronpa yet again it seems.\n\nSpeaking of Danganronpa, that speech they give the mastermind at the end? [i]So[/i] corny. It's like every Danganronpa ending combined. They basically said \"we're gonna find the truth and make our own future with the power of hope and friendship!\"\n\nI also didn't care for the fact they switched from a nonary game to a decision game. The number nine was a key feature to these games, and it feels wrong for it to basically be absent from this one.\n\nIf there's one good thing about the game, it's the voice acting. The voice actors are all very talented, and they deserved a better script than this one, because this game's story also leaves little to be desired. Spoiler territory below.\n\nI think the first bad decision is the reveal that [spoiler]Phi is Sigma's daughter. There are two main reasons this is bad, first being that it created a paradox, but the first game had one as well, so I'll let it slide. The main issue is, well, incest. One of my least favorite things about the second game was that Sigma spent a lot of time harassing women because the writers just thought it would be funny (it wasn't). One of those women he would make perverted comments towards was Phi, most notably when he said he wanted to see her in a swimsuit or that joke about making a baby together. Granted, neither Sigma nor the audience knew, but still...eugh. The perving was already unnecessary and gross, but now it's just even moreso. If you're going to reveal two characters are related, maybe [i]don't[/i] do it after having one character be perverted towards the other.[/spoiler]\n\nAnother story decision that bothered me was revealing that [spoiler] Delta, the old man and mastermind, was just...there, the whole time. He was just sitting there next to them the whole time and none of them ever mentioned it, nor did they seem uncomfortable with him sitting there while they tear each other to shreds. Also, in the various endings where some of them got out, you're telling me [i]no one[/i] thought to bring him? They wanted to bring the dog but not this other human? This is almost as bad as Sigma somehow not realizing that he's an old man throughout the entirety of the last game.[/spoiler]\n\nAlso, we need to talk about [spoiler] the C team force quit box scene. If you don't remember or just don't care about spoilers, it seems like, out of [i]nowhere[/i] Carlos suddenly tries to r//pe Akane. Junpei justifiably beats the snot out of him. It's revealed not long after he did that because he had to get close to both of them so he could whisper in their ears how to avoid the injection, he was never going to hurt Akane, and it was all an act to save them. I [i]hate[/i] this. There were so many ways you could have accomplished this without a r//pe scare. I bet they made it look like Carlos was going to commit one of the most disgusting acts a human can do for the same reason there's all the blood or Diana's abusive husband or Eric's PTSD: shock value, which is gross.[/spoiler]\n\nSpeaking of [spoiler] Diana's ex husband and Eric's PTSD, they're very unnecessary, and like I said, just for shock value. You should never throw in something disturbing just to shock the audience, it lacks integrity, treats serious topics with disrespect, and it leaves the story with little value once the shock wears off. Diana has an abusive ex husband that really has no impact on the plot except strengthening her and Sigma's relationship for about five minutes, which is in really poor taste, and Eric has PTSD from that time his abusive father killed his brother when they were kids and forced him to help hide the body. Eric's tragic backstory adds literally nothing to the story. Diana's tragic backstory at least adds a little bit, but Eric's adds [i]nothing.[/i] It could be completely removed and the story would be exactly the same. Other than just making the audience shocked, the only other reason I would assume it's there is to make audiences sympathize with Eric, because he's whiny, petulant, and resorts to violence way too quickly. His constant violence and threats towards Q, a [i]child,[/i] really put me off of his character. He also has a habit of shifting blame when hes clearly at fault, but it seems that that one is a [i]result[/i] of his tragic backstory, because his dad blamed him for his brother's death, so in this case his tragic backstory made him [i]less[/i] sympathetic.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, only get this game if you're just [i]dying[/i] to know what really happened to cause the events of the second game, or if you just...really liked the second game maybe.

Where ZTD lack is the story and engagement that the previous other games had. Many were hoping for ZTD to close up the loopholes left by the previous series, but instead only opened them. The gameplay is still great but these games falls under the \"puzzle visual novel\" game.

The first one was super good, the second one was a huge disappointment, which caused me to want to refund this game (I read quite some negative stuff about this, and the gore/violence was something I didn't want). Couldn't refund, so well, I've let it rest for half a year, and then decided to play it. Needles to say, my expectations were quite low. The game ended up being much better than I anticipated. Especially compared to Virtue's last reward (VLR).\n\nDisadvantages:\n- The game is really short. I am a kinda slow player, taking my time examining everything, even then, it took me merely 23 hours to complete the game. Several issues rise up related to this. There are fewer escape rooms, and no \"boss battle\"/final escape room. Characters develop a bit hastily, expressing secrets quickly, and there isn't much character development to begin with. \n- The game is incredibly fantastical, which makes the story incredible and thus less interesting to me. 999 was so good because it did a good job at making the story credible.\n- Escape rooms were generally too dark.\n- No animated portraits during escape room interactions made all the conversations there very unemotional and boring because of that.\n- For some reason, some characters become nonsensically aggressive/bloodthirsty. The gore/violence (which is lore-wise probably not even needed) was bearable, except for one sequence (you'll know which when playing, so you can prepare yourself a bit).\n- I got stuck because I didn't know I had to replay the execution sequence multiple times.\n\nMixed:\n+- The escape room had a very healthy mix of puzzles and click/combine the right things. VLR was too puzzle-heavy for my taste. The general difficulty was moderate to even low. I don't remember resorting to walkthroughs (unlike VLR). This made the experience very smooth. However, the escape rooms did have their issues: the puzzle variety was really low (puzzles got reused multiple times within the same game!). One escape room accidentally made me skip a big portion. Time spend in escape rooms is too low for this game series.\n+- The animated scenes are a large improvement compared to VLR. It was easy to get used to, and I actually somewhat liked the style, even if not really detailed. I liked 999's style more though, and I have a small feeling the labor needed to produce these hindered making longer conversations, resulting in the short game it is.\n\nThe good things:\n+ The game handles the flowcharts much better than VLR with its fragments. The general flow chart is also much better than in VLR.\n+ The game is well-constructed, making it not completely random like VLR, where pairings/colors/unlocked rooms/... all felt random. This well-constructed aspect is something it shares with 999.\n+ It kept my attention well. Unlike VLR.\n\nAs final note: I recommend playing 999 before this, and recommend knowing the story of VLR (through reading or playing) before playing this. One, this spoils a lot from the previous games, two, those games were longer than this one because things were explained better.

I was, however, entirely wrong. This game actually had me engaged all the way through.\n\nPros\nThe riddles are challenging but most of them one can solve without a guide (when my friend and I played it we only needed a guide once).\nMost of the characters are engaging and likable.\nThe story is very engaging but it is not for everyone (it's my first game in the series).\n\nCons\nEric is one of the worst characters in all of fiction.\nThe story is not for everyone; if you do not like stories about time travel and the type of pacing that comes with, you will not like this game. It ain't back to the future.\nIf you do not like anime, do not buy this game as it has a lot of the cliches common to the medium.\nThe ending is very open-ended and can be seen as pretty unsatisfying.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game and I was pleasantly surprised by this game in an industry that is plagued with a lack of originality and open world games but those are the same thing.\n\n9 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1611736765, "timestamp_updated": 1611737694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85426177": {"recommendationid": "85426177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097148876", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1244, "last_played": 1612044439}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor videojuego de la historia\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: El mejor videojuego infravalorado de la historia", "timestamp_created": 1611732826, "timestamp_updated": 1612044495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85267210": {"recommendationid": "85267210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000896253", "num_games_owned": 687, "num_reviews": 209, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1047, "last_played": 1574105109}, "language": "english", "review": "The final instalment of the Zero Escape Trilogy. I rated the previous games as 6/10 and 5/10 affairs, decent games but with flaws that drag it down somewhere. For the first, it was the ending that let it down, and for the second the messy complexity of the routes, which made it exhausting to go through, alongside a non-canon finale and again, a poor ending. Still, they are by no means a bad game, I do enjoy them and I have enough interest to shoot on to the finale.\n\nWhere the first two (The Nonary games duo) were visual novels with puzzle/escape room elements, this one has fully jumped into the adventure genre. It dispenses with a lot of the visual novel trends, UI, text boxes and so on, enough that even VNDB has denied it classification as a visual novel.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t detract from the game though. This is still mind-bending stuff, with a lot of core concepts based in pseudoscience and wild theories that exist in real life. The creators of the game take all the previous themes and run with it. There are a lot of nods and call backs for players of the previous games, in fact, you really shouldn\u2019t be coming anywhere near this without completing the previous two.\n\nThis time around, we\u2019re investigating the DCOM\u2019s Mars Simulation \u2013 a plot device in the previous game, and here we get to see the full events of the cliff-hanger ending of the second game. Of the cast, there are many familiar faces, people who were involved in the first and second games are here starring as central protagonists for the finale. As is tradition, several people (9) get captured and put in a complex where they are forced to solve puzzles to survive and/or kill each other.\n\nGameplay is now broken up into cinematic sequences, choices and puzzle rooms. Cinematic sequences are full videos of the characters being put in a situation, with lots of talking, it\u2019s essentially watching a movie, and you need to pay attention to the plot hooks and reveals if you want to piece together the story and the truth. You\u2019ll often get a choice at the end of the cinematic, usually resulting in the death of one or many other people and often setting you down different realities \u2013 there\u2019s alternate universes and time stuff going on here, it\u2019s all out there and messes with your head.\n\nPuzzle rooms are the same as IRL escape rooms, similar to the previous two games, they\u2019re not too difficult.\n\nWhat has changed now though is there are no longer straight-forward \u2018routes\u2019 to unlock and progress things on. Now, everything is smashed into \u2018fragments\u2019, and you have to pick a fragment and investigate the choices etc within and then work out where the fragment fits in the timeline, i.e. the more traditional \u2018routes\u2019. The in-universe explanation for this is that everyone is on memory wiping drugs, so no one knows in what order things are happening. (You could, if you\u2019re so inclined use one of the many chronological order guides out there, although you lose the fun of figuring some things out, you gain in having a more coherent storyline to follow, either approach works. I note that the fragmentation of the routes came under criticism from some fans, I don\u2019t blame them.)\n\nThe brilliant thing about this game is you can roll the credits in 10 minutes flat. It\u2019s pretty damn clever, I won't spoil it. The story elements have gone back to being darker and more gruesome, a lot of the deaths pan away from the immediate incident but then proceeds to show the aftermath and they\u2019re not very pleasant. A lot of the puzzles now contain a fairly lethal element to them, similar to the Saw movies.\n\nThe story is also fairly serious, and all throughout I found it fairly interesting to go through. The pacing is good, the ending is reasonable and I think it left the series in a good place; a wild journey with lots of mindbending pseudoscience to take to my grave, an enjoyable if flawed trilogy. If they trimmed the second game and upped the ending of the first, I'd say this would swim into my 'best series ever' catalogue, but I think for me, personally it just misses the mark.\n\nIf you were lukewarm on the first two, I think the third is definitely worth trying. However, again I might be going against the grain here as I understand that this was a bit of a marmite affair for the initial fans.

The puzzles aren't as tough as in VLR but they're pretty decent. The storytelling method is a bit odd in that you have to constantly jump between memory fragments rather than following a single chain of events up to an end or story block like in previous games. The character animations are stiff and janky, there are a lot of blood and gore scenes that appear to be just for shock factor, the game is overall very short to 100%, and[spoiler]the ending is ambiguous and not set in stone[/spoiler]. It's worth playing if you haven't experienced the finale in the series, but you should probably buy it on sale. \n\n[h1]GENRE:[/h1]\nVisual novel, puzzle, sci-fi story follows the events of previous two games in the series\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\nThe game plays out as a visual novel where you, the \"observer\" of the story, pick fragments of story to play through that are often not connected chronologically. Within these fragments, you play as the protagonist of one of three groups in a specific part of the map where you are trapped in. You get a bunch of exposition before you are faced with some kind of puzzle room that you need to complete in order to escape. Puzzle rooms usually have a gimmick where something needs to be unlocked via a series of actions in the room related to objects contained within the space and specific interactions between them.\n\nAt the end of these puzzle rooms, you have to make a choice between two or more different outcomes and whatever choice you pick unlocks new story fragments that follow those choices chronologically in the same time line. In order to \"finish\" the game, you have to reach the \"True ending\" by viewing and playing through all the critical story fragments and unlocking certain character actions. \n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\nThe visual novel and user interface elements are presented pretty well. The text in dialogue and in menus is legible and navigating between different interfaces like your inventory, the timeline map, and additional resources is intuitive. The visual display leaves something to be desired, though. The game takes place deep underground in a bomb shelter so most of the environments aren't exactly gorgeous sceneries. The character models aren't great mostly because the way everyone is animated is so stiff compared to the presentation using 3D models seen in the previous game, VLR. Also, you can expect lots of bloody scenes in the game and oftentimes bodies are being dismembered so just be aware if you have a weak stomach. \n\n[h1]STORY:[/h1]\nZTD's story follows the events that occur in VLR, Virtue's Last Reward, and that game establishes so much of the story that there is not enough room to fit that in this review. Basically, finish 999 & VLR and understand that story before diving into ZTD. \n\nThe events of ZTD take place chronologically a few years after 999. A group of 9 people have signed up for to take part in an experiment to simulate an environment where they are all stuck together in a base on Mars. Unbeknownst to them, the experiment becomes something completely different when wake up in prison cells and meet a masked man who introduces himself as Zero. After failing an encounter by luck, he forces all 9 people to play a game called \"The Decision Game\", where the only way to win is if 6 of those people die. The fates of the 9 people, and basically the fate of humanity, rests with whatever happens in Zero's game.\n\n[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]\n\u2022Zero Escape games are popular for their puzzles. 999 had some pretty straightforward but decent puzzles, while VLR cranked it up to 100 in the difficulty of some of their locked rooms. ZTD takes it down back to less difficult, but not clearly obvious puzzles. It is always fun to try to figure out the correlation between the various objects lying around the locked rooms and how using them on each other interact to guide you toward the solutions. \n\n\u2022To its credit, most of the events that occur in ZTD do explain various story gaps that were left at the conclusion of VLR. If you have played the previous games, you will probably be satisfied that most of the burning questions you have are probably answered here.\n\n\u2022Most of the characters are great. Some are reccuring from the previous games, like Junpei, Akane, Phi, and Sigma. The recurring characters are pretty consistent personality-wise with how they were in 999/VLR. \n\n[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]\n\u2022I already mentioned it but, ZTD's graphical presentation of the characters could've been improved. VLR's animations were vastly superior in that character expressions and animations were conveyed much, much better than in ZTD.\n\n\u2022Eric is an insufferable character. Sure, it makes sense why he acts the way he does because of what happened in his past, but he is still a d*ckhead like 80% of the time.\n\n\u2022The story feels way too short to complete and to get 100% in. VLR, the previous game, took a good upwards of 60 hours to complete blind and to reach the \"True ending\". I 100%ed ZTD in under 20 hours and overall wish the story was longer and a bit more more fleshed out.\n\n\u2022(Regarding the ending)[spoiler]This is one of those games where at the peak moment of a story's conclusion, the camera pans away and doesn't reveal what occurs. Personally, I am not a fan of these endings because for a game's story to be built up so dominantly over two whole games prior to this one, I wanted a more concrete and decisive conclusion of events. The ambiguous nature of this ending just adds to the mind-boggling time-jumping antics of the game where either Carlos did shoot Delta and prevented 6 billion people from dying from Radical-6, or he didn't shoot him and... who knows?[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]\n6/10\n\nZTD is an okay conclusion the Zero Escape series. The puzzles are cool, but not as difficult as the ones in VLR. Story gaps are explained for the series but I wanted more from the conclusion.\n\n[quote] Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t.

Putting an emphasis on crudely animated violence while taking away many of the puzzles as well as dumbing down many of the characters takes away a lot of the enjoyable aspects the series has. Characters are frustrating both in their writing and overall character designs. The designs are a significant downgrade from past entries, favoring more of a generic ever day look rather than the colorful displays of personality that have been used in the franchise in the past. The animations are laughably bad, especially considering the game was released on the same systems that VLR was, showing that it isn't just hardware restrictions. The game fell into many tropes and annoying twists that made it frustrating to play. It might be better to just make up your own ending for the events after VLR and pretend this entry does not exist.

It's definitely the weakest of the three games, but the parts of it that are good are very good. I've played through this one twice now (once on PS Vita and once through steam) and I will say that it is better on the second time through. \n\nThere are a few questionable writing choices made in ZTD, which I'll go through and give my takes on. There will be spoilers ahead, but I won't be spoiling anything major (in this game, the previous games are going to be spoiled heavily here).\n\nWriting Choice 1: Split the group into permanent teams instead of allowing the characters to form their own teams based on restraints (as in 999 and VLR).\nTake: This was a worse way to get to know the characters of ZTD. In 999 and VLR you needed to form your own teams for every escape room based on criteria (finding the digital root of the door through math and the bracelets in 999, or matching the colors with the bracelets in VLR), which was how you branched off into the various paths of the game. This worked really well because it forced characters into working together with people they might not have liked, and allowed for the player to avoid characters they were suspicious of. We don't ever really get to see how a lot of the characters might have interacted together directly. We get some inter-team interaction through the messages send via the dog, but I think it would have been really interesting to see how Eric and Mira (new characters to ZTD) would have interacted with Sigma, Phi, Akane and Junpei. \n\nWriting Choice 2: Changes to Junpei's Character\nTake: I think this might be a hot take, but I actually liked Junpei becoming a much darker, jaded person in this one. While 999's Junpei is a much more likeable character, I think him becoming a jaded asshole is more realistic at this point in the story. Akane using him for her own survival and then running away without a word can do that to a person, and I see the Jaded Junpei as a logical middlepoint in his progression into becoming someone like Tenmyouji. It at least makes sense, I've known people who've become jaded over less than what Junpei has gone through. \n\nWriting Choice 3: Q Team sucks\nTake: There isn't a single person who is likeable on Q Team. I'm kind of torn on whether this is bad writing, or very good writing, at least on Eric's part. I get Eric. Not as in I'm a hopeless Simp with nothing to live for outside of chasing someone who is bad for me, but he is and it makes sense. I've seen people like him before, and while he is a total shithead, his backstory works well and he feels like a real person. I think he is supposed to reflect what Junpei might have been like had he accepted Akane's willingness to use him as an instrument instead of becoming a difficult asshole, but that might be me reading too much into this. Mira and Q on the other hand do not feel like real people. Mira feels as if she exists to just do all of the evil things that Zero is unable to do himself. Her motivations are pretty boring (feels like something I might have read about on myspace 15 years ago). She basically serves 2 roles, to do bad things and to act as a foil for Eric and indirectly for Akane. Q is boring, but I can't explain why he's boring without spoiling the true ending.\n\nWriting Choice 4: Sigma didn't change much\nTake: The Sigma in ZTD isn't the Sigma we played as in VLR. He is a decades older version of himself from an alternate future, yet he feels very similar to his 22 yearold self from the previous game, although maybe a little less jokey. I was really hoping for a Sigma who felt like an entirely different person, because he is literally 40 years older now than he was before. Interestingly enough, we have 2 former Zeros acting as participants in this Nonary Game, yet they hardly bring any information related to their experience creating Nonary Games. That's super weird. I really wish we got to see a bit more change in how Sigma acts for this one. Akane too, but a lot less time has passed for her so its less disappointing. \n\nWriting Choice 5: Using new characters as player characters\nTake: We play through ZTD as three new characters, Carlos (Arguably the real protagonist), Diana, and Q. This works really well with Carlos and Diana, who work in teams with Akane/Junpei and Sigma/Phi respectively. As I mentioned earlier, it doesn't really work that well with Q, but working 2/3's of the time is still more than half the time so it isn't the end of the world. This was probably a necessity as playing as previously known characters would have taken some of the mystery out of the plot, but in doing so we have lost the mystery of most of the characters. One of the best things about 999 and VLR was slowly learning new things about the characters you were playing the Nonary Game with. In this cast, we have already met 4/9 of the cast. 3/5 of the remaining cast are POV characters who we learn about directly from themselves, meaning the only characters we get to explore outside of POV are Mira and Eric, of whom Eric is the only well well written character. I think the best way to go about a story with this cast would have been to only have 1 POV character (either Carlos or Diana) and have the teams a bit less set in stone, allowing for whoever the POV character would have been to explore the others (plus Mira and Eric) with the player. \n\nOverall ZTD did a lot of questionable things with the story, but the true ending is a good one that is satisfying but leaves enough for another game. If this is the last it functions fine as the finale, but doesn't guarantee no further sequels. The new characters are very hit or miss, but when they work they work well. The puzzles are a little unreasonable from time to time, but they have always been in Zero Escape, so that isn't anything new.

The puzzle-based gameplay has always been clunky, character dialogue has always been awkward, and the world is built entirely on a bizarre pseudoscientific foundation. Despite that, the series has managed to tell a truly engaging story that uses the format and structure of a visual novel to subvert the player's expectations at every turn. Zero Time Dilemma makes a half-hearted attempt at resolving some of the series' issues, but it can't quite stick the landing.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the biggest departure Zero Time Dilemma makes from VLR and 999: the visuals. Rather than a traditional VN perspective, ZTD makes use of fully animated and voiced cutscenes. The character models look great, but the animation is awkward and the lip sync is downright abysmal. I can't deny that actually SEEING the characters move around in more intense situations adds a lot to the experience, but the unskippable nature of the cutscenes also slows the pace of gameplay down to a crawl - there's no way to skip dialogue, and chances are good that the player will finish reading the subtitles long before the characters finish speaking. All in all, I'm okay with this change, but it made for some pretty frustrating moments especially during exposition-heavy scenes.\n\nThe second major departure ZTD makes is in its structure. Without going too deep into the overarching narrative, this game breaks away from the standard set by 999 and VLR by splitting the characters up into three smaller groups. These groups never change and rarely interact, and as a result there are far fewer interesting character dynamics to explore. This ends up working in favor of the story, but if you don't like a particular person or group, you'll be forced to engage with them for quite a long time whether you like it or not.\n\nOn a positive note, puzzles have received a major facelift and (to my surprise) ended up being the best part of the game. Gone are the horrendous inventory management of 999 and the endless reams of numerical charts and coded files of VLR. ZTD's puzzle rooms are lean, challenging, and thematically appropriate. I have no complaints here.\n\nFinally, a few words about the story: to put it bluntly, it sucks. I loved the world and characters established by the previous games in the series and I was anxious to see how ZTD would wrap things up. Unfortunately, it drops the ball at nearly every turn. The plot feels rushed and unpolished relative to the previous games, and the player is hammered with \"twists\" that feel more cheap than clever. I don't want to say too much for spoilers' sake, but this is the first time I've ever seen a series finale retroactively create plot holes in previous entries.\n\nI'm going to mark ZTD as recommended because there are a few genuinely exciting aspects of the game.

I enjoyed Zero Time Dilemma quite a bit. Was it Virtue's Last Reward or 999? No, not at all. But was it an enjoyable experience? Absolutely. The plot is good, and the characters? Just as interesting as they were in the past games. It really manages to tie in the backstories of so many of the characters together, into a nicely woven tapestry of murder and emotional distress. The writing was good, and there were so many points where the game sent me into a panic over the events that were occurring. C-Team is insanely lovable and has a wonderful dynamic, Q-Team... exists, I suppose, but they're still nice, and D-Team has one of the most emotionally investable backstories in the Zero Escape Franchise. The voice acting was really well done, the puzzle rooms were fun, and, for the most part, the animation was nice. Sure, it was a bit choppy, but as I once saw someone refer to it, 'its hard to keep your eyes open' during some of the more brutal cutscenes. If you're not a fan of watching people get hurt? Might wanna close your eyes and mute your volume, cause there's a lot of murder. Unlike in Virtue's Last Reward, you *Need* to get bad endings to continue. In fact, that's the best advice I could give a new player- get every single bad ending, no matter how much it hurts to get one, and no matter how useless you think it might be. \nMy (and most people's) major gripe with the game would be the massive info dump of exposition at the last moment, and how the main antagonist's motives aren't explored too much, but even then, they're still an interesting character. Another one? Nitpicky, sure, but frequently, the lip-syncing of the dialogue doesn't match up, which isn't a huge deal but it's still a little bit irritating.\nI'd give Zero Time Dilemma an 7.8/10, personally. A good game overall. Maybe not the best ending for the Zero Escape franchise, but definitely a good addition to it. If you like Phi, Sigma, Junpei, or Akane?

There are some elements- the ones that really pack a punch, which are foreshadowed appropriately from the beginning, have good support and satisfying payoffs, but then there's also a fair share of random ones which seem a bit poorly shunted into the plot last minute. If the game was paced in a more \"standard\" way, this would probably not be the case. It'd be interesting to see a sort of \"director's cut\" or re-done edition of this game that follows a consistent storyline, and I definitely think the game could have been executed on a lot better.\n\nThat being said, just strap yourself in and enjoy it. The game's fun, play it with some friends so you can holler about whether you're gonna push that big red button, or you can all go ape mode when some crazy shit happens.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1605918320, "timestamp_updated": 1605918320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79577580": {"recommendationid": "79577580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123881581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2800, "last_played": 1605914504}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty trippy story, but was super fun.

However, this is just my gut reaction and my personal opinion, so this is all subject to change.\n\nAlso, quick disclaimer: this game, while technically playable on its own, is LEAGUES better and more coherent after playing Zero Escape: The Nonary Games (which you can also get on Steam!). Unlike this game, I can undoubtedly recommend it to just about anyone who likes fantastic storytelling. So go play that first because, regardless of what I say here, you shouldn't play this game until you play The Nonary Games. Cool? Cool.\n\nFirst, the good. I think the cinematic style actually provides a lot of benefits to the story as a whole over the traditional VN format. It lets the game communicate its more outlandish situations clearly, it lets the expressions of characters (somewhat) give insight into what they're thinking, and it significantly aids the pacing of the game, since it never has to stop to give narration and can substitute it with camera angles and sound effects.\n\nThe puzzles are still quite good. The free-camera makes exploration way less janky than in VLR (part of me would've preferred 999's approach still, but this works solidly). I did still have the same problem that I did with the other two games, namely that I often spend ages trying to solve a puzzle because I forgot to check some drawer with the solution inside it (although that's likely just a \"me\" problem), but they have some clever moments and serve their purpose by stopping the game from becoming stale. Without them, it'd just be a 16-hour movie, and I think that would be hard to sit through. Although there are some dumb moments: I had to smash every item in my inventory with every item in the room to find that iodine solution goes on the potatoes (like, yeah it does in real life, but there was basically no clue pointing me to that without me just knowing that that's a thing. Also, yes that's where it goes, you'll thank me if you get there).\n\nThe decisions and scenarios in this game are really enjoyable. They have so, SO much more variety than VLR's or even 999's: the fact that it makes \"do you inject yourself with a dangerous serum\" a genuinely difficult choice to make speaks to its ability to weave these together. Much like in the other games, the characters will actually analyse the choices they're presented with, which makes them feel more real and fleshed out. One thing I love is how they're presented: some are a simple \"pick A or B\", but others get you to type stuff out or put you under a timer, with these all adding to the moments and providing more insight into the situation at hand (except the final ending keyboard, because the ending ruins everything, I guess: the fact that I had to guess the twist really isn't like these games, which normally make their twists engaging by proving just how little I knew about them).\n\nI actually didn't find the story and fragment system especially confusing here, at least not until the end (and I'll get to that). As a matter of fact, it was less confusing for me than VLR, because it's designed around said system. The start of a fragment will normally give you the current time and casualties, meaning you can piece together where in the timeline it fits before it gets put on the global time chart and confirms your suspicions (or not, meaning you'll be able to figure out why it goes there, or be excited when you stumble upon the fragment that precedes another you found earlier, where you learn WHY those events happened). Plus, the variety of scenarios in the game meant that, if I got told the casualties, then I could normally pin it to a certain scenario and its relevant info if I'd already seen it, whereas VLR just told me to remember what happens down a certain path with close to zero prompting when it'd been days since I'd touched it. Finally, it doesn't give you any major ending fragments, meaning that you can't spoil yourself on anything early, so all it really does it get you into the mindset of the characters, who are trying to figure out where they are just like you.\n\nAlright, now for the bad. The elephant in the room must be addressed: this game looks pretty rough. The models and environments are alright, but the animation is just atrocious. I get it's a quantity/quality thing, but they should have realised going in that animating such a large game with a non-AAA team would not have been the best idea. As it stands, while it does sufficiently communicate the characters' emotions, it isn't fun to look at. It's something I got used to dealing with, though.\n\nThe \"true\" ending is a bumpy ride. It isn't completely unlike anything from the rest of the games in the series, since some twists are well set up. However, it doesn't really go anywhere and doesn't really relate to any of the hours of content and decisions you just went through: I even had to look up one of the answers to one of the final questions, and even when I had the answer it still didn't make much sense in the moment (for anyone whose already played the game, I'm referring to [spoiler]the true identity of Zero[/spoiler], and I did later see how it made sense, it's just annoying to try to go back and figure out). The game then throws in a bunch of plot elements which, while foreshadowed, don't go anywhere, robs you of the last meaningful choice it could give you (again, SPOILERS but it was [spoiler]whether to shoot Zero or not, which considering the game's emphasis of choice, was weird to just leave hanging[/spoiler]) and then just ends unceremoniously. I was just sitting there, waiting for an end-credits scene because there HAD to be one, and there... sort of was? Some \"post-payoff\" cinema files get added after the credits, but I didn't find them until ages after the ending because it doesn't tell you they're there. These actually do quite a good job of closing the ending out, and significantly improve my opinion of it, but it's baffling that they're not signalled to you.\n\nIf you're curious why I didn't like the big end twist, here's why (and massive spoilers, obviously): [spoiler]it feels so utterly contrived. With most of the other twists, they're built on some assumption that both the player and some of the characters share, which is then shattered: the reveal that the wards were all the same is one such twist, and I like that one. However, the thing that annoys me about this ending is not that \"Delta is Zero\", that's fine. It's that \"Delta was here the whole time, he was just offcamera.\" It's something everyone except the player knew for no reason. It is technically foreshadowed, but when it happens it's just confusing, because it's foreshadowing you're not supposed to pick up on because it ruins the twist. And if Eric used slightly different wording or called \"Q\" Sean, the jig would be up.[/spoiler]\n\nHaving mused on it, I like this game now. It's got probably the best scenarios in the entire series, some great puzzles and some fun character moments: even the characters who became worse people had realistic and sympathetic reasons for doing so, and I like every character in the game (some I find entertaining even if they aren't good people, which is pretty impressive honestly). But it also has the worst ending in the series: it isn't a slam dunk like 999 or VLR, but still irons out eventually, and the visual style has taken an even further dip from VLR. I still think it's worth a shot though for its better moments.

This is the third game in a trilogy, and the story is the most important thing about it. Spoilers will ruin it for you. Do not read anything about the game, get the heck out of here, and don't look back until you've gotten the true endings on the aforementioned games. On Steam, 999 and VLR are bundled together as one purchase under \"The Nonary Games.\"\n\nAlright, so continuing now, ZTD has a very interesting storyline and is more in line with VLR than 999 in terms of how it handles the branching paths through the story. However, it can take a little while to get used to the new user interface, and it can be a bit confusing at times. In fact, much of the game, I had no idea where I was starting in the timeline for each path for the team I was playing as. That said, the story was still pretty awesome. Finding out who Zero was wasn't as fun as it was for me in the first two games, but it was fun having four returning 999 and VLR characters! Although they are hard to recognize in the weird new art style, two characters from 999 and two characters from VLR make an enjoyable return. I won't say who they are, though, as it's more fun to gasp as you hear their names in-game and realize who is back.\n\nOn the topic of characters, I actually felt like most of the women really could have used more story moments. The lead character you play as on D-Team was only likable for me in like...3 or 4 scenes out of a 20+ hour game filled with scenes. We needed to learn more about her before her best scenes, but didn't. Most of the game, she felt like one of the lesser Telltale's The Walking Dead characters making dumb worried faces and bad decisions, but lacking any real character depth. The character depth is there, but you won't find it until you should have already cared about her, in my opinion.\n\nThe female character on C-Team had a secret that the leader - Carlos - REALLY should have heard for the sake of some interesting dialog. I won't say what for sake of spoilers. When you hear the woman's name as she's introduced, you'll probably almost immediately think to yourself \"Wow, what if Carlos finds out what she did a year ago?! That could be a really interesting and intense scene.\" Instead, it never comes up. Sure, it was smart not of the people \"in the know\" to keep it a secret, but it should have been revealed for sake of drama and tension/mistrust.\n\nI won't say what, but there was one storyline in this game that had me absolutely crying bittersweet tears as it was simply brilliant and wrecked me emotionally. There were a few other fun moments, but wow, the ONE plot thread just destroyed me for a while today.\n\nThe gal on Q-Team, named \"Mira,\" is very interesting...but only for maybe an hour and a half or so. After that, the game has kinda given away all her secrets and nothing else ever really comes up about that, nor is any of it ever really resolved. After you complete the game, there are some \"epilogue files\" in-game that you can read that give you a little bit more information to leave you with (hopefully) less questions than you started with and some level of satisfaction/closure on Mira. She was really getting interesting, but then everything just sort of tapers off and she isn't important anymore.\n\nIf you're skimming reviews, you will see the name \"Eric\" pop up. Eric sucks. Eric is just the worst. He has a couple of good background bits, but oh my word he is pretty despicable in almost everything he says and almost everything he does. He's written alright, and I thought that people were exaggerating about hating Eric and that he wouldn't be that bad, but he's just awful. He didn't ruin the game for me or anything, but that guy was difficult to put up with sometimes.\n\nThe voice acting in this game was good, the overall plot was pretty cool, and the puzzles were my favorite in the series. I didn't have to go through the same puzzle room multiple times (*stares daggers at 999*), and the puzzles usually weren't too convoluted (*stares flaming daggers at VLR's pantry*). I used a walkthrough a handful of times, but if I did, it was generally no more than once in any given puzzle room.\n\nOverall, I had a nice time with ZTD. It was a decent conclusion to the Zero Escape series and the 3D animations helped to convey the scenes well. I think they could have done better with the expressions at times, and I certainly had nothing against the 2D stylings of 999 and would have enjoyed 2D with crisp animations just as well. The game concludes without everything feeling resolved and there are supposedly no plans for sequels, so that's a bit of a bummer. I really wish they had brought everything to complete closure with this game, though, because at this point, even if they did make a fourth entry into the Zero Escape series, the science fiction elements have gotten so convoluted and so much stuff is going on that it would be - in my opinion - excessive to go on further. So this was a case where I feel like they should have \"quit while they were ahead\" and just written the story to have an ending that has more resolution than we get here.\n\nTo be fair, though, after how much I loved VLR (except for the puzzles that stomped me), it was going to be difficult to leave me as satisfied with a sequel after it, but I think that the satisfaction of more closure for the characters and the setting might have gone a long way to leave me feeling great about the game. As it stands, it left me feeling a little empty inside. I must say, though, that after having played this series, the Danganronpa trilogy, and the Phoenix Wright trilogy on Steam, I'm really liking stuff in this sort of genre and will be keeping my eyes out for more of its ilk.\n\nSeriously, though, screw Eric.", "timestamp_created": 1603341131, "timestamp_updated": 1603341258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77895514": {"recommendationid": "77895514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081961597", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2259, "last_played": 1603230388}, "language": "english", "review": "Life is simply unfair.", "timestamp_created": 1603238129, "timestamp_updated": 1603238129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77784611": {"recommendationid": "77784611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343904219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1367, "last_played": 1603058231}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al principio la animaci\u00f3n del juego y el avance inicial desconcierta un poco (Cosa que no me paso con el primer juego de la saga).

It completes the circle on this over-the-top engaging and amazing storytelling. While the two previous installments had different art style in each but were more on a basis of a visual novel, the third game provides us a dynamic and full view of the space and characters just like any other role-playing game would.\nIf you aren't aware of the game style, here's a basic rundown: with each decision that they ask you to make the story is different and new information is told (sometimes it's even for the better to have a pen and paper on your side to take notes of some extremely important things). This information will help you further along on the story development and give you some guidance amidst the confusion that sets in everytime a new storyline is shown.

I had purchased this game alongside the Zero Escape collection containing the first two games. I absolutely adored its predecessor VLR and while that game wasn't perfect, the way they executed its concepts and story were phenomenal. I installed this game and played for less than an hour before being so turned off I had to stop playing. I came back two years later, and here we are.\n\nIf you enjoyed VLR and are willing to go through a bad game just to find a proper conclusion to the end of VLR's plot (the reason I stuck through this game), do not bother. The answer is in no way satisfying and has some contradictions that are so glaring it destroys the whole point of this entire game existing. If you have other motivations to play, don't believe me, or love seeing models clip and clop more than a race horse then by all means try this game out.\n\nThere is some good. The escape rooms were fairly easy but had some good puzzles, overall these were good and sit somewhere between 999's and VLR's. There were some legitimately good story moments, and there was a section leading up to the end that piqued my interest and then kept it and got better as it went on. I cannot believe that achieving such a thing in one segment that lasted no more than 20 minutes is noteworthy but, I may as well mention it.\n\nPresentation is so bad, the models clip, specifically the hair most often. The characters with long hair have it so bad the hair often gyrates rapidly from being so confused. Keep in mind that in gameplay you do not manipulate the models, this is all in cutscenes. The devs knew exactly how these would look, and it is frankly unacceptable. I'm not someone who cares a ton about graphics, but this crosses the line and looks ridiculous and happens far far too often. \n\nThe characters have almost no expression and they keep static expressions as they talk through moments that have actual emotion intended that just doesn't come through. The characters never change expression on camera, they barely move on camera most of the time, if there needs to be any change in pose or facial expression there must be a new camera angle or, worst of all, a jarring cut to the ceiling while sound effects play to INDICATE what action is occurring. Passing out? Cut to the ceiling. Entering or exiting a room? Cut to the ceiling. I hope you  like looking at the ceiling. In one scene, a character is punched and when they hit against the all, they crumple to the ground and this blew my mind. This animation was nothing special, but when I saw that my first reaction was \"wait so you DO know how to animate a character falling to the ground\". Without spoiling too much, the base premise of the game centers around all the characters waking up and falling back asleep through injections in their watches, so they pass out constantly, yet this wasn't important enough to be given animation?\n\nAnd i won't get into the story for spoiler purposes just know that, while some moments are good, the game's biggest twists are just... bad. So much of this game is bad, the writing sometimes is just off, the story beats are never GREAT. Sometimes good but rarely great and often bad or terrible. One ending in particular upset me so much because of how important and STUPIDLY it was handled.\n\nStrongly do not recommend. There's some good in this but there's too much wrong and the good isn't so good that it outshines the rest. What's good in this game about its story and situations is never better than the good of the first two games, which also got the rest of the stuff mostly right.", "timestamp_created": 1601319642, "timestamp_updated": 1601319642, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740679085254669189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76682254": {"recommendationid": "76682254", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960340571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2455, "last_played": 1601156911}, "language": "english", "review": "Spoilers ahead, reader beware!\n\nI suppose after finishing it twice, I have a bit of a better idea about how I want to 'rate' this game. As a fan of the first 2 games (999 and VLR) and after re-playing those 2 as well, I thought this would be nice to give a re-play as well.\n\nBut this game is... Ehm... Not as good as it's predecessors. \n\nThe premise is the same; people are stuck inside a facility where they have to do escaperoom-esque kinds of puzzles. Most of the music is the same, some of the sounds are the same and even improved. The voice cast is (as far as I could tell) the same and even some of the puzzles are similar.\nBut Unlike the previous game(s), the 3 teams are pre-set and those people are stuck with eachother from the get go and through mostly (about 80%) of the game afterwards... And it's rather heavy, depressing and dare I say... Unrewarding.\n\nThe start of the game throws you into what you could expect for the rest of the game. You make a choice with all 3 teams and the result is that 1 of the teams dies as a result. Why? Because 6 people need to die in order for the X door to open and if you chose the 'good way out' you can't progress the game.\nFrom there, the game 'begins'. The surviving team(s) find themselves in a puzzle room and need to find their way out... If they can. This is where it gets a little confusing, as you can choose between the 3 teams' perspective whenever you can and not 'every' choice you made earlier is logically carried over.  Most of these stories overlap, but that's only clear near the end, so before that, there's a lot of confusion going on.\n\nSo the first puzzle room is completed with only 2 people currently present. During the puzzle, you find limbs from someone's corpse and while the player starts putting 1 and 1 together, the characters act like it's a little creepy. At the end of the puzzle, the corpse belongs to one of their members and the girlfriend does a fake-out. Then after the fake-out, she goes nutzo and attacks the other member of the team. Now the player has 2 options, to defend themselves or to give in to the questioning madness. The end result: another one dies. Later, ofcourse, you find out _why_ that all happened.\n\nThe second puzzle, with another team, has you search a room full of antiques, only to result in a standoff between the 3 characters. They have a crossbow, pistol and grenade launcher. I'm not sure that the devs know what a grenade launcher can do, but if you may believe this game, it's a pretty safe weapon. I digress. The end result is: 1 of the 3 dies. There's an 'epilogue' where 1 of the characters goes nutzo and the other one can go bonkers.\n\nThe third and the last team, they need to make a choice, either pull the trigger or don't. The end result? You guessed it, another death. But why stop there? Why not make it so that 2, ahhhh 3, get randomly killed out of nowhere? \nAre we starting to see a pattern now?\n\nAlmost(!) every one of these rooms has some sort of ultimatum. Yes, it's explained at the end for what reason this was 'needed' but as a player, I became numb to it. There was so much 'shock value' and 'needless deaths' that I stopped caring about the characters. And the characters are actually what made this game 'good' in my first playthrough and 'quite obnoxious' in the second one. \n\nThe characters are a bunch of returning characters from the 999 and VLR games as well as a couple of completely new ones. However... Do some of them act and behave like total monkeys or aliens sometimes. The returning characters are... Doofusses, especially Akane (I already warned about spoilers beforehand). She takes actions that she would never do in both the prequels and I'm not just talking about her randomly going berserk. In one of the endings, she even 'knew' that this would happen, so why is she this dislocated?\nThe same goes with Phi, normally calm and calculated... Near the end, she takes such a huge risk that she nearly blew everything they had worked on. Why? Then there's Eriku, good god, why people think he's 'relatable' is beyond me. There are arguments to be had that he's already had his mind broken, which only excuses his stupidity for about 5 minutes. In the whole timeline where he meets Diana, Sigma and Carlos, he's not human at all.\n\nSo what's happening is, more or less, what the previous 2 games have hinted about. The morphogenic field or SHIFT and whatnot. Transfer consciousness between time and space, but then on a grand scale. All of the puzzles are connected in some variety of way the eventually lead up to several endings. One of the endings leads to the start of VLR, which, I'll admit, was really damn well done. The rest was... Hmmm, I'd compare it to Chaos;Child.\nThe 'villain' is probably the most annoying  thing about this whole game. First of all, he talks too much, whereas in the previous games, things could be found out by the player instead. Then he talks some more and when you finally meet him... He has superpowers. Namely, the ones where he knows what the contestants are thinking AND can mindcontrol them. His background story is supposed to be tragic, but it felt closer to being... Over the top and unnecessary. \n\nAnd that's what this game sort of sums up to in the end. It was needlessly over the top with its deaths, endless talking, barely likable characters and an ending to a plot that felt really underwhelming. \n\nIt's an unsatisfying ending to a trilogy that was otherwise pretty good. I dare even say that this game made the prequels 'void' because of this plot. One could also argue that's to 'conclude' all those games, but... Eh, it doesn't feel like it deserved that deep of a thought. \nIt's a garbled mess with a lot of good ideas here and there, then very sloppy execution. I know that a 3rd game wasn't really planned and that there were some issues creating it and it can definitely be found back in the game.\n\nI haven't even talked about the graphics and the animation, because those 2, I feel, can be overlooked. They're definitely not great by any stretch, but as a visual novel'esque style of game? Fine enough.\n\nSo why am I recommending it anyway? Hm, because the previous 2 games are great / super good. Sure, there were a lot of things missing / breaking / bugging me about those as well, but at least the story was engaging, interesting and energising. They didn't kill off every character that they could find after someone acted like a neanderthal... And because this game offers some pretty good disclosure on at least 1 of those storylines. Or, should I say, serves as a prequel to those. \nSome of the stories were really intriguing.\nThe puzzle rooms were hit and miss, mostly average as there's nothing interesting there. Some were too short, some were nonsensical and others were just fun enough. \nThe last reason I can think of is because there isn't a 'meh' option. \n\nI suppose it has more to do with that I _wanted_ to like it, rather than really like it. It's 'okay' entertainment for a while and I like that there is a nod to the previous games...

So much of what I loved about 999 gets thrown out of the window. The best part about zero escape was without a doubt the escape rooms. There is simply nothing like exploring a room finding objects and racking your brain to solve the puzzle; ZTD was no different in that regard. What I hated the most in VLR was navigating the rooms with the mouse, sometimes when I clicked on the wall or a massive object the characters would begin explaining it when I merely wanted to change the camera. I had absolutely no issue navigating in ZTD. However one thing that I loved about VLR was the gold files you could collect. Every puzzle had two solutions at the end which made clearing them just fun, it made me think in ways I hadn't before. This is replaced with a decision game.\n\nDecision Games are the new gimmick. At various points during the story the characters are forced between two options, clicking one determines which route the story follows similar to the AB games in VLR. But I felt as though there were too many of these games even worse they never felt fun. these \"games\" always seem to end in character deaths or simply end the current section; to which I would simply restart the decision just to see the bad end.\n\nThere are numerous bad ends in this game, too much. It made it impossible to stay attached to the characters. It got to the point where I just stopped caring about them all together. Worst yet, I just ended up laughing at the death scenes just because of how ridiculous they were. In every other game, death meant something it comes out of nowhere emotionally impacting the player, not in this game. Characters die over and over, after every decision game there was a death, heck just to see the entire game you had to make sure to kill off the cast at least once during the second decision (this really frustrated me, as I was literally stuck with nowhere to progress because I didn't think to execute every team, the game never tells you this heck I got every scene meaning I picked both options and still got stuck.)\n\nA big gripe that I had was that the characters just never seemed interesting. Everyone was just bland or annoying. Even the returning characters just felt off. Junpei for example is not the same character from 999. He just feels downgraded to a cynical sometimes meanspirited individual nothing like the character from the first game. Even Akane annoyed the heck out of me with some of her actions just feeling completly out of character.\n\nI honestly wished the game was more linear.

There's literally nothing good about it and I say it as a fan of the first two - this one is just a disappointment and a waste of your money.\n- The graphics are TERRIBLE. The 3d models are seriously only good for one thing and it's to laugh at them and their convulsions as they try to convey deep emotions and suffering but only make you suffer instead.\n- The characters are incredibly effing boring, especially the new ones. There's nothing deep or interesting about them that would make you care about their fates, the fact that they die over and over again doesn't help. You just get used to everyone dying all the time so you couldn't care less when they die again - not a good thing for a game. The old characters are just shadows of their former selfs, they're so much worse; Akane is even more infuriating (I didn't know it was even possible), Junpei has lost all of his brain cells and character consistency and Sigma is neither the hilarious himbo that I've come to love nor the serious work-obsessed scientist that Kyle described in VLR. Phi is tolerable, I guess, but she's dead for the most parts of the game somehow. I don't remember much of her.\n- The story is literally nonexistent. This random cutscenes system messes with the story continuity a lot, and I mean A LOT. There's no plot to the game until you get to the endings and you spoil yourself stuff all the time by playing scenes out of order. Not fun.\n- The puzzles are so dumb sometimes. The fuck kinda question in a video game requires you to answer 'I don't know'?????????????? pleaseeeeeee end my sufferingggg\n- All the stuff that was promised by Uchikoshi in interviews - info on Light and Aoi's fates, Kyle and more that he said would be in this game? Not present. Don't even bother looking. Which is such a huge shame because this game could've explored them deeper (esp Kyle) but instead chose to create new characters with no personality whatsoever.\n- Whew boy, don't even get me STARTED on those plot twists. I felt genuinely offended by how stupid the writers thought I was. These twists are partly disturbing and partly idiotic, they wouldn't work in any logical universe. The plot holes are so enormous that you can see the writers laughing at you through them. \nTruly, it's fascinating how this game manages to be an actual abomination in every single way possible. I'm honestly SO angry at it, because I paid money for it and I really wanted it to be as good as the first two. And it had SO much potential. It easily could have been incredible - make it a visual novel with traditional 2D art, get rid of the random cutscene system, change Sigma and Junpei's characters to be more consistent with previous games, throw the fucking [spoiler]twins plot twist and Delta reveal[/spoiler] in the trash, bring back Kyle, Aoi and Light to develop their characters and BOOM you got yourself another banger. Sadly, this game preferred to focus on being horrible. Really, it belongs in the garbage. Please do yourself a favour and don't buy ZTD.

These arguments are not something the player has control over, you basically have to listen to Uchikoshi argue with himself and then you get to solve a puzzle in between chapters.\n\nIt's boring and frankly embarrassing, like watching two stoners argue about whether they both see the same thing when they look at  the color blue, dude?! Or listening to two nerds argue about how fast the Millennium Falcon can go. Imagine a videogame story devoted not to Batman fighting Superman, but to some characters DEBATING WHETHER BATMAN OR SUPERMAN IS STRONGER for the entire 12 hour playtime.\n\nThis game's discussions of theory are based on a misunderstanding of simple probability, which is embarrassing, and also relies on misrepresentation of multiple mental illnesses that are either incredibly uneducated, or incredibly offensive.\n\nIf dense pseudoscientific dialogue translated from another language is your jam, then this game is for you.

I'm sad that I ended up buying the bundle, my hope is that the other 2 games aren't as bad (that's if I even feel like playing them after this).", "timestamp_created": 1598228361, "timestamp_updated": 1598228361, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469696968793869019", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74796026": {"recommendationid": "74796026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003861149", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2191, "last_played": 1598207281}, "language": "english", "review": "Life is simply unfair", "timestamp_created": 1598207410, "timestamp_updated": 1598207410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74753334": {"recommendationid": "74753334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069857910", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1171, "last_played": 1597618192}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1598143351, "timestamp_updated": 1598143351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74716331": {"recommendationid": "74716331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065647499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1722, "last_played": 1598093086}, "language": "english", "review": "This ends the story of the nonary game ... games ... and it is by far not as boring an repetetive as the second one.

This game however is really good in its voice acting and how it presents the story. The voice acting in the scenes adds a ton to the experience of the cinematic scenes, there were pretty much no moments where I disliked the voice acting and many moments I can probably rewatch to see the scenes again. The way they present the story is changed from the other two games, instead of a clear beginning middle end they change up the way scenes are presented with the use of fragments of the story that overall come together later. The story was enjoyable however some parts felt rushed. Overall this game is excellent, however I think it is worse than the other two.

Por lo que es altamente recomendable jugar los juegos anteriores en el orden correcto (999>VLR>ZTD). Esta trilog\u00eda de juegos consiste en que 9 jugadores, por diversos motivos, quedan atrapados en un lugar y deben resolver acertijos y evitar morir en el intento. \n\nGr\u00e1ficos: A diferencia de los dos juegos anteriores, no es una novela visual, sino que los creadores optaron por animar las escenas, con resultados mixtos. Los modelos en s\u00ed no est\u00e1n mal pero la animaci\u00f3n es un tanto deficiente, el movimiento de labios no est\u00e1 tan bien sincronizado (m\u00e1s notorio en el doblaje al ingl\u00e9s, recomiendo por ello jugar con idioma japon\u00e9s) y la animaci\u00f3n es un tanto tosca. Los fondos en cambio son bastante detallados. \n\nSonido: El OST es b\u00e1sicamente remixes de juegos anteriores y las voces (al menos del doblaje japon\u00e9s, que es el que jugu\u00e9) son bastante buenas. No hay mucho que decir ac\u00e1.\n\nGameplay: A diferencia de 999, que se basaba en la raiz digital (suma de d\u00edgitos de un n\u00famero) y VLR, que se basaba en el \"Dilema del Prisionero\", ZTD se basa en \"Decisiones\" y como \u00e9stas te afectan no s\u00f3lo a t\u00ed sino a los otros equipos. Los puzzles tienen una dificultad intermedia, sin ser tan obvios como en 999 ni tan dif\u00edciles como en VLR y eran bastante ingeniosos en algunas ocasiones (hay uno en donde tienes que rotar las paredes de un cuarto, fue bastante innovador). De ah\u00ed si es un poco tedioso el hecho de tener que soplarte la escena animada (teniendo en cuenta la calidad de las animaciones) antes de progresar en la historia. \n\nPersonajes: Un punto un poco flaco son los personajes nuevos. De todos ellos, la \u00fanica que tuvo un poco m\u00e1s de desarrollo fue Diana y a pesar de sus defectos, sent\u00edas que era una persona real, no un personaje en dos dimensiones. Eric es bastante odioso, Carlos es algo plano y Mira, si bien ten\u00eda un concepto interesante, no se le desarrolla mucho. El ni\u00f1o es tambi\u00e9n bastante olvidable. Regresan personajes de juegos anteriores como Sigma, Phi, Akane y Junpei. Los dos primeros, bastante parecidos a como sal\u00edan en VLR (sobre todo Phi) pero es notorio el cambio en Akane y Junpei, as\u00ed que si los amaste en 999, puede que los odies aqu\u00ed. A mi personalmente me encant\u00f3 Junpei, pero muchos fans se quejaron sobre ellos dos. \"Zero\" me parece un buen antagonista, pero siento que le falt\u00f3 m\u00e1s profundidad y ten\u00edan para explotar m\u00e1s su historia.\n\nHistoria: busca parchar los huecos entre 999 y VLR pero en algunas ocasiones sientes que m\u00e1s te confunde que otra cosa. A ratos, parece que la \u00fanica ruta bien desarrollada es la de Diana y las dem\u00e1s est\u00e1n de relleno. Le\u00ed que el director s\u00f3lo estuvo involucrado en esta ruta, lo que puede explicar ello. El hecho de saltar entre diferentes puntos de vista tambi\u00e9n puede ser algo confuso, sobre todo si tienes flashbacks de eventos que no deber\u00edas conocer.

Filled with annoying new characters with terrible twists, it's best to just look up a plot summary if you like Zero Escape this much. \n\nAbandoning the first person perspective for a more abstract story involving 3 parties, ZTD somehow manages to fail at the fundamental level to remain interesting after the exciting climax to Virtue's Last Reward. Constantly switching perspectives after literal \"fragments,\" You wake with your team to the typical locked room puzzle with a new mechanic- \"decision time,\" a frantic scenario in which a the protagonist must choose to act in a certain way in the fragments conclusion. If you picked right, you find yourself losing consciousness with your squad as you fall to the ground, and await your next challenge. You might be able to guess how the characters get around this loss in memory...  Due to a lack of nuance in buildup to these portions of the game, the first half or so becomes quite redundant as you pick choice after choice, sitting through awfully shock-value consequences that prove to be mind-numbing after the first batch of fragments. The new cast of characters come off (and stay as mostly) as super bland- even the returning cast comes off as super uncharismatic. Many character arcs are rushed or, in the case of one, arguably completely unfinished, and developments in the story read as pure fanfiction honestly, I cannot believe some of these choices made it past the drawing board. It's absolutely, unequivocally, the worst story in the trilogy- probably the worst narrative out of the whole Spike Chunsoft catalogue (that i've played).\n\nVirtue's Last Reward, the adventure preceeding this one, is quite solid narratively, but is known for its... less than stellar presentation. Part of it is fault to the hardware of the 3DS, but it is generally somewhat unattractive to the eye. Surprised as I was, this game's presentation may be even uglier? The character models look fine, but the actual animations themselves are ridiculously whiplash, actively ruining the potential sincerity any point in the game could have. It's a little funny at first- seeing the strange hand gestures Q makes or the or the awkward mechanical prowl of Gab, but it gets pretty unfunny around midgame. It's almost like watching an old random Garry's Mod movie on YouTube without any of the familiar frenzied energy- or any punchline really. At least like, 95% of the shots in this game feature this slowwww crawlllll across someones profile while they explain some mathematics/psychology/philosphy concept, with little charm any sort of execution. A surprising blow to this game's atmosphere was the very subpar voice acting this time around. 999 and VLR both had relatively strong dubs, but ZTD once again showcases its mediocrity with pretty poor performances all around. Carlos and Mira sound particularly dead, but I was super surprised to hear Phi sound really phoned in, especially after VLR. The music is pretty uninteresting too. mostly consisting of some tracks from older games with added drums. \n\nThe gameplay is the only part of ZTD that doesn't completely blow. Puzzles aren't difficult, but are somewhat stimulating depending on the room. My favorite is definitely the \"hammer\" room (I think you'll know when you get to it). While not annoying, \"Decision Time\" could have been expanded upon. A good chunk of the time it's glorified \"enter password\" or \"which option will not kill you\". Without elaborating, it's VERY SUSPECT in some portions of the game you do not decide on anything. \n\nPassable gameplay does not save ZTD from a rushed storyline with unsuccessful immersion and terrible plotpoints. Sadly, ZTD was made on a bit of a budget- with proper funding, this likely would have been a fine entry to the series, but its soaked in issues from every corner. Significant overhaul of many ideas/characters should have been accomplished for this game to soar. You are better off with the first two.\n\n3/10", "timestamp_created": 1596263257, "timestamp_updated": 1596263257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613426148891448975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73589707": {"recommendationid": "73589707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392788013", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1936, "last_played": 1596432912}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it", "timestamp_created": 1596253575, "timestamp_updated": 1596253575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73544835": {"recommendationid": "73544835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089111401", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1317, "last_played": 1596168611}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game.

The first two parts, [I]Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors[/I] and [I]Virtue\u2019s Last Reward[/I], were re-released as [I]Zero Escape: The Nonary Games[/I], [URL=https://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/recommended/477740/]which I reviewed recently[/URL]. [I]ZTD[/I] was designed so that players without any experience with [I]999[/I] and [I]VLR[/I] can still enjoy it. However, I highly recommend you to play [I]The Nonary Games[/I] first so that you can understand the narrative of [I]ZTD[/I] better, and to appreciate the game\u2019s nuances and references.\n\nMain characters from [I]The Nonary Games[/I] -- Junpei, Akane, Sigma and Phi -- return in [I]ZTD[/I], only this time they are supporting cast to three new protagonists, Carlos, Diana and a mysterious boy. Despite that, Junpei, Akane, Sigma and Phi remain to be important characters, as their pasts and futures play a huge part in the engaging, convoluted story. Thankfully then, [I]ZTD[/I] features fully-voiced cinematics instead of visual novel reading, allowing creator Kotaro Uchikoshi to show, rather than tell us (verbosely), what\u2019s happening.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I appreciate the visual novel roots of [I]The Nonary Games[/I]; yet, the transition to cinematics truly works in [I]ZTD[/I]\u2019s favour. In [I]The Nonary Games[/I], there was so much reading of repeated text and scenes that it bogged the games down at times. The use of cutscenes, combined with some editing, and slight variations in cinematography and photography, allow [I]ZTD[/I] to move along at a better pace. The cinematography and photography also help evoke suspense, shock and terror.\n\nIn [I]ZTD[/I], our protagonists find themselves trapped in a mysterious facility filled with escape room puzzles. This part of the game isn\u2019t much different from [I]The Nonary Games[/I], and many of the 13 featured puzzles are fun. My favourites are the ones in the Pod Room and the Healing Room, because they make use of the game\u2019s new graphics technology. They also stand out amongst others because you to do more than just \u201cfind/pick this up and use it on that\u201d in those puzzles.\n\nTo differentiate itself from its predecessors, [I]ZTD[/I] also includes Decision Games, in which you have to make one of two or few possible, often difficult, choices. Your decision will have an impact on how the narrative unfolds, inviting you to try out different responses. As a result, the story in [I]ZTD[/I] is presented in an expectedly non-linear and intentionally fragmented manner. While this may seem like a flaw on the surface, I can assure you that this style of storytelling is integral to the story, and adds to the suspense and mystique.\n\nTo reference a key element of the game, the \u201csnail\u201d that derails [I]ZTD[/I] from achieving perfection, however excellent it is, is the character animation. It\u2019s disappointing to see the game falling short in this area, given its full transition from visual novel to graphic adventure genre. First, there\u2019re slight inconsistencies in character designs. The styles in which Junpei, Akane, Sigma, Phi, Carlos and Diana are drawn do not seem complement each other completely. When you put all these characters next to the antagonist, you\u2019d notice the differences even more.\n\nThen there\u2019re Mira and Eric, two new characters to the [I]Zero Escape[/I] trilogy. Of all the characters, they look most out of place with their dead eyed appearances. (Perhaps this was intentionally done from a narrative perspective.) Combined with all characters\u2019 inadequate facial animations for emoting (including limited, if not absence of, eyebrow movements), their general wooden expressions, the very poor lip-syncing to English voiceovers, and the small number of character stances and movements, I felt like I was watching marionettes acting out scenes at times. If only the developers had more time and money to fine-tune the animations...\u201cLife is truly unfair, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nThe fact that the poor character animation didn\u2019t deter my enjoyment of [I]ZTD[/I] goes to show the game\u2019s strengths in escape puzzle/Decision Game presentations, as well as in storytelling. Sure, story of [I]ZTD[/I] is even more outrageous and convoluted than that of [I]VLR[/I], but it\u2019s very entertaining overall. Honestly, after all the science fiction wackiness in [I]VLR[/I], I\u2019d have been surprised if [I]ZTD[/I] is more grounded and restrained.\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I know just how wacky the story of the [I]Zero Escape[/I] trilogy would become right after playing [I]999[/I]. No, the [I]Zero Escape[/I] trilogy takes you to places you\u2019d not imagine, especially given its humble visual novel roots. [I]ZTD[/I] is a good conclusion to the [I]Zero Escape[/I] trilogy, and I highly recommend it. As I stated in my introduction, I do feel that this game is best enjoyed if you have played [I]999[/I] and [I]VLR[/I].

In this way, I ended up with an overwhelming amount of story fragments after the first big decision in the game.

It completely goes against the 2 previous games (which already had different art styles). The animation is terrible, it makes the cutscenes look really awkward and the characters look like puppeted mannequins. \n\nThe cast is by far the weakest in the series.

It's an experience that's almost flawless, with the exception of hit and miss voice acting and a few questions not being answered. VLR on the other hand, I didn't enjoy as much. The graphics were just ugly, the characters weren't as memorable (except Phi. She's my favorite character in the whole series), and it just drags on for far too long (I put over 40 hours into it, and I was just done with it when I finished) thanks to repetition, having so many endings, and those map traversal moments. While I still think the story's great and the puzzle rooms are pretty fun, it's my least favorite in the series.\n\nYes, I think ZTD is a better experience than VLR. While I do think it's the weakest in terms of story and such, I had more fun.\n\nZero Time Dilemma is the most interesting in terms of what it wants to do. There are nine people (3 in each team in different wards. C-Team, Q-Team, and D-Team) put into a bomb shelter by the villain known as \"Zero II.\" He wants everybody to play a game, that game is to kill if they want to escape. Kill six people, at the very least. You'll be switching between the three teams and making the choices of the leader of said team in order to find out what's going on, and who this Zero is, how to get out safely, along with other mysteries.\n\nWhile I do think the story is fine, it's not great. Every now and then, plot points can be downright stupid or nonsensical, a twist that comes out of left field and might not be explained. Along with the animation (which I will get to) and Saw-like violence (seriously, they really upped the violence in this game), you just can't help but not take it seriously and laugh. There still is some great dialogue, emotional moments, interesting mysteries, and plot points and clever references to 999 and VLR that will click. The pacing is also *much* better than in VLR. The ending, without spoilers, was weak however. It gives off the feeling that they ran out of budget and didn't know how to wrap thing up, which is a bummer.\n\nThe cast is the weakest in the series, although not bad. We have Jumpei and Akane from 999, and Sigma and Phi from VLR; the rest are new. Carlos being the best new character, Phi being just as enjoyable as ever, Q and Diana being great additions, the rest don't leave that much of an impression on me. Eric is the most unlikable character in the whole series, Mira is uninteresting, while Jumpei and Akane not being as likable as in 999. Sigma's character just feels off. \n\nThe team's stories are told through cutscenes, and it's very different than last two games. To put it in a simple way, imagine having the text set to \"auto\" in the visual novel sections while it's fully animated. In my opinion, it's an interesting direction to take, but it comes with one of the biggest problems the game has: the presentation and animation. While I do think the models look much better than in VLR (although Akane and Junpei look too different), the environments weren't given the same treatment. The game looks fine overall, and effects do look solid, but the animations are just flat out awful. They're janky, stiff, feels like they're trying to cut as many corners as possible (shaking the camera while zoomed onto a character's face, cutaways if somebody falls over or gets attacked). There were a few times I saw errors, like a character teleporting when the screen fades. The movement of the characters' hair freaks out at times, the lip-sync is awful. Despite all of this however, there is some odd charm to it, and it makes dumb moments even more hilarious at times. They don't get in the way once you get use to them.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is great! The animation does hurt some performances, but overall, I have nothing to complain about. The soundtrack is pretty enjoyable and fits scenes pretty well, although I wish they didn't reuse many songs from 999 and VLR. The new songs are still good though! The sound mixing on the other hand is rough, and I highly recommend turning down the music and upping the voice acting by a couple of dots.\n\nThe gameplay... I don't have much to say. You still have the escape rooms and moments of choosing the path you want to go. The rest, you're watching cutscenes while trying to piece the story together. I'd say the escape rooms are pretty fun in this, even if some puzzles are reused a few times. The movement while looking around in the room is a big step up from VLR, and it's the same as the first two games: you're in a room, find a way out. \n\nThe biggest change in gameplay is that instead of a flowchart where you go from the start of the path to an ending, you now have \"fragments.\" Each team have multiple fragments you can choose from, and they resemble a small part of that team's story. They aren't in order, so if you find one interesting and it's unlocked, you can do it. If you finish that fragment, it's added onto the main flowchart to show which time it took place. It works very well in my opinion, and having it nonlinear like this is refreshing. I do have a gripe that [spoiler]you have get all teams executed in the voting segment if you want to finish the game,[/spoiler] but overall, I like it.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say this is a good game. The puzzle rooms are pretty enjoyable, the plot is interesting and has good pacing, the flow chart is refreshing, and many of the characters are good. But this is a flawed game, and you're not going to get the quality of storytelling 999 and VLR had. Personally, I think this experience is much better than VLR since like I said: the pacing is much better and repetition occurs much less. \n\nThis could've been better, but for what it is, I think it's worth your time. It's an enjoyable game.\n\n[b]SCORE: 7/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1590033470, "timestamp_updated": 1590074047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663225650787353516", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69459081": {"recommendationid": "69459081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029846902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1269, "last_played": 1589896389}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of the more interesting games which I have played in a long time.

I believe I thought it to be the original game of a DS game I had never played, and it reminded me of Dangaronpa with the sudden introduction of characters I had never seen, some of which I couldn't tell apart on my first play. It was all very confusing to me, the bizarre cutscenes, minimally expressive character models and animation, the English voicing sounded so strange to me I found it more enjoyable to just listen to the Japanese and read subtitles, I even WON the game with the first decision I could make (about 20 min in, I think, I'll talk about this later). But because I made that (seemingly correct) choice, I was shoved into the menu UI without any explanation. This plague doctor creep flipped a coin, I apparently escaped this game, without ever hearing what it entailed, and now I HAD to go back and make the wrong choice so that I could properly play the game. For some reason that rubbed me the wrong way when I first played this, that and the really repetitive scenes- the characters constantly forget their experiences so they don't know what they have revealed before- which grew quickly tiring, because I was not aware this game was more a long movie with a few puzzles and Big Decisions to make.\n\nI left and came back a long time later, I quickly learned what I had written above but this time I rolled with it. And even so, going from ~2 hours playtime, to then 8 hours, 15 the next day, now 25 hours in the span of less than a week, this game is a LOT of talking. I'd say its 80% talking, 15% escape room puzzles, but even the puzzles have the character's witty commentary- to a point where they reveal info about the puzzles through 'hints' that range from things you already know to [i]the literal answer.[/i]\n\nThe first half of the game, like the first 12 hours I swear, is the same information repeated over and over and over again, sometimes in different rooms, with different people, you learn things but these things are then repeated, and repeated, until you want to just call it quits. I don't think everyone will feel this way, but if it wasn't for quarantine there's no way I could have put the hours in this game that it drains from you. \n\nI was really tired for a lot of this first part, not because the series of events weren't interesting, they just took so long to listen to, and when I figured anything out for myself one of the characters says it a minute later, except it's still not information that helps. I had to really get myself to care somewhat about these people who complain a lot and make stupid allegations all the time, who would constantly whine about each other or their past or dead parents. But finally, finally I got to a point where I was given the one piece of information that seemed to spark the second half, basically none of the people were there by coincidence, and they know a lot more than they've been telling you or each other.\n\nIt was everything I wanted, the narrative switched from character details to profound discussion about the bounds of time and space, multiple universes, the reveal of apparent common knowledge that was kept from you. It gets weird. It gets confusing again but in a world-breaking way, you finally see how big this puzzle actually is, and you want to know everything, you want the good ending. You strive for the good, for the complete. Every ending, every bad ending, because there's purpose now, because you're getting answers, you're revealing new things because of what you know, what you've deduced.\n\nI can't say the ending is savory, it would have been better as an ending to a movie, but not a video game. Because choice is so important, that's told to you constantly, then you believe your choice is nonexistent, then you have choice again, but then it's revealed the choice was never actually yours, but still offers you  illusions of choice everywhere. I only recommend this game because I can see and experience the love and effort that went into this experience, I loved the complexity of everything, and because this game will make you feel all sorts of things. But those emotions include boredom, sometimes impatience. My computer fell asleep multiple times during some cutscenes. Take that as you will.\n\nI would play a sequel.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1589426216, "timestamp_updated": 1589426216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69044465": {"recommendationid": "69044465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004352329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2571, "last_played": 1589341168}, "language": "english", "review": "Qdk Idp Wklv Dlqw lw\n(Ceasar Cipher, shift of 3)", "timestamp_created": 1589340210, "timestamp_updated": 1589340210, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48108142614364624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69037769": {"recommendationid": "69037769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113956206", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 880, "last_played": 1610409853}, "language": "english", "review": "YES YES YES AMAZING", "timestamp_created": 1589328310, "timestamp_updated": 1589328310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68954327": {"recommendationid": "68954327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093192238", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1353, "last_played": 1589200161}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is as good as the prequels, but the ending is kinda weak.

It's writing and characters are awfule compared to the other two and just awful in general. It also leaves a lot to be desired coming from VLR, as it completely neglects a lot of details and threads that were set up previously, as well as retcons things, and completely changes world-building and characterization. These aren't the characters you know and love anymore. The new characters are all completely horrible as well. Eric and Q are incredibly annoying with Eric especially having the most awfully stupid character motivations. Mira is also a bland and incredibly flat character, despite what her in game model looks like.\n\nThere is one thing I did like though. I really did like the decision mechanic, and how there weren't just two binary options for each choice and that some had three or even four outcomes, and how they were all different. The problem is that nothing interesting was done with this mechanic. All of the different outcomes are just as bad as the others, even if the way the game splits the paths off of each other was unique.\n\nI also didn't like the change to a more movie like format instead of the more traditional visual novel format. This is just a personal preference, though. I don't think the graphics looked good enough for the movie style. It also takes away control from the player in being able to skip voiced lines, even though that's not my personal preference. It also makes skipping using the fast forward button a lot slower, and more imprecise, than it was in previous games. There's also the rather funny little slip up of them including the skip button UI element in some characters' memories. \n\nThe escape rooms aren't bad. They're actually pretty good by themselves. Some of them are just very generic compared to VLR. Not an inherently bad thing, but can make them less enjoyable if you have played VLR recently. Multiple times while playing through this I thought, \"haven't I done this already?\" only to realize that it was actually a very similar room from VLR that I was remembering.\n\nOverall, this isn't a good game. There are many elements to it that hit personal boxes that really irritate me specifically, but might not bother you. If you want a fun escape room game with a passable story, get this while it's on sale. If you're a huge Zero Escape fan, this game might hurt. It's kind of necessary to play to finish the story from VLR, but you're probably better off creating your own head canon and forgetting this game ever existed. That and playing AI: The Somnium Files.

The way they ran, the way they interacted... Nothing was natural. It was all so stiff, even in the less stiff situations. I believe I may have even gotten some bug that made it near impossible to finish without looking up codes for the Q team box. I never got to see the part to get the codes for the computer or Qs head. The story so boring and uneventful, the characters were very different at least, no one was alike, but... Again, they were for the most part boring. Really Q team was the only team with interesting characters. I loved Junpei in 999, but in this... I get that mental health is difficult. I of all people would know, but his overall presence just felt so non-important, along with a lot of the characters. There were so many situations where I felt like more should be going on or characters should be behaving in a different way- during Junpei and Carlos' fight in the power room, I just rolled my eyes because it was obvious what he was doing at that point in time... And that ending... It felt so rushed and sloppily put together. So 'Ex-Machina' if you will. No hints lead to who Zero was until it practically shoved into your face, no guessing at all. I would have been able to forgive the visuals and voices and interactions if it was at least a LITTLE interesting, but it was just...

Absolutely Fantastic.\nI know it says that I've only played 3 hours but that's only because I ended up watching the entire game in movie format first.\n\nWhy? Well. That's the game's only flaw.\n\nZero Time Dilemma, or [ZTD] for short, Is the third and final entry to The Zero Escape: The Nonary Games Series. It follows 999: Nine Hours, Nine People, Nine Doors and The Nonary Games: Virtue's Last Reward; Both of which have a flowchart style story.\n\nWhat this means is that in the first two games, You start off at Point A. You're lead down to Point B where a choice you make will determine whether you move on to point C or point D. The story line possibilities continue to divide until each path reaches it's finale. You're also able to jump back to certain points to change your mind and follow different paths. It's important to do so because some crucial answers needed in say Point E can only be obtained in Point J in order to progress to a better ending.\n\nThis is a formula that is maintained throughout both [999] and [VLR]. However in [ZTD], this flow chart system is abandoned in favour for a new...uh...I don't even know what to call it. It's not even a web. It's very confusing to behold at first. You're so used to the flow chart that none of this makes any sense. \n\nSo the begining is simple enough. but random points pop up soon after. sometimes one new path shows up, some times 2 or 3. Before long you have so many options you don't know what order to take. \n\nWorst off, you pick a path, and it feels wrong. Disjointed.\n\nBut here's the problem. The game doesn't tell you to just do whatever and that no matter what, everything would make sense and work out in the end. So Because i didn't want to 'Get the order wrong' I watched a movie guide version of it where someone who played the game, edited it and arranged it in the most progressively pleasing manner possible. But it was so damned good i couldn't stop watching.\n\nSo just play it~ play it and complete everything! This one is easily the best of all three of them (Assuming you've completed 999 and VLR) \n\nThe story is totally fantastic! The voice acting is incredible! The characters are all perfect! The game is perfect! The OST is a perfect mix of old and new! That one little flaw gives it a 9.5/10. But honestly it's fantastic! I don't care what anyone says.

I also liked the idea of bringing it in a cinematic way, although the characters expressions and movements were quite weird, which made it more difficult to take seriously. On the other hand, thank god it was like that because this game was the most brutal and gory with lot of difficult choices to make, in which someone always ended up dying. And despite the fact that the visuals were weird, knowing the characters, being attached to them, made it sometimes difficul to continue, so props to Uchikoshi for that.\n\nThe premise is similar to the other games: nine people locked in a building, but now they are separated in 3 teams and you play with the leader of each team. They have to play the decision game, which implies killing elements from the other team, deciding who survives or believe in luck.\n\nI liked the fact that the game would build up by playing fragments of story. I liked it because you would gather information from each fragment, and although you would lose youself in time, at the same time as you were locked inside a building, it looked like it didn't matter what time it was. Even the fact that they were sedated and their memories erased at the end of each fragment, made it look like any fragment could fit along or that you could map the correct fragments for each timeline giving the constraints from each one of them. There is also a flowchart so you could always guide yourself from there.\n\nAbout the flowchart, there was only one thing I couldn't understand at first. One of the first fragments is to vote on a team to kill. The team with more votes would die. One of the requirements to finish the game is to kill every team (each in a different timeline). From the flowchart I didn't understand that and it blocked me for a while but despite that, the rest was kind of easy to figure out by playing different fragments.\n\nThe credits song for each ending is superb. It is melodic and it affects you, like what happened was a result of your choices and you have to live with that. Some songs from the ost are songs from the previous games (and it's interesting because you find some similarities between some rooms too), but there are also new ones, especially for Q team.\n\nThe beginning of the game, in my opinion is genious and you really have to try it because I kept thinking about it until the end.\n\nThe \"true\" ending (it is difficult for me to define it as a sole true ending because every ending in Zero Escape is essential for the final one) is a bit rushed and leaves a lot of questions to answer. I kind of liked the \"each player makes it own decision about the ending\", but there was material for another one (although it would the the 4th and 4 is an unlucky number in Japan).\nBut despite that controversial ending I liked how some of my suspicions were confirmed and how some events were explained.\n\nI also liked the characters. Some were already known from the previous games.

The first two game were pretty good. This? Where should I even begin.\n\nFirst the obvious: The presentation sucks. I don't need to talk much about this. \n\nSecond: The entire story is awful. They had the great idea to use fragments for storytelling, so there's pretty much no narrative order at all. Stories without any kind of order however make everything feel quickly pointless. Whatever happens in a fragment? Who cares, it's not mattering in the next one. Someone dies? Who cares. Even if the next fragment plays afterwards, who actually died isn't set in stone.\nThe game was praised by some for giving you a huge amount of choice. It's not a choice if you have to exhaust all \"choices\" anyway though. The entire drama also becomes frustrating. Press the button or not? WHO CARES?!? We do both anyway. I don't need a full damn minute of \"exciting countdowns\" where people argue about pressing the button. Both. Happens. Anyway.\nThere's also way too much random killing going on. The writer was insanely lazy with the endings and just decided that characters simply start killing others without much of a reason.\nSpeaking of characters, the returners are a shadow of their former selves. \n\nThird: The gameplay. Puzzle rooms are at their worst designs as well. It feels like nobody ever bothered thinking things through. Many hints can be understood in multiple ways leading to trial and error. Other hints are completely pointless. Random triggers you have to find that are complete and utter nonsense. Like having to click twice on something before you can do what you need to do. Or when you have to find special spots so you can insert 8 keys, having to actually only find 6 and insert them to progress, because the last two are locked away. Frustrating. Pointlessly frustrating. The latter could be easily fixed by making the trigger FINDING and not INSERTING. Everything could be easily fixed. But alas.\n\n\nI've never see a worse final entry in a series, let alone to a series that was so promising. In all of the time I've played this game, there was nothing relevant about the story either. Everything felt pointless. How can you even care about the characters when every damn 5 minutes they snap and kill random people, themselves or whatever, and then are back in the next fragment where that didn't matter?

And they did very well with what they had)\nI wish the ending had been better with an animated Epilogue and answering the rest of the plot threads left untouched. (There's nothing that tells you there are \"Epilogue Files\". And why do only 6 of the characters get epilogues? I won't spoil who but there is a group of 3 that gets absolutely nothing.)  Unwoven.  An otherwise small blemish an amazing game and series.  It really feels like there should be an anime film sequel that finishes the whole thing. (As the whole escape room plot thread has run it's course. But there's still things left unsaid)\n\nIf you want to just play 1 game in the Zero Escape series. Play 999. That game works on it's own by itself. But also as part of the other two that cannot function as a whole without 999. I never played VLR when it first came out and if I had, man I don't know how I would've handled the thought of there never being a third game. Because that ends on a utterly depressing clifhanger, and on it's own it feels wholy incomplete.  ZTD ties up a lot from VLR and is really VLR part 2. But still leaves some pretty WTF feelings on how to interpret it all. Really, thinking about it one way is so sad that it makes me feel anxious. Another way it's bittersweet but necessary that eventually leads to success. However it doesn't change what happened, from still happening. \n\nAlso it cannot be understated, that if you don't play this series and cry (or want to cry) at least a dozen times or so. You are not human.\n\nShinji Hosoe's music is incredible. The way he reuses themes and reworks them in each entry is just enhances the continuity of the series as a whole. There is never a bad song. It's never repetitive. He finds great ways to rework tracks and re-arrange them to make it different enough to make you say \"wow\". The emotional themes will get you to cry all over again. It's a shame that it isn't easier to legally get a hold of the soundtracks to this series. It's a grave injustice to how good this legendary composer's music is.\n\nThe shift in character designs is jarring at first but they grow on you quick as Rui Tomono's art is amazing. Equally as jaw dropping as Kinu Nishimura. \n\nThe puzzles are less difficult than VLR and more in line with 999 as well. Though still thought provoking. Between VLR and ZTD I think I had about 25 pages in a small notebook filled with notes. I LOVED that the puzzles (and other bits of key info) were engaging enough to need to write down to figure out or remember. \n\n\nThe PC version lacks some of the visual changes in the PS4 version, like SSAO, greater self shadowing, and some bloom. But I feel the game actually looks better without them. Mostly the SSAO, as it looks extremely overpowering on PS4 and doesn't blend well with the character models. (There will be random shades of gray on places that there shouldn't be that look egregious. Such as on specular highlights in the cel shading.)  The option would've been nice I guess. But really you aren't missing much. \nThe things you are missing that definitely look much better are UI assets like the fonts for subtitles. They are very low res on PC but much improved on PS4. As are icons for items.\nBut overall the PC version looks very good. You can turn off effects you want (Like the motion blur that really doesn't belong in a game without much fast motion), and inject others with reshade if you want them enough.\n\nLengthwise i've seen some criticism against ZTD for having 3 less puzzle rooms (not a big deal) or being shorter than the other games. This isn't really true though. Because ZTD is actually about the same length as 999 if you do everything in both. In fact, longer because you can only reach the true end of ZTD by doing everything. Where as in 999 you can learn absolutely everything and attain the true ending by only taking 2 paths. Leaving the other 7 paths unnecessary but still entertaining. (Minus Lotus).\nVirtue's Last Reward is really the outlier, it's a 60 hour game to get the true path and there is a lot more repetition of similar dialogue playing out and it's all necessary. In my mind VLR is just about 10-20 hours too bloated in contrast to ZTD and 999.\nI will say though that the length of the VN segments in ZTD often feel too short. Moving to animated cutscenes instead that are much more difficult to create lead to the balance sometimes feeling off kilter and not leaving enough time for character development. (And some characters not quite getting enough screen time. Like Phi and Q Team).\n\nAnother thing that felt kind of off as well was the beginning of the game. You are just kind of thrown into the mix without much context. Where as there exists a sort of proper beginning slash prologue for the story. But relegated to a digital pre-order bonus in the west. And part of a pre order booklet in Japan. That should've been animated and expanded on to become the beginning of the game to really set things up more.\n\nZTD isn't perfect. But it's still masterful.", "timestamp_created": 1582778584, "timestamp_updated": 1583997030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63886902": {"recommendationid": "63886902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058026716", "num_games_owned": 898, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1510, "last_played": 1582299037}, "language": "english", "review": "A good ending to a great trilogy. If that tells you enough, you won't need to read the rest.\n\nZero Time Dilemma picks up where the story of Virtue's Last Reward left off, with some old faces coming along for the new ride. Don't expect familiarity, though. With one notable exception, every returning character acts notably different from how they used to. Most of that is explained, but it can be off-putting.\n\nOnce again, puzzle design has been improved from the previous entry in the series. Puzzles and story also intertwine more than in the last two games.\n\nSo far, so fantastic, right? Well, not everything is sunshine and rainbows, I'm afraid. For starters, this game is technically very unstable. If you're experiencing crashes in Windows, I recommend setting the executable to run in administrator mode and/or compatibility mode.\n\n[spoiler]So, remember the cliffhanger at the end of Virtue's Last Reward, with the mystery character hopping into Kyle's body? The character Phi explained would be vital to stopping the pandemic? Because the writers don't. No payoff to that is explicitly given in this game. And Brother? It's revealed who he is, but nothing comes of it and the goals of Free the Soul are largely left to the imagination.\n\nThis game wraps up the plot thread of the Mars mission simulation just fine, but in doing so it forgets to give closure to more or less anything else. Even in the final, true ending to the series the game manages to leave several major plot point unresolved, most of which are introduced earlier in this game. It seems to beg for a fourth entry, but leaves almost no room for a new nonary/ambidex/decision game to frame such a sequel around.[/spoiler]\n\nI'd still recommend this game if you want some more Zero Escape, for it is a Zero Escape game through and through.

There are quite a few issues with the story logic, story structure/game play loop, and basic things like people just staring when talking and mouths moving when silent. It does have an interesting concept iterating on the story mechanic of the last two games. Instead pure linear branches, the story is sectioned off due to the character being knocked out and given amnesia drugs. But while it looks good on paper, in practice it hampered the momentum of story progression. I had to restart it half way and use the Chronological Fragment Guide because it was not clear in game the places I had to try new choices or endings. Even more so when game over endings would still have nodes after it. \n\nThe puzzles, for the most part, were good and interesting. Many felt more interactive rather than minigames, but I think they were some the easier puzzles in there series. Or it could be having played all three, I had the Zero Escape mindset that made them seem easy. Some of them had a few logic inconsistencies, like the transporter room when finding the last part to finish the room. The answer goes against the logic you were told and operating on up until that point. If anything, I felt like there weren't enough, that it was almost too story heavy, or that the easy of the puzzles or how quick they could be solved was out of balance with all the story you watch.\n\nThe story itself...well, there is a twist about 2/3rds through that really made the whole thing seem very doubtful. Up until then, I kinda figured out many of the storylines of the characters and why they were there, but towards the end, with that twist, it felt very illogical and random. It made \"sense\" as the story finished, but there were a lot better ways to do what they did and get to the same place. \n\nSo, if you feel you need to play to get the whole story, I won't stop you since I did playthrough it myself.

I finally beat the voting choices portions and unlocked the rest of the \"undiscovered\" map, which shows me I still have tons of content to get through before the game is over. \n\nI was streaming the game to my friend, and we were solving problems together. He's more math-oriented than me, so some puzzles were easy for him to answer. I'm more object-oriented, so environmental puzzles were something I was quicker at. We made a great team when it came down to it. It was a fantastic time.\n\nI did a lot of the Q team story, and let me tell you, man, doing these separate timelines gives you so many perspectives on the characters and development for them because you are seeing them unfold when the circumstances are different, it's just so interesting.

I'm very grateful for the forward button when you are repeating scenes to go for different results. Otherwise, it would be an impossibly long game. \n\nI have been focusing mostly on C team missions today and trying to unlock as much as possible. I swear the way the drama is played out in these scenarios almost feels alien in comparison to the Q team because right from the start, we pretty much understand that all three are friendly people and wouldn't seem to hurt a fly, except Junpei I guess. \n\nThough man, most of the stuff I did was all luck based material when it comes to choices. I was doing dice rolls, antidote gambling, and also tackling the Monthy Hall problem. Mind you, it took several times to get the desired outcomes I wanted, but this game plays a lot of trickery when it comes to choice. It's downright awesome how much this game messes with you.\n\nThey go into more detail about player choice and how it affects the world the further you get into the game.

Felt like the game changed from a puzzle, visual novel hybrid to strictly a visual novel one.

I enjoyed the overall story after it all clicks but feel this game isn't really needed.\n\nThere are a few dumb design decisions this time.\n\n1. Most important the story doesn't follow set routes this time. The characters lose their memories after each event and so YOU also don't know the correct order. This leads to dumb situations where you will experience all the routes at once without knowing what is really going on. Your choices don't really matter since you won't go further in that specific story next more then likely. In the end it all makes sense but I hated this from start to finish.\n\n2. The characters are split up into three groups of three and only interact with each other for 95% of the game. No going through routes with different characters on different doors here. I suppose since most aren't new characters it doesn't matter but I like the interactions.\n\n3. You might get stuck in the story. Some events do not have predetermined outcomes. Something different can happen if you do it enough. You can't advance the story unless you see all of these events. By that point you will have a bunch of story locks on your flowchart so it can get confusing. One of them I had to do 5 times and finally looked at a guide to see what I was doing wrong.\n\n4. Skipping text is annoying. The dialog is in cutscenes this time not static images. If you skip dialog you are likely to skip more then just that line. I don't need to hear every word so I skip a lot of text. You will have to check the backlog a lot if you do this.\n\n5. Animations. Yes they are ugly but they aren't that bad. I like the new artstyle but 999 still looks the best. 2D>3D.\n\n6. Not many escape rooms this time and the majority of them are pretty easy.\n\n7. Could ruin 999 and/or VLR for you.\n\n8.

However, I can still say with full certainty that I have seen enough to warrant never recommending it to anyone, especially fans of the series.\n\nThe game just looks awful, honestly even worse than VLR.  Animations are either nonexistent or goofy as all hell, so any time the game wants you to take it seriously, I can't help but laugh.  I could forgive this if the writing was good like the other games in the series, but it just isn't.  The entirety of Q team are all new characters, and they are just awful people with no redeeming qualities.  The other teams are mostly just returning characters, but are just far less interesting than they were in other games.  Junpei, the protagonist from the first game, went from being someone who got sick just seeing a dead body to being perfectly fine with killing off just about anyone that isn't Akane over the course of a single year.  He also hates Zero for killing people, despite the fact that he has no issues with sending entire teams to their deaths. \n\nThe overall story itself is a joke as well.  It is so poorly managed that you just have no idea what comes next.  You can, and probably will play everything out of order.  Because of this, your choices straight up do not matter.  Like I mentioned before, you can choose to kill off an entire team, which I did.  Immediately after, I had 4 new scenarios on the team I just murdered.  It just isn't coherent at all, and to really make it easier to understand, the most you get from a scenario before playing through it is a single frame that doesn't convey anything at all unless you've already played it.  From everything I've seen, the writing is awful and from a few spoilers I've seen, it only gets worse.  Just know that Zero's motives are complex.\n\nRemember how the puzzles, especially in VLR, were really cool?  Yeah, they aren't anymore.  They are some of the easiest I've ever seen in a game and the only time you'll get stuck is if you forgot to check on something or if you aren't very good at math.  \n\nOverall, just stick with the first two games and don't spend any money on this one.

They moved away from a sprite based VN with dialogue boxes to one with models and voice acting. This sounds dumb but I prefer the older way, because in later parts of this game it felt like I was watching a movie instead of actually playing a game. It doesn't help that the animations are....not good. Some scenes that were meant to be serious just end up being funny jokes because of the animation.\nLets talk gameplay. This game has less escape rooms than the 2 previous Zero Escape games and it also lacks one final escape room in the true ending path like Room Q from VLR. Also some of the rooms are just plain bad. The Pod Room literally consists of the same puzzle like 8 times and thats it. Puzzles get reused a lot during this game and I found that most escape rooms were just not enjoyable to me.\nNow lets get to the story and how it presents itself. Instead of following a flowchart with forks in the road, you have the option of going anywhere. You just select a fragment and have no idea where you are in the story and on which fork. I know this was done because the characters lose their memories each time but I feel like this hurts the presentation of the story more than it favors it. Some of the endings were really lackluster and not unique enough. C End was literally just an extended version of D End 1. The true ending itself was good, i give it that, but getting there feels like such a slog because you probably finished all the escape rooms 5-6 hours before getting there, so you just sit there for 5 hours watching cutscenes that try to be serious but end up stupid instead.\nLastly I want to talk about the characters and the teams that the game sorts them in. If you play this game, there is a high chance youve played 999 and VLR before. Then why does C Team have 2 999 Characters and D Team 2 VLR characters and Q Team no old characters. This makes Q Team by default the most uninteresting team of them, because of course you want to know what happens with Tenmyouji or Sigma, thats just natural. It doesn't help that most of the new characters are just so damn uninteresting that even if they didn't exist, it wouldn't change much in the story.

An example:\n[spoiler]What happened to Aoi from the first game? He escaped with Akane during the cliffhanger ending, but while she's part of the story in both sequels, it's not mentioned once what happened to him.\nI had been thinking since Virtue's Last Reward that maybe he was actually Brother and that that title was a reference to him being Akane's brother, but no, he's just randomly erased from existence. Am I supposed to assume he died from the Radical-6 outbreak or something like that? Killing off major characters off-screen without any explanation isn't exactly good writing in my book.[/spoiler]\n\nFurthermore, the game actively omits visual information and logical dialogue between characters for the sake of using certain elements as plot devices in later parts of the game.\n\nIn addition to everything mentioned above, the ending is one of the most unsatisfying ones I've ever experienced.\nBasically, the main issue at the core of the game is never resolved, and we're just left to imagine the rest for ourselves.

Being in the same trilogy as The Nonary Games 999 and VLR standards and expectations for ZTD were really high.\n\nIf you haven't finished both 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward don't bother playing ZTD since it is a culmination of those two and heavily spoils their plots. Since you've finished 999 and VLR and are still debating whether to buy ZTD or not let me give some of my insights. \n\nZTD was made to be multi-platform game and has PS4 and PC next to 3DS in it's targeted systems you can already expect it to be a bit disappointing. It aims to be fully 3D game with cutscenes (lots of cutscenes) and fancy looks yet it is obviously downgraded, has stiff animations, weird camera angles, low amount of movement and all that just to cover how lacklustre it is. On top of that, characters' design of some of the reappearing cast have changed drastically for the worse. Puzzles on the other hand look fine and work similar to VLR. Some game design decisions are done on purpose so I don't think ZTD would work much better as a pure Visual Novel.\n\nPuzzle design was hit or miss. ZTD gives same feeling as VLR did since puzzle sections work almost exactly the same. Most of the puzzles aren't hard. In my opinion toughness of the puzzles was overall between 999 and VLR. Some of the functionality is lost from VLR. Menus are confusing and sometimes terrible.\n\nNow onto the most important part. Story. Just like 999 and VLR, ZTD too has main twist lurking in shadows right in front of your nose while carefully crafting the amazing reveal. The problem this time is that as the culmination and conclusion, ZTD doesn't work. There were amazing moments and incredible reveals but the story suffers from overpowered plot-devices and complexity of some of the characters' motives. Reappearing characters are way different (in negative context) than what they used to be for bizarre reasons. The story gets itself into easily noticeable paradoxes that start appearing when you start thinking about the issues. On the other side, drama and horror of the game work really well in building up the tension. You can expect some good emotional payoffs.\n\nWeighing pros and cons can give different results for everyone. Personally, if you're like me and you too overthink, overanalyze and have really high expectations out of things, then I don't recommend ZTD.

I rarely find games that have that much influence on me, but this game is the one. \n\nIt came out as a third game in franchise with a different gameplay and visual style which made many people who played first two games dislike it. I kinda disagree with them and think that this game is best in series. If first two games were all about finding the way out and beat the escape game by completing boring routines, this is one is showing how much the 'butterfly effect' can change the human history, not just the history of players. It also has a good example of a 'time loop' causing Zero to exist (it is somehow a huge spoiler, so I won't tell more) and is more about philosophy than entertainment. Throught the whole playtime, the player has to make a choice, and each of his choice has a great plot twist. You can beat the game in a very beginning, but you may also cause a huge catastrophe. All you need to know in this case that you can and you can't determine your future at the same time.\n\nThe events of ZTD take place between the events of 999 and VLR. It shows what made the events of ZTD even happen and how easily it could be avoided. This explains why this part has characters both from 999 and VLR. It also had some new characters. Each character plays his own role in this game. If you played VLR, you know what happened in the future in their timeline. If you didn't, I recommend you to do it first, cause the 3rd game is a huge spoiler to both Nonary Games.\n\nThe gameplay is different from NG. You don't have to play this game from the beginning to the end which I love - it has many video and escape game fragments, and you can watch/play them in the order you like in most times. To continue some routs, though, you need to finish some fragments first. Some fragments can be opened by doing certain actions, f.e. killing someone. Yes, that's another difference from previous two games - only three people may escape the game zone. The individuals who can make it to escape change the history - the game is playing with timelines again, just like in VLR. There many endings, too, and all of them are equal, unlike in previous games where there's only one 'true' ending. However, there's only one ending that actually leads to the VLR main timeline. Despite all that, there actually IS a way to make all people escape but it wouldn't be that easy.\n\nAs for characters, there are ten of them, - nine players and Zero, the mastermind. Some of them are familiar to those who played Nonary Games as they already participated in them (not in chronically order but in previous games). Three of them are new and belong only to certain timelines. What they have in common is that they all woke up in a place looking like a base for preparing to go to outer space. None of them have any memories.\n\nIn this game, you'll have to play as one of teams. You can start with the team you like the most but you'll need to play all of them in order to find a way to keep everyone safe. Each team has a leader and includes three players. Two of them are connected but leader is someone new to them. You'll learn the story of each team by playing their routes. \n\nTeam C is represented by Akane, Junpei and Carlos. While first two people are very familiar, Carlos is a new player who plays for the first time. He is a fireman who came to the 'base' for his very own reasons. He has no idea who his teammates are but he had to lead his team anyway. Unlike them, he's not from Japan. This thing makes\u00a0 a player understand that the 'team' is international and they were preparing for a really serious thing. He appears to be 'gifted' in a special way, like everyone in his team. His abilities save the day in some timelines. He's also the one who starts the escape game in the very beginning. \n\nTeam Q is represented by Mira, her boyfriend Eric and Q, a little boy wearing a helmet. While Eric has no influence on the game, the other two do have one. Mira is a sexappeal girl with a big secret which you may learn by completing the story. She's also a reason why VLR timeline even happened and a reason for the some events Zero is referring to. Eric is a simple ice cream seller who's in love with her. Q is the most mysterious person among nine players. He has his own ending, unlike everyone else in this game, and represents a part of Zero's past.\n\nTeam D is represented by Sigma, Phi and Diana. The first two will take part in the next escape game while Diana seems to be the one who doesn't matter at all. The truth is that Diana, a red-haired young woman with a bird necklace, is probably the most important person among them all. The story of these three is the most interesting but not that unexpected for those who learn from noticing little details.\n\nFinally, Zero II. This Zero is my favourite because he's not trying to achieve his own goals as much as he's putting a true challenge for nine players by making them learn more about the responsibility for choices they make and effects they cause on the human history. Literally, he puts them all in his little game to turn them into figures on his chess desk called 'the fate of the world'. Even the passwords the players need to receive to escape are connected to them - and to him a little, too. He has the ability of mind-hacking while most of players have the ability to travel between timelines. He's not an actual evil genius but some kind of God who rule the game and the world, and also some kind of philosopher.\n\nThe identity of Zero II is truly amazing. By revealing it, he makes some players learn the truth they never thought really existed. He also makes them understand that time is much more mysterious thing than they could have ever imagined. The biggest mystery behind it is that actions that make this game exist were taken in the this very game but in a different timeline, making the greatest time loop you have ever seen. All the timelines are connected to each other a lot, and all players' actions summarize and turn into the future of the humankind. That's the dilemma that he leaves to three teams - choosing the human history's future knowing how much he can affect it and deciding whether to make him pay for his sins or not.\n\nThis game is a true masterpiece. \nYou won't get bored by all the dilemmas you'll have to solve.", "timestamp_created": 1576833942, "timestamp_updated": 1602059807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547894656658172607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60159159": {"recommendationid": "60159159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068246286", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1511, "last_played": 1576829246}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended but only if you've played 999 & VLR, on it's own it's even more confusing than it is with context", "timestamp_created": 1576829454, "timestamp_updated": 1576829521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60140518": {"recommendationid": "60140518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032313576", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1090, "last_played": 1576790724}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game, but let me say it is definitely below the first two games.\n\nFirst off, the graphics and sound are fantastic in the game. Nice texture work, the characters looks great, soundtrack is beautiful, love all of it.\n\nThe plot, I have mixed feelings on it. Sometimes you'll get stuck and not know what to do next (puzzle wise and flowchart wise), and there are a few plot twists that leave you incredibly confused. The ending is somewhat abrupt and you'll sit there thinking, \"..Really? It ends there?\". It does expand on 999 and VLR, which is to be expected, but bear in mind this will even change how you see THOSE games. Overall, I do like the game and its plot, but something just feels like it's missing. I've heard this game was rushed and honestly it shows. I wish this game had a bit more love put into it.\n\nNow, the few things I hate about this game.\n\nThe animations:\nThe models are beautiful in this game, but the animations are so god awful that I wish they stuck to 999's 2D sprites for the characters. Those sprites were animated so well and they actually felt alive. In this, the animations are so stiff and robotic that a lot of times that's all you can notice. The lip-syncing is also terrible, but I'm guessing the two go hand in hand.\n\nEric. Fuck Eric. He basically never redeems himself and you'll hate him the entire time.\n\nAlso, a returning character had a personality shift, and acts like a scumbag now. You'll know who I'm talking about, even 2 minutes into the game.\n\nOverall, the game is good, but there are so many things it could do better.

I entered it with slightly dashed hopes, as I got the impression from some in the fan base that this game is a step down from the first two in the Zero Escape series ('999' and 'Virtue's Last Reward'), and whilst I do understand the complaints, ZTD is a brilliant game and a step up from the other games in some ways too.\n\nThe pacing is improved tremendously from the first two games. The player doesn't have to sit through so much unnecessary dialogue and repeated situations, the player doesn't have to mash a button to skip the text boxes anymore either. This made the experience so much more enjoyable for me. The added animations and cinematography is well-appreciated too. \n\nAnother pacing-thing that was improved was the characters explaining things, in the previous games many concepts and stories about characters were explained well, but sometimes it went on a bit, such as the infamous 'Explaining Ice-9 while freezing to death' situation. In ZTD, the explanations were done well and took as long as they needed to. Unlike in the first two games, I never felt impatient playing this.\n\nThe story is as genius as ever, and I think it serves excellently as the finale to the Zero Escape Series. I don't think I'm qualified to explain why I think this, and going over the story would go into spoilers, but I really liked it. Even if I'm not sure I understood it.\n\nSpeaking of spoilers, try and avoid using a walkthrough. Basically any and all ZTD content online is full of people who love to try and spoil the story, but by the time you're reading this review you probably already know not to do that, realistically, by the time you're reading this you've already beaten the game and are wondering what everybody else thought of it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, ZTD did make some missteps, but they aren't significant enough to warrant not playing it. If you enjoyed 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, play Zero Time Dilemma as well. Also, play 999 and VLR first.

I want to play a game where you can save / kill members and I want to actually see it happen. If this was in there the game would be a solid 10/10\n- Some sections of the game can be really slow and tedious especially some of the puzzles, You might get stuck on what seems to be easy stuff when in reality it's a little more tougher then you thought.\n\nConclusion: Excellent game with a rich story, interesting characters and a fun play style, gets your brain working to deduce puzzles and figure out pathing to story lines. \n\nBought this game and Zero Time Dilemma: Nonary Games when they were on sale in a bundle for 5$ got lucky and definitely well worth the price, its worth it at full price, you get hours of game play and it's all enjoyable!", "timestamp_created": 1575607213, "timestamp_updated": 1575607213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59284207": {"recommendationid": "59284207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000595945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1131, "last_played": 1575496946}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe it is not as good as 999, but still enjoyable.

Additionally, one twist is extremely jarring and breaks the story a bit, as the characters would have to be acting extremely odd for it to make sense.

Eventually, each one revealed their best sides and my opinion swung around.  I didn't learn - after coming around to really appreciating 999, I internally grumbled about the set up of VLR.  And then having ultimately liked VLR, I thought ZTD was a big step down, until I ... got it.  If they release a 4th title I'll play it because they've earned my respect and willingness to stick with their story telling - I will probably think they've dropped the ball for quite a while, though, but I'll trust them enough to keep going.\n\n* I'd definitely start at the beginning if you're coming to this franchise fresh - I think a lot of the character interactions and story explanations will seem both incomprehensible and dopey without having fully experienced their backstory.\n\n* It's another game series where spoilers should be avoided as much as possible.  That's particularly hard for this franchise because each of the games had a small number of points where I ended up road-blocked by either a small missed detail in a puzzle, or the timeline display (or both) and looking up how to progress is, of course, fraught with spoilers.  Zero Time Dilemma is perhaps more of a problem here because the timeline/fragments system is really opaque in some crucial details and they have made the actual story structure significantly more complex.  All I can say, without spoiling anything, is be watchful for any parts of the \"flow\" that are not complete/activated, and that there are some unexplained aspects of the decision making system that can result in non-obvious road-blocks where you think you have done everything you need to, but the order matters (when it really shouldn't).\n\nSo, yeah, I recommend playing the whole series in order, and while each of those titles has flaws I think they each provided enough story-telling reward to shine - in the end - even if that's not apparent early on in gameplay.\n", "timestamp_created": 1571346470, "timestamp_updated": 1571346470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667802929878234863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55625296": {"recommendationid": "55625296", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993486602", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1317, "last_played": 1571366224}, "language": "english", "review": "This whole series was fantastic.

To put it shortly, I don't think Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma doesn't do a very good job of continuing, much less concluding the Zero Escape series. It's worth playing if you want to end the series, or if you got it for about $3.69 Canadian Fun Bucks like I did.\n\nZTD is in many regards less technically sound than VLR, and sometimes, 999. ZTD takes a lot of the issues I had with VLR, and actually ends up compounding on them for bigger issues. Convoluted menus turned into an incomprehensible mess. Files turned from inconvenient reading to frustrating because of the inability to write memos in them. Janky animation turned into laughably weightless, Telltale level animation. Even the new 3D models go from tolerable to a bizarre sidegrade with high-poly counts but compressed textures. Zero Escape's style, polish and presentation keeps getting cleaner and sleeker as it goes on, but the overall usability and enjoyability still peaked at 999.\n\nBut, the story. Man oh man, the story. It retreads too much while simultaneously adding too much. The returning cast return in name only, with personalities at such a distance from their old ones that they're practically a new character entirely. [also the new characters suck oh my god i fucking hate you eric] The plot hits all the same story beats that 999 & VLR did while telling it in a nonlinear fashion that, well it is pretty damn cool, but still leaves a lot to be desired. The story hits lots of targets that VLR and 999 set up. It also ended up missing quite a bit and accidentally shot VLR and 999. It has its moments, but there's a lot of slog to go through to get to those moments, and the payoff isn't always worth it. Even thinking about the story in relation to the other games makes my head hurt a little, much less trying to think about it on its own. \n\nI'm really torn on what I think about ZTD. I mean, yeah, it's [i]good.[/i] Hell, I'd even say it's worth playing to end the Zero Escape series. It's still got great puzzles, witty banter, tons of \"OH SHIT\" moments. Hell, even the mathematical logic themes I thought were great when put up to 999's pseudoscience & VLR's philosophy. It's just...everything feels like such a step down from VLR that ZTD ends up leading the series to a disappointing end. It doesn't end with a bang, but it doesn't end with a whimper.

Zero Time Dilemma is many things: it\u2019s the overarching conclusion to a cult sci-fi thriller series, it\u2019s an attempt to square every thread left unwind during the previous games, it is an experiment of how far will people passively accept faux-science in lieu of common sense; it\u2019s a thriller devoid of real suspense, a conspiracy story where the conspirators never show up, a sci-fi with so much fiction and so little science, a character driven drama where the characters are almost non-existent and lack any sort of humanity and coherent development. Zero Time Dilemma is many things, hardly any of them is good, well developed or new to the general audience.\n\nThe story itself won\u2019t require many spoilers as it is more of a giant meme than a serious narrative by this point. Uchikoshi Koutarou came back and decided to strip everything that made previous game enjoyable and memorable \u2013 the style, the characters, the mystery, the sci-fi implications \u2013 and instead decided to bring everything the players had previously know from the series to a climax consisting solely of SNAILS, of ANCIENT ALIENS and COMPLEX MOTIVES. \n\nCharacters still are probably the worst offenders of this game, even more so than the dumbed down puzzles and idiotic narrative: new characters are either disconnected completely from the plot or have one very specific role that is either fix the holes in the narrative or being a hole in the narrative; old characters are unrecognizable from their former selves and probably fit into the story even worse than their new counterparts. You would\u2019ve loved to see some of your favourite come back with their wits and humour to spice things up and get their deserved good ending? Too bad, instead everyone is now a massive unlikeable c-nt and they will gladly leave the centre stage to some lame bugger, like the kid with Yoko Taro\u2019s mask or Carlos.\n\nThe graphics are also at their lowest ever. The rigid models in Virtue\u2019s Last Reward were an offense to the eye but at least they stayed put and pretended to be sprites, now instead someone woke up and decided to try a full-fledged cinematographic approach by adding camera movements and panning over the models, probably just to show off their immense ugliness. The facial expressions are more comically rigid than ever, movements just robotically stiff and there is an impossible amount of time lost between unskippable idle animations during replays.\n\nMore often than not the game actively punishes you for thinking ahead about the possible solutions, as the most predictable and inconsequential answers will almost always be the correct ones, leaving one without the feeling of reward for actively solving the mystery but more like an accomplice to the huge joke that is the storytelling in this game.\n\nDo you feel the unsurmountable urge to complete each and everything you ever begin, have a fetish for train wrecks and C O M P L E X M O T I V E S, or generally like to enjoy your own anger?

This is coming from a non weeb, who thought 999 was just okay and VLR was good. The puzzles are fine as per usual, and I didn't mind the graphics, but the story is trash.\n\nThe pacing is awful, mainly because of the \"fragment\" system that the game uses to tell its story. The premise of the game is that each segment is 90 minutes long (not real time 90 minutes, but in universe time 90 minutes) and that once those 90 minutes are up, the characters get knocked out and lose their memory. These 90 minute segments make up the \"fragments\" that you can select from. They are given in a non linear order, with you having to piece together what comes before or after in these scenes. This seems like an interesting idea on paper, but it ruins the flow of the story. Scenes just start and stop abruptly and there often isn't a pay off to anything that you just did in these segments. Things don't really lead to one thing or another until you understand the full context of the story, and often times are meaningless in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the premise of the game itself. To \"win\" the game zero sets up, 6 of the 9 people in the game have to die. This obviously leads to a lot of moments where the characters die, but because of how often the characters die, there's really no emotional impact when someone dies.  Death becomes so meaningless that it's impossible to care when characters die, because you constantly see these characters die in each of the \"fragments\" that you play.\n\n The story can get promising at points, but completely falls apart at the end. The twists that the game tries to throw at you are laughably stupid. \n[spoiler] They introduce alien technology that can create copies of yourself and send these copies back in time. There is no mention of any aliens through out the whole series until this point, so this plot device comes out of fucking no where, and it's origins are never brought up or questioned. [/spoiler] \nAlso the reveal that  [spoiler] Zero is a tenth participant in the game, that is kept offscreen and hidden from the player, even though the other characters seem to have always known about him, but just decide to never ever bring him up at all (besides 1 time where it's implied that the characters are talking to a dog, and not the tenth player), or ever verbally question why their group has 4 people in it instead of 3. It's obvious that the only reason they kept this character hidden from the player is because the player would immediately suspect that he's zero, so they had to show the story in a \"dishonest\" way in order to BLOW YOUR MIND LMAO.  [/spoiler]\n\nThe characters are pretty hit or miss. I enjoyed Carlos and Sphere kid, but Mira and Eric seemed like they were just there to [spoiler] sperg out and dispense game overs. It's also sucks that they retcon the ending of VLR because K (who was supposedly going to play a big role in stopping radical 6), Clover and Alice are not in this game at all. [/spoiler]. The characters from the previous games come across as incredibly incompetent or often time just acted like completely new characters. The decision to make Junpei a drunken beat cop while his character design makes him look like an angsty fuck boy lead to some pretty funny moments\n\nOverall, the game is pretty disappointing. If you're played the previous 2 games and enjoyed them, then you're going to play this one regardless. Just don't get your hopes up, because this is clearly the worst game in the series. I guess you could say life is simply unfair...\n\nI give this game a final score of 1 snail out of 6 billion.\n", "timestamp_created": 1567117641, "timestamp_updated": 1567117641, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485764801502227783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54873714": {"recommendationid": "54873714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021757944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1468, "last_played": 1567026095}, "language": "english", "review": "I would like to mark as a neutral review but it goes like this.

The puzzles are of usual standard, but this time around the timeline/story branches just get a little bit too confusing. The story itself is, as usual, excellent and fascinating - but some branches will only unlock when certain (vague) requirements are met, and often you are left scratching your head as to how. Furthermore, it becomes imperative to remember and revisit old scenes to pick up passwords/clues etc, which would be fine... but it's actually quicker to boot up the internet and get the things for yourself. Which is a somewhat flawed element of the game as I never dreamed and did not do that in the previous two installments.\n\nSo all in all, if you are coming to or are looking to start with this one first, DON'T.

I strongly recommend playing the two games within the \"Zero Escape: The Nonary Games\" package (999 & Virtue's Last Reward) before playing ZTD.  There are recurring characters between the games, and the plot of VLR leads heavily into ZTD.\n\nI was initially hesitant to pick up these games since I generally steer clear of anime.  However, even though all 3 games are all puzzle oriented visual novels from Japan, I wouldn't really classify these games as anime.  The English voice actors are all pretty solid, though I find Clover a bit annoying.  This series really got me hooked because of its strong science-fiction elements.  \n\nTo avoid spoilers, I won't go into too much detail about all the sci-fi topics covered in Zero Escape.  A lot of sci-fi stories take a concept and make a permutation in a way that may or may not coincide with reality as we know it.  \n\nThe Zero Escape Games examine the consequences that would occur if elements of human consciousness could be transmitted wirelessly, or stored in a cloud in a limited sense.   And these games really run with that initial idea.  Zero Escape regularly invokes concepts from quantum mechanics, philosophy, and even fictional research results to validate the pseudo-science presented.  \n\nThis series is a crazy ride across branching timelines with numerous fatally bad endings.  The first two games are more mystery than psychological horror, with tension and conflict generated through several prisoner dilemma type decisions.  ZTD does however ramp up the gory consequences of your choices significantly.  As you learn more tidbits of information from all your ending failures, you'll start to learn more about your companions and their complexities for better or worse.  You'll really bond with some of them, and be shocked and disgusted by others.\n\nFortunately, the flowchart system provides a convenient way to swap between story branches that have already been completed, so you don't have to repeat content over and over to reach the multiple endings.  It is also possible to skip and fast forward through previously seen dialogue sections.\n\nThe only game I've played that is remotely similar to Zero Escape is the first Life Is Strange, but that game lasts for only 12-15 hours.  Each game in the Zero Escape Trilogy will probably run 15-20+ hours, unless you're really fast with the puzzles.\n\nZTD provides a mostly satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.  The art and presentation is significantly improved with the third installment, even if the animations can seem a bit robotic. Just be aware that some of the branching plot threads weave and intertwine in impossible ways, so expect to suspend disbelief a bit (e.g. Phi's brooch) and just enjoy the wild ride.", "timestamp_created": 1566713133, "timestamp_updated": 1566746445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54754550": {"recommendationid": "54754550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038814483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1566506102}, "language": "english", "review": "So after 25 hours of playing this game, I finished it.

Also the way the game works is a bit strange; you'll shift between different segments/fragments and doing specific actions in a specific fragment unlocks another one - etc. etc. The thing is that all these segments and fragments are non-chronological so the game asks a lot of attention and investment from you (but believe me, it's worth it in the end).\n\nThe game exists out of a lot of cinematic clips, making choices and finding your way out of rooms by completing puzzles. The last one was what made the game interesting for me. The puzzle rooms are really fun to complete even though some are really hard and completing them without pen and paper or calculator is almost impossible. Also the choices you have to make at the end of each room and their results kept me at the edge of my seat.\n\nThe storyline is really deep and sometimes confusing but if you invest some time and perhaps write some crucial things down, then you''ll get the hang of it. \n\nI never expected this game to be as much fun as i had with it.

I thought this was kinda interesting at first, but it becomes rather difficult to jungle all the plots points and character development the further you go.

Still, for people who played both Nonary Games, it probably merits a play.\n\nMore than 999 and VLR, ZTD focuses on moral choices and their consequences, with a darker presentation. For me, this was the game's strongest aspect\u2014crises manufactured to force the player to make the hard choices themselves. (Of course, player choice is a theme in Zero Escape, but ZTD steps it [b]way[/b] up.) At one point (in the \"Fire\" fragment, for those who are curious), my decision made me hold my hand up to my open mouth and stare for a while. In place of mechanisms like digital roots or color combinations, player decisions (and by extension, timeline divergences) revolve around these choices. Characters remain in separate groups of 3, but the player plays as all three group leaders throughout the story.\n\nBut for this one strength of [i]Zero Time Dilemma[/i], there are a plethora of weaknesses. Unfortunately, the game's structure and plot are disappointing. Basically, you're unaware of the structure of the narrative at the beginning, and have to fill it in yourself in fragments. You don't know where a fragment fits into the flowchart until you've completed it. This is an interesting idea, but it obviously takes a lot of precision to implement well, especially when the narrative heavily includes branching plotlines. There were too many points where I was at a loss for what to do to open up more of the flowchart. Then, beyond just the structure of the narrative, its actual contents really don't have a saving grace. It was messy, it was confusing, and it was even a bit frustrating. 999 is a great game with a self-contained plot. While VLR is clearly a different game than 999 with a higher-stakes plot, it at least made sense. Frankly, ZTD hardly feels like a member of the Zero Escape series to me.\n\nThe story in this game, in a big transition from other games, is presented in 3D-animated voice-acted cutscenes. This could be a plus or a minus for you, depending on preference. Fast readers won't always want to wait for the VA, not to mention that it isn't great in the first place. Subtitle readers will also have to deal with the occasional typo and misread line. However, the added depth of animation partially makes up for it, even if it is stilted at times. As for the puzzle rooms, they were good fun, but I still contend that 999 is the best in that regard. And, in my opinion, the soundtrack is good.

They've always been bad, and to be honest this series has desperately been in need of an option to skip them entirely from the start.

They're frontloaded here, you can finish all but one immediately and then it's nothing but story. \n\nOne character really sucks, but if you like ironically enjoying bad things then you might like him the most. I did. \n\nIn the end - and again, without spoilers - there are so many questions left unanswered. Some extremely basic questions. Fundamental questions. Despite this, the game will waste a lot of your time explaining basic things to you. This is the sort of game where a character can be reminded of an anagram and say, \"I remember, the anagram. An anagram is where you rearrange the letters to spell something else\" and have it not be a joke.

(Al principio parece bastante lioso y confuso, pero cuando desbloqueas varios, empiezas a ver el patr\u00f3n y la coherencia de los mismos). Los fragmentos se van desbloqueando por las decisiones que se toman en ellos (puedes re-jugar las decisiones para escoger una diferente y desbloquear m\u00e1s fragmentos). Est\u00e1 muy bien, aunque algunas decisiones son complicadas porque necesitas informaci\u00f3n que consigues m\u00e1s adelante o en diferentes historias, (con soluciones bastante sut\u00edles como un n\u00famero largo dicho durante una escena o una palabra dicha ah\u00ed perdida durante la trama) as\u00ed que se quedan bloqueos algo dif\u00edciles.\n\n+ Las habitaciones de escape est\u00e1n muy bien, son habitaciones llenas de puzzles que hay que resolver, muy al estilo de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de los 90. La pena es que son pocas (\u00bfunas 13?) y muy distanciadas entre tantas cinem\u00e1ticas.\n\n+ La historia que sigue a los 9 personajes, Est\u00e1 entretenida tambi\u00e9n, y los personajes tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n bien. En gr\u00e1ficos es simpl\u00f3n (creo que el juego se hizo originalmente para una consola m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a) pero el estilo manga encaja bien y le da un aire caracter\u00edstico.\n\nCONTRAS:\n\nx La jugabilidad est\u00e1 limitada. (M\u00e1s tiempo viendo escenas que jugando).\n\nx Sin rejugabilidad.

I was turned off of playing this after a mere few minutes, so keep in mind that I have made no substantial progress in the game and can only rag on the presentation. The visual novel aspects of the first games has been replaced with something more like an interactive movie, where you have to wait for each character to fully say their lines and automatically progress, which is fine if you want a movie but I personally can't stand being forced to wait. I want to read at my own pace even if it means cutting off dialogue mid-sentence because I've already read it. If you play visual novels the same way I do, you can't do it for this game, and if you enable the option to skip text, it skips multiple lines at a time, and the only way to read them is to go back in the log, at which point you're better off looking up a transcript of the game online. My last complaint is the character models. As other people have stated they are poorly animated and I personally find them unbearably slow. The mouth movements are not the least bit synced with the dialogue, and the textures are so low-res that I'd prefer the look of VLR.\nBut if you reaaaaally want to know what happens after the first two games then that may outweigh your complaints, but it didn't outweigh mine.", "timestamp_created": 1559698398, "timestamp_updated": 1559698398, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45648077130317688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51042178": {"recommendationid": "51042178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984598883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1245, "last_played": 1559618671}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ The conclusion to the Zero Escape saga...? It clears the major plot points set from the first two games, although some questions still very much remain at the conclusion.\n\n+ The visual style of 0E: ZTD is a huge improvement over the last game, trading the DeviantArt inspired models for a much more satisfying outlined, Catherine-esque style. Most characters look much more improved in this style.\n\n+ Some of the puzzles are at their most difficult in this sequel, with one room in particular being a considerable challenge.\n\n+ The most brutal entry in the series, one that doesn't shy away from actually showing you the violence (although it does have moments where it pans away from scenes as they happen for animation reasons).\n\n+ Voice acting is, imo, at its best in this finale to the series. Some of the voice deliveries are very well done for the scenes.\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- While I feel satisfied with the actual ending of the series, I feel a lot of irritation at how they explained away several glaring issues with the series. The final reveal of who Zero is is very weak and pulled out of thin air, but with the air of a \"GOtchya!\". Several issues with the story aren't explained adequately, the time travel gets extremely convoluted, and the spiritual direction the game takes is irritating when compared to the grounded story of the first game.\n\n- The game has a confusing and convoluted progression system that ruins pacing. Fragmented story was, honestly, not a great idea. It fits into the story thematically and they give a very good explanation for it, but overall the structure of how you experience the story destroys a lot of the pacing. For instance, one of the things you MUST do to unlock all the relevant endings is to experience all the outcomes of a vote. BUT, it's not immediately clear that you need to do so, and it is not immediately clear how you go about restarting the vote. You need to do the vote and then immediately swap to another perspective before you pass out. It's asinine. It also took a lot of the impact out of choices. \n\n- Despite a higher visual quality, ZTD has absolutely, positively, unquestionably the worst fucking animation I've ever seen in a videogame. Somehow it managed to beat VLR in terms of having the most lazy animation possible. Every scene is acted out as if it's the person's first time animating in 3D Space, with movements looking stiff and cycled. The camera does its best to hide this by panning away, but it fails to really hide how bad it is. What's more, truly emotional scenes happen and are brilliantly acted out by the Voice Actors, yet all of the emotion is sucked out of it simply due to how badly the scenes are animated.\n\n- Many of the player models (Zero especially) have a really low texture quality. \n\n- Music feels much more... weak, in this entry. In particular the one that plays for C Team, mostly when Junpei talks about how hard his life has been. It all feels incredibly cheesy and annoying.\n\n- Some characters are written very oddly, in particular Junpei.\n\n[h1] Overall: [/h1]\n\nI only recommend this game under the following:\n\n1. You played 1 & 2 and desperately need to know what happens next.\n2. This game is on sale.\n\nThe animation quality is enough to make me hate how this game was handled. There is a lot of potential in the 0E series that is woefully wasted here. Somehow, I feel as though it is the worst in the series, with the first game (The Nonary Game) being the best. So, f you are invested in 1&2's story, you HAVE to play 3 to see where the crazy train was going.

It is easier to be lost in ZTD than either of the previous two games, and it\u2019s flowchart, although initially appearing similar to VLR, is considerably more complicated. There are alternate methods of viewing the timeline in ZTD which assist with understanding the timeline.\n\nI can\u2019t stress enough just how fantastic the story is, bringing just as many surprises as VLR.  It also ties together the trilogy, in particular answering unanswered questions from VLR. The final ending in ZTD could be seen by some to be a little underwhelming \u2013 personally I didn\u2019t think that but I know others did so I thought it worth mentioning. There are after game files that offset that, if you have that reaction.\n\nIf you enjoyed 999 and VLR, you should definitely play ZTD. It was an amazing end to the Zero Escape Trilogy.

The characters wear bracelets which knock them out and erase their memory at 90-minute intervals, so every scene starts with them waking up in a new place with knowledge of the game in general, but no memory of the previous scenes.\n\nThe Fragment system is definitely the game's Achilles' heel. While it may seem at first like a highly personalized way of delivering a story \u2014 every player will experience it in a different order! \u2014 the developers probably realized that, in a game that relies so much on plot twists for emotional impact, it'd probably be a bad idea to let some players accidentally bump into a plot-crucial revelation, without any context, right at the beginning. (They did not follow this realization to its logical conclusion, that the entire Fragment system is lousy, but I digress.)\n\nTheir solution was to arbitrarily limit the scenes you can access by delivering them in sets. You have to explore every option in a single set (including every gameover) before unlocking the next one. The result is, ironically, a system that seems even [i]less[/i] personal than simple chronological decision-making, and more like crossing items off a shopping list. It doesn't matter which Fragments you pick when; you do all of them because you have to. And if that's the case, what is even the point?\n\nThe Fragment system ultimately ends up undoing a lot of the series' characteristic strengths which [i]Zero Time Dilemma[/i] might otherwise have been able to rely on. For one thing, cutting the puzzles off from the rest of the story really emphasizes the disconnect between gruesome horror and off-beat humor (usually reserved for puzzle flavor text), making the latter seem out of place.\n\nThere's no longer a single point-of-view character. Furthermore, the character teams for puzzle rooms are also always the same, meaning that not only are you likely to be stuck with someone you dislike in every puzzle, but the group dynamics are almost identical, which becomes increasingly obvious whenever you're forced to repeat the same Fragment with all three teams. Each has a leader, a chaotic neutral guy, and a girl who will have an extensive reaction to any moral choice you make. In the case of Akane and Phi, this is to explain that you're a horrible person every time you press the kill-your-friends button, which is not great when you're required to press the kill-your-friends button to get the next set of Fragments.\n\nRather than starting with a puzzle, the opening is about 20 minutes of repetitive Fragment cutscenes. None of the branch endings are very climactic, since you're stuck ping-ponging through out-of-context scenes in order to reach them.\n\nAnd of course, a lack of context between scenes makes bad, over-the-top twists even harder to swallow.\n\n[i]Virtue's Last Reward[/i] introduced a lot of revelations that greatly exceeded in magnitude those of the first game. [i]Zero Time Dilemma[/i], attempting the same on an exponential scale, was left to scrape the absolute bottom of the barrel for interesting plot twists. As a result, [i]Zero Time Dilemma[/i] a lot like [i]Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy[/i], in that it's not only bad, it's so series-crunchingly bad that it also actively sabotages your love of the games that were actually good.\n\nThere are many ways ZTD does this, including such bleach-your-brain twists as [spoiler]Phi being Sigma's daughter, the entirety of of VLR being a bad end of one ZTD timeline, and a bad memory-wipe retcon for Tenmyouji's character arc[/spoiler], but the biggest offender is its handling of Akane and Junpei, who, now sporting purple hairdos, only vaguely resemble their former selves.\n\nApparently, during the time Junpei spent with Seven searching for Akane in the criminal underground(???), he witnessed such Traumatic Events\u2122 that he claims to have lost faith in humanity and is now an alcoholic. He's \"done playing the action hero.\" Needless to say, [url=https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/143/657/d0b.jpg]this image of him as Junpei the Epser[/url] is no exaggeration.\n\nMeanwhile, Akane has been vacuum-pressed into a generic anime heroine who is at times grossly cutesy, overly maudlin, self-righteous, and yes, even yandere.\n\nGlancing at the early concept art and profiles included in the DLC artbook, I can kind of see what they were going for (I might have called Junpei's original outfit \"lovably dumb\"; the developers opted for \"childish\"), but the result is two mass-marketed, unlikable iterations of erstwhile charming and morally complex characters. They are so unrecognizable that the opening cutscene spends an awkward beat just revealing their identities.\n\nI can imagine this game might be enjoyable if it wasn't also a disappointment. The promotional art and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzNS8Ah139Y]the music[/url] is good. It might be a worthwhile purchase for people who have never played Zero Escape and have really low expectations.\n\nFor series veterans, don't bother for any reason. Any questions you have regarding Kyle, Dio, Snake, or Santa will not get answered. In fact, your time is probably better spent looking at [url=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/3d-render-beefburger-wheels-197855378]this picture of a hamburger[/url].

Is that where Zero got his name?\" And this is coming from someone who liked VLR's ending. And the plot holes. Oh laaaawd the plot holes! I can't go into any more detail without getting spoilery, so let's move on to...\n\nThe characters: are utterly unlikable.\n4 old faces join 5 new playable characters. I dislike the new Junpei (why did they make him so wanksty?) and ACTIVELY HATE every single character from Team Q. Zero II being whinier than Tidus didn't help matters, either.\n\nThe gameplay: is bad.\nI liked 3 of the puzzle chambers, of which there are only 13. And then there's Biolab. When was the last time YOU played a point-and-click adventure that was nigh-uncontrollable? You only need to be able to do two things: point and click.\n\nThe presentation: is horrific.\nWhat is wrong with their faces? It's like they attempted cel-shading but missed by a country mile. And the characters expressions are all so...wrong. Is this what low-functioning spectrumfolk see when they try to interpret emotions?\n\nTL;DR: look up something along the lines of \"Zero Escape wiki Phi\" online, repeat for Diana, watch the 10 hour version of nyan cat twice, then donate 40 USD to a charity (I recommend Doctors Without Borders).

Truly, when I review a game, I can usually say what is so good or so bad about it, but not with this game. This game messed with my head too much for me to say what's so great about it, but hell if I won't try.\nThe time travel elements within this series floors me every time; this game is no different. It seemed a little bit overwhelming at first with so many timeline fragments opening at once, but it's more straightforward than it seemed. The idea of involving how the player will retain information from different timelines in a way where the characters are aware that they know things they shouldn't is utterly fascinating, and something I've loved throughout the series.\nThis game builds upon the previous two, ramping up the mind-heckery and the existential dread. With the new premise being that *6 of the 9 trapped people* have to die for the others to escape, it kinda makes the player think \"How the hell do I get all of them out alive then?\" What I love about this game, and the predecessors, is how it makes you go through *failure after failure* before reaching that point of an epiphany.\nGameplay-wise, the puzzles are really fun and engaging, as well as difficult! You shouldn't have too much trouble as long as you're *observant*. I missed a bottle of water and that left me searching around the room for an extra 10 minutes just to find it. A lot of the time, the puzzles gave off the same epiphany like satisfaction that I mentioned before.\nAs for cons, I can't name off too many. I had trouble running the game after my first time running it, but was able to play after disabling anti-aliasing (MSAA). Otherwise with the core game, I can say there were some mouth synchronization issues, as well as kinda weak animation at certain points.\nTL;DR This game is a fantastic time travel, mind-hecking, psychological horror with great puzzles, and a conclusion to the series that I enjoyed.", "timestamp_created": 1548390596, "timestamp_updated": 1548390596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48525981": {"recommendationid": "48525981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025333761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1396, "last_played": 1548343330}, "language": "english", "review": "Zero Time Dilemma, the third game in the Zero Escape series, is very similar to its predecessors. They are each suspenseful visual novels about a group of people trapped in a bunker and forced to play mind games to the death. The Zero Escape series are among the best visual novels because they:\n- have branching storylines which have vitually no shared content between them.\n- have multiple endings which each give you a different point of view or insight on the main plot.\n- each include of a flowchat which allows you to easily skip back to any decision so you can explore other paths.\n- have escape room like segments which force you to think and add a bit of interactivity.\n- each have a mysterious Zero antagonist whose secret identity keeps you guessing until the very end.\n\nThat being said, I feel that Zero Time Dilemma is the worst game of the series because:\n- I felt that the \"decision game\", the main mind game featured in Zero Time Dilemma, is not as interesting intellectually as the main mind games in the previous installments for the series (the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game).\n- The identity of Zero II, this entry's main antagonist, was not as interesting or exciting as the identity of the main antagonist for previous installments. The flip side of this, however, is that his identity was at least original (was not a reused, rehashed idea from a previous Zero Escape game).\n- The plot started up too quickly (there was less confusion among the characters and lead up to the situation than I expected and was in previous installments), which might overwhelm players who have not played the first two Zero Escape games.\n- The plot was even more complex than previous entries due to the heavy use of science fiction elements.\n- The characters sometimes looked stiff and unrealistic when moving and their mouth movements did not always match up with what they were saying.\n\nDespite these downsides, it did have some advantages over the other games in the series:\n- The cutscenes were all done using 3D models, which was both a technological step-up and an interesting art departure from the previous installments.\n- For some decisions, you are given a box to put a character's name into. This allows for many different and creative answers, many more than could be done realistically with multiple choice.\n- It wrapped up most of the plot holes between the first and second games in the series.\n\nThough I liked the previous games in the series better, I enjoyed Zero Time Dilemma overall and would recommended it to friends, especially those which have played the first two installments in the Zero Escape series.", "timestamp_created": 1548348960, "timestamp_updated": 1573147097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48435066": {"recommendationid": "48435066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044034892", "num_games_owned": 888, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 819, "last_played": 1547962828}, "language": "english", "review": "First things first, [b] Do not play this without going through 999 and VLR!

Truly the best sci-fi / plot twist based games ever, and ZTD was more than satisfactory, despite leaving things a little unanswered.\n\nThis is less a review and more of a reply to not only the naysayers, but myself from 2 years ago.\n\nI still liked the game during its release, and wasn't as frustrated as the vocal minority back then that still spew their hatred on reddit and tumblr. However, outside of gameplay and artistic elements, there were story points that really didn't sit well with me, namely:\n\n[spoiler] Eric and Mira were terrible\nThe big reveal of Delta was cheap and not that great of a plot twist \nJunpei and Akane's actions seemed really off.\nThe romance between Junpei and Akane seemed unsatisfying\nDelta being the true mastermind of the series kinda hurt, after the game seemed to set Akane up as the mastermind.\nThe introduction of alien technology and Delta's mindhacking seemed a little deus ex machina and ill explained\nThe ending could've been more conclusive[/spoiler]\n\nAfter playing through for a second time, I believe I only still have a problem with the first two\n\n[spoiler] Eric is still the worst character in the entire series. Completely void of any character and inspires zero empathy. Mira is interesting in only what her actions provide, but she's still bad. In fact, they were essentially just the fodder required to make up the 9 players.\n\nIn retrospect, the reveal wasn't cheap, and was kinda well foreshadowed. It just wasn't that good. And honestly felt really try hard for a plot twist. We already had the hidden \"Zero\" amongst the cast with K and his suit in VLR, and Sigma being Zero.\n\nAs for the rest, I'm now satisfied. Playing through 999 and VLR gave enough context to make me realize Junpei was always kind of a jerk when his back was against the wall. And Akane was always the manipulative type to achieve her goals. And there was enough to assume both of them felt the same way toward each other\n\nAfter a second playthrough, I'm more warm to Delta as the big bad/good. Akane ruled with her own brilliance in \"that\" timeline, and her actions were necessary. But the history and conundrum Delta was presented with is equally as interesting, and his implementation, eben if left with holes, is somewhat hard to deny.\n\nI still believe the transporter pod was conceived specifically for making the series work, and is therefore a little desu ex machina. But it still makes complete sense, and in a universe where morphegenetic fields and \"unlimited universes and possibilities\" exist, it seems daft to deny somehwere, there was such an item.\n\nThe ending could have been better, and I think closure should have been brought further to the fore. But I also liked leaving it open ended. After all, the entire point of the series to this point is, there are unlimited possibilities. This gives the player a chance to come up with their own ending with the characters they love.\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nGameplay wise... this is probably weaker than VLR. The flowchart and AB game narrative device from VLR was vastly superior. The puzzle rooms were also stronger in VLR. SOme of the rooms in ZTD were fun, but some were also obnoxious and full of vague half hints. And let's not deny... the animation here is absolutely godawful. Thank god the voice acting was pretty good.\n\nSo, yeah, such a great game. I no longer have any time for people that feel other wise. It seems like they had a version in their head long before ZTD was released and couldn't accept it.

Virtue's Last Reward brought a host of new characters, missed maybe one jump in the scenario but did a geat job at introducing those (not only) new characters. Sigma and Phi were a great duo . So here we've got a trio of main characters : Carlos, Q and Diana. As this game takes place between the first (999) and the second (Virtue's Last Reward), we meet a bunch of \"old friends\" and newcomers.\n\nAnd to be honest, I wasn't excited when I began the game...And then, by the second half, like Virtue's Last Reward and maybe like 999, the game just took me to the heart and I couldn't stop until I finished it.\n\nI won't spoil the scenario any further and tell you that if I found 999 puzzles interesting and some of Virtue's ones hard (I played on hard on purpose), I didn't feel the same here, everything is pretty simple, and the main things are scenario-related, like some passwords you have to learn from the story, but it's still simple enough to not give you a headache.\n\nI think it's mandatory for you to play both the first installements before launching this one. Otherwise... I don't know, maybe you wouldn't be able to feel some revelations of the game at the same level as if you knew what happend before and after.... \n\nNonetheless, for the great moment I had, I give this one a solid 9,5/10...no 10 ? No, some details are left behind, some questions  of the global scenario are not answered and...well those are details...10/10 is just enough ;-) Enjoy !\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1536630888, "timestamp_updated": 1536630888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44605630": {"recommendationid": "44605630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122244584", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 1585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1585, "last_played": 1536267148}, "language": "english", "review": "This... is really just a good game in terms of story, as a follow-up to the previous two games in [i]Zero Escape: the Nonary Games[/i]. Though the ending leaves mixed feelings, there is a lot more clarity off of the second game in regards to what has happened, what will happen, what we need to try to do. Like the other games, it was good at providing interest in the characters as well, though they certainly didn't shy away from the time travel elements yet again, more present than ever.\n\nIn that way I need to recommend it, but there are some major aspects holding it back. Some people say that the Zero Escape series should never have moved on from 2D storytelling. With this game I can most definitely see that complaint. While the 3D art in [i]Virtue's Last Reward[/i] was passable, at least apart from some cutscenes, the 3D work here was much more noticably lacking by way of syncing dialogue with lip flaps, the 3D models clipping over bits of themselves, and overall just being more lacking by way of facial expressions. There are a couple truly psychotic characters though, so I'd be lying if I didn't say it worked in their favor sometimes.\n\nI also greatly dislike the \"fragments\" gameplay mechanic, in which the player doesn't know in when or within which timeline they have chosen to play through, until the story fragment has reached one conclusion or another. In fact, I was once stuck for more fragments to unlock because I didn't realize that one branch's ending had multiple results of one decision that was left up to chance. \n\nThis is a lot more confusing and creates less coherant of a story than the previous games, which allow you to follow a timeline beginning to end with the decisions you make, later providing you the option to simply go back and change your decisions to reach a different conclusion. This decision could be used to create some mysetery in that you aren't following a single protagonist anymore but switch your perspective between the different groups, so information is withheld this way. Needless to say, for the game to simply follow one character would have been much simpler for the player to have blinders on and not be as informed on what happened around them. It was a fair method to exercise, but came at the cost of the experience of the player in my opinion.\n\nBut, if you made it this far in the series? You want to know the conclusion to Zero Escape.

As for the cinematics, you'd think it'd be a step up from the traditional portrait-text-occasional-CG affair, and while it is used rather interestingly in the game, the animations [which are stiff, unnatural and very limited (You never see characters start/stop running, interacting with the environment without a cutaway, get killed off on-screen, etc.)] and the visual presentation of the game brings it down significantly. If it wasn't trying to compensate for the Nintendo 3DS, which was what this game was also released onto [As well as the PSVita and the PS4], it probably would've hit a lot harder with the attempt of a more realistic presentation.\n\nThat being said, it is still very much Zero Escape, with all the puzzles, plot twists and everything being (mostly) consistent with the other games. The story itself is enjoyable for the most part, even though there are a few points that I feel could use a bit of polish. The rooms' puzzles are more difficult at points than previous installments, however, to the point where I have a notebook filled with tiny pages of notes for rooms and the info certain scenes contained. When it comes to game-critical password entry screens, info can be hidden almost anywhere. By the time you get to the near-end of the game with only a few endings left to go, you'll still be asking too many more questions than is necessary [in my opinion at least]. The gameplay itself is solid though, and the story managed to surprise me several times.

They are on Steam, Zero Escape: The Nonary Games, and they are fucking amazing.\n\nNow onto this game and how it concludes this trilogy.\n\nWhile serviceable, ZTD never quites reach the quality of the 2 previous games. What bothered me the most was the animation and 3D models. The first game had the characters drawn in a nice anime style with pre-rendered backgrounds. This worked the best in my opinion and the game looked great. In the 2nd game, they moved to 3D model of the characters, and, maybe it was because I played that in the small screen of a 3DS, it looked fine.\n\nBut, playing ZTR in a 24 inch full HD screen, it just looks BAD. Even more disappointingly when you see the amazing art Rui Tomono had for the characters. The animations are stiff and the characters non-emotive. There's one scene where I had no idea if Diana was afraid or giggling, that's how bad it is. \n\nSo, the game functions similar to the 2nd game, Virtue's Last Reward, where you live, you die, you live again, this time in a different timeline where you made different choices. Using the knowledge of all different timelines you can reach the game's true ending. But honestly, it's not as good as the 2nd game mostly because it get's stale. In the 2nd game that was the whole gimmick, and you, the player, shifted together with Sigma, the protagonist. You really felt in the character's shoes, trying to fix the horrible situation they were in by trial-and-error in different timelines. \n\nNow, basically everyone can shift, and it just feels like you're playing a videogame and checking out wherever this path leads you before you try again with a different choice. \"But you're playing a videogame!\", yeah, but isn't great when you immerse yourself into a game so much, you forget you're playing one? That's what the second game does and the third game fails. \n\nMoving on, and before I talk about the plot, if you have played the The Nonary Games and is wondering if you should play this one the answer is YES. It should be obvious since my review is a thumbs-up, but I understand some people might be confused after I did nothing but trash the game up to this point. So let's talk about the plot and this means, spoilers!\n\nThe story is good as an ending to the Zero Escape Trilogy, but as a standalone, it's by far the weakest of the three. It get's much better during the 2nd half, after you finish all the puzzle rooms, but the beginning is such a chore. Since you can't blow your load and reveal all the mysteries, they spend some time developing the characters for mixed results. Eric is, by far, the worst character in the entire trilogy, Junpei is going through an weird phase, much more cynical than his previous appearances, and... yeah, I guess everyone else is fine. The biggest problem is caused by the separation of the cast. Unlike previous games, you only have 3 people interacting with each other for most of the game and again, it gets stale. Oh, here comes another scene of Akane trying to understand why Junpei is such an asshole now. Oh, now Eric is bullying Q again, etc, etc. That's why it gets much better in the second half when the groups start to meet each other.\n\nThe mysteries and revelations are good, but never quite pack the emotional punch of 999s twist or the mind bending of VLR. Still, it's good, it's just not as good. Which I guess isn't really something to be shameful of, you can't expect that level of quality being reached in every game.

Finishing ZTD was a nice send-off to the series and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles, especially with logic and advanced problem solving-- as well as visual novels. Personally, I suggest playing all of the games in order. I loved seeing old characters return and I feel that someone playing this game without having went through the first two would be a bit lost as to some of the symbolism and long-term meaning of relationships. I love the characters and the building of story and time, so this matters a lot to me, but it may not matter to some people who are just going in to solve the puzzles or try something different. The plot can be a bit overwhelming and kind of a convoluted mess, but that's why I love it.\n\nI do have a few nit-picks about the game-- my primary gripe is with the new fragment/flow system. I don't like how there isn't as much of an organized order to the way that you play, not because I feel like that's vital to the story, but because at some stages in the process I had trouble getting some fragments to unlock unless I played through a cinematic more than once. I feel like this really hindered me getting the purest experience I could of had-- seeing as I had already played through the cinematic once, not sure if it is a bug or just a glitch on my end. It was easily resolved and I was able to finish the game. The only other thing I can complain about is that the teams had different numbers of puzzles to solve, I don't feel like I actually spent a lot of time with Q-Team as compared to the others, but I know that was kind of on purpose.

Its definently worth it for ZE fans who enjoy the franchise and still does a lot of things right.Regardless, playing the previous two games first is a must for those who have not experienced the Zero Escape series besides the fact that the first two can be purchased as a bundle and with a cheaper price tag while being undoubtedly some of the best storytelling experiences in the genre.\n\nLet me just start this review off by saying i am a big fan of the Zero Escape series. The first 2 games of the trilogy are some of the best in the visual novel genre and are probably some of the best written stories in video game history.\nThat being said , this third game was close to not being a reality due to poor sales and only managed to be made due to demand by loyal fans albeit with a limited budget. I am aware that many fans were thoroughly dissapointed with this installment and to be honest, it was kind of a letdown for me too. Character developtment and writing was a lot more inconsistent and rough but still within acceptable standards. Some of the puzzle elements were just plain unnecessary and frustrating but this applies for all of the Zero Escape games. \nNevertheless, this game imho is still pretty decent, however compared to the previous two this game probably pales in comparison. Without spoiling too much, most of the characters (especially the returning ones) are pretty enjoyable once you get enough of their backstory and the twists are as mind blowingly absurd as they are in the other games. The unexpected but much darker setting of this game compared to the previous ones was also fitting for the game. It was a hard decision for me at first wheter to recommend this game or not, but i decided that it had done enough things right that the majority of it was a enjoyable and satisfying experience for me and ended up being a fitting conclusion to ZE franchise.\nSo for those still having doubts about getting this game, dont be disuaded by the negative reviews until youve truly experienced it yourself. \n\nFINAL VERDICT\n(3.5/5)\nSadly it seems like this installment of the series garnered the most public exposure but ended up being pretty mediocre compared to the previous games and undoubtedly caused some to lose interest.\nRegardless, this game is a must get for ZE fans but newer players should play the previous two first.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1531643339, "timestamp_updated": 1531643339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553105056285858154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43532892": {"recommendationid": "43532892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025400295", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 281, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1531598552}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great if you are a slow reader, because YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE SPEED OF DIALOGUE AND EVERYONE TALKS SLOW AS FUCK.", "timestamp_created": 1531602231, "timestamp_updated": 1531602231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441921621561050415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43463280": {"recommendationid": "43463280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042480003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1531260676}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]No spoilers review[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoy visual novels and time traveling stories I highly suggest you to check out Zero Escape series! Make sure to play in the right order, starting from 999 and VLR before playing this one (ZTD).\n\nThe animation in ZTD is a bit clunky, but considering the amount of animated scenes (I'd say roughly 20+ hours of animation) in the game it's no wonder and honestly, you do get used to it pretty soon. There was a minor problem with character mouths not always moving when they were speaking (Maybe they all are ventriloquists? Just kidding!)  The gore scenes were, as with the previous games, not very realistic and rather awkward but if you let yourself become immersed with the story they still get to you pretty bad.\n\nI didn't really like the Floating Fragment system and would have preferred to use only the Global Flowchart, yet the game makes it obligatory to use FF in some cases. I got so familiar with the flowchart in VLR that I wanted to continue using it in this one, and the floating fragments had me tearing my hair off in one part of the game when I couldn't figure out why a part of the timeline hadn't opened even though I had done everything required.\n\nThe puzzles were nice and sometimes pretty hard as you had to think outside of the box in some of them (which isn't a strength of mine). Make sure to either use the memo feature in the game or take some pen and paper for some serious brainstorming and for writing down clues to progress the game! \n\nFor the people who are looking for a game with lots of gameplay and puzzle solving, this might not be for you. ZTD is mainly a visual novel so if you don't enjoy watching the story for 90% of the time I suggest you skip this series entirely.

First, the game doesn't have the same impact, since you won't have a connection to the characters in the same way that you would if you have played pervious games in the series, as about half of the cast are reoccuring. Secondly, the game wouldn't make much sence in certain parts of the story, what the heck do you mean an old mans' brain in a young mans' body from the future?!?! And third, it is the weakest in the series - with the first game being the best. \n\nPros:\n\n[b]A Real Mindboggler[/b] - The biggest and most significant aspect of the entire series - the story. It's always been amazing in a weird wonderful way and Zero Time Dilemma is no exception. In true Zero Escape fashion the story only gets weirder, crazier, FASCINATING and harder and harder to explain to another human being the further you progress into it. In Zero Escape style one playthrough isn't enough either, it requires a multiple 100% playthrough in order to fully understand each characters' perspective and the overarching plotline and while this is the third installment of the series, time-wise it's actually the second. Those who finished VLR may already understand why. \n\n[b]Interesting Characters[/b] - For the most part these characters are interesting. Some are an enigma to be unravelled. Some have their dark issues yet to be revealed. Some are likeable favourites from previous games and some have complete character overhauls. Zero Time Escape have always had intriguing characters throughout the franchise and this is no exception.\n\n[b]Are Puzzles Harder?[/b] - Compared to VLR I actually think the puzzles are a little bit easier, which I found to be okay. I didn't really have any issues with any of the rooms except for maybe one or two - looking at you, weird card puzzle thing - but otherwise I could complete them without having to look up answers or having to go through too much mental gymnastics. Didn't feel like they were too easy either, being spoonfed answers. I will say however that the puzzles do not feel as inventive as they did in the previous games. \n\nCons:\n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - Again with these weird old Playstation 2-looking graphics. Didn't work for VLR, doesn't work now. They should have kept the cool looking 2D art style from the first game, personally. \n\n[b]Pacing[/b] - They talk reaaaaaaaaaaally slowly. Kind of takes some getting used to. Wish they would speed up the tempo, or atleast let me skip ahead.\n\n[b]Unskippable Cutscenes[/b] - There are several cutscenes throughout the game which are shared with multiple characters perspectives. The cutscenes themselves have about 90% similarity through each of them and you have to watch the same thing said from Zero over and over and over again.\n\n[b]Convoluted Timelines[/b] - In the past games, you pick a timeline and you see how it plays out before you go down another. Not in this one. In this one you jump from different universes and at different times. It's very easy to get lost and forget what is happening in a current timeline, it gets a little bit crazy.\n\nUltimately I definately recommend this for fans of the previous two games as it keeps its CRAZY storylines, characters and wraps up this wild ride known as Zero Escape.", "timestamp_created": 1530577635, "timestamp_updated": 1530578013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869717717170715332", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43233556": {"recommendationid": "43233556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000785750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1530499944}, "language": "english", "review": "I have 43 joyful hours invested in the original Nonary Game bundle (999, VLR).

From sub-par technical specs to poor writing/script/characterization and disjointed gameplay pacing, this game does not work. The character animation is stiff and the lips do not sync to the dialog resulting in PS2 levels of animatronic stiffness. The voice acting is cringe-inducingly bad for at least 3 of the 9 cast members (including some very important main characters).

When comparing it to the other Zero Escape games, it just doesn't stand up. The first red flag showed up as soon as the game started. It tries to shake up the classic visual novel style by making everything fully modeled and animated, which just did not work. At serious moments, the low quality of the animation and basically nonexistent lip-syncing destroys any tension. They lack if the player acting from the perspective of a single character ruins the sense of immersion that interactive stories should give. And the worst bit, for me at least, is that you can't move to the next line once you finish reading. The pace is slowed to a snail's pace, and I found myself just twiddling my thumbs waiting for the next line. This utterly fails as a VN.\nAnd as for being a Zero Escape game, the character's feel completely messed up. It can be somewhat understandable for some characters, but is just a mockery of others. Heck, they turned Junpie into the polar opposite of his personality in 999. While having a heel is needed, having a good amount of characters who solely exist to piss you off is a horrible decision. Admittedly, I've yet to force myself through the game, so I may not have reached a point where they redeem themselves. But that's the point. I feel like I have to trudge through the game hating the characters at worst, or having little interest in them at best. The only reason I'm compelled to play through is that I'm a big fan of the series and want to see the conclusion of the story.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of the series, don't get this game.

It has good music, it's entertaining enough and the non-linear storytelling not only makes sense, but I personally enjoyed it; however, since you obviously have to play the other games to play this one there are some issues that I just can't forgive:\n\n1. The puzzles: the puzzles are fine, maybe easier than the other games but the main issue is how quick the game gives you tips about how to solve them, essentially spoiling the answer.\n\n2. \"The Decision Game\": it's a boring system compared to 999 and VLR, a lot of the \"decisions\" aren't even decisions but input a password and most of the time the right and wrong decisions are painfully obvious.\n\n3. The death centered/gory scenes: I don't mind gore in general but this game makes you go through so many surreal and easily avoidable death scenes that it makes you not really care about people dying, whereas the previous game's deaths were shocking, unexpected and meaningful.\n\n3. The characters: without spoiling anything get ready to see certain characters from the other games  be completely different than they were, without any kind of character developement.\n\n4. The story is overall weaker with plot twists already used in the other games, fair amount of plot holes and an ending that could lead to another game even though this is supposed to bring closure to the trilogy.\n\n5. The graphics: I personally don't care about the graphics, this isn't the kind of game i expect mind blowing graphics from, but it is true that I found myself laughing at dramatic or tension-filled moments just because of how bad these were.\n\nI was disappointed by this game, especially with how many positive reviews it has, so maybe the key to liking this game enough to recommend it is not expecting much from it \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "timestamp_created": 1527953618, "timestamp_updated": 1527953618, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535449206829071045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42353618": {"recommendationid": "42353618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157705968", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1328, "last_played": 1527722404}, "language": "english", "review": "the graphics couldve been better , but I personally find it to be my favorite out of the trilogy .\nobviously , you must have played 999 and VLR to get a good concept of this game .", "timestamp_created": 1527568356, "timestamp_updated": 1527568390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42313658": {"recommendationid": "42313658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265243816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 851, "last_played": 1527434050}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the entire series.

Within the first 15 minutes you'll be fatally spoiled for both games, and most of the rest will be a mishmash of nonsense without knowing the rest of the story.\n\nZero II, the mastermind this time around, is unlike both of the previous Zeros -- he is an absolute monster, and the game is set up to be full of sadistic choices, murder opportunities, and wanton cruelty. ZTD itself is more violent, more bloody, and more cringe-inducing than both of its predecessors combined.\n\nOn the plus side, the general quality of the puzzles has improved, and the usual mind@#$@ of these games is taken to whole new levels. Everything mostly hangs together, and even if Zero II doesn't have the depth of character or interest factor of his predecessors, his plotting is just as airtight.\n\nOn the minus side, the decision was made to get away from the \"visual novel\" style and show cutscenes in the form of non-interactive movies. The character graphics are awful, rooted firmly in the Uncanny Valley, and conversations seem briefer in general, lacking the wonderful long tangents into physics and the supernatural of the previous two games.

VLR had a very clear flowchart you just kind of linearly follow each line by line.. this has snippets and segements floating around you just kind of chop and change between, it sounds clever given the story  but in actuality just feels lazy and disconnected, you don't feel in the dark on the story because it's mysterious and you don't know enough yet, you just feel like the system is poorly written.

Personally I didn't really feel that ZTD left things unexplained, I recommend reading the different cinematics that you get throughout the game since it explains a few things. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the entire Zero Escape series and really recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Danganronpa!", "timestamp_created": 1524416610, "timestamp_updated": 1524416610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540231704711914063", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41573627": {"recommendationid": "41573627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324796726", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4835, "last_played": 1554472629}, "language": "english", "review": "It's dark, it's violent, and it doesn't exactly wrap the whole trilogy of games up in a nice, neat little bow, but the puzzles are fun, the characters are interesting, and you'll learn a lot about logic and philosophy as you play.", "timestamp_created": 1524155053, "timestamp_updated": 1524155053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41563686": {"recommendationid": "41563686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002572406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 990, "last_played": 1699491173}, "language": "english", "review": "Video Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71G2GgZZaZY&list=PLTvlE65z5TIkLvyW8yKrZFzk_fPEU1iII&index=22", "timestamp_created": 1524101062, "timestamp_updated": 1524101062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41366269": {"recommendationid": "41366269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146395897", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1295, "last_played": 1505623072}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome story, it leaves you with many difficult situations where you have to pick a really hard choices", "timestamp_created": 1523206895, "timestamp_updated": 1523206895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41260658": {"recommendationid": "41260658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040093463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 996, "last_played": 1522806274}, "language": "english", "review": "This series is violent, dark, heart-warming and thought-provoking. \n\nNot necessarily intellectual...but also not unnecessarily.\n\nIt's difficult to talk about without spoiling anything.\n\nThis game is intended to be played as the finale of the triology of 999 and Virtue's Last Reward.

Obviously. It's pretty much the same, so it is good, as always. Not much more to add here. If you loved it in previous games, you'll love it here.\n\nStory presentation. Without spoiling anything, in previous games you had to finish some routes to progress through others. Here it's a little bit different. You don't follow the routes linearly, nor do you follow only one character. Instead, there are three separate teams and their routes are fragmented, chaotic, and you jump through events along those routes without knowing what is going on or why. At first it may be a bit disorientating, but you know what, it makes sense. It's great, because it fits the theme of the game and the plot. But it's also great because it's incredibly satisfying to piece the story together. I think I enjoyed this way of presentation even more than the way it was done in the other two games.\nHowever it comes with a slight minus. Since you are in direct control of all three teams, you basically always know what they did in certain situation. Which can decrease tension in certain moments, when characters are afraid of decisions the other team makes, while you know exactly what these decisions are.\n\nNow, to the things that aren't so good.\n\nFirst of all, graphics. It is straight up the ugliest game in the series.\nThe first one had fantastic animated sprites. The second went semi-3D. Which means while the models were 3D, they were still mostly used in the visual novel style, so no walking around, not many animations overall and thus not many chances to fuck these animations up. And while I personally didn't like the overall style of some characters (#NotMyClover), the models themselves weren't that bad.\nThis game, however, decided to ditch the visual novel bits and replaced it with fully animated cutscenes. And they are atrocious. The animations were done by an amateur. Lip-sync is virtually non-existent with characters often speaking with their mouths closed. Facial animations are laughable and ruin tension at times with how silly they are. Then there's hair and various objects that clip through characters' bodies. And of course, the textures are as bad as before.\nAnd it's not like you can just ignore this. Because everything that's not a puzzle is these cutscenes now. Awful.\n\nOn a plus side, with the game having these cutscenes in fully 3D environments, there is now room for more visual gore. Mind you, the game is still very much censored, there isn't THAT much graphic violence. But there are a few chunks of meat, pools of blood and some other delicious gory stuff that I won't spoil for you. It's nice.\n\nWhat isn't nice though is the new UI and control scheme.\nI played these games back to back. Switching from 1 to 2 was really easy, they barely changed the UI there. But 2 to 3 was kind of a frustrating experience. You can't just right-click to exit menus now, you have to click the \"back\" button. Annoying, but meh, not a big deal. What's worse though is that you can't reliably skip the dialogue lines. I'm a fast reader, despite English not being my first language. I read A LOT faster than the characters speak their lines. So in visual novels it's always nice to set the speed text to instant and then click through it at your own pace, without waiting for the character to finish talking. Here, however, like I said, the visual novels are replaced with cutscenes. Mind you, you can still skip the lines, but sometimes it skips the whole sections (that are probably tied to animations), which means you have to go back to log and re-read these. This is REALLY frustrating. Not being able to play a visual novel at my own pace is the last thing that I want.\n\nFinally, the story. Again, no spoilers here. But honestly, past the presentation part, I thought it was rather weak. A few reasons for this.\nThe plot \"twists\". Some were really obvious, some a bit less so and some were not foreshadowed at all. Like, absolutely 0 indication or clue that this or that would happen. And it's absolutely unacceptable for a mystery novel (or game).\nThe second game had that little \"Easter egg\" document in it with quotes from a detective writer about how a good detective story should look like and what it should avoid. Going though this game I was thinking: \"How the hell did you manage to add that little bit into your game without reading it yourselves?\". It takes practically everything that that author says not to do and does it. Worst of all is - overcomplicating their \"scientific\" explanations. Sure, Zero Escape series were always full of unnecessary expositions, with first one actually being the worst culprit, but here they are just so dull and unnecessarily overcomplicated (despite being simple in concept), that I was simply sitting there thinking \"please, just move on, I can't take it anymore...\".\nAnd that's why the remark in the beginning of the review about me loving Japanese games is important. I can deal with a lot of stuff. I don't have issues with, say, for example, 4-hour long intros in Persona series. But Zero Escape (the whole series, not just this game) really tested my patience with these exposition bits.\n\nThe culmination was meh. If you've played the previous games you know how they solve all their problems. Spoilers, [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler]. I can't say it's satisfying. In many ways it cheapens the experience and is anticlimactic. Not to mention it was done pretty poorly in some aspects of this story, with characters struggling with moral choice one second and completely ignoring them the other, whenever it's convenient for the plot.\n\nThe characters themselves were fine. I mean, it's hard to be worse than in 2nd game.\nJunpei's development makes sense. Akane is as frustrating as ever. Sigma is slightly less stupid now that you can't hear his thoughts. Phi is... still Phi. The newcomers are probably the worst (with the exception of Diana, who is amazing). I can't talk much about them without spoiling the game, so I won't. But let's just say that overall development of Q team was a cause of many facepalms during this playthrough.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, this is, in my opinion, the worst Zero Escape game. But I still enjoyed it in the end. This game is like that weird relative of yours. Odd, clumsy, a little stupid, but you still love him.\n\nObviously, I don't recommend this game to anyone who did not play other Zero Escape games. It will make no sense, just don't bother. But if you've played the other two and want just a little extra... well, at this point - why not? You're invested anyway.\nIf anything, it's worth it just to see Junpei's development.

I was either killing people or not killing people and there did not seem to be much by way of connection to anything.  It wasn't until much later in the game where everything started coming together and started making some kind of sense.  That is my complaint about this installment of the Zero Escape Series.

This fragmented form of story telling in my opinion made it the weakest of the three.  \nNow.. here is my dilemma.  This game left a lot of unanswered questions.  I don't know whether there was more plans to release a spin off, or another Zero Escape installment.  I chalk it up to leaving these \"questions\" in here so that way you can formulate your own theories about a few things.  Whatever the reasoning, they did manage to clear up the majority of the loose ends and tie things together quite well.  Do you really get the answers that you wanted when you saw the end to VLR?

This game nearly never happened, but thanks to the effort of the loyal fanbase and operation bluebird. Uchikoshi promised closure and no string would be left untied. And while, the ZTD was a wonderful game - I did not feel very satisfied by the ending. \n\nBut just because the ending ins't that great, the game itself is all I could expect from a Zero Escape Series installment. The puzzles are very thought invoking, and one of my favourite aspects of these games is including philosophical and moral conversations and choices. The themes in the Zero Escape Series and the story are mixed so welll together. [spoiler] One of my favourite parts of this game is the Monty Hall Problem.[/spoiler]\n\nI have to say, please don't play this game without playing 999 or VLR. It's a wonderful feeling finishing this game after having completed the previous 2; and things just slowly fit into place. Albeit, a little shakily, but it fits. It may not be the most satisfying ending, but it does okay to close up the series.\n\nIn my opinion, ZTD is the weakest out of all three games. My ranking of the games would probably be in the order they release; with 999 as number one, VLR as number two, and ZTD as number three. I agree with these other reviews too - it's definitely not a bad game, it's definitely worth the time, it's just the previous two games set expectations so high, it was basically impossible.\n\nThis game was still a classic Zero Escape game, in the way that it just hooks you in, right into the story and you can't stop. With segments of reading/visual novel, it's wonderful that the escape rooms feels so right and just balances out the story part as well. It attaches you to characters, even if you didn't like them that much.\n\nThe Zero Escape Series is my absolute favourite games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1518261526, "timestamp_updated": 1518261526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52649003267288208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39966666": {"recommendationid": "39966666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377407269", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1389, "last_played": 1518225899}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally got to play this third entry of my favorite visual novel series, and I'm really glad I did!

It was also one of the first attempts, to my knowledge, to bring the Cube (the movie) ideas to video game format, mixing horror, thriller and mystery novel and becoming somewhat of the \"What if Cube, Saw and Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None\" were anime\".\u00a0Virtue's Last Reward followed 3 years later on PS Vita and 3DS, and then in 2016\u00a0Zero Time Dilemma was released as a final chapter of the plot on the same systems, but also on PC.\n\nAs mentioned, all games are made with the same basic structure: most of the story is told via visual novel segments, which tend to have no puzzles or choices (though that gradually changes with every next game), while at times game switches to the escape the room puzzles, which require you to solve puzzles, find items and do the usual puzzle game stuff to get to the next visual novel bit. Another common concept is the idea of branching timelines and multiple endings. First game had very few of them and, as such, in the original version didn't have a Flow Chart for \"jumping\" between the timelines, but starting with the second game the timelines and jumps between them become much more complex. Being influenced by Cube and Saw, games also tend to deal with pretty dark themes and while it varies from game to game, it is common to expect lots of characters dying in horrible ways in different timelines with the main goal, usually, being finding the best possible solution where no one should die. Finally, I should really mention that the entire trilogy has absolutely amazing soundtrack by Shinji Hosoe and while very few tracks seem to be exclusive to a particular game and most themes repeat from game to game, the themes themselves are really good and it is a real shame that the soundtracks are not sold alongside the games.\n\nZero Time Dilemma in particular, though, is a mess. Most of it feels as if \"David Cage really liked Saw and was Japanese\", since instead of following on the cohesive storylines like in previous games, you're usually just presented with a scene, barely connected to other scenes (a common issue of Quantic Dream games). And then the scene develops, usually involving the escape the room segment, and then it ends with either everyone or some people dying in absolutely horrible shock value torture porn pointlessly brutal ways, or ending with less gore but then dropping the scene and asking you to go to another mostly disconnected one. There is a story reason for this structure and the 3 main characters instead of one approach does bring in curious possibilities for the story, but it's so dumb most of the time and very much not worth it. You will be watching people dying horribly and then going \"Oh, this reminds me of this famous philosophic dilemma!\" and proceeding to talk about it for several minutes (while still dying or in immediate danger of horrible death). And when everything has been explained, you'll see that barely anything has been resolved, and what was, was done in such an unnecessarily convoluted way that the whole experience feel like it wasn't worth it. And it really isn't worth it. There are rare smart moments, there are rare great puzzles.

It didn't come out as well as either of the previous games' stories, in my opinion, but it got the job done and left me somewhat satisfied.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe visuals were pretty enough although I hated the janky animations. The fact that mouths sometimes just didn't move at all when a character was talking, or that hair just ripped through bodies made it an annoying experience most of the time, but especially during intense scenes. I strongly preferred the more static visual novel style of VLR, but it didn't make ZTD unplayable by any means.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nMusic was good as always.

Scenes play out without you having to click to go to the next line and the scenes have a more 'cinematic' feel to them. So you are basically not allowed to do anything by yourself, except during the puzzle rooms and the decision games. It felt more like watching a movie than playing a game. During each of the long discussion scenes I felt my attention slip more than once, while this was never the case during previous games because I was forced to read and click, so I had to be looking at the screen.\nThe fact that jumping between fragments and teams was available from the very start made it so that not a single choice felt even remotely pressuring aside from that one in the AB game format. There wasn't a single time where I thought \"oh no, if I choose this now, they might choose this and screw me over, but what if they don't\". Nor was there any time where I actually legitimately felt bad for a choice that had a bad outcome for a certain team.\nAnother issue I had specifically with the fact that this is a port is that the memo feature is virtually unusable because drawing with a mouse sucks.

It's obvious they went for a style that was very much inspired by the West (TellTale Games), rather than sticking to the original VN style. The cinematic scenes, the (largely unnecessary) gore and fountains of blood, and the fact that some of the characters did OOC things just made me roll my eyes most of the time.\nAll in all I would say I recommend this game solely for the fact that it's the one that wraps up a lot of the story.", "timestamp_created": 1514989571, "timestamp_updated": 1514989571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559195578098297119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39005637": {"recommendationid": "39005637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452785514", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1283, "last_played": 1514735637}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Y con esto concluye Zero Escape.\nJugablemente sigue siendo lo t\u00edpico, muchas cinem\u00e1ticas y salas con puzzles. \nPero hablando francamente lo que realmente importa de este juego es la trama.

A pesar de que es uno de sus encantos, tambi\u00e9n puede volverse su punto d\u00e9bil. ZTD no es un mal juego, pero dentro de la saga pierde fuerza. Es dif\u00edcil hacer un buen final para una trilog\u00eda y, especialmente, cuando es tan esperado y no hay mucho presupuesto. La narrativa de ZTD a veces resulta confusa, ciertas cosas resultan forzadas (en mi opini\u00f3n, especialmente el final) y, teniendo en cuenta la saga completa, bastantes cosas quedan sin responder.\n\nEn ZTD se opt\u00f3 por cambiar de una manera un tanto dr\u00e1stica el gameplay, narrativa y visualmente. Desapareci\u00f3 la narraci\u00f3n literaria del protagonista y pas\u00f3 a ser 100% di\u00e1logo. No est\u00e1 mal hecho pero quita cierto nivel de inmersi\u00f3n del jugador. Esto, mezclado con que visualmente pas\u00f3 a ser 100% 3d y la acci\u00f3n/narraci\u00f3n depend\u00eda de di\u00e1logos y acciones de los personajes, fue un punto muy negativo. Por motivos de presupuesto, los modelos en cuanto a expresiones y movimiento no eran muy all\u00e1, lo que a la hora de crear tensi\u00f3n, emoci\u00f3n o una escena dram\u00e1tica puede revertir el efecto y hacer que resulte rid\u00edculo. Por suerte, la banda sonora de Shinji Hosoe compensa en muchos momentos por lo buena que es. En VLR la mec\u00e1nica de juego es similar, pero dada su narraci\u00f3n la tensi\u00f3n sigue presente mientras que en ZTD esa atm\u00f3sfera se pierde un poco. \n\nEn resumen; ZTD es un final para la trilog\u00eda un poco regular. No es un mal juego pero tampoco es un juego muy bueno. Sin embargo, lo sigo recomendado para los fans de saga, por el cari\u00f1o a la saga, porque ZTD sigue teniendo un valor nost\u00e1lgico por la presencia de personajes que salen en juegos anteriores, y porque los puzzles me resultaron entretenidos.", "timestamp_created": 1514919963, "timestamp_updated": 1514920330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38977402": {"recommendationid": "38977402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037349603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1470820912}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juegos a los que he jugado.

But 6 hours in I felt an overwhelming urge to play something else. That was months ago, and I just can't find the motivation to give it another chance when there are so many other time wasters out there. Unfortunately it's too late to demand my money back.\n\nNow this is a matter of taste, but ZTD's chaotic, disjointed storytelling structure bugs the hell out of me. I loved the precedessors because making a decision, and watching the consequences unfold before your eyes was so much fun. ZTD hops from scene to scene seemingly at random and you don't get to see the consequences of your actions until MUCH later.  This caused me to stop caring and just about killed the story for me. I don't care if it all comes together and starts to make sense 15+ hours in. I want a story right away, not disjointed puzzle pieces of one.\n\nI also didn't like how the story would 'end' repeatedly after ONE SINGLE ROOM. No, not the 'to be continued' kind of cliffhanger, but an actual ending. After. One. Room. Not just once, but every single time I did a room during those first 6 hours.\n\nI also felt that the story sequences were much shorter than in previous installments, though that could be because the animations are awkward and many of the voice actors amateurish at best. Plus some of the characters who appeared in the previous games have undergone off screen character development that felt forced and unbelievable.\n\np.s. those who say that the voice actors are good don't know what good voice acting sounds like.

I'll try not to include spoilers, but it'll be kind of hard without discussing my biggest gripe with the game.\n\nTl;Dr - The change from first-person view to outside observer of events killed the atmosphere and suspense, the game no longer has any meaningful mystery because you're given next to no clues on who's secretly killing people and who's Zero until the game is just suddenly ready to reveal their identities, Then some other minor gripes. Ultimately, though, you should probably play if you care about the overarching plot. \n\nFirst off, Atmosphere. The Nonary Games both had only partial voice acting, and were in traditional VN first-person view. This brought two things: Immersion, and focus on the environment. Both of those things were lost in Zero Time Dilemma. Sure, the music was just as unsettling, but it was played behind fully-voiced conversations, and the player was an outside observer instead of a participant in the Jigsaw-esque \"game\" the characters were part of.\n\nSecond, Horror. Sure, this could be part of atmosphere, but I think it deserves it's own footnote. In the Nonary games, when a character died, it was a terrifying thing to discover because you KNOW one of the other characters killed that guy, and you could totally be next. In Zero Time Dilemma, characters dying like that just brings an end to the memory fragment. That, combined with the altered atmosphere, just makes those scenes seem tragic instead of chilling.\n\nThird, this game lost it's \"whodunnit\" factor when it decided the player didn't deserve all the information to at least try to solve the mystery on their own. Who chopped up Junpei and strangled Mira in the third timeline? We never get any clues, just the answer.\n\nThen, there's the entire existence of a character named \"Q.\" When the game starts, you're told that \"Q\" is the kid wearing the helmet, but then you almost immediately learn that his name is actually Sean, but this \"Q\" character is still referenced, even though he is literally never shown until after you've seen the timeline where two children, \"Delta\" and \"Phi\" are born during the game's events. I continued to assume that Q and Sean were the same person until Delta revealed himself to be Q, and that happens at the same time we learn that a now-grown Delta (time travel, it's a Zero Escape game and timelines are not boundaries. There's a 22-year-old with the literal mind of a 67-year old.) has been there the whole time. We, the outside observer, are never, ever shown this character, and no, it's not because we've been secretly playing as him. We're Carlos, Sean, and Diana.\n\nAnyway, The fact that we are given next to no information on Q's existence ruins the potential to discover the truth for yourself. Yeah, he's locked in the game with the rest of you, but he's not a player, but he somehow is central to the plot.\n\nFourth, things get re-explained WAY TOO OFTEN!!! It would make sense if this were one of the older games and you had to restart at the beginning because you hit a bad end, but with the fragment timeline system in ZTD, there's no need. For example, Eric explains how he met fellow player Mira 3 times.\n\nFifth, there was a huge step back on the central theme of the games, which has been people with the ability to pull information from past, future, and alternate realities. In Virtue's Last Reward, the theme of \"noting is set in stone until it's observed\" expanded upon 9 hours 9 people 9 doors's light exploration into the theoretical \"Morphogenetic field,\" which allows you to, at the end of the game, complete a puzzle and send the information back in time to save a child's life.\nSixth, on the topic of the first game, you meet the protagonist from there again. Sure, they explain it away as part of the plot, but they turned him into an uncaring asshole.\n\nIf you played and enjoyed the Nonary Games, you need to play ZTD just in case they make a Zero Escape based on the \"happy end\" timeline from there. Though if they do that, I really hope it's a back-to-basics entry that plays out more like 999 or VLR than ZTD.", "timestamp_created": 1510530748, "timestamp_updated": 1510530748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36374653": {"recommendationid": "36374653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035913360", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1074, "last_played": 1509890633}, "language": "english", "review": "7.2/10\n\nThis game tries to live up to the extreme hype that the first two games in the series have built up over the years.

Everyone gets a backstory and everything you see and hear matters, and this is what makes the story and concept so likable.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a well writen story.", "timestamp_created": 1507849493, "timestamp_updated": 1507849493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35623740": {"recommendationid": "35623740", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997036304", "num_games_owned": 3150, "num_reviews": 406, "playtime_forever": 1774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1774, "last_played": 1507655293}, "language": "english", "review": "A great way for the end of the third Zero Escape game!

I also think most of the puzzles on this game were better than most of the puzzles on the other games (of course, there are exceptions), i think that because the puzzles on this one are more about decifrating codes and finding passwords than doing math based minigames (nothing wrong with that, i just think it got very annoying in the other games). There's also one important thing that differs this game from the others, the story is not told in a linear way, you play through fragments and later you find out what actually happened and how these fragments matched with other fragments, initially i hated this, i thought it was confusing and ruined the storytelling, but as i continued playing, i noticed it's not that bad, mainly when things start to make sense. \nSo, after all, what makes this one worst than the other ones? Well, i'll start by stating that the story is overall weaker than in the other 2 games, but that isn't so much of a problem, because it's still rather interesting, what i actually disliked a lot about this game were the poorly made plot twists near the end, don't get me wrong, there are some plot twists in this game that turns the other 2 games around, but mainly the final 2 ones, involving the mastermind and his \"complex motives\" that are NEVER entirely explained, i won't spoil it for you, but it does ruin the experience a little bit.\nWell, so in conclusion, the game is weaker than the other 2, but not bad, and if you played the other 2 and want to finish the story, you totally should play this.", "timestamp_created": 1504298018, "timestamp_updated": 1504298018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713091731071472168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34658124": {"recommendationid": "34658124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002600769", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1304, "last_played": 1504266792}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet, just like this review\nGotta play the \"Nonary games\" for context though.

I would say the graphics have a comic book style feel.  I really did appreciate it, especially when compared against the other two games in the series.  I also felt the voice acting was drastically better, although I hated zero\u2019s English voice actor so much that I played the game with the Japanese voice actors and English subs.  I also felt the puzzles were drastically better then Virtues Last Reward.  There were a few that made absolutely no sense, but for the most part I felt they were well done.\n\nI will say that I felt the way the menus for the time flows were laid out just was terrible.  Most of the time I had no idea what I was supposed to be clicking on or where.  It\u2019s divided into story fragments menus, global flow menus, and character flow menus.  I guess it was kind of fun to do a character menu scene and then after see where it appeared on the global flow and if that\u2019s entirely how you picked things that would be fine, but eventually it gets to the point where you have to go into sub menus of the character flow menu to find the right path or clicking on the global flow menu and then choosing paths from there to find the character path.  It was too much.  I guess if the plan was to have the menu\u2019s be its own puzzle then job well done\u2026but I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t, which means it was just poorly designed.\n\nDespite that if the story was good I would recommend the game, but it\u2019s just not.  I don\u2019t understand why people praise the story of this series.  First, this game is a direct sequel so it\u2019s not like you can skip the other games.  You\u2019ll be utterly lost if you haven\u2019t played the others.  Which is certainly fine, but the way character act and the way the story is laid out makes no sense.  You fine yourselves at a Mars simulation in the desert, maybe in Nevada.  You have all agreed to be part of this test because the organization was paying people $500k to participate (I\u2019m not sure  who thought that was an accurate number, no one is paying people that much money for this.  Especially, a group of randos with no real skills).  You are then captured by someone calling himself Zero and forced into a death trap game in a bunker where 6/9 of you will die. So again it sets up a murder mystery\u2026but it\u2019s just so utterly terribly told and just a mess at every turn, explaining why would all involve spoilers though.\n\n[spoiler] First, so long as you\u2019ve played the other games it takes all of 2 hours to figure out every single mystery in the game except who is Zero.  It has the same problem of Virutes Last Reward, but at least thankfully this game is shorter.  So you only have to wait about 20 hours after figuring everything out for the characters to admit it.  Such as it\u2019s painfully obvious Sigma and Diana are the parents of Phi\u2026to the point where I\u2019m not sure if this was supposed to be a mystery or not.  Diana and Phi constantly act like mother and daughter\u2026so when it\u2019s revealed at the very end they are and the characters act surprised I was just utterly baffled.  \n\nThere is also a subplot that one of the characters is a serial killer (not zero, I mean another serial killer).  I mean it\u2019s Mira, their isn\u2019t even a question.  She acts like a sociopath in everything she says and Sean\u2019s hint that he knows about a serial killer so painfully points to Mira that it\u2019s just ridiculous.  Again\u2026since it was so obvious I\u2019m not even sure if it was a mystery.\n\nSo really the only mystery in the game is who is zero and it\u2019s an unsolvable mystery.  Zero is a character that you have never heard of.  See it turns out Zero is really Phi\u2019s twin brother Delta who Sigma and Diana put in an alien teleporter that teleported him to the year 1904 where he was raised by German scientists (and I mean clearly he became a Nazi, there is no way this lunatic that performs horrendous experiments on people wasn\u2019t one of Hitler\u2019s top scientists).  He came up with this master plan in order to fix the paradox that if he didn\u2019t put people in this death trap game he would never have been born, because he gets conceived in the death trap game\u2026except it\u2019s not a paradox, so there was no reason for him to do this.  He exists simply because the teleporter sent him to a world where he exists\u2026there was absolutely no reason for him to recreate the circumstances where he was born.\n\nOh yea, I should also mention the entire game is an unreliable narrator.  It turns out Zero was part of your group of 9 the whole time and it was really a group of 10.  They just never really mention or reference him and I guess it\u2019s supposed to be that the player is him.  It\u2019s a cheap twist.  It takes the genius of Agatha Christie\u2019s twist in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and bastardizes it.  The game literally could have done that twist though and it would have been genius.  All it would have required was the game telling you that you are the character of Delta and everything is seen through your eyes and the characters could have directly been talking to you.  That\u2019s not what happens here, no one really acknowledges Delta\u2019s existence, he\u2019s apparently there in every scene, but no one mentions him at all.  Clues all certainly point to him existing, but the game tries very hard to obfuscate that.  \n\nThe game wanted a grand twist at the end, but that twist also ruins the murder mystery occurring in the game.  I guess a lot of people don\u2019t care.  They seem to think this twist is a masterstroke, but I can\u2019t really accept it.  It\u2019s just too many logical leaps. (1) that when characters talk about Q, they mean Delta and not the robot who the game makes you think is Q (2) That Delta is a 124 year old man who is the son of Sigma and Diana who was sent back in time in an alien teleporter (3) That Delta/Q is Zero and their motive for putting everyone together is to stop a terrorist in the future form killing 8 billion people so really he\u2019s a good guy.  Even if you could make the logical leap that hey wait this is weird the game doesn\u2019t seem to be talking about the robot boy when they are saying Q\u2026their must secretly be a 10th person here which is me\u2026and if they are doing that it must mean that Q is Zero!  I don\u2019t see how then you can connect the motive of\u2026he must be doing all these horrible things in order to stop terrorists from wiping out humanity.  This point is literally never even brought up until the very end of the game, so you couldn\u2019t possibly know this was the motive.\n\nI guess the game is a serviceable time travel scifi story.  I don\u2019t care for it because I dislike the twist that it deals with alien teleporter technology.  Also the ending where everyone is now friends with Mira\u2026who again is still a brutal serial killer\u2026who they all remember specifically murdering everyone in the game as well as the dozens she killed outside the game, but apparently is now sorry so it\u2019s alright (what serial killer has ever said, oh I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m going to be a nice person now).

It doesn't play like a traditional VN, it's more of a Telltale style--a really low budget TT game.\n\nI don't put that lightly. This game has horrendous models that make VLR's look good by comparison, and it also has the most stilted, stiff, and just downright terrible animation I think I have ever seen in a game this popular. It looks absolutely awful. As for the voice acting, it's hit and miss. It's servicable overall but it's not as good as VLR's. Nearly every escape puzzle is terrible in ZTD as well. There's a couple interesting ideas here and there, but the game feels a need to make every room feel like a scavenger hunt. Unlike VLR where the puzzles were consistently challenging and logical, ZTD tends to present solutions that will either warrant a reaction of \"oh, come on!\" or \"how in the hell was I supposed to know that?!\"\n\nZTD's puzzles are not hard. They work almost exclusively in a manner where the most challenging part is finding wherever the hell Zero decided to hide every piece you need. If a puzzle seems impossible, it's simply because it is. However, unlike in VLR where characters would tell you when you were wasting your time and didn't have enough clues, ZTD's cast is often as oblivious as you are, resulting in indefinite times of trial and error. You'll often become irritated not because you weren't smart enough to figure out a simple solution, but because that answer was hidden away in some corner you wouldn't have considered to look in.

The game is so far worse than the first two that it's really hard to recommend.\n\nFirst, don't even think about the game without having played the prequels: The game would make no sense whatsoever, and you'd have trouble caring at all about any of the characters.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game? I'll do my best to avoid spoilers for the previous two games, but if you want to remain unspoiled, just play them before reading: They are more than worthwhile on their own.\n\n1) Graphics. While the game might is newer, and the prequels were not technical masterpieces, This one is so ugly it's unsettling. The facial expressions are so grotesque, they'll have you wishing for Mass Effect: Andromeda. It's not as if I expected good animation, but the few frames of animation that were selected could't make characters seem much less human. A couple are passable, but the large majority should just be redone.\n\n2)Splitting the game into fragments. Unlike the previous games, where we got to play a branching tree, from start to end, here we get to play a wide series of fragments, most of which involving very few characters, and maybe a puzzle in the middle. The fragment system makes each scene have to stand on its own. This makes all the sections that are attempting to get emotional responses from the player to fall far more flat, because you could be getting them way before you have a chance to investing in the characters at all. \n\n3)In previous games, every decision led to more and more changes later, and thus we just got to see the narrative play differently, and especially in the second game, made it far easier for the player to navigate the game in a satisfying way. However, since we have fragments here, and we don't know what the next step is, the game instead wants us to just make a decision, and immendiately follow with the opposite one, as that's the way to move forward. How can I get invested into making a decision if the consequences will be instantly erased in a couple of minutes? this makes the game mechanical. For extra boredom, there are a few situations that are very similar to each other, so you face the same decisions over and over again, and you will pick both. It's the definition of how to kill the mood.\n\n4) The game plays more like a video than like a visual novel: There's a button to speed up, but it often will end up skipping text. So at any time that the dialogue is moving slowly (and there's a lot of that), you end up missing entire sections, instead of just being able to move at the speed at which you can read.\n\n5) It breaks a couple of conventions of the series in ways that just make the storytelling feel cheaper.\n\nSo ultimately, this is the worst game of the series by a country mile.

Except for the name, i struggled a bit recognizing them here, to be honest. they use the same excuse for that fact again, but you get quickly used to the new design (if you could stand VLR that is).\n\nThe story told is still good, and it answers several questions you might had after the first two games (but not all). The way it is told you could also dislike being a fan of the earlier titles, tho. It's in short episodes of 5-15min, you can play in a semi-random order. early episodes add the classic escape rooms and a decision, the later episodes are mainly for story-conclusions. speaking of the rooms, they are as difficult as in 999, so not even close to VLR. you should finish a room in 10-30 minutes on average (if you don't get stuck because you overlooked the multiple ways of using a coin *like me*) without much paper work. I think that's fine, probably because the rooms didn't felt like the center of the story anymore (it's more about the decision game afterwards). \n\nOverall, It was a nice game and I enjoyed it more than The Walking Dead, but it still wasn't what I was expecting, so I love it a little less than 999&VLR. The price feels high for the playtime you get, so maybe grab it on sale (but get it).  \n\n\nfor new players:\nyou should probably play the other games first, but it is really not a must. Be warned that it, if you don't, maybe ruins the earlier games for you, because it reveals most of the main plots of 999 & VLR in the first 1-2 hours of the game. These can feel like the game is throwing kinda nonsense-explanations at you nonstop, and you might are not used to that. The characters have never time to explain the whole thing, so they buzzword bingo especially early in the game. If you played the nonary games, you got hours to slowly learn the ideas and truths in the Zero Escape universe. If you just play ZTD, you will have to except them pretty quickly, or else you get that bad scifi-fanfiction vibe (which can still be fun, nevertheless) and might lose interest. they even add more layers to their concept for the veterans, so try not to get lost.\n\nThe puzzles in ZTD are not too difficult and the NPCs give you a lot of tipps how to solve some of the problems (if needed). It is fun to see the story fold out fragment after fragment and you should definitely take the time to make some own theories how the story will end, who zero is and what this is all about. this might be easier (again) with more backstory, but the game tells you what you need to know along the line, except some of the fan service bits which are not really main-story-relevant. there could be plot/explanation holes I am not aware off because i played all games, but i felt they were pretty consistent in themselves.

If you're dying to see how the story turns out, watch a lets-play or read the spoilers on the wiki. I honestly don't think you'll be missing anything. Here's why I think that:\n\n(I take a roundabout way of framing this review. Feel free to skip a few paragraphs down if you want to skip to the meat of my thoughts on the game.)\n\nEvery once in a while, you find a game that is truly great, and leaves you wanting, desperate for more. And sometimes they decide to make those games into a series. You know the next ones won't be the same as the first, but you're so attached to the characters and world that you want to see where it goes. Soul Reaver was one of those games for me, and I had a similar experience with the Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game.\n\nWhen I read the rest of Ender's series, it was different. Not as good, but not without merit either. Very different though. It's an ethical examination at the intersection of a handful of hypothetical sci-fi situations, not the story of a boy trying to make his way in a confusing world. I'm glad I didn't read the later ones right after the first, because it gave it time for it to exist in my mind as an independent thing. A complete work in and of itself. Nonetheless, I was glad I eventually read the rest. They weren't the same, but they were good in their own right. After 999, I felt the same about VLR.\n\nHowever, when I played the later Soul Reaver games, I was deeply disappointed. They just threw the characters into circumstances that in many ways contradicted the previous ones. There was a half decent plot twist, but for the most part they were crappy. I felt like they added nothing to my experience. I would have probably been happier had I never played them. Completely without merit. After 999 and VLR, that's how I felt about ZTD.\n\n\n(Ok, here's where I start the real review)\n\nThe game uses a \"fragment system.\" The characters each have a short episode with typically involves waking with no memory, doing a room-escape and then a plot decission, and typically ends with the injection of meds that erase their memories of the episode. So to capture the feel of that, the game is presented in a series of disjointed, nonsequental chapters. You click on a team and a pic, and you get thrown into the middle of a story with no idea how it fits in with the rest of the story. It's a great idea, and I respect the developers for trying something more experimental, but in practice it runs into a few problems. \n\nFirst, I would imagine a terrific sense of isolation and disorientation if I imagnie being in that situation, which I think is what they were going for. They don't manage to pull it off though. The characters wake up and briefly discuss their lack of memories, but then go about solving their puzzles. Sometimes they wake up missing a person with no explanation, and there's some overly dramatic running and shouting. But they never really develop the characters enough that you get emotionally invested. Perhaps because the reactions are so dramatic, the characters so plastic, that it just is hard to relate.\n\nSecond, you really aren't that isolated. You click a button and it takes you to a flowchart that shows exactly where you are in the scheme of things. It's trivial to say \"oh, they can't find this character, because this is an offshoot of that plot line. Yea, I know what happened.\" \n\nAnd third (and perhaps my biggest issue), the fragments just don't affect each other that much. I mean, they open up different puzzles and situations, but there's no reason for them to. Q team makes a decission about an injection, and the results for Q are identical. I mean, it changes the room the next group wakes up in, but there's no reason for it. In terms of meaningful decissions, there was one big one at the beginning, then one in the middle with Phi and Sigma, but otherwise they were all pretty meaningless. VLR felt like \"I'm going to make good decissions to try to save everyone! I wonder if I can do it!\" but this is more like \"I've no idea why this choice matters, but i'm going to try both options to unlock more story pieces!\"\n\nThe developers made one other decission that I feel was a big mistake. They decided to have three teams that almost never interact with each other, and you could control each individually. This had two major problems. First, they had no protagonist. You can control all the characters and events through each of their eyes. And if each of the character does what you ask them to do and never make their own decissions, they really become shells of characters. You aren't always trying to guess what such and such a character was thinking when they made their decission, because ultimate you'll see them make both, and then see the game's writers try to justify how the choice fit with the character.\n\nAlso, when you control each member of the group, there's no delimma in the prisoner's delimma. In VLR you were always trying to guess what the other characters would decide. Here, you control them and make them do what you want. Logically, it's so much simpler and less interesting. Except then in some situations, one character will make big decissions by themselves or take major actions without the player observing. The disconnect is very confusing. Ultimately, it's hard to make a mystery when you seem to see everything.\n\nThe last problem... the game was painfully simple. This ties in tightly with my previous concern about the teams being isolated and choices not mattering, but also just simply the length of the storylines. VLR's storyline let you make 3-5 decissions, making around 20 fully fleshed out endings. Excluding \"they made the wrong choice and everyone immediately died\" kind of decissions, ZTD had  1-3, for maybe 10 endings (A few of those are so simple, I'm reluctant to count them as real endings). Maybe 5 that felt as involved as the simplest VLR ones. \n\nLet's look at the line where C-team dies in first decission. After the character introduction and first choice (C's execution), we see team Q. They do a puzzle then make a decission that does not affect the other team. Next we see team D (in one of two rooms, depending on the choice Q made, but without any reason Q's choice should have changed their room). On both branches, D solves a room puzzle, has a chance to die, and then a final cutscene plays and the game is over. There's some final minor decissions tacked onto one of the branches, along the lines of \"what does the person left behind do with himself\" but nothing complex and nothing that influences any other characters. So there you have it 2 meaningful decissions, 1 meaningless decission, 3 or 4 fragments of things happening, and the game's over. That accounts for 2 of the 10 endings, or 20% of the game.\n\n\nThere were a handful of little things too. \"Guess the word\" style typed questions. The game asks \"Who are you going to shoot?\" I type \"noone\" and it doesn't recognize it so I assume I have to shoot someone... I read a faq later and find out it'll accept \"nobody\" though. Also, they introduce a new character right at the end, like \"oh, he's been sitting around forever. We all knew about him; remember we referred to 'the old guy' once in one scene? We thought he was catatonic though, so we just ignored him.\" Seriously, that's just bad writing. Also, some solutions to puzzles are \"do it alot.\" When the villian says \"You'll die unless you roll 1s on 3 dice\" I never imagined the solution was just \"replay the scene multiple times, because eventually you'll hit all 1s and that storyline will continue.\"\n\nI really was disappointed. VLR wasn't 999, but it was alright.

The escape rooms have a lot of repeat puzzles. One type of puzzle re-appeared in 4 different escape rooms. It isn't even a particulary interesting type of puzzle. Granted, the 999 series has always had repeated puzzles, but usually you would only see repeats in the final escape room. The real cool feature of hard mode versions of puzzles from VLR is also missing from the game. It was cool to be able to solve a puzzle multiple ways. The game also basically gives you the solution to some puzzles if you don't solve it right away. This is really annoying because some puzzles require you to look at an item in your inventory before you solve it. The game still has some interesting puzzles though.\n\nHow the game handles some of its characters is also lacking. Compared to the rest of the series, the character design is really low-key. Part of the 999 series' appeal is the flashy characters, Due to the nature of how the game works, some really unatural characterization is forced on an important character. It doesn't really add up with the character's history, despite how they try and justify it. Furthermore, the character is even made ignorant of knowledge they should know at this point. It also doesn't help that some of the animation is really low quality, so you get some wonky facial expressions from some characters.\n\nThankfully, the story still has the signature craziness of a 999 game. It certainly goes places. Although it also unfortunately fails to resolve some hanging plot threads from VLR. It does leave an opening for a sequel, but to be honest, I'd be happy if the series ends with this game.\n\nOverall, I did end up enjoying the game a fair amount, so if your a fan of the previous 2 games you should definitely pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1496467628, "timestamp_updated": 1496468979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888125598430633545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32120927": {"recommendationid": "32120927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142557826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 845, "last_played": 1508479404}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, let's talk about Zero. In the first game, Zero was a mysterious and intimidating menace. The kind of character who was a man of few words, but every word he spoke had value. The second Zero was the opposite. He was sort of like the Joker, as evil as can be, but yet somehow charming and charismatic. Then we have this Zero... who is honestly so fucking boring I don't even care who it is anymore. He goes on and on and ON in such a monotone voice you will have tuned him out by his second sentence. \n\nI know the game is a visual novel, and I have no problems with a game that is 90% exposition. But if you are going to have the narrative be your main focus, then that narrative better not suck. This game's dialogue is so bad it made me want to gag.\n\nSo how are the characters? They are worse. They are so badly written you can literally define them in 2-3 words. We have the whiney guy, the jerk guy, the over sensitive teen girl, etc. The only character I even found slightly interesting was Carlos, because he is the only one who isn't painfully annoying.\n\nAnd I understand that they had practically no budget. I am very aware of \"Operation Bluebird\" and how this game nearly never existed to begin with. But the animation still had no excuse to be this bad. There are single individuals capable of doing BETTER animation using FREE SOFTWARE then what we have here. \n\nBut the worst part... this is an adventure game where you can't explore. You just get knocked out and magically teleport from room to room. Yaaaaaay.

But there are so many issues I can't even think where to start at :D \nI will keep this review spoiler-free as much as I can.\n\nOkay. First of all. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY COMPLETED THE NONARY GAMES. Zero Time Dilemma (ZTD) is the third game in this franchise and is a huge (literally massive) spoiler that will completely ruin/destroy/outrage your potential 999 and VLR experience. \nLet me use an analogy here. You are about to watch \"The sixth sense\" or \"Fight club\" and your jerk-friend spoils you the ending in the first 5 minutes. This is pretty much the same deal with Zero Escape series. Just play it the way it is meant to be played (C). 999 -> VLR -> ZTD.\n\nNow the game itself. ZTD can be described as a Visual Novel (pretty much interactive movie here) with a substantial amount of choises that ACTUALLY create multiple branches of the story (take that telltale games!). And from time to time you will find yourself in a room you need to find escape from. The game turns into point-and-click mode and you have to solve escape-the-room puzzles that are actually interesting and well designed. And the goal of the game is to unravel the spiderweb of this story to reach the complicated conclusion. \n\nThe problem of ZTD comes from... well... pretty much everything in this game is done worse that in previous installments of the series: \n- The 3D graphics looks okay but essentially outdated. \n- The puzzles are easier and involves less grey matter (you could say less inspiring...ish). \n- The story is too messy and unclean. After brilliant (no jokes here) nonary games the plot of ZTD falls flat. It might sound complicated but imagine if Zero Scape series developed its own Zero Escape Knox's ten commandments. And ZTD takes a huge dump ontop of these developed \"rules\" the story SHOULD work. Especially after creating so powerfull buildup in VLR. This supposed to be the conclusion to the series! Goddamnit! [spoiler] Alens and mind hack. Nope. JUST NOPE. [/spoiler]\n- Characters are weak. Well I know we are supposed to KNOW these guys (at least 4 of them) from previous games but there are zero to none character development compared to 999 and VLR. And OMG I hate Q-team. I've counted exactly ONE emotional moment caused by my own deep connection to characters [spoiler] D-Team and the Incinerator [/spoiler]. ONE! FREAKING ONE! I was creating pools of masculine tears in 999 and VLR. Here is not the case.\n\nBut let's lighten up the mood. The plot is still interesting and unique, the graphics are good enough to fully enjoy the game, the puzzles are holding well and most of the characters are still worth meeting (even if you played 999 and VLR). The voice acting is still great.\n\nTL;DR. If you played 999 and VLR this game is worth checking. It is a good game. It's just not a mindblowing masterpiece like previous ones. And it is definetly not as great as you expect from long awaited trilogy crescendo.

Welcome to \"OH MY GOD, CAN WE JUST KILL Q TEAM?!\" Q team had some of the most annoying cast in the whole game. And where you used to love Akane and Junpei from the first game, they come off kinda annoying in this one as well. Only D team tends to be enjoyable as Phi and Sigma and Diana tend to keep their character personality the same as the second game.\n\nThe animations of course were really poor and made some of the scenes just funny to watch. Voice acting was great though and the artwork has always been nice. I wish they would of went back to the visual novel 2D style of 999 or only used brief 3D visuals like in Virtues Last Reward.\n\nThe puzzles were still pretty fun and the long branching paths were enjoyable as well. You can definitley play this one if you haven't played the other 2, but be warned, it's nothing compared to 999 and VLR. Plus it will be confusing since it will constantly reffer back to the other 2 games. \n\nI want to suggest it, but I really can't. Even if this game is meant for a Zero Escape fan like myself, it was just such a huge letdown. I still had fun with it, but it could of been way better. It's like maybe their whole staff changed or somethin, because there is a HUGE difference between everything within the last two games and Zero Time Dilemma.", "timestamp_created": 1493602732, "timestamp_updated": 1493602732, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575619161128997803", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31472142": {"recommendationid": "31472142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092668799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1493583764}, "language": "english", "review": "I have mixed feelings about this game.

I'm gonna say this is easily the weakest of the triology, but in the end I enjoyed playing it, despite my disliking it at first.\n\nThe main issue with this game is that its got a very blatent identity crisis going on. This is a game that ONLY exists becuase of the Zero Escape fan base, those that are even bigger fans then me. Without them, the sales of the first two games aren't really good enough for sequels. Its by their passionate support that the game creators can point at and say 'there is audience for this.'. This game sets out to answers the major lingering plot lines of VLR, but ends up leaving a lot of questions unanswered; some of which were stated WOULD be answered here. \n\nThe other side of the game however... this is a game that feels like its was made to try to appeal to a larger portion of gamers... I guess I can understand that from a business sense but they do it by pretty much dropping or weakening a lot of the elements that made people fans of the first two games. The biggest being dropping the visual novel format which seems to feed into the idea people don't want to read anything anymore. Everything plays out in cutscenes that makes it hard to memorize plot crtiical details, since in the last two if there was information that NEEDED to be remembered, you could not advance the dialogue and write it down to save for later. Here you've got to rewatch cut scenes multiple times in case you want to be sure you got it right, as sometimes stuff flashes past before you're even ready for it. \n\nAlong these same lines, it feels like the majority of the puzzles are easier to solve, only one really feels like its on the same level as some of the previous ones. It feels like puzzles here are a distraction then actual game play, just so there IS game play, as otherwise this ends up being mostly an interactive moive of just chosing wither to do something or not. \n\nThe game at least has much of the clever writing and deep story as the first two, though there is one element of blatent dues ex machina that feels like it was just made as a solution to writing out of some of the corners they end up written into. There's no real explination for why it exist, its just does and has for a long time apparently. \n\nThe changes to how the story is handled doesn't really help either, while I got used to it and one particular twist made me kinda enjoy it in the end; I still would have prefered a more 'Point A to B to C or D, etc'  story rather then 'Point A, to B, to D or f to E or maybe d...' way that this game just skips around... like an episodic show being aired out of order. It leaves you lost and confused... and that kinda works since that's how the characters can feel as well... it just doesn't fully gel with me. Nor the fact that there's no mix'n'match with the characters. Team D is always Team D, while in the previous games your teams got shuffled up allowing for more character interaction. \n\nCharacter is another kinda issue here. Five new characters, and only half of them are kinda interesting. Two are player characters feels like we get to know them fairly well, with one tied into the overall ZE plot and the other just being a decent character with good reasons for doing what he does.  A half point goes to a third that just has a really interesting story once it gets revealed, but the character is very generic up  till then. The other two, one feels like a retread of a character we've gotten at least twice before, and the other is just bland with nothing that really stands out about him even with tragic backstory. He just mostly seems along for the ride... \n\n\nIn the end, you're probably only going to really like this is your a fan of the Zero Escape series, I think anyone new to the series would end up gettign turned off by all the front loaded lore that gets put into here, even if its done by secondary characters.", "timestamp_created": 1493178424, "timestamp_updated": 1493178424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554896116256713867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31345742": {"recommendationid": "31345742", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972223037", "num_games_owned": 1091, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1635, "last_played": 1493009446}, "language": "english", "review": "and incredible--unforgettable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1493065766, "timestamp_updated": 1493065766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31336131": {"recommendationid": "31336131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030878029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1310, "last_played": 1493025465}, "language": "english", "review": "The first two games (Especially the first) were brilliant.

It does shine during the occasional action filled cutscene though.\n\nThankfully, the Japanese voice acting is always excellent, and by focusing on the subtitles, one can still easily immerse themselves in the story.\n\nOn the puzzle side though, ZTD is a massive improvement over VLR thanks to smooth controls adapted to the PC screen, and there are fewer calculation based puzzles which were always a chore (remember the food one in the infirmary at VLR? Sigma even mentioned its difficulty). The graphics here are superb and quality.\n\nAs for the story, it takes an ambitious fragmented approach to storytelling.

I loved VLR and waited over a year to be able to play 999 (didn\u2019t have a DS or apple device). My love for the series has allowed me to overlook most of the faults in the previous games, but sadly it\u2019s not enough to approve this third title.\n\nIf you want a quick summary of my thoughts, here it goes:\nThis game is made for fans only. Almost all the drama comes from the previously established characters. The puzzles are easily the worst in the series. The graphics and animation are indefensible. The music and voice acting are great in some places and laughable in others. In fact the only thing I can praise this game on is the story and boy does it have a slow start and a poor end\u2026 Or lack there of\u2026\nOnly play this game is you absolutely need more Zero Escape in your life!\n\nIf you want an in depth review:\n\nGraphics, Animation, and Presentation: Everyone looks like a Hollister manikin being rendered on a Playstation 1. They\u2019re bad, moving on.\n\nPuzzles: The game has a few puzzles I promise. For me it took almost 6 hours before I found one\u2026 That was 6 hours of cut scenes with the occasional interaction before I found myself actually playing a game.\nWith each Zero Escape game I took it on myself to never use a guide, and save two rooms from VLR (if you played it you know which ones I\u2019m talking about) this worked out fine... Do not do this with Zero Time Dilemma! Not only are these puzzles the worst in the series, but they are also the hardest-No, not hard\u2026 Vague. Two rooms in particular kept me locked in for over an hour as I tried to figure out what it wanted me to do. So please, if you find yourself in the Transporter Room or the Rec Room look up the codes online and save yourself the mental torture.\n\nCharacters: Initially you are introduced to nine characters like in the other games. You will see the 4 remaining characters and then the quite bland looking new ones\u2026 And my God how they make you try to care about them. The first half of this game is an explanation on why you should care about these brand new people. And by the end? Well half of them fit in, the other 2 not only don\u2019t, but are the most annoying characters in the entire series with Eric being a whinny, oh so very whinny version of Dio with none of the sarcasm, and Mira being all the worst parts of Alice and Lotus, with none of the\u2026 Emotion of any kind.\nThe worst part is how the 9 characters are stuck in 3 groups of 3 that hardly ever interact except for at the end. It's essentially if they had a Marvel/DC/Darkhorse cross-over where each group of characters stayed miles apart except for the last issue... What would be the point? The two previous protagonists\u2019 spend a 20 hour game less than a foot ball field apart but have on one or two conversations... Why?!\n\nStory: First off it\u2019s only fair to say that he dead expressions of the characters, the God awful animation, and the low poly models made enjoying the story a trial of it\u2019s own. So many serious scenes had be laughing because of how they would play out on screen. The silly faces made. The constant clipping. The speaking through a closed mouth\u2026 Well, you\u2019ve been warned.\nThe story in the middle kept me hooked with constant twists and revelations; easily the best part of the game. The beginning is bogged down by being 10 hours of \u2018no no these people are cool I promise\u2019. And the last 4-5 hours fill you with questions and leave you with very few answers\u2026 Oh that\u2019s right. This series doesn\u2019t actually close itself off. I triple checked to make sure I have 100% the game, and yet I am left with dozens and dozens of questions, most of which pertaining to plot holes and potential plot holes. This has more plot holes than the rest of the series combined.\nAfter seeing the final scene the first thing out of my mouth was \u2018well then what was the point\u2019! If you were looking for closure this is not for you.\n\nGenerally stupid things in this game:\n-\u201c4 digit number using a 0-9 keypad. That\u2019s over 100,000 combinations!\u201d\n-If a room is dark everyone becomes blind, deaf, numb, and stupid.\n-Sneak attacks with a revved chainsaw.\n-Near point blank Mexican standoff with a grenade launcher\n-The Q reveal\n-The password entry screens\n-The Mouse and Keyboard Controls\n\nAll in all I'm glad I played it, and it was defiantly a ride. I liked some things they added (wont mention for spoiler reasons). I disliked some things they added (like how you are forced to play the game out of order or how characters are stuck in changing groups of 3). And I hate how it left off on such a giant middle finger to the fans... But I can't bring myself to hate the game.

You REALLY shouldn't play it before you've played other two games first, or you not only won't understand or feel complicity to much of the events and key scenes without knowing their background, you'll also will see lots of spoilers for those previous titles. It's not a big problem since first and second games are almost out in steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/477740/ \n\nNow, about ZTD - I liked it much. Combined with experience from all games of Zero Escape series, the last one provide tightly intertwined plot of mysteries which will reveal meanings of everything you thought was illogical of irrelevant and everything you haven't though of or haven't expected. You'll get lots of unpredictable turnarounds and twists where every detail from narrative to game design elements is thoroughly planned to fit into director's key ideas about overall plot.\n\nCharacters are deep and well-written despite being a bit overly fantastic at times. I could say same about whole story too - it feels sometimes too implausible and caught within it's own paradoxes, through I could never tell that director did a bad job there. Maybe that's just my natural reaction to it's overcomplicated nature (which in the end allows some events with most powerful impact on player even happen to begin with). I ended deeply impressed and interested in almost every character from the story.\n\nAlso, ZTD due to game fragmentary structure has most varying scenes and situations of all three games in the series, and those fragments are really interesting and very distinct from one and other. \nThe first drawback here is game structure itself: choice system is not like you've accustomed to in Telltale or other interactive movie genre games. Although lots of hard choices and dilemmas are present, due to the game core principles and main idea you'll end up replaying choices and picking out another solutions to them over again, even those ones you really don't like and wanted to avoid (imagine you've tried so hard to prevent horrible and agonizing death of some character and now game forces you to replay the episode and allow that death happen).\n\nZTD is weaker than it's predecessors in terms of puzzles which are easiest in the series, and will end up too early, leaving you with smth about 4 hrs interactive movie till the end. Some of them are really cool with unseen before features while some being sadly repetative and dull.\n\nDevelopers hadn't much funds so their first game not in VN-style but in interactive movies genre (or adventure, if you want) with lots of camera work, dynamic and animations - ZTD has visual drawbacks too. Guys were trying hard, but you'll still won't miss repetitive cameras, low graphics and poor animations. However, I got into the game and pass this drawback pretty quickly. \n\nIt's also a shocking and sometimes gory experience, so take care.\n\nThese sentences about drawbacks were warning for those, who could consider to buy this game or not. It was absolutely must play for me, and this game touched me to the heart in the end and I'm really recommending it to all Zero Escape series fans, Kotaro Uchikoshi really did amazing job here.

I will address each of you in this review. But first, for two of those groups of people, I am giving you a link to the first two games in this series, which at the time I am writing this review will be available on Steam in approximately three weeks. http://steamcommunity.com/app/477740 Indeed, this is the third game in an established series.\n\nSo! The first group. You haven't played any of the Zero Escape games before. If you want to get the greatest possible enjoyment out of this game, you really should play the first two installments. Honestly! But, let's say you won't do that. Alright, you strange person. Then you should at least play... oh, VLR first. Please! But, let's say you won't do that either. You are a very silly person indeed. Fine. What you will get is a wonderful visual novel with three characters to choose from, each going through rather different experiences as a result of who they are and who they are stuck with. You will triumph, fail, get blood on your hands, die, and be horrified. You will also be surprised and probably have your mind blown too, but not as much as it could have been. You will also not get the same sense of comraderie or horror that comes with already being quite familiar with the several characters that come from 999 and VLR. You will enjoy this game if you relish those experiences, but you could enjoy it more.\n\nNow, the second group. You actually have two variations among you. One variation has played 999 and not VLR, the other has played VLR and not 999. If you are the ones who played 999, I strongly urge you to play VLR before you play this game. If you are the ones who played VLR, I highly recommend playing 999. Either way, as one Zero Escape fan to another, I just want you to know that you should play the other game before this one. Need a reason? Plot. Need another? Better head explosion. Need another? Um, well, I don't want to risk spoilers. Alright, but let's say you don't intend to take my advice for you own unfortunate and unfathomable reasons. Those who have played 999 will enjoy the familiar company and the horror aspect that is much like what you found in 999. Those who have played VLR will enjoy the familiar company and the, um, stuff. You will enjoy this game, this I believe! But, you will be missing out. 999 players a bit more so than VLR players, because reasons.\n\nNow, the third group. Let's be honest: Most of you in this group probably don't care what we have to say. As long as you see that this game rightfully has very positive reviews, you are going to play this game. There are those of you however who want to be convinced. The short of it is that if you liked, especially if you loved, the first two games, you will be quite happy to play this game, and it is worth it. Still not convinced? Look, the story has been building up to this. There are still so many questions you need answered. You don't even know all of the questions that need answering. Face it: you need these answers. The formula is a little different in this one, and its not quite like the other two. This is good. It is something unique and special, and it will be a ride.\n\nThe fourth group. You know you don't need this review. You've already played this game! Unless you are here writing a review, I'm not certain why you're here... Are you here to tell me that it isn't over, and there's still more to do? Sign me up for additional head explosions, yes please!\n\nThe Zero Escape series sits among my all-time favourite games, which include the Portal series, Red Dead Redemption, and Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.

I waited with bated breath for Zero Time Dilemma, but quickly discovered that I should not have held my expectations so high. The animation is janky, the dialogue is awkward, and the once interesting plot is bogged down by so many holes that the few clever reveals and twists are not enough to save it. Unless you can get this game for near free then I recommend you watch the cutscenes on YouTube because it will be a slog. What started as a series about time travelling consciousnesses has turned into a 20-hour trek through Wikipedia selecting related articles on parallel worlds, Sophistry, quantum theory, and fallacies. \n\nThe puzzles are few and far between and are remarkably simple. The ones that are more difficult basically require brute force to solve. Of course, puzzles are subjective, so it's fair to say for some they will be harder so I won't spend too much time here. The controls are a little broken so I often found myself clicking where I didn't want to click and zooming in or out when I wanted to look around or interact with something. \n\nWithout going into too much detail to avoid spoilers I will say that the biggest reveal is only possible because the game deliberately lies to and tricks you through omission. Think Heavy Rain here. If you don't mind spoilers then theseGame FAQ links will detail everything for you (although without context it might not make sense) https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/175993-zero-escape-zero-time-dilemma/74031394 \nhttps://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/175993-zero-escape-zero-time-dilemma/74019274?jumpto=60\n\nFinally, the game frequently breaks its own lore and logic and makes mistakes with its own assertions by ignoring the mathmatical and logical facts of things like the gambler's fallacy to make its timeline seem fair. And much like Mass Effect 3, it sets you up with a series of seemingly consequential choices that in the end only result in you playing to the result it wanted.\n\nGreat concept, poor execution.

I hate the game uses the \"cinematic\" style but Fails To understand the very basics of cinematic language itself (SHOW. DO. NOT. TELL.). I hate the games ending and its failure to decide if it wants to be a \"cliffhanger\" (Which, mind you IT CANT due to, you know... FINALE) or a \"happy\" ending. I hate the fact that MANY Gaming Journalist's have given this game \"Matsterpiece! 10/10\" \"9/10\" \"PERFECTION!\"  \"UCHIKOSHI'S DONE IT AGAIN!\" (Mind you the fact, you know, HE WROTE ONLY 1/3 OF THE ENTIRE GAME!) and other high scores the game does not deserve at all.\n\nAnd yet im not mad. Oh yeah i was mad when the game came out at first, but now  im dissapointed. Why?..... i just pity it for not being the zero escape i wanted, nor the community at large wants. if this came out in 2013, there would be alot of anger. Why? This is not the zero escape 3 WE wanted.  Operation Blue Bird did not fight for this mess. We did not deserve this garbage. yet the\"spike chunsoft wont let me make this\"  uchikosi message, made us fight. and then some spike chunsoft got the message and got an idea, to \"restart\" the game production, but only giving them a small budget and time constrats so they had to rush it. and so it was. in 2014 a cryptic teaser site called 4infinty debuted with a countdown  and words related to the game, and evrey gaming outlet reported it. Now, somewhere in america, a little boy heard that news too. and wondered.\"whats going on with this wierd site?\" and visted a fourm. it said it was related to a game called 999. he had heard of the game, but never really played it. so he got the ios version. and although confused at first by the games ending, he looked it up. and said \"ohhhhhh i get it :)\" then he played vlr next, after frustraion that the countdown ended with \"nothing\" he was VERY liking it. and while he was playing it, he got the news ther WOULD be a zero escape 3. He was happy in the knowlege that after he finished it, in a year, he play ze3 and have a satifying ending. Well..... SImply put That boy was ME. This is NOT ze3.\nThis is not the game OBB Expected to play.\nOperation blue bird did not win.\n\nin fact they , no me..., no... EVERY zero escape fan did not win.\n\nAll of us, were simply expolited. Even of Uchikosi, Who had a bad run of stupid mastakes, during \"resumed\" development.\n\nHe to, expoited us in some way with his poor choices\n\nThis is an expoitation of our money by spike chusoft after seeing that blue bird.\n\nI dont care about the release order, Play ZTD after 999, and after that play VLR. Then you A: Be more \"satifed\" and less angrier than me. B: end your experience with a WORTHWILE conclusion, Even though it was the inteded cliffhanger. Even though im not \"recommending\" this, your probaly gonna play this anyway. Because vlr ends on a cliffhanger that leads to this.

Pick-up objects, manipulate items and combine them, push buttons, sorting, logic puzzles and (bad) mazes. Its all here.  Expect a couple of incoherent logical leaps, but these are few.  The game really does give a nice mix that never seems to overstay on one mechanic.\n\nThe story and characters are somewhat of a drag.  Many events feel (and are) very forced, and character motivations and arcs (what few there are) are vapid and usually without much meaning.  This is the third title in a triology, and as a game trading heavily on its story it really doesnt have a lot ot show for it.  There are some twists, but they arent mind blowing, or having much payoff.  They seem to only exist.  There are worse narratives take part of, but this game's lackluster storyline being so central to it certainly hurt it.\n\nThe visuals are tremendously dated.  This was a PS Vita port, and the upscale shows. Everything is cel shaded, and quizzically looks plastic and glossy.  Animations are reused to annoyance, and the colors clash.  The backgrounds for rooms are dingy and drab, but that is part of the overall aesthetic.  If you're ok with a game looking like a budget title, this isnt a deal breaker. \n\nThe sound doesnt standout, or get in the way. The game has its only atmosphere and the muted sound designs helps sell it.  \n\nOverall the game isnt bad, but its not great.  As the third game in the series its a noticeable step back, but remains enjoyable.  Fans of the series may be split on the narrative, but puzzlers will be amused.

And so it begs the question: why am I the one choosing the order that this conversation happens in? I don't freakin' care what order they discuss these topics! Same thing happens with the so-called puzzles. The ones I made it through  - a Prisoner's Dilemma-esque situation - weren't even remotely puzzle-like. Sure, I was given a choice of where to put a vote but it was arbitrary. I was just picking a story branch. But who the hell thinks that is fun? Why am I picking the story branch?

So if you can, do it. Or just wait for them to be released on Steam.\n\nWell but sadly, I'm not sure what to think of Zero Time Dilemma. The title gives you the feeling that every decision is going to be really important and you have like no time to think about it.. but that's not the case. The decisions are just \"click or don't click\" or \"do this or don't do it\". Most of the puzzles are really easy and they do not take you long. What I think is worse, is that the puzzles repeat themselves. You just do the exact same thing over and over again, it gets boring. And the few special puzzles that actually take you time to solve were ridiculously hard (at least in my opinion.) The puzzles in 999 and VLR were harder, but not too hard and they were different every time. Also, there are so many plot holes and a lot of things are just not explained. \"Yeah, we're gonna explain everything we left open in VLR!\" Uhmmm no, you didn't, you only made everything we knew more confusing. But if you haven't played the games before, I guess you would be even more confused. Also, the models are not the highest quality and quite glitchy. The hair of the girls is the worst, it's almost always inside their bodies or the physics do funny stuff. But hey Miras boobs wiggle, that was important huh? They have just a few facial expressions which leads to some funny scenes, even in situations when it's not supposed to be funny. (But when it is, it really is hilarious!) One thing I quite enjoyed were the interactions between the characters and the (sadly almost non-existent) development of the relationships. It felt natural most of the time, at least when we're talking about Team-A and Team-D. But I also have to admit that the characters we already knew were very different and kind of out-of-character. And one last thing, we just pretend that the ending never happened. It was SO unsatisfying. In the end you always have to consider that this game wouldn't exist without the help of the fanbase and I'm pretty sure they didn't get as much money to create this one as they got when they made 999 or VLR.\n\nEven though there were so many flaws, I still enjoyed the 20h I put into this game and I don't regret it. The humor was great, I actually cared about most of the characters and I had fun solving the puzzles (most of the time).

Except... it doesn't occur to either of them that perhaps the sinister mastermind WHO MOVED THEM TO THE ROOM WHILE THEY WERE KNOCKED OUT may have been the killer. I mean, the plot is stupid enough for it to be one of the two, but if it was, and they did it because they wanted to be one of the survivors, why didn't they off the other (still knocked out) person at the same time as they killed the first?

The other half are a mixed bag but not in a good way.\n\nBottom line: I recommend playing the first two games, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, first; both are coming to Steam in Spring 2017.\n\nEDIT: I would like to amend this review with a tl;dr:\n\nWhat I played: Zero Escape Volume 3: Zero Time Dilemma\nWhat I expected: Back to the Future Part 3\nWhat I got: The Matrix: Revolution", "timestamp_created": 1483360795, "timestamp_updated": 1483362147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520456671714782715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28921282": {"recommendationid": "28921282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960271994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 282, "playtime_forever": 2887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1638, "last_played": 1506621574}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1483314787, "timestamp_updated": 1567704186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28861314": {"recommendationid": "28861314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026758906", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1243, "last_played": 1483496103}, "language": "english", "review": "game is called Zero Escape\nI escaped\ngg ez, not sure if it's worth 30 bucks though", "timestamp_created": 1483174938, "timestamp_updated": 1483174938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464285492897033691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28856368": {"recommendationid": "28856368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046308793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1264, "last_played": 1483159536}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked the other games in the Zero Escape series, 999: Nine Hours Nine Persons Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward, you will love this game. The story, the puzzles, the time travel-y philosophical bullshit, and even (spoiler) some of the characters are all there. Though I should mention that I have only played 999. \n\nTL;DR: good game mate 7.5/8\n\nThe puzzles range from easy to fantastically brilliant to frustrating at times. But overall they are easier than 999, but still pretty intelligent and they make sense. I never had to resort to a walkthrough to solve a puzzle. Though sometimes the last piece you need is either unnecessary and the game wonders why you didn't go find it, or it is difficult to find and you sit stuck at a point looking for the answer in vain.\n\nThe story does get off to a bit of a strange start. You get thrust into things with even less explanation or context than I remember from the previous games. Don't give up on it right away. Through playing you will find about the same depth as previous games in the series. The great part is that the game gives you a handy decision tree to keep track of your choices. You can reference this to find out which timeline you're on and which choices you've already made at a specific decision. I really like this feature. Sometimes though, the decisions don't feel like they have as much weight as they did in 999. You can simply go back right away through the decision tree and try the other choice. Nice for 100% and curiosity, but in 999 every choice you made felt important because if you really wanted to see the other result you had to play through from the beginnning again and that would take time. I understand why this happens though. the game is so heavily based on making lots of decisions that it really needs to be this way. \n\nIf you're worried about there being great reveals and hints to stuff that you need knowledge from other routes to figure out, don't worry it's all there. There's plenty of stuff to make you go: \"Oh that makes sense now\" or \"So THAT'S why that was going on.\" There is perhaps one reveal that I feel they cheated a bit, but it isn't that terrible considering the rest of the reveals and interlocking routes and decisions went so well.\n\nBeing a port from a 3DS title the graphics aren't exactly up to snuff, but I don't think the graphics should be what you play this game for. It's kind of like how people still love an old game like myst.\n\nOverall the puzzles are fun, and the story (while sometimes trope-y) is enjoyable especially in cinematics even if they don't look all that great.", "timestamp_created": 1483161197, "timestamp_updated": 1483161260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28848425": {"recommendationid": "28848425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042295473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1483135972}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has me torn although I enjoy it as a fan of the series I do recognize it as the weakest link of the three.

But YOU NEED TO PLAY THE PRECEDING GAMES! It is absolutely obligatory for you if you want to glean any enjoyment from the story! So if you are curious about this game just because of it being a puzzle game/visual novel, stay away! Wait for the PC version of 999 and Virtues Last Reward, they are slated to come out in March 2017 on steam, so please, wait until then! Alternatively you can hunt down a 999 cart online, you can run it in a New 3DS no problem, and Virtues Last Reward is available on the nintendo E-shop as a downloadble title.\n\nSo first! Buy and play 999, if you like it; move on to Virtues Last Reward. ONLY after finishing those two, play Zero Time Dilemma. It's a fantastic series! With a pretty damn good story, with a quality set of puzzles set in a pretty damn original setting. \n\nOnly three issues: \n1. There is a metric craptonne of semi-believable psuedo science and as such big helping of disbelief-suspension will be required. Saying more than that would be saying to much however. \n2. While 999 was a pretty good looking DS game, and Virtues Last Reward was fine looking on the 3DS, Zero Time Dilemma can be pretty damn off-putting with it's presentation. \n3. It is certainly the weakest entry into the series, it is good and works pretty hard to tie up all the loose ends. But the story have some silly bits, and some of the plot points are very contrived in my oppinion, but it is not enough to bring down the thing entirely. \n\nAll in all, a fine game.

Like its predecessors, it is a graphic novel littered with first-person puzzle-solving segments. It's the good book you can't put down and can't stop flipping the pages.... until you get stuck on a puzzle. About that : this is one of those games where you definitely want to keep googling for answers to a minimum, as plot spoilers REALLY ruin the fun here. The puzzles in this game probably aren't as mindbending as the other ones either; however, I did have to bust out the pen and paper sometimes to write things down. They got a little bit lazy with some of the puzzles, especially the ones they kept recycling that really didn't seem to make sense in the grand scheme of things (such as rotating tools to fit into a toolbox to... open that toolbox?). \n\nThe storytelling was a good way to tie in the first two games; however, the ending may seem to be a little... rushed. There were some storyline sequences that unlock only after you re-viewed certain early-game events, but there weren't any actual hints/clues or much logic as to why you had to revisit those scenes to unlock the subsequent ones. You also need to know to jump back into the game after you beat it to view the updated \"Files\" to get some end-game closure. That said, it seemed like they tried to wrap it up quickly so that they could be done and over with the game... but at the same time, there just might be enough scope for a 4th game in the series. Hell, there is enough scope for a few spinoffs as well. \n\nThe plot in this series isn't perfect: there are plot holes here, and just like the previous games, you have the chicken and the egg problem. But if you dig deeper and really embrace the infinite amount of possibilities and histories as suggested in this story, you may get creative enough to pardon these plot holes. \n\nWhen 999 and VLR comes to steam, I would definitely do a marathon re-run through this series.", "timestamp_created": 1482890208, "timestamp_updated": 1482890208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28582838": {"recommendationid": "28582838", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995933443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1150, "last_played": 1471598371}, "language": "english", "review": "Zero Time Dilemma is a worthy entry to the Zero Escape series that I found myself, as a series veteran, unable to put down until the very end. \n\nThat being said, the game was far from perfect.

I was wrong.\n\nI never finished the Mass Effect series, but I heard all about its awful ending. Having played through Zero Time Dilemma, I think I understand how the fans of Mass Effect felt. Zero Time Dilemma, as a conclusion, is one of the most lazily written endings I've ever seen. The way that every major plot point in the series seems so downplayed is insulting. The game is full of Deus Ex Machina-style moments because apparently Uchikoshi wrote himself into a wall. It seems like he wrote the beginning and middle and didn't even know how to end it.\n\nHow did this happen? Here's my theory.\n\n9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors was never meant to have a sequel. Once it achieved a surprising amount of success, Uchikoshi extended the story. Virtue's Last Reward was a noticeable step down in quality when it came to the writing, most likely because it had to have ties to 999 (which is about as strong as a narrative as you can get, in my opinion), which limited its scope. However, for what it was, it did pretty well. 999 character arcs went nicely, the story still managed to be intriguing (though somewhat nonsensical), and the puzzles and atmosphere were amazing.\n\nEnter Zero Time Dilemma. VLR didn't sell well as they'd hoped. The budget was next to nothing. Uchikoshi knew he had to go back to D-Com for this last game, but had no other ideas as to what happened there when writing VLR (I hope). The development cycle was probably only a year or two, which left almost no time for editing the script. As a result, we get this mess. \n\nSome light spoilers ahead, but I figure I'd better close with the positives and negatives.\n\n+ Great atmosphere for most of the game.\n+ Some genuinely good moments.\n+ A few creative puzzles.\n+ Interesting narrative structure centered around playing things out of order.\n+ Puzzle room dialogue (always a highlight in this series)\n+ Includes a healthy selection of songs from 999 and VLR\n- Akane's personality does a complete 180, her actions and words completely contradict everything said in 999 and VLR.\n- Junpei's personality is the same way, to a certain extent. How he gets from here to VLR Junpei, I have no idea.\n- Clover and a bunch of other characters barely get a passing mention. Pretty disappointing seeing as this is the finale.\n- Repeating puzzles in every escape room.\n- Awful animations, some spotty English voice acting, and an overall lack of polish due to low budget.\n- Almost every major plot point from the previous game is downplayed and irrelevant.\n- Mira has one of the worst character arcs in anything ever.\n- Eric is a complete idiot, to the point where it breaks immersion.\n- Even though the 999 and VLR tracks are good, the game rarely brings any of its own music to the table.\n- Extremely rushed ending with awful closure, though at this point I wouldn't be surprised if they were lining up for yet another sequel.\n- Complex Motives ( you'll know what this means when you finish the game)\n\nI know you're going to finish the game regardless of what I say if you've beaten 999 and VLR. Who wouldn't? Those games are fantastic. However, be prepared to want to throw your computer away after you've finished this.

Each character sounds very distinct in the manner of their speech and it brings a lot to the table in terms of immersion\n-Unique interesting characters. I found myself quite invested in a few of them by the end\n\nCons:\n-One or two of the puzzles use ridiculous moon logic, where twice I just resorted to rubbing items in my inentory on everything in the environment until something worked\n-The animation quality is absolutely terrible. I'm not sure what the budget was for this game or how it was allocated but it sure as hell didnt go to animation. They have to cut away and cut back every time anybody picks an object up in a cinematic for God's sake\n-I'm not sure if they were things established in previois games, but the plot does have a couple of total ass-pulls which dont do too much detriment to its overall impact, but when you have good writing surrounding these moments it makes them stand out more\n\nOverall it's an excellent narrative experience with fun, well made puzzles. The tone of the game is quite bleak for the most part and involves a similar type of premise to Danganronpa; several characters locked in a confined space, attempting to find a way out.

While there is some in-game context given to familiarize new players with the storyline, it is still highly recommended that you be familiar with the plot of the first two games in order to understand this one.\n\nWith that out of the way, this installment was a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, though I wouldn't say it was perfect by any means.  For example, if they wanted to transition from still images to animated cutscenes, they should have gone all out and fully animated every detail.  Instead, the camera often cuts away from the characters when a significant action is performed (such as one character attacking another) and we only hear a sound effect to signal that said action took place.  To me this signifies either a limited budget or a lack of effort.  However, the music was good, the dialogue/voice acting was entertaining, and the events of the game were presented in a coherent manner.  The room escape puzzles were the perfect level of difficulty; they were challenging enough to require some thought, but not so difficult that I was stuck for hours on a single puzzle.\n\nBut let's talk about the one aspect that the Zero Escape series is known for: the story.  You can expect the same sort of mind-blowing, alternate timeline laden story in this game as you experienced in the previous two.  While I wouldn't say that this game introduces any ingenious new concepts to the overarching mythos of the series, it takes what made the other two games so awesome and cranks it all up several notches.  More death, more violence, more paranoia and backstabbing, more alternate timelines, more time-loop miracles that completely screw with your brain.  Killing off other characters is not just something that happens to take place in certain timelines, but is now a requirement for the remaining characters to escape the facility they are trapped in.  A group of characters can seem completely peaceful and cooperative at one moment and then suddenly proceed to turn on each other in a matter of minutes.  Needless to say, I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole game.\n\nThe one part that did leave me scratching my head a little was the ending.  While many old questions are answered, new ones are raised - and therefore left open to interpretation because the developers have apparently stated that this is the last game in the series.

The Zero Escape series is popular for its chilling twists and powerful atmosphere. Zero Time Dilemma manages to bring the series to a satisfying end; fans of the series should certainly pick it up. That being said, this game is nowhere near the level of its predecessors. The animation is cringey, the ending isn't all that mindblowing, and, most of all, it relies too much on gore.

El resto de detalles puedes leerlos de la descripci\u00f3n del juego. \nA mi parecer sigue en la l\u00ednea de la saga en cuanto a calidad de la historia narrada dando unos giros de argumento que no te esperas. El m\u00e9todo de avanzar en la historia ha cambiado, ahora vas jugando segmentos del juego sin orden temporal (sirve para crear una sensaci\u00f3n de estar perdido al igual que lo sufren los protagonistas). El elenco de personajes es una mezcla entre desconocidos y otros ya conocidos (o eso es lo que cre\u00edas).\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\nSigue en la l\u00ednea de los dos anteriores, puzles de escapar que tendr\u00e1s que resolver, escenas de dialogo y decisiones dif\u00edciles que tomar. Si te gustaron los puzles de los dos anteriores seguramente te gustaran estos nuevos. En mi opini\u00f3n no llegan a ser tan buenos como los del [b] Virtue's Last Reward[/b]  y deja la sensaci\u00f3n de que hay m\u00e1s decisiones y dialogo que puzles, eso s\u00ed, las decisiones son m\u00e1s variadas y dan lugar a muchos cambios en la trama.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\nEste yo creo que es el punto que m\u00e1s flojea, han decidido dar un salto del estilo novela gr\u00e1fica a animaci\u00f3n 3D, como si se tratase de una pel\u00edcula. Aunque el planteamiento de las escenas y el dise\u00f1o est\u00e1n logrados, la animaci\u00f3n de los modelos es muy pobre al no tener tanta experiencia en este campo (tampoco se puede pedir mucho de un estudio peque\u00f1o). Probablemente habr\u00eda quedado mejor de seguir con el estilo novela. Aun as\u00ed, en esta saga los gr\u00e1ficos no son la parte importante, de manera que salvo alg\u00fan detalle molesto se disfruta igualmente.\n\n[h1]Opini\u00f3n final:[/h1]\n\nEste apartado aviso de que es muy subjetivo y voy a dar mi opini\u00f3n personal.\n\nRespecto a la calidad global yo dir\u00eda que es un juego muy bueno dentro del g\u00e9nero aunque el precio sea demasiado alto. A no ser que seas muy fan recomendar\u00eda esperar a alguna rebaja. Tambi\u00e9n dir\u00eda que no llega a ser tan bueno como el [b] Virtue's Last Reward[/b]  pero es un juego que cierra la saga muy satisfactoriamente y no la echa a perder de ninguna manera. \nDesde luego recomiendo su compra.\n\nP.D: Yo lo compre de salida que incluia la banda sonora y un libro sobre el juego en PDF.

It paired room escape puzzles with deeply anime visual novel sequences and plenty of weird random pseudoscientific nonsense, and that's probably about as much as many people got out of it because it was structured in such a way that you didn't get the really amazing, mind-bending twists and revelations until you'd finished it a couple times, which meant repeating at least some of the room escapes and sitting through repeated visual novel bits over and over. And ultimately to really experience the whole thing and get the True Ending (tm) you had to hit all the major permutations.  If you did that, it was a heck of a ride. But you really had to work at it to get there.\n\nThen it got a sequel called Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. Similar formula, but this time it exposed the decision flowchart from the get go and let you jump around it at will. And the ways it played with this ability in the actual fiction, as well as the ways it called back to 999 and generally messed with all your expectations were frankly incredible. I could forgive people for being unenthusiastic about 999 because of how many obstacles it put between you and the good stuff, but Virtue's Last Reward was pretty much impeccable. Oh, and the True End? A giant, horrifying, agonizing cliffhanger reveal you almost certainly wouldn't have guessed. But then sales were not great, and every indication was the planned third game in the trilogy wouldn't be made.\n\nWell, here it is. Zero Time Dilemma. If you've played the first two games, you need to play this. That's all there is to it. And if you haven't, you absolutely should not play this until you do, because it is the culmination of two games worth of story. You don't -have- to know this stuff going in - mostly the characters don't - but it will make a world of difference in the impact of what happens in the course of the game, and your familiarity with the returning characters will help parse their motivations and actions in this. But also, frankly...not gonna lie...Zero Time Dilemma is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and it has some incredible twists. But it isn't the best game in the series. That's still VLR. You can unfortunately tell that Zero Time Dilemma was made on a shoestring budget and so the cutscenes are pretty awkwardly rendered, there's a lot of telling and not showing, and the pacing and format are a bit strange for the game overall.

The formula is always the same: a cast of stereotypical characters tries to find their way out from an enclosed location where they\u2019ve been forced to play a game to achieve their freedom. This is the set up to tell a story with Sci-Fi themes that goes far beyond the mere concept of escaping, with plot twists and character development that defies the initial premise of the formula.\n\nAs the author stated, the Visual Novel tries to use and abuse the media to tell its story, truly integrating the decisions of the player. This is made possible through the Flowchart: a tree of choices that leads from the beginning of the game to the multiple endings it bears. This, however, doesn\u2019t expect any one player to choose its own singular ending, but rather invites everyone to explore the various branches of the tree to discover the mysteries hidden behind your decisions and reach the True Ending of the game.\n\nThe Flowchart takes on a new form in this title, appearing in two separate versions: the classic one and a second, where the scenes appeared group and inconsequential. This is made so that the player can experience the events of the game without knowing their placement in time, leading to the need to reconstruct the story piece by piece. This, coupled with the three POV the game gives, makes for multiple ways to experience the story of the game, leading to different decisions and results. \n\nThis mechanics thus define the experience of the game, leading to a story that is bit by bit revealed with multiple scenes dedicate to the development of its characters and twists that make for a truly interesting story. The decisions made in the game also have the intention of making the player think about their true opinion on them, rather than roleplay the character they are playing as, with the intentions to subvert one\u2019s beliefs as the information piles and on and the situation becomes clearer. \n\nThe game was designed to fit the needs of both new players and fan of the series, especially since it\u2019s the first released on Steam and the upcoming ports for the same platform. The first two titles of Zero Escape worked easily as a standalone game, but this one is the end of a trilogy and therefore it works less as one. Nonetheless it could easily be played as entry point, with new players feeling both confused and intrigued by the information revealed early in the game. \n\nTaking a different approach from the previous titles, the game seems to be more focused on the freedom of choice and sense of discovery correlated with the middle part of the game. With the new fragment system for the timeline probably influencing that result, feels less ramping up to a huge twist revelation at its end and rather focuses on the truths that you might discover during your experience. This however leads to a less impactful ending, by some defined weak and unclear. As most Sci-Fi stories a few holes are inevitably left, but most are probably wanted.\n\nAs it was the case in previous titles, some questions weren\u2019t answered fully or directly, while some were probably scrapped during production. This inevitably leads to open ended situations, but this aren\u2019t inherently bad. The Zero Escape series was intended for players to make ponder about some questions posed during the game and finding their own answer to them.", "timestamp_created": 1479995876, "timestamp_updated": 1479995969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27145667": {"recommendationid": "27145667", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994028532", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1356, "last_played": 1561730542}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1479991239, "timestamp_updated": 1479991239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27139544": {"recommendationid": "27139544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053598969", "num_games_owned": 810, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1256, "last_played": 1478308876}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fucking awesome,just play it.\n\nYou won't be dissapointed!", "timestamp_created": 1479990105, "timestamp_updated": 1479990105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27112431": {"recommendationid": "27112431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011025517", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1185, "last_played": 1470521916}, "language": "english", "review": "Please play the series.", "timestamp_created": 1479984783, "timestamp_updated": 1479984783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27060854": {"recommendationid": "27060854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007800062", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1547, "last_played": 1592735373}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the best finish for an otherwise amazing series, but it's worth it for the ride", "timestamp_created": 1479972565, "timestamp_updated": 1479972565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27044846": {"recommendationid": "27044846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004007816", "num_games_owned": 979, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1308, "last_played": 1488291799}, "language": "english", "review": "While it's still a visual novel, just like its predecessors, the transition to real-time cutscenes does wonders for the charactersization here, even if the models and textures... aren't the nicest.

I would almost go as far as saying it was faultless - but to absolutely scrape the barrel, when skipping dialogue, if would occassionally skip something you hadn't read. This was solveable by viewing the dialogue log (which you could pause and do at any point - even mid way through dialogue) and was by no means a deal breaker. \n\nTellTale could really take a leaf out of their books - this is how decision based games should be made. The puzzles are challenging at times, but fun. Each puzzle being based in a single room, it also avoided the traps of games like Myst where you find yourself running around a large world trying to get the clues required. There is no walking at all.\n\nIn the end, everything is wrapped up wonderfully, with no disappointment and you'll likely have an existential crisis on your hands to boot. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.\n\nUPDATE: I decided to go and read some of the other reviews of this game - especially the negative ones. There was a strong theme that you can't enjoy this game unless you have played the two preceding games. I have not played them and had no problems at all picking up the concepts and definitely enjoyed it - so, give people some credit. \n\nUPDATE 2: Having now gone back and played the previous games, I believe this to be the weakest of the three games. The plot is not as well thought through, with clear holes that are frustrating. The puzzles are shorter and not as satisfying. \n\nBut the biggest annoyance, coming from the previous games was the dialogue skipping, which I had already been annoyed with. The whole game moved slower because you couldn't click to reveal and then skip to the next section once you'd read it twice as fast as the diaglogue was being read to you.\n\nIt's still a good game, and you'll likely want to play all 3 - but if you had to pick one, don't pick this one.", "timestamp_created": 1479866932, "timestamp_updated": 1494366838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26733893": {"recommendationid": "26733893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106486025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1568, "last_played": 1480006064}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game with a beautiful story.

The puzzles are hard as hell but really make you think and there's so many endings it's difficult to keep track. I've played the previous two games and have to say this one is my least favorite. \n\nBut to those of you who are brand-new to the series and want to play this one first-- don't.\n\nI'm serious. You will miss out on so many key hints and tossbacks it would be blasphemous, like playing Bioshock Infinite without playing the first game (you can actually just skip the second) and you would be doing yourself and this series a great disservice. Trust me, the PC version of the first two games are coming to Steam next year but if you really can't wait then you should at least watch some playthroughs on YouTube to get the full experience. \n\nI have to say Zero Time Dilemma (the third game of the series) ties up the story pretty nicely. It's not like so many other series that never got a third installment (talking to you, Valve) and there's some real mind-fuck moments in here. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game and it really had me guessing the whole time on how the hell any of it was going to relate but it just didn't have...I guess you could say \"flair\".\n\nI say that because the first game was so uniquely amazing that they had to make a sequel and the second game was so colorful and fast-paced that I felt really slowed down and bored coming to the third game. Have you seen the cover art of the second game? You should look at it and compare it to the rusted, watered-down look of this game's cover.\n\nAlso, the character's designs are a lot more intersting in the second game and I expected the interest and \"flair\" to come back much the same but it didn't. This a good game but man are the character designs boring. \n\nAnd the gameplay wasn't bumped up either. That's what was so great about Virtue's Last Reward (the second game). It took what made the first game great and made it brighter and wilder (if not better) and really hooked me. \n\nZero Time Dilemma is just lacking individuality and does a similar thing of the second game by jumping fragments but in a much blander, more drawn-out way that had me sighing.\n\nI really wish this game had something more to add to the series than just drawing on the other two and making it bleh. \n\nYeah, that's what this game is. It's good but it's bleh (compared to the other two).\n\nJust...bleh.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478627614, "timestamp_updated": 1478627614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26484512": {"recommendationid": "26484512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042208543", "num_games_owned": 3923, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1523, "last_played": 1478560119}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like escape rooms with a sense of actual danger, this game is the game for you.

The Zero Escape series, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, has been one of my favorite games series of all time.  Virtue's Last Reward, while not quite as good as 999 was, opened up the story massively.  It created so many interesting questions about where this story was going to go.  And since it pretty much left off on a cliff-hanger, I was immensly looking forwards to this game.  What a dissappointment.  This game was almost not made as the Zero Escape series was never a very profitable series of games.  Understandably so, its a very niche market for escape the room puzzle visual novel games.  So in order to get this game made in the first place, they had to do so with a significantly reduced budget.  And it shows in every aspect of the game.  The graphics are horrendous.  I imagine they switched to the 3D animated style because it was cheaper and easier to put together, but it really takes you out of the story when the characters mouths flap around durring dialogue and you can so clearly see the low quality of the character models.  Another aspect in which the reduced budget really shows is in how short this game feels.  Its largely exacerbated by the way they decided to tell this game's story.  Instead of letting you make a series of choices and see how they play out to the end, you instead play through a series story pieces between which your character's memories are erased.  So you never know the consequences of your choices and there can be little to no character development until half way thorugh the game when the mechanic is dropped like the sack of rocks it is.  While it is a cool idea, it ends up being largely frustrating and confusing.  And since the game is fairly short they aren't able to capitalize on this mechanic very well.  There just aren't enough story threads make you truly wonder where you are in the timeline effectively.  The puzzles and choices you get to make throughout the game are pretty solid and about what we've come to expect from the Zero Escape series.  However the story and characters is where the game truly falls on its face.  Let's start with the characters.  Boy oh boy did they ruin the characters of this series.  The game consists of three groups of three characters.  In one group we have two of the protagonists of 999, Akane and Junpei.  These characters and their story form one of the major threads of this series.  And they absolutely destroy their characters in this game.  Junpei has effectively become a whiney disaffected teenager.  He is so absurdly unlikeable and it just kills me as someone who has played the other games in this series and come to love his character so much.  They eventually give a reason for this, but it is very unsatisfactory and largely unnecessary for it to have happened in the first place.  Another group contains two more returning characters.  Phi and Sigma.  Of course because of the way Virtue's Last Reward ended, this is not the same Sigma that we came to know in the previous game.  Its just a boring and stern nothing of a character who pairs very well with Phi's also complete lack of interesting character in this game.  The third group isn't even worth talking about.  They are crap filler characters that no one likes and have no relevance to the overarching story.  So yes, that does make 1/3 of this game pointless and annoying to play through.  The overall plot starts out alright, but the ending is so terrible that it legit almost ruins the entire series.  It breaks the series' own rules for how the jumping and shifting stuff works and leaves almost every plot thread from the previous games unanswered.  They try to cover some of the lack of an ending with little text cutscenes to cover what happened to the characters after the story concluded but even those failed.  They were way too short and covered almost nothing of value.  In the end we are left with an ending to a great series that is so unsatisfactory that it almost makes me regret loving the series in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1478377406, "timestamp_updated": 1478377406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473537594079971313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26437148": {"recommendationid": "26437148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024690412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1709, "last_played": 1478358036}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good conclusion to the trilogy.\n\nThank you Uchikoshi and your team for all this hard work on this exceptional game series that Zero Escape is.", "timestamp_created": 1478358652, "timestamp_updated": 1478358652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553741872310638428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26434698": {"recommendationid": "26434698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014392136", "num_games_owned": 744, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2433, "last_played": 1467697320}, "language": "english", "review": "999 > VLR > ZTD \n\nNothing will ever top 999, but you might as well play this if you've already played the other two games.\n\nBuy this and play it when it's out before you play ZTD. \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/477740", "timestamp_created": 1478350508, "timestamp_updated": 1478350644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26433676": {"recommendationid": "26433676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016690091", "num_games_owned": 803, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 981, "last_played": 1478346368}, "language": "english", "review": "In some histories, you don't have the game.\nIn some histories, you don't have time.\nIn some histories, you don't have any ideas to solve puzzles.\nLife is simply unfair.

Chunsoft  definitely has created a major success in this series. I have played both 999, Zero Time Dilemma and watched the playthrough of Virtue's Last Reward. When this game came out, I bought it straight away in the first week since it definitely is worth the price. It is completely worth it.\n\nDefinitely gonna have to recommend anyone wanting to play this game that you have to play for watch the walkthroughs of the other two games to understand all that stories on this series. Because it is completely crucial to understand the mechanisms and plot twists.\n\nThis may not be a TL;DR review from me, since I wrote this review 4 months after finishing the game.\n\n1/ Story: Hmm, hard to make a concise version of the story. However, I can say this is the missing link between 999 - the point where Akane Kuroshiki has finished orchestraing her plan together with her brother San, and Virtue's Last Reward - the point where Akane creates a major plan to stop the virus from spreading together with Sigma and Phi. Zero Time Dilemma answers all the questions I had from the other two games, making it a complete finished story for me after playing. I understood so much after playing the game. \n\nThe game definitely has plot twists, it really does. But I'm really glad at the fact no plot hole was missed and not thought of.\n\n2/ Gameplay: The game now is a bit different from the other two games, as it does not allow the players to have one playthrough with different choices like the other two. It did created some confusion for me at first, but as I kept on playing through, I understood that the confusion in selecting different paths does has its goal to allow the players to see one huge picture behind every choice the players make . It is actually pretty rewarding in the end. \n\nThe puzzles mechanism in this game , for me, is much easier to grasp than in the other two games. It does requires thinking as well, but it does gives me better hints than in the other two games. I love it. \n\nI like the fact that Chunsoft kept the notes section and dialogues section in order for me to keep track of everything. I really like that. Sometimes you may get back to the game after a long time. Those are the things that keep you continue going forward easily.\n\n3/ The music: The Zero Escape series definitely has great soundtracks. I love them all. \n\nOverall Score: 10/10 for me. \n\nIt's a must-have for novel stories lovers like me. I have always loved the quantum physics theories and thought experiments. They are something to think about and this series does opens my eyes in a lot of ways. \n\nThank you Chunsoft for creating such a great game as the missing link between 999 and Virtue's Last Reward!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1478157812, "timestamp_updated": 1480074714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510825574398040771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26378226": {"recommendationid": "26378226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173981665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1480198262}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is very interesting so far\nPuzzles are smart and fun (Though a little bit too tricky for my dumb brain)\n\nThe only thing to be wary of in my opinion:\nI know the game was originally released on 3DS and Vita, but I can't help but mention the\nterrible animation and lip syncing.

It's weird people seem to forget there is a game attached to this book, but it's a good one. (check out the bonus riddles in the art book, they're cool)\n\n-It brought back the sense of tension that was missing in the 2nd game and you never know when the next puzzle will force someone to murder you to save themselves. Some end plot twists were rather silly, but they were in VLR as well (you know shrodinger's cat was originally written as a joke, right?), so whatever.\n\n-I was expecting not to like new characters just joining us just this game, but I ended up loving them, particularly the couple on green team. They wound up being as if not more interesting than our returning cast (Akane is such a nagging old lady in this one).\n\n-The ending is so dumb.

I'll keep this recommendation spoiler free but it must be said right now that you shouldn't play this game without playing the other two before.\n\nTechnically speaking I should be honest and just say that it would be hard to get worse than it is. Going against the visual novel style the previous games had, it adopts interactive cinematics, sort of simulating the recent Telltale hits like The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us and et cetera. I truly believe this was the worst possible choice the director could have made. We all know that the Zero Escape series isn't really rentable and the simple fact that this game was made is almost a miracle. The production value must have been low and it really transpires in these cinematics. The animation is really, really sloppy and most of the action happens off-screen and those that doesn't really look terrible, almost making me wish the game wasn't animated at all because the 3D models of the characters doesn't really look that bad. Not only that but one of the ways you could experience Uchikochi's writing brilliance was through the way he would use the main character to describe action and scenes with details and it all was lost to some badly executed cinema tricks with crappy animation. I was already against the 3D models and animations on Virtue's Last Reward because the series would be far more visually appealing if they had just kept the 2D aspects of 999. Life is simply unfair, isn't?\n\nSo, now that I've put aside all the bad stuff I had about the game I must talk about the the good ones: the plot. It may look not worth for some people after reading my rant about the animation but if you're into Zero Escape, the plot is pretty much all you want in the game and every other thing is banal.\n\nI must start with the cast, that is really diversified and less Danganronpa-ish design and plot wise. The character design made sure you got some information through the way the characters look and some of them are misleading. Like before in the series, not everything is clear about the participants in the Decision Game and discovering about them is really interesting. I must say though that twice they pulled old plot cards about the characters and it didn't hit like before.\n\nAs a sequel Zero Time Dilemma delivers good shout outs to the last two games and it finishes the arc created in Virtue's Last Reward in a way that almost all points meet ends. Through the middle of the game until the end it got me really hooked. It is good to see old friends again and the new cast is better than VLR's (Dio, Quark and Alice kinda sucked to be honest).\n\nOh, good thing I told you people about the beginning of the game because I didn't quite like it. The game now works with fragments that are all out of order so before stuff start making sense you might feel lost but please, persist. Like pretty much everything in the series things usually have some meaning to them.\n\nIt is quite dumb to recommend the last iteration in a series, if you played the first two you are going to play this anyway but I really felt like writing this because I'm really passionate about Zero Escape and had to express my opinion about the series \"end\".\n\nI hope everyone enjoy Zero Time Dilemma like I did!\nSeek a way out.", "timestamp_created": 1477935737, "timestamp_updated": 1480627059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593790411949157715", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26317783": {"recommendationid": "26317783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995681616", "num_games_owned": 1590, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1429, "last_played": 1488617460}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played the first part about 3 years ago on an old DS, and the story grabbed me ever since. \nYou are probably questioning yourself, what sort of game you should expect, while looking at this store page. \n\nEssentially, it is a mixture which consists of:\n\nThe atmosphere of SAW\nThe soundtrack of Silent Hill\nThe amount of blood of Resident Evil\nThe logic of philosophy\nThe fiction of physics\n\nAnd all of this garnished with fiction I cannot explain without spoiling the game.\n\nI definitely recommend playing this game, but if you have the chance, play the first two parts!

This is the most flawed of the 3 games, but it is still head and shoulders above many other games I have played. ZTD made me laugh, cry, and think. It has what I think are some of the best moments in the series, and it justifies the 3D graphics, much like how the previous two games utilize their 3DS/VN mechanics in interesting ways.\n\nThere's a lot of detail put into this game that I didn't realize until re-playing and checking out trivia. Overall, despite the shortcomings, there are many things I love about this game: cast, writing, VA, music, the fragment system, humor, puzzles, decisions, emotional moments, etc. While I think 999 has the best climax and art design and VLR has the best plot twists and dialogue, ZTD has, in my opinion, the best emotional moments and atmosphere. \n\nIn terms of my enjoyment and investment, I'd rank the game as VLR > ZTD >>>> 999.", "timestamp_created": 1476417076, "timestamp_updated": 1479786446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26021354": {"recommendationid": "26021354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118736505", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3019, "last_played": 1476478906}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the first one,\nAdored the second.\nLike the third\n\nIt's pretty good, but i have to admit that the second one left more of an impression.

It's good, serviceable but it lacks a strong, choking moment to really last in my mind, like the alice or the submarine ending of the first... It's good but the 3d didn't had much going for it because of how simple it looked, cranky animation, funny sound effect (i mean the sound for crouching, sitting or touching the ground is the same as when a dead body hit the floor,  not really the same thing) It's a good game but i will think of it more as a passage to a different style of zero escape that with time will get their strengh back.

Expect a lot of text and movies and fairly little gameplay. All the gameplay is in the form of dialogue decisions and 'escape rooms'. So clearly not a regular game already.\nSecond, this game is the conclusion to the Zero Escape series and most of the story will not make sense without playing the first two games, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. \n\nIf you're somehow still interested after all this, you've got a real gem on your hands here. The story of this game is both more convoluted, more messed up, more ridiculous and more awesome than the previous two games (which I would say are already 'pretty out there'), it is also incredibly satisfying to figure everything out by yourself or with friends while streaming. The story even teaches you some fun historical facts that might interest you.\n\nAnd then there are the escape rooms. These are definitely easier than in 999 and VLR, but they are still so much fun to do and, again, satisfying to complete.\n\nThe one downside is the way the story-branching of the game works. Since you probably want to learn everything once you're invested enough, the \"branching\" is not much of a choice anymore; you're going to check out all outcomes because you're curious. And rightly so, since there are some clever hidden endings hidden here and there as well.\n\nAll in all, you're looking to enjoy about 20 hours of a really good book, since there's not so much a lot of gaming to be done here.

The story is interesting, if you don\u2019t mind a little crazy. Most of the puzzles are tightly designed to leave little room for not being able to find the next step, but occasionally they can frustrate with an exceedingly inconspicuous clue or item placement. The Transporter room is an especially odd duck in terms of difficulty, but that\u2019s technically \u201cend game\u201d (regardless of how early you CAN play it). \n\nI was unsold on the \u201cfragments\u201d mechanic (which allows you to play sequences of the game in almost any order you want to), and still think I would have enjoyed the more traditional Zero Escape structure more, but once you get to the \u201cevent horizon\u201d and all of the pieces begin to fall into place, it\u2019s very satisfying\u2026 just don\u2019t take extended time off from this game before you complete it, especially if you\u2019re new to the series; forgetting details will lessen the impact of certain revelations. \n\nI do wish there were a harder difficulty option for series veterans that concealed additional information and made entering ALL of the \u201cdecisions\u201d manual and required you to keep notes in lieu of a log being available\u2026 but that\u2019s ridiculous and not useful to someone who needs to read a review to know if they\u2019d want to play this.\n\n[b] About the series [/b] : This series started under the pretense of a \"locked room\" murder mystery, but at this point in the series its crazy flag is flying proud immediately. I wouldn't say it's absolutely vital you've played the other two in order to enjoy this one (like some of the other purist reviews here), but it's highly recommended that you do because they're both great games and it's doubtful you will care much about some of the characters without that foreknowledge. The only real downside to having played both of the previous entries is that you will likely figure out a lot of the \u201cmysteries\u201d here a lot sooner than the game intends that you do.\n\nThe story is less tight than 999 (which, like I mentioned, has the pretense of a more traditional locked room story with some weird philosophy for the first 75% of the game before going off the deep end) but is way more cohesive than VLR, which is probably the height of this series\u2019 insanity. There\u2019s a similarly \u201ccheap\u201d revelation toward the end of this game to the ultimate identity of \u201cZero\u201d was in VLR, but it\u2019s less egregious than that one was in my opinion.\n\nPlaying Virtue's Last Reward is arguably a lot more important than playing 999 if you want to understand the PLOT in this one, though.

I was super excited for the conclusion to the trilogy, as it seemed as if this game wouldn't be made due to poor sales. After the long wait, I can safely say it lived up to my expectations.\n\nSome plot points (and holes) seemed really strange to me coming from playing the other two in the series, but I could overlook them pretty easily considering the rest of the game is excellent. Also, it feels as if a lot of the BGM is reused from the other two games, but the music is good and there are some new tracks that I really liked as well.\n\nI'm still not sure how I feel about the ending (it was a little weird to me), but I personally feel as if a game is about the entire experience, not just the ending.\n\nIt was a very enjoyable game, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who may be on the fence about buying it. Just make sure to play the other two games in the series first, or you may be a bit lost on some of the plot and miss out on backstory with some returning characters.\n\nThe first game in the series is 999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, and the second is Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. 999 is available on Nintendo DS and as a visual novel with the gameplay elements removed on iOS.

Where to even begin. It's a rather [i]complex[/i] game. ;)\nBefore you even read this, I really would reccomend playing the earlier games, 999 (9 hours, 9 doors, 9 persons) and VLR (Virtues Last Reward). Although they say that you can play this game without having played the others, the story is going to make a whole lot more sense to you and have a lot more impact on you if you have played the other two. There were certainly a few things revealed to me in this game which I probably wouldn't have been so shocked by if I had not played the other two. If you can't get your hands on 999, try VLR at least. I would hate for you to enjoy this game and then go on to play the others afterwards, having learned things from this game that you wouldn't be able to unsee!\n\nOnto the review...\n\nOnce again Uchikoshi has crafted a wonderful narrative for us. If you are unfamiliar to the series, the gist is that 9 people get trapped somewhere (this time in a mars mission test site) and have to figure out why they are there and how they can get out. While 999 and VLR have slightly more linear storylines (you'll understand what I mean if you have played this series before), ZTD introduces fragments, short parts of the story which are given to you without you knowing what order they are in. Part of the game is trying to piece these parts together to see what happens when and what choices influence what. I have to say that I do prefer the more structured ways of navigating in 999 and VLR, but the fragments were fun because if a part of the story was getting tricky or boring you could always try something else. ZTD brings together main characters from both previous games as well as a few new extras, and the story is really riveting. I was always jumping for chances to get back on my laptop and find out more. My only complaints would be sometimes that it is hard to figure out what needs to happen for a shard to unlock, which can leave you feeling a bit helpless and stuck. And also,I won't say too much on this but all three games have a twist of some kind in their stories, and I feel like the twist in ZTD was a little cheap.\n\nThe game is reaaaalllly good. But don't get it if you arent into novels or very story focused games. Long novel sections are contrasted with escape the room type puzzles, and ZTD sports some of the best puzzles in the franchise. This game has shifted to cinematics to show the action happening rather than being inside the head of a character and having them described to you like in the previous games. I think this defintely was a good choice for this game, as the descisions you have to make are really hightened by being able to see the action in front of you rather than just imagining it. However, the animations are *not* great. I can't complain too much considering that this game almost never happened, but they aren't wonderful. I always found the mouth movements to be a little off, but it's a pretty minor thing all in all. Be warned though, it is a lot more graphic than the previous games - you see the nasty things happening rather than just having them described to you. I played through the Japanese audio as that was my preference, voice acting was very good. Have seen a little of the English dub and while it isn't bad, I think some of the characters are defo better in Japanese. But do try both!\n\nAll in all, I think it was a good end(?) for the trilogy. Though a little more pricey than previous games, I was willing to pay knowing that it goes towards a wonderful development team. If you have played the previous games, I think ZTD is a must-play. If you haven't played the others yet, please do! They are coming to steam soon but there are other ways to play it. This one didn't get me as emotional as VLR did, but it is a really good game and I would highly recommend it to anybody looking to :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1473656344, "timestamp_updated": 1473656344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25418683": {"recommendationid": "25418683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004976835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1356, "last_played": 1473372487}, "language": "english", "review": "*****WARNING - DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED 999 AND VIRTUE'S LAST REWARD\n\nAs a person with the most awful memory I've ever seen, after so long waiting for ZTD to come out, I felt obligated to replay the other two games of the series beforehand, since I was 100% sure I'd forgotten pretty much everything, and boy am I glad I did. This trilogy is made to be played one after the other, with everything fresh on your mind, making the experience completely amazing.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 8\n\nAs a visual novel, it goes exactly as you'd think: walls of text to be read, and lots of options that change what happens next. The unique part of the Zero Escape series is the fact that you can \"jump\" from one story to another, and instantly see what happens if you'd chosen the other option, so no remorse in choosing the unethical answer. Hooray!\nAs an Escape the Room, the game is mostly simple, but now and then throwing an extremely complicated puzzle on the players face out of nowhere (I'm looking at you, Transporter Room). I felt like Virtue's last reward had a better balance of dificulty overall.\n\nSTORY -  9\n\nBeing a visual novel, if the story was bad, the game would be bad. fortunately, that's not the case. The plot twists were really well made and unexpected, and the game did a fine job explaining what VLR didn't. I did feel that some plots were abandoned (Kyle and ? from VLR, for example), but there were not any blatantly obvious holes. That's the advantage of having an extremely complicated story full of time travel and paradoxes, I guess. \nAgain, however, I'll warn new players to wait and play ZTD ONLY AFTER playing the other two games, as both of them will be on Steam soon enough. This game references the other ones A LOT, and although you end up understanding some stuff, the story is not remotely as rich as it really is if you don't know anything about Zero Escape. Including the inside jokes. So go play 999 and VLR right meow. \n\nCHARACTERS - 9.5\n\nThe game gets the two likeable main characters from 999, the two likeable main characters from VLR, and put them all together to wrap things up. And then introduce more likeable characters. Joyful. \nI'd say the cast of ZTD outshines the ones from VLR and 999, as I pretty much liked all of them (except Eric, he's an idiot). They all have their distinct personality and you end up caring about them. Even though they just keep dying. Over and over again. \n\nOVERALL - 8,8\n\nI simply loved this trilogy. Extremely well made and it should really deserve more attention than it does. It's outraging to think that this game almost didn't exist because the producers didn't have the money to do it. I think every penny I've put into it was really well spent.

As to whether I think you should play it, it depends on whether you've played the earlier games.\n\nIf you have, then you should definitely finish the series.  I wasn't completely sold on the art style of the game when I was looking to buy it, but I have to admit it grew on me as the game went on and by no means was a negative.  The room puzzle difficulty falls somewhere between the first two games.  Significantly easier than the 2nd game, maybe a touch more difficult than the first.  The addition of some plot puzzles (answers needed to advance the story) is welcome, and I think they hit the right difficulty here.  Some are just hard enough to feel some accomplishment for figuring them out while being just shy of getting frustrated and looking up the answer on-line.  I think the storyline was on-par and maybe slightly better than the previous games though the zero for this game isn't as good as the one from VLR.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It's painful to watch, It's painful to listen to the bad voice acting, and the \"payoff\" at the end of the game felt contrived and flat.\n\nI have loved the prior two Zero Escape games, completing them both 100%. This, however, is not the same quality as the prior two on the 3DS.\n\nGraphics - 3/10 Horrible character 3D animations. There is no motion capture movement here, it's all via stiff animation techniques. It felt like a game from the early 1990's before motion capture was implemented. If a scene is too difficult to animate? Show a picture of the ceiling, or the wall and play a sound effect. Then show the animatronic characters again. The artists did a decent job with most of the models themselves, except with the dead fish-eyes everyone has. The one really bad character model is Mira. She's supposed to look sexy, with her oversized chest. Unfortunately she looks like a teenage boy's drawing of a hooker. Because all of the characters are more cartoon than real, it just looks sad. This cartoon isn't sexy, just comically bad to the point of being unintentionally funny. Overall, I think the game may look better on the low-resolution 3DS vs the PC. The PC just exacerbates the low quality graphics and empty environments.\n\nSound - 3/10 English voice-overs are beyond cringe-worthy. They don't fit the characters at all. And the dialog doesn't match the emotion, or lack of emotion. Junpei sounds awful, and Zero's English voice is too low to hear. I ended up changing the voice overs to Japanese, who did a great job providing much needed drama, with English subtitles. Sound effects were often amateurish, sounding out of place and just wrong.\n\nDialog: This has always been a problem with the Zero Escape series. Most of the time the dialog is okay with the occasionally painful banter. This game is mostly cringe-worthy. There are several times when a conversation is hijacked by a character so the science-fiction explanations are presented to the player. It's also common for characters to repeat confirmations to ensure the play knows what to do next. (Yes, you can skip any dialog IF you enable the feature in the options menu.) Eric, one of the most irrational and irritating characters in the game, inspired me to find this solution. Another problem is unnecessary cursing when it didn't make sense. Again, it's an attempt by the developer to sound more mature--only to end up sounding like a 13-year old who's angry with the world.\n\nGameplay is divided into two styles - story and room escape. Considering how badly the animations were, and how slowly the dialog was going, I often skipped people's dialog. I would then click the Dialog Review button and read it instead. This was much faster, as the pacing sometimes ground to a halt. I really wanted to enjoy the experience and kept looking for a silver lining--I didn't find one. Instead, I simply got bored with it.\n\nThe room escapes kept me going. None of the rooms were terribly difficult, though I was hoping for a bigger challenge.\n\nThe biggest change for the series is how fragmented the storyline is. It makes sense near the end of the game why it was done this way, but it makes for a very disjointed experience. I didn't care for it. Especially 3/4 of the way through the game--you'll get stuck. The flowchart provided typically shows exclamation marks (!), but there won't be any. Because I don't play \"Find the Pixel\" to prod a game to continue the gameplay, I checked online. It turned out to be a choice I had not considered.\n\nI feel very let down by this game. I had such a great time with the prior games on the 3DS. The 2D graphics, while basic, were charming and required more of my imagination. The 3D models and environment felt like it was too much for the studio. A feeling that carried into the end of the game.\n\nSpeaking of the end of the game... No spoilers here -- The story scene at the end of the game simply stops when you don't expect it. The game then starts rolling the credits that you CANNOT skip. Bad move. Unless you look for them, you'd miss the epilogue notes for the various characters.\n\nAs I said at the start of this review: I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It's painful to watch, It's painful to listen to the bad voice acting, and the \"payoff\" at the end of the game felt contrived and flat.

ZTD is okay, but considering the rest of the series, that's probably the worst thing a Zero Escape title can be.\n\n[b]Long Version:[/b] Unlike the other games in the series, ZTD is not a visual novel. It's a series of long cutscenes, interspersed with the usual puzzle rooms and choices. This method of narrative presentation baffles me, as it essentially removes the charming internal monologue of the POV characters while accentuating just how much standing around and talking there is in these games.\n\nCutscenes are unskippable when you first view them. Unfortunately, this goes by a fragment-by-fragment basis, so if three fragments have the exact same tutorial cutscene... then you're gonna have to sit through it every single time.\n\nThe modular method of storytelling is a huge missed opportunity and only serves to drag down the pacing of the story. The very basics of the scenario have to be repeated in unskippable cutscenes at the beginning of each fragment. Presumably, the meta reason for this was so players wouldn't get confused or feel compelled to play the fragments in a certain order, but after the third time you hear somebody explain the memory wipe drug, you start to see the problem.\n\nThere's no incentive to try and make sense of how the timeline fits together, because characters have their memories wiped at the end of nearly every fragment so it ultimately doesn't mean jack shit. It's also blatantly displayed on a flowchart. What could have been a fascinating storytelling lense is instead one of the game's biggest flaws.\n\nI'm not gonna touch on the story's actual content much because I'm trying to keep this spoiler free, but the new characters are nothing interesting, and if you're familiar with the director's work you probably already know what their Character Twists are just by looking at them.

And were it any other stlye of game I'd probably give it a much lower rating, but this game is a Visual Novel at heart, and we need to remember that it didn't get a huge amount of funding.\n\nLet's talk about the good points first:\n\nSTORY:\nThe story for Zero Excape: Zero Time Dilemma is a continuation of the first two games: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors (Nintendo DS), and Virtue's Last Reward (Nintendo 3DS and Playstation Vita). 9 people who had initally signed up for a government experiment testing whether people could live on mars or not, are captured by the mysterious \"Zero\" and forced to Decide whether the result of a coinflip would land on Red or Blue. IF they choose correctly: They free. If they choose incorrectly, though, they have to take part in Zero's Decision game until at least 6 of them are dead.\n\nThe story is basically what got me hooked on the game, it's extremely story-driven; as were the previous two games. It does get a little confusing at times though. 9/10\n\nGAMEPLAY/CONTROLS:\nThe game is more of a Visual Novel with Room Escape sequences every now and again. The controls are what you'd expect from a Room Escape game really, though it seems like it would be much easier to control with a controller. With a mouse I found myself accidentally clicking things when screen transitions happened, or being unable to drag the camera the way I wanted. With a controller those things would be nullified. Also the in game buttons have controller buttons shown on them, but no Keyboard Hotkeys.\n\nThere are also times where the game doesn't tell you if you're missing something you need, so you have to either manually search for the part you're missing, or google it.\n\nOverall, it gave me some frustrations every now and then, but nothing major. 8/10\n\nSOUND:\nThe music in this game is very, very good. It uses the same music from the previous two games, which brings back memories and can make you feel what you felt at those times. They music is also very good at evoking emotions, it's constructed in such a way that when the game wants you to feel tense, happy, sad, etc. You will.\n\nPersonally I didn't try out the English voice acting, as usually it's fairly bad. English speaking people never seem to get inflections correct, and things that should sound one way end up sounding really cartoony, or just completely different. I may try out a few scenes with the english language on just to update this review, but it's not certain. As for the Japanese voice acting, I can't fault it really. A lot of the words that are said are in English though, and Japanese pronunciation of English words can be pretty lackluster. The subtitles also don't help, as they're subtitling the English dialogue, not the Japanese dialogue. This means that some translations are incorrect, and the way you read something might be said and toned completely differently.\n\nOverall, the music is amazing, as is the japanese dialogue, held back only by English words and the subtitling. 9/10\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe graphics in this game are fairly basic. The character models have obviously been worked on harder, or longer that the rest of the game models, they feel somewhat out of place at times when compared with their surroundings, or other 3D aspects/items. A lot of the textures look (and are) flat in a lot of cases, which leads to some things looking slightly weird and low rez.\n\nThe animation in the game is.. pretty bad. The characters move stiffly, or not at all, and the lip synching is terrible in both Japanese and English languages. it never quite matches what the characters are saying. The animations basically just feel very rushed.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game lookes fine visually. The animations are sometimes painful to watch and the textures look flat and drab. 5/10\n\nIn conclusion, despite it's flaws I think it's a great game, especially so if you've played the two previous.\n\nIn total I'd score this game 85/100", "timestamp_created": 1471609714, "timestamp_updated": 1471609714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24994725": {"recommendationid": "24994725", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982938152", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 949, "last_played": 1591033598}, "language": "english", "review": "C O M P L E X\nM O T I V E S", "timestamp_created": 1471535565, "timestamp_updated": 1471535565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478860914707183838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24965788": {"recommendationid": "24965788", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970382583", "num_games_owned": 1414, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1110, "last_played": 1471400771}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to overstate how well written this game is.

Compared to the previous one, which I consider a masterpiece, the puzzles are not as challenging(I have to say, there are too many hints, I'd rather have the option to choose easy/hard and be able to figure more stuff alone), yet some were still pretty interesting, the plot was weird, but it was again pretty well written. One thing that felt bad was the duration of the game, it was quite shorter than the previous one. The animation also felt strange.\n\nThe series' main characteristics, though, are there. An amazing story, with many plot twists, well written(although with one... strange, questionable part. Just one though), cool puzzle rooms and really interesting characters.

I do believe they could have improved the experience; maybe by showing exactly where each fragment lay on the timeline BEFORE playing through it, but irregardless I greatly enjoyed this title and fully recommend it to anyone who liked the Saw movies.\nI do have three additional warnings however.\n1) The price tag is a bit steep for what you get at $40, I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale first\n2) The first section of the game is a bit slow and repetitive - stick with it, and do not be afraid to make bad choices - you'll be able to change them later\n3) DO NOT cheat and look at the passwords guide until the very end or you saw the password in your playthrough but forgot it - those road blocks are there to make you experience the other sections before coming back with the correct answers", "timestamp_created": 1470645353, "timestamp_updated": 1470645855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24771729": {"recommendationid": "24771729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300151032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1468536062}, "language": "english", "review": "Chances are, if you're looking at buying this game, then you have already been part of this cult following since the first or second game.

If I lose - more review.\n\nDamn. Okay, here we go. Let us embark into a 20 hour [strike]review[/strike] Decision Game!\n\nFirst of all: I have no prior knowledge or Experience with the Zero Escape Series. Say: 999 and VLR.\n\nThis gamme is a Puzzle Game / Visual Novel, but unlike your average visual Novel all dialoge is voiced and acted by character models in the respective rooms. So, in Game Cutscenes pretty much.\nThe Story is pretty simple (and might be known from a certain other Spike Chunsoft game involving a killing game)\n9 people are trapped in an underground shelter. They are split in groups of 3 and awake for 90 minutes at a time. After that their memories of those 90 minutes are erased. To get out of the shelter they need six Passwords. A Password is revealed once a person dies. If you did the math, then six of the nine people (at least) have to die so the rest could escape. \nAnd here is where the game starts to shine: You dont play the stories of the 3 teams in a linear fashion. Rather than this, you have a global flowchart, based on a decision made by the 3 teams which splits the timeline into 4 different ones. You pick those 90 minute, amnesia ending snippets (called Fragments in game) and play through it. Some require you to make a Decision which might end up causing deaths or other bad (or good) things to happen. You are able to jump in and out of completed Fragments to see different outcomes or to just check what the devs came up with for text entering possibilities.\n\nFor example - I keep this part as vague as possible but still, Spoiler tags\n\n[spoiler] One character from a team ends up dead at the beginning of a fragment. Another character aquires a weapon and believes you (the player controlled character) did it and threatens you to spit out the name. I have tried a lot of names that come up in the game, including end game very spoilery ones and I got different responses such as \"You say it was ME? Stop prouting Bullshit!\" upon entering the gun wielders name, \"I can see that, but you are probably acting for him\" upon entering Zero, the name the game master calls himself and \"Interesting, But I dont know where that is\" with the super duper spoilery name[/spoiler]\n\nThis also happened with another whudunnit text entry, but in textbox form. \n\nThe VN Action is Broken by Escape the Room-Style Puzzle games. Those arent too hard or require you to have extensive knowledge about a lot of things (since usually upon checking a puzzle long enough, they will give you hints that become less subtile). I stopped the time on one I thought was going rather fast, and it took me about 20 minutes.\n\nIf there is one thing I have to complain, its that the voices, especially the voice of Zero, was very quiet and with a fan running next to me, I could barely understand what he said. This might have been due to my Laptops crappy sound output, but still, even with headphones it was hard to make out what he was saying.\n\nMusic is wonderful and fitting to the situation, the Puzzles are very well crafted and the Story is just [i] Woah [/i]\n\nOverall, a good solid recomendation", "timestamp_created": 1469967602, "timestamp_updated": 1469967612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572063207626342773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24630060": {"recommendationid": "24630060", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965957763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 990, "last_played": 1469953136}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been a long time since I\u2019ve played a game nonstop for many hours.

Well, not really, the author still found a way to spice it up, and make the players still doubt each other\u2019s. \n\nOne of the change that I like is the animation of the story (not the animation itself, it's actually not that good).

This game largely is non-linear, which is awesome, but can be potentially random and confusing due to the story jumping all over the place. In saying that the game works well by doing just that because you are trying to piece together all the threads of a story that takes many twists and turns throughout. I was impressed by how everything came together and take my hat off to the developers for creating quite a complex tree of decisions and plot branches to get to the end. Next point of warning relates to the story being told: there is a HUGE number of cutscenes which cannot be skipped or fast forwarded. I love a good cutscene but I do believe this game could have snipped a fair few of them out of the game. I found myself not having touched mouse/keyboard in upwards of an hour at some points. They do serve character development, of course, but when the ratio of interactive gameplay and cutscenes is out of whack and is noticeable then there may be a problem. Perhaps a few more puzzles scattered through the ending may have broken up the long videos. Hence why by the end of the game I was quite relieved that the story was done. But, why the thumbs up? This game does have a very addictive knack of creating mystery, having some challenging puzzles and having some of the solutions to those puzzles requiring a lot of pen and paper notes plus scattering answers throughout other scenes that pushes this beyond a hidden object game. If you don't like a challenge, don't like puzzles, or like to use a hint function within a game then don't play this. The mood of this game does replicate any 'escape room' scenarios ala 'Saw' and is 110% not suitable for children. There is a lot of death in the game, some very strong adult themes, and terminology that is going to fly straight over most  younger people's heads but for the adult audience this is very much a Japanese style game that is very familiar to anyone who's watched most Japanese extreme cinema or watched a bit of Anime.

Note that you do sort of spoil some things that happen in the other games, but I wouldn't say it's massive plot twists that would make playing the other games unnessecary. I played this with my partner that didn't play the other games and yet we both knew about the same at the same moments. In fact, we look forward to the PC ports of the other games! :)\n[*]The game features violence and blood, but you never see actual extreme gore.

That's not really an issue by itself, but the story is further divided into fragments that you can watch individually. I didn't really know where to start and most things made no sense at all.

Later on when you've played some more fragments, things start to make more sense though. \n[*]Sometimes you can get stuck in the various timelines and you simply don't know what to do. The main timeline isn't always clear enough to show you what options you have left. \n[/list]\n\nI can't mention enough how good the story of this game was. It reminded me of the \"Saw\" movies, with less gore and a lot better story. I'm really glad I've played this series and I think it's one of the best games I've ever played story-wise. I couldn't recommend it any more than that. If you have the patience to appreciate a good story, definitely consider picking this up!\n\n[i]Was this review useful to you?

Although I'd have to admit all games in the series are pretty flawed in one way or another, I'd still recommend giving these a look if you're down for a pretty well written mystery/thriller with an unmistakably Japanese flavor. So before we go any further, know that THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN LIGHT SPOILERS FOR 999 AND VIRTUE'S LAST REWARD because I have no idea how to discuss this series' convoluted plot otherwise\n\nZero Time Dilemma begins in December of 2028 at the Dcom facility in Nevada and takes place after the events of 999, but before the events of Virtue's Last Reward. Sigma and Phi have traveled back in time and joined what is known as \"The Dcom experiment\" in order to prevent the outbreak of the Radical-6 virus which has killed most of Earth's population in the future. They are joined by Junpei and Akane from 999 who have been tracking the movements of a terrorist organization known as \"Free the Soul\" whose objectives also include destroying humanity. They are joined by heroic firefighter Carlos, sad sack Eric, seductive Mira, a somehow familiar looking girl named Diana, and a young boy boy has no memory and wears a strange capsule on his head. As part of the Dcom experiment, the group of them are (of course) locked in a facility and forced to play a deadly \"decision game\". The group is forced to split into 3 teams and told that at any point if 6 people are dead, the remaining survivors will be allowed to escape. Additionally, every 90 minutes a drug from the participants bracelets is injected which puts them to sleep and wipes their short term memories. Pretty crazy stuff\n\nThe story of Zero Time Dilemma is told in 90 minute \"fragments\" where you choose what team you'd like to follow and watch what events play out over the next 90 minutes. Only you initially have no idea where those 90 minutes fit into the grand timeline of the game. Sometimes you'll start a fragment and half of the group will be already dead and you'll have no idea why. I actually found this approach to storytelling a little annoying and hard to follow as I never knew where in the timeline I was and near the end I couldn't keep track of all the reveals of who was dead and who was alive and why.\n\nAfter 999's static images and fixed camera, Virtue's Last Reward introduced voice acting and full 3d models with moderately successful results. Zero Time Dilemma takes it even farther with a much more distinctly cinematic approach to portraying its story. Zero Time Dilemma uses much more camera panning and animations during cutscenes. This is a slightly less successful transition unfortunately. It was pretty clear that the animation team was either rushed or not very experienced. Animations are jerky and forced and the lip sync is pretty questionable. It personally didn't bother me too much, but it was certainly notable and I know a lot of people will find the stiff animations a distracting drawback\n\nI thought the puzzles in Zero Time Dilemma were some of the best of the series. They were varied, interesting and had me pulling out actual pen and paper to work through problems. Depending on the order of the fragments you play, the pacing of the puzzle rooms can be a little weird though. In my experience, I had tons of puzzle rooms in the beginning and middle of the game, but almost none near the end which made playing through the end of the game more like watching a movie. Speaking of the end... it was kind of a let down. Without discussing any spoilers, the ending was sort of plain and disappointing which was a surprise in of itself since 999 and Virtue's Last Reward had such huge reveals and shocking twists. Ahh well, it was still nice to finally have some sort of closure for this series.\n\nRegardless of what the marketing of this game wants you to believe, you can't play it without playing the first two games first. Or at least you shouldn't. Start there first or else you'll likely be massively confused. For veterans of the series, this game will offer some closure for the story, albeit a slightly disappointing one. I still must admit I enjoyed this game a lot as it features some of the strongest puzzle rooms in the series.

Wait for it to go on sale, even if you're a fan of the series. \n\n6/10\n\nMore below.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nA valid and passionate attempt to finish out the Zero Escape series that falls flat in puzzle challenge and curve, character development, and an enormous amount of unsolved questions. \n\nIt had a lot of potential - the voice acting is decent, the musical remixes and new tracks are on par with the rest of the series, and while most of the story's twists were predictable after a point, some DID leave me impressed at the amount of hidden foreshadowing and Uchikoshi's general ability to blow the player away. Given a few more months minimum of polishing the story and gameplay, this could have been an outstanding game to end the series with a bang. As it is, it sends the series out with a thousand more question marks and a wet, sad fizzle. \n\nReturning characters' consistency is all over the place, while new characters are flat and dull. Puzzle rooms are surprisingly empty in challenge for an M-label audience - outside two INCREDIBLY hard ones, most puzzles presented are either boring, extremely repetitive, or both, requiring less of the logic that other ZE titles favor and more just a pair of working eyes and an ability to see that \"X goes into Y\". When I become less excited for puzzles in favor of frustration over a third \"fit all the items in the box\" minigame with no change in difficulty, it speaks for how much fun I as a player am having and how much I want to continue the game for the sake of finding new things. And while the story had its moments, most of it felt like the writers were dragging their feet. Dialogue was stale, character chemistry was awkward, various points unresolved from 999 and VLR were not addressed even in passing, and (my biggest complaint) one particular twist anchoring much of the end of the game felt completely out of genre - a deus ex machina that tried to explain a lot but felt thrown in as an afterthought, not even touching the ideas of Quantum Theory and the possibilities of the human mind and body that existed in other games. It made the rushed ending even less enjoyable. Even the addition of epilogue files to try and wrap things up after the cinematics end falls short, several characters not even making an appearance for a \"happy ending\".\n\nTHAT ALL SAID, THOUGH: I'm still a fan of the series, and I still do have a fondness for the purpose of this title, even if this game is on the bottom of the trilogy by a long shot for me. If you have played the other two Zero Escape titles (and you should - much of this game won't strike as hard if you're playing it blind), then I'd recommend getting this for the sake of completion and some manner of story resolution... but NOT full price. Lack of engaging puzzles, a 20-hour-max play time and no major replayability afterwards really makes it hard to defend the $40 USD price tag.\n\nWait until a good Steam Sale if you're that desperate to pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1468993936, "timestamp_updated": 1468994269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50411522388458252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24416838": {"recommendationid": "24416838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055792982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1391, "last_played": 1468970473}, "language": "english", "review": "As an avid fan of the Zero Escape series i was overjoyed to find out that Zero Time Dilemma would be released on Steam as i currently dont own a handheld. After truly believing the final installment would never happen and we would be left with that cliffhanger forever, i had a lot of expectations for this game. And while it started off strongly i cant help but feel slightly disappointed by the end.\n\nThe puzzles are brilliant and twisted, although i found them to be a bit easier then in previous installments. The story for ZE has always been a bit over the top, but i feel like this one took the biscuit, especially with what i felt like was a deus ex machina. The characters are great, apart from Eric, and the soundtrack is as great as before (although mostly due to previously used themes). \n\nI have given it a positive rating as it is a GREAT game overall, but it just felt like it could have been so much more. I even finished the true ending and wondered where the hidden branches were for the epilogue and all you get are some files.
