We will also someday name our future children (that come out from your belly!) after Hotline Miami characters. We will also teach our kids about Hotline Lore and that sort of stuff, we can also homeschool them if you want (because private school is expensive and public school is a bit biased). Preferably 18+ btw, so if you're below 18, you'll have to wait to get this! You should also be willing to work to support the family, don't worry though, I'll gladly take care of the children while you're away working your office job (in-between full combos, of course!)! I'll play along with them and teach them how to be the best Hotline Miami players around!

Enter Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, which not only comes with a deeper story than its predecessor, but with a much more diverse soundtrack, and newer characters with unique gimmicks.\n\nSet within an alternate 1980s Florida, Wrong Number revolves around a series of morally-questionable protagonists who are either hunting down a truth, or finding means to sate their bloodlust.  The sharper controls help with the more complex missions, and if you're coming fresh off Hotline 1, it can seem a little daunting with the more unusual characters, but the game never asks more than what your keyboard demands.\n\nSome character highlights include:\n- A brother-and-sister duo controlled simultaneous with gun and chainsaw\n- A journalist who refuses to use guns\n- An experienced soldier on a stealth mission\n\nThe soundtrack also takes a huge leap in quality, and while it's all still the same retrowave feel of the first game, the variety of moods the OST brings is far stronger to give each character their own unique voice in their separate scenarios.  If you haven't played Hotline 1 yet, consider that a tutorial if you get it on sale.  Otherwise, Wrong Number is the stronger game, and Hotline 1 has such little story within it, that you can safely skip the first game to enjoy its sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1700447476,

It was immediately 5 times more frustrating than the first game and I almost got tired of it... because I was used to 1. \n\nBut then I got used to planning out my attack lines. Picking up the right weapon for each room. Prioritizing certain targets. It got to be totally awesome.\n\nExcept there's no satisfaction to the story. It's a beautifully weird and completely disconnected set of details that somehow comes together in the end and I love it for that reason. I love the new characters and I love how it all ties together, but... it just hurts. \n\nPeople complain about how basic the game is and the quality of life things that just aren't there, and the constant cheesing enemies through doors. I get it! But it's an artistic experience and it's really fun except for the few times it isn't, and even then you love it anyways. \n\nI don't give objective ratings based on subjective preference because that's dumb.

It takes the ground work the first game setup and expands upon it. The characters are like-able, their stories are unique and interesting and they did a REALLY good job of tying everything together and wrapping everything up.\n\u2022 Graphics are consistent with the first game and are still good looking for retro style\n\u2022 The soundtrack is great and stays consistent with the previous game. I would even go as far as to say this game's sound track is superior in some ways.\n\u2022 The variety of characters adds variety to completing levels and offers different choices based on your personal play style\n\u2022 Progressive difficulty really ramps up the challenge more so than the first game. The training wheels come off much quicker in this one.\n\n-CONS-\n\n\u2022 The doors are still a broken, buggy mess. You would think having 2.5 years between the first game and this one that they would have focused on getting them fixed. Expect gunfire to fail to penetrate the doors, fail to penetrate past door frames, melee attacks failing to hit when in or through a door frame, your character phasing through doors and enemies teleporting through doors/walls to kill you in 1-hit.\n\u2022 Dogs can turn door knobs and open doors\n\u2022 The detective characters do not have service pistols/firearms for some reason? So you start their levels with nothing\n\u2022 Apparently in the 80's our military didn't have ballistic/bulletproof vests or helmets being deployed behind enemy lines\n\u2022 Bugs out the wazoo. Enemy A.I. will have seizures occasionally, get stuck in walls and on 2 separate occasions I became stuck or stuck in a wall and needed an enemy to find me with a gun to kill me to progress.\n\u2022 You can drop/throw weapons out of bounds or past invisible walls, which can sometimes instantly result in a failed level because you have nothing to defend yourself with. You shouldn't be able to throw weapons in unreachable locations.\n\u2022 Scenarios are RNG at times because the spawns change seemingly at random occasionally so beware of that\n\u2022 1v1 melee combat is also at times RNG on you winning the fight. Basically if the game gives you the dice roll on a swing against the enemy swinging at the same time.\n\u2022 Some levels cannot be completed with certain masks unless it's possible to bug/glitch encounters. They did not balance the masks in this game to be usable in all levels.\n\u2022 The characters you play know what kind of scenarios they are getting into and choose to go into them empty handed during certain levels even if you procure a gun in a previous level at full ammo capacity to take with you.\n\u2022 Expect to get killed off-screen by enemies you cannot see in just about every level and countless rage inducing trial and error processes to map out where all of the enemies are or their general vicinity.\n\n-CONCLUSION-\n\n5/10\n\nThis is a game that exists and is a faithful sequel to the original. I enjoyed getting through with the game and the final level was a treat for me personally. The story is superior in every way to the first game and so is the soundtrack. If it wasn't for those 2 pros specifically, I would have given this a 3/10. I still recommend if you can look past all the things that don't make sense and it being riddled with bugs. If you played the first game like I did, then you will likely enjoy it. $15 isn't a bad price, but I would suggest getting it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1700284625, "timestamp_updated":

It prides itself on its top-down one hit die mechanic, and it flourishes. Despite dying being a punishment, it never feels like it. Mainly for the reason that through every death, you actively become better and better, following a specific rhythm, and its not drawn out because all you have to do is hit \"R\" once. I do have my gripes with the game, such as it not expanding on jackets story, and you never really have a chance to enjoy the characters and get attached to them because of how little you play as them before their inevitable death throughout the story. As mush as i enjoyed that said story, it's incredibly difficult to learn it by yourself, and you'll always end up having to search up a youtube video abt it. That aside, however, the game play itself is ball dropping. It always has you on your toes, and stressed, and the violence is great.\n\nIt's a rather short experience, but if you have the money: BUY IT!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1699804798, "timestamp_updated": 1700693166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150007910": {"recommendationid": "150007910", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105840544", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2810, "last_played": 1697829812}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games i have played in a while.

(Nota: Una vez que termina una canci\u00f3n, se vuelve a repetir; por lo que, si est\u00e1s estancado en un nivel, la m\u00fasica puede un poco ser estresante si es una melod\u00eda que no sea del 100% de tu agrado y, aunque nunca lo hice con este juego, puedes escuchar m\u00fasica por otro medio; lo importante es que disfrutes el juego). Para terminar con este aspecto, me encanta la rapidez con la que puedes reiniciar un nivel, \u00bfperdiste ni bien comenzar? Solo presiona R y, mientras la m\u00fasica no se detiene por m\u00e1s que mueras, sigue intentando.\n\nEn cuanto a su historia es, algo raro de explicar, no porque sea una trama cinematogr\u00e1fica con un mill\u00f3n de fumadas ni nada, solo que, por decirlo de alguna forma, tienes 2 puntos de vista; me explico:\nEste videojuego es considerado como una cr\u00edtica a la violencia en los videojuegos, es muy sangriento a pesar de ser solo pixeles, y satisface 2 partes bien diferenciadas de los jugadores: Los que buscan jugar un momento (como lo es mi caso por falta de tiempo) y, los que se encargan de revisar detalles de la historia y a partir de ah\u00ed construirla, tomar en cuenta cada punto y di\u00e1logo.\nCuando acab\u00e9 los dos videojuegos, no hab\u00eda entendido mucho; sin embargo, tras ver un video en youtube, me di cuenta que la historia era muy interesante y sent\u00ed que no hab\u00eda disfrutado de lo que tiene por ofrecer (l\u00f3gicamente esto porque no le di el tiempo que se merece, actualmente re-juego un nivel como si fuera una partida r\u00e1pida o intento sacar la A+ en alg\u00fan nivel), esto en un principio, me desanimaba un poco porque sent\u00eda que jugaba por jugar aunque, tras entender el por qu\u00e9 de esta decisi\u00f3n, pues simplemente lo acept\u00e9. Ojo, esto no implica que no sea disfrutable el juego, solo que, si eres alguien que busca una historia clara y no quiere adentrarse demasiado o, como es mi caso, no juega muy seguido y se olvida de detalles, pues sinceramente (y sin faltar el respeto a esta obra) quiz\u00e1s no sea el videojuego que buscas, aunque no soy qui\u00e9n para decidir por ti.\n\nUn detallito que se me pas\u00f3 por alto es el editor de niveles, que si bien a\u00fan no lo he probado, he visto niveles que, a simple vista, son muy llamativos (Es como Geometry Dash, pero en menor medida).\n\nEntonces, \u00bfDeber\u00edas jugar este videojuego?\nUn rotundo s\u00ed, no es como \"Tienes que jugar este videojuego antes de morir\", pero verdaderamente vale la pena, su gameplay se basa en seguir intentando y la banda sonora es buen\u00edsima, sus colores son brillantes y muy de los 80's, la \u00e9poca que se ambienta es bastante atractiva, y todo el tema de las mafias rusas y las llamadas telef\u00f3nicas resulta ser muy interesante.\nMi consejo es que lo compres cuando este en oferta (no porque pagar lo que vale regularmente no valga la pena, solo que; algo se vuelve mejor si lo pillas m\u00e1s barato xd). Si eres alguien que le gusta el gameplay fren\u00e9tico y que no tiene mucho tiempo, este juego te puede divertir y, si por el otro lado, eres alguien que quiere profundizar en la historia y puedes recordar detalles, o juegas muy seguido, tambi\u00e9n es para ti; la historia no es una obra cinematogr\u00e1fica al nivel de El Padrino, Metal Gear Solid, The Last of Us o los Backyardingans, pero es buen\u00edsima y resulta interesante descubrir cada detalle como jugador, sientes la revelaci\u00f3n y ves si tus sospechas eran ciertas o no. \nAl final del d\u00eda, es tu decisi\u00f3n, no soy qui\u00e9n para decidir por ti, pero, espero que te sirva de ayuda (si alguien lee todo esto. si no mejor lo hago video en youtube xd).\nSi te decides en comprarlo solo dir\u00e9:\n[h2]DISFR\u00daTALO A TU MANERA.[/h2]", "timestamp_created": 1699370353, "timestamp_updated": 1699370445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149698384": {"recommendationid": "149698384", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096351371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 260, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1700718041}, "language": "english", "review": "silly machine gun go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr", "timestamp_created": 1699354593, "timestamp_updated": 1699354593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149698262": {"recommendationid": "149698262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930462732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1699088858}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm quite late to the series but this is probably one of the most phenomenal end of a game series that I've played so far.

I feel like a lot of people miss out on certain themes either from just not caring or being too ignorant to comment on them and will thus call stuff they don't like \"convoluted\" or \"pretentious\" or \"thinking it's way smarter than it actually is.\" Insults like that always come across to me as projection, and here it's no different.\n\nHotline Miami 2 not only comments on certain concepts in its own world, but in a genius way offers a meta idea with each of these concepts. The fans are obviously representative of the people who loved Hotline Miami 1 and wanted more of the violence, action, power trips, and insanity in that game. The henchman represents the more human aspect of the enemies, and also tells the player that these pixel enemies are actual people in their own world. The question of how we process and look at violence in video games and other forms of media is everywhere here. And the developers actually take it a step further and shows you what constant escalation of violence leads to. For that, you'll have to play the game for yourself and either be alert to the subtle world building and underlying messages here.\n\nNow onto the gameplay. If you liked Hotline Miami 1 this is essentially more of the same. Super addicting, super violent, and super fast paced. I've seen some people call these levels bad because they're difficult, but I strongly disagree. For starters, the more difficult levels they're referring to actually have a narrative reason for being so difficult. You try raiding a f*cking nuclear power plant with a squad of 4 soldiers, knowing that the military is expecting you to die and is only sending you because you're expendable. Or try getting revenge on a different mafia family that took advantage of the fact that you were so targeted by the main character in the first game. To me, the added difficulty is appreciated and makes a lot of sense. Plus, let's be real it's not like any of this is impossible. You can get through this game in like 5 hours if you just use some strategy ffs.  \n\nThe presentation is incredible, so much so that I can't think of many games that can pull it off so effortlessly as the Hotline Miami games. The soundtrack is superb all the way through, the visuals are fun, vibrant, and chaotic, and there's some really nice imagery. My favorite example of this imagery would have to be Richard and his role as a foreshadow of death. It's really quality stuff that is hard to not love.\n\nOverall, this game is mostly what you'd expect: Hotline Miami 2. But it takes the first game and greatly increases the scope of everything. I don't know which one I like more, but they're both classic games that you should play.", "timestamp_created": 1699304572, "timestamp_updated": 1699304572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20,

Hotline Miami does not feel the same without a playable Jacket or Biker. It's like having a Super Mario game without Mario and Luigi. \n\nCharacters aside, playing HM2 feels more like a slog. The level design is the biggest problem, with unrealistically large, open spaces full of enemies that have infinite sight range. The melee weapons seem more unreliable in HM2 than in HM1. But the worst problem has to be the buggy dogs, which have not been fixed (in fact, they might be worse). They can get you through doors without even seeing you first. Overall, HM2 is more painful than fun.\n\nIf you are an aesthetics person who appreciates fun instead of pointless pain through means of escapism, just stick to Hotline Miami 1. If anything, you should only get Hotline Miami 2 for the level editor.

Sin embargo ninguno de los cambios a\u00f1adidos me han gustado, salvo quiz\u00e1s el mayor \u00e9nfasis en la trama contando con diferentes personajes jugables, algunos de los cuales tienen relevancia en la primera entrega aunque sigue siendo muy abstracta, al menos para m\u00ed. En este caso en lugar de contar con un \u00fanico personaje con diferentes habilidades seg\u00fan la m\u00e1scara que porte contaremos con diferentes avatares seg\u00fan el nivel con variaciones desbloqueables.\n\nLos niveles son mas grandes y complejos, lo que podr\u00eda parecer algo bueno pero conlleva un gran problema: la distancia de visi\u00f3n. En algunos niveles se incluyen pasillos con enemigos que no podemos ver por la longitud del mismo y obliga a disparar de lejos para abatirlos de casualidad o arriesgarnos a atravesar el nivel a ciegas lo que exige una rapid\u00edsima velocidad de reacci\u00f3n. A parte de esto, algunos niveles son demasiado largos y dif\u00edciles haciendo desesperante el terminarlo.\n\nWrong Number sigue siendo un juego divertido pero que no llega a la calidad de su antecesor, adem\u00e1s de ser mas repetitivo e injusto en comparaci\u00f3n.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698240298, "timestamp_updated": 1698240298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148833985": {"recommendationid": "148833985", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213006159", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1698559348}, "language": "english", "review": "play this when youre high", "timestamp_created": 1698215786, "timestamp_updated": 1698215786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148829736": {"recommendationid": "148829736", "author": {"steamid": "76561199537867719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1699498030}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1698207613, "timestamp_updated": 1698207613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148828545": {"recommendationid": "148828545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078869716", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1707, "last_played": 1698262260}, "language": "english", "review": "Do I like this game enough to give it a nice review?

By the time you get good enough at it to find it appropriate in difficulty your most hated levels will have become you favorite and your least favorite character will have something you miss when

Tiene m\u00e1s niveles, con la misma o a\u00fan m\u00e1s rejugabilidad, sus nuevas mec\u00e1nicas son cuanto menos interesantes, ejemplo de esto son Alex y Ash que poseen dos personajes en uno o Corey con su giro (que dudo que alguien con suficiente inteligencia quiera usarlo), las cuales le a\u00f1aden un toque de refrescura al juego.\n\nPros: A comparaci\u00f3n de la primera entrega, Hotline Miami 2 posee mayor cantidad de niveles, m\u00e1s personajes jugables y un soundtrack m\u00e1s extenso con m\u00e1s artistas y frecuencias, tiene una historia m\u00e1s comprensible (A\u00fan que seguro necesitaras visitar paginas de gu\u00edas o v\u00eddeos para comprenderla del todo), y su gameplay, se siente m\u00e1s rico, con m\u00e1s movilidad, m\u00e1s satisfacci\u00f3n al matar y con mayor variedad de enemigos y los niveles, son m\u00e1s extensos. Para esta segunda entrega, los de Dennaton Games prefirieron que la puntuaci\u00f3n se quede mayormente en el combo, decisi\u00f3n que al principio si bien, no estaba demasiado feliz con escucharlo, a medida que lo fui jugando, descubr\u00ed que en verdad, era muy enriquecedor, manteniendote pegado a la pantalla de la pc, d\u00e1ndole al juego m\u00e1s tensi\u00f3n de que puedas perder el combo y mayor satisfacci\u00f3n al terminar el nivel y ver que todo tu esfuerzo te dio una merecida S en el rango final.\n\nContras: \nAlabo este juego con toda mi alma, lo que Hotline Miami hac\u00eda mal, en este juego lo agarraron y lo cambiaron abruptamente, mejorando y cambiando en una manera positiva, por ejemplo, los sprites del primer juego que estaban deformes, cambiaron, sin muchas o nulas deformidades a la vista.

original excels in fast, tight combat in corridors, apartment buildings, etc. Being able to see the enemies and strategist the most efficient way to take them down was part of the fun. Then, you would hatch your plan over and over, optimizing each time until you were a killing machine. That last run feels so good, and you earned it through trial and error/death.\n\nIn contrast, HM2's much larger maps makes this nearly impossible. here's so much dying to enemies off screen that you can't really predict. I don't mind a challenge, I got an A+ on every mission in the original, but it just got repetitive. You don't get the feedback of how to approach it differently, at least not as clearly as before.\n\nExample: \n\nHM1: \"There's a brute character who takes more hits in that room. Got it, I need to back up and give myself room to take him down before he can get me.\"\n\nHM2: \"I'm got shot from... somewhere...\"\n\nSome may disagree, but it just is not the same.", "timestamp_created": 1695352173, "timestamp_updated": 1695352173, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438508421182632446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146753237": {"recommendationid": "146753237", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101276084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1069, "last_played": 1673198125}, "language": "english", "review": "g", "timestamp_created": 1695350026, "timestamp_updated": 1695350026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146745653": {"recommendationid": "146745653", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070352631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1009, "last_played": 1696818409}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1695339673, "timestamp_updated": 1695339673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146718834": {"recommendationid": "146718834", "author": {"steamid": "76561199203210308", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 1415, "last_played": 1700754519}, "language": "english", "review": "Corey is very hot 10/10 will cum again", "timestamp_created": 1695312443, "timestamp_updated": 1695312443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146714198": {"recommendationid": "146714198", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098908782", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1698796822}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number es un juego que lleva la experiencia de su predecesor, Hotline Miami, a un nivel completamente nuevo y emocionante. Este juego de acci\u00f3n indie, desarrollado por Dennaton Games, contin\u00faa con la f\u00f3rmula de acci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida y brutal que hizo que su predecesor fuera un \u00e9xito, pero agrega una profundidad adicional a la historia y la jugabilidad que lo hace a\u00fan m\u00e1s atractivo.\n\nUna de las caracter\u00edsticas m\u00e1s notables de Hotline Miami 2 es su estilo visual y sonoro. El juego se desarrolla en una versi\u00f3n alternativa y retorcida de los a\u00f1os 80, y esto se refleja perfectamente en su est\u00e9tica retro y su fant\u00e1stica banda sonora llena de sintetizadores y m\u00fasica electr\u00f3nica. Cada nivel est\u00e1 meticulosamente dise\u00f1ado para crear una experiencia visual y auditiva inmersiva que te sumerge por completo en su mundo.\n\nEn cuanto a la jugabilidad, Hotline Miami 2 mantiene el enfoque en la acci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida y letal que caracteriz\u00f3 a la primera entrega. Cada nivel es un rompecabezas de violencia en el que debes planificar tus movimientos con cuidado, aprovechar las armas y objetos disponibles, y aprender de tus errores para superar a los enemigos. La dificultad del juego es alta, pero la satisfacci\u00f3n de superar cada desaf\u00edo es a\u00fan mayor.\n\nLo que realmente destaca en Hotline Miami 2 es su narrativa. La historia es compleja ya menudo desconcertante, pero est\u00e1 llena de giros sorprendentes y momentos impactantes que mantienen tu inter\u00e9s en todo momento. La trama se desarrolla a trav\u00e9s de m\u00faltiples personajes jugables, cada uno con su propia perspectiva y experiencia, lo que agrega una capa adicional de profundidad a la historia.\n\nEn resumen, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number es una secuela que cumple y supera las expectativas. Combina una est\u00e9tica retro impresionante con una jugabilidad adictiva y una narrativa intrigante. Si disfrutaste del primer juego o eres fan\u00e1tico de los juegos indie con un toque \u00fanico, definitivamente deber\u00edas darle una oportunidad a esta obra maestra. Es un viaje salvaje y emocionante que te mantendr\u00e1 pegado a la pantalla de principio a fin.", "timestamp_created": 1695309076, "timestamp_updated": 1695309076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

At first I thought it was a shell of its predecessor. but then as i finished the game and started to understand it I looked past the game play and the real story really hits deep. About a detective struggling with his personality and attention, a man who wants to help his mother, a soldier who wants a break, a dedicated writer, obsessed fans, and a son who wants nothing more than to make his late father proud. Truly and amazing game. Great soundtrack, Story, Game play and feel. This game captured the feeling of emptiness why providing a fun experience. and through it all a good message. \"Do you like hurting other people\" It really really sinks in once you realize this game is about not characters but about you.

Miami\" - A Violent and Visually Striking Masterpiece\n\n\"Hotline Miami\" is a video game that has captivated gamers since its release, and for good reason. This indie gem, developed by Dennaton Games and published by Devolver Digital, is a neon-soaked, adrenaline-pumping experience that leaves an indelible mark on players. Its unique blend of style, gameplay, and narrative makes it a true standout in the gaming world.\n\nOne of the game's most striking features is its aesthetic. \"Hotline Miami\" transports players to a grimy, 1980s Miami dripping with neon lights and pulsating with a synthwave soundtrack. The pixel art style, while seemingly simplistic, is a work of art in itself, creating a visually mesmerizing experience. This distinctive style doesn't just serve as eye candy; it enhances the game's atmosphere, drawing players into its gritty, neon-soaked world.\n\nBut \"Hotline Miami\" isn't just about looks; it's about gameplay, and it delivers in spades. The core of the game revolves around fast-paced, top-down combat that demands precision and strategy. Each level is a puzzle of sorts, with enemies, weapons, and obstacles to navigate. The beauty of \"Hotline Miami\" lies in its unforgiving nature - one hit kills, and death is a constant companion. This forces players to think on their feet, plan their moves carefully, and execute with flawless precision. The satisfaction of clearing a room full of foes with a perfectly executed sequence of actions is unparalleled.\n\nThe soundtrack deserves special mention. Composed by artists such as Perturbator and M.O.O.N., the music is an integral part of the game's experience. The synth-heavy tracks not only complement the 1980s setting but also drive the gameplay. The music ebbs and flows with the action, intensifying as the player enters dangerous situations, creating a heart-pounding, immersive experience.\n\nStorytelling in \"Hotline Miami\" is intentionally enigmatic and surreal, leaving players to decipher its meaning. As the protagonist, Jacket, players receive mysterious phone calls instructing them to carry out brutal assassinations. The narrative is a puzzle, inviting players to piece together the fragments and draw their conclusions. It's a unique storytelling approach that adds depth and intrigue to the game.\n\n\"Hotline Miami\" isn't without its controversies, as its extreme violence and themes have sparked debates about the impact of video game content. However, it's essential to view it as a form of artistic expression, pushing boundaries and challenging conventions.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Hotline Miami\" is a great game because it successfully blends its striking visual style, adrenaline-pumping gameplay, and enigmatic narrative into an unforgettable experience.

Many may prefer the first game though for its simplicity in both.\n\nThe game has a lot of stories going on, taking place both before and after the first game, featuring loads of protagonists, telling why they're going on their own killing sprees. The protagonist of the first game even makes many story appearances, but most everyone probably won't recognize him at first because he never talks, and the pixel graphics were never detailed enough to make him look distinguishable.\nThe stories constantly jump from past to future and everywhere in between, and its lore goes pretty deep, so it's probably recommended to just look all this up on your own.\n\nI went for the highest rank on all the levels on the game's Hard mode, and doing so only highlighted for me how actually terribly broken this game is. I think most people don't notice its broken nature due to them being blinded by its naturally high difficulty. In other words, on top of the game being already hard, there's a lot of B.S. as well.\nWhile a lot of people seem to not like it, the stages are now larger and more gun-focused, which the idea in and of itself isn't necessarily bad, but the game wasn't designed for that.\nThe original game always had the character at the center of the screen, no matter how large or small the level was. However, in this game, there are plenty of times where the character can now touch the edges of the screen, but because the game was designed with the character being in the center at all times, the mouse cursor ends up moving along with the character while the screen stays still, making aiming with a mouse really awkward and annoying.\nAlso, as a result of these large stages, you're now more than likely to die from an enemy's gunshot that's off-screen, strongly encouraging you to constantly hold the shift key to see far-off enemies at all times and straining your pinky finger in the process. Even worse is when dealing with enemies that are above or below the game screen because their extremely high detection range seems to be designed with them being on the horizontal side of a 16:9 monitor, so enemies on the vertical side will more than often shoot you before they're even visible on-screen.\nThey changed how weapon pick-ups worked, which is already really annoying to deal with, but in doing so, they also seem to have broken something. The order you pick up a weapon is now determined by when they dropped, so even if you wanted the knife that you're standing on, you'll actually pick up the nearby empty shotgun instead simply because the empty shotgun was dropped first, and then you die because you thought you picked up the knife as an enemy runs to you. I think as a result of this new mechanic, there's a chance that you just won't pick up a different weapon on the ground at all. I've had many instances where I tried to pick up a weapon out of the three on the ground, but I only kept grabbing two of the three. Sometimes, a weapon just won't get picked up at all no matter how many times I keep pressing the grab button even if it's the only weapon near me, and only until I position my character slightly differently do I pick it up.\nThis game also has the same problems the first game had with its RNG enemy spawns, AI, and busted door mechanics. If you're going for high scores and big ranks, then you're at the absolute mercy of said RNG enemy spawns, AI, and busted door mechanics like in the first game, though all that is a lot more prominent here with its larger levels. You fire off a shot to lure an enemy, but they don't hear it even though that exact enemy did last time. You try to lure an enemy out of a room with your presence, but they turn around and shoot you in 3 frames even though they followed you outside the last time you did that. Enemies you thought stayed in a room, for some reason, went outside upon a restart, then stayed in the room upon another restart, still stayed upon another restart, moved outside upon another restart, stayed upon another, and so on. I've read people say that the randomized A.I. is intentional just for the sake of surprising you. It probably makes playing the game casually a little more enjoyable, though it hardly matters at all if you're just patient with your peeking and baiting, but going for proper high scores where you don't have the luxury of being patient is an absolute nightmare with that.\n\nWhat the game has going for it is its overall vibe and story. Its music is as amazing as ever and its multiple stories are very interesting if you can follow along.\nThe actual gameplay is absolutely busted. Just because someone can beat a game and get extremely high scores or whatever on it doesn't mean the gameplay is automatically good.", "timestamp_created": 1694849946, "timestamp_updated":

Not to mention that the story is so engaging, and the commentary on sensationalizing these kinds of atrocities and becoming desensitized to violence is beautifully executed. And as if all the twists, turns, and expectation subversion throughout the game wasn't enough, the existential dread of the ending really kicked me in the gut. This is not a game you're going to feel happy-go-lucky playing.

I don't know what I'm asking for here, maybe some NG+ thing (it kinda does though) where you can use any playstyles on any levels, but at most I had wished to have the possibility to do a Challenge Run like I could for all of HM1.\n\nAlso, Evan Wright's gameplay is completely broken, I hate him for it; it's not that it's bothersome I can't use ranged weapons for the most part, on the contrary it's a welcome playstyle where you can neutralize enemies peacefully, such as depleting the enemies' ammo which can extend your Combo and you can even move while doing so as you get closer to your next targets, but his said Combo system is where the problem lies, because when you get on top of an enemy, you can knock him out with only two punches, but either it gives you the Points and increase your Combo or not at all, you can see why this is annoying because me trying to get the best possible score is entirely based on how the game feels at that very moment, and it goes for every single characters he knocks out in this fashion, so you're bound to see this problem.  There is a way to go around this if you simply want A+ or S Rank; if you actually \"try\" to punch a third time, but not go through with it (Evan will visibly hold himself back), well that somehow gives you Points and the Combo again, but... it would be possible too to get the Points and Combo from simply knocking him out with two punches, then get them again by trying to do a third punch anyway.\n\nSo at most, every enemies as Evan can give you x2 to your Combo, make it x3 if they were holding a gun, but that's also the problem, it's never guaranteed that, even by playing expertly, you will ever get the Max possible Combo + Score in any of his levels, this isn't Dead Ahead where anybody could get it up to x90 with enough practice, because again knocking them out doesn't always gives you the Points Combo, and that's a risk that goes for every single guy you get on top of.  This is so stupid, honestly I would've loved Evan as his gameplay is the most unique and technical out of all the other characters because he doesn't just brute force his way in and he has two more ways to extend his Combos, but this is completely ruined for the aforementioned reasons, and so as an example of why this is hell, I kept having to restart Level 5 because he just couldn't get the full x6 Combo I wanted from the first 2 guys, again this is entirely based on luck if I get it or not, and this is a game you should know you die a lot in, so... have fun rerolling the dies for another 12!  Being a Score Attack game, I believe this randomness is inexcusable.\n\nNow for sure, there are only negatives so far, but these inconsistencies are mostly exclusive to Evan, otherwise everything else works pretty much as it should, and in fact, HM2 introduces a few weirdass playstyles that I can appreciate, like Alex & Ash, and aside from that, the level design, graphics, musics, punishing deaths, it's still what Hotline Miami does best, there's so much going on and there aren't that many games as highly punishing as this, it's pretty fun when you push through all the adversity.  Even when you die many times, you just restart right away, no reloading bullshit... well, aside from the transitions I'd wish to skip; I had to restart Level 4 a few times and I kinda had to sit through quite a few annoying transitions.\n\nI must say though that the Camera is quite a problem in this game, which I'm not exactly talking about visibility issues, but it's about keeping the characters in the center of the screen at all times, because when they're always in that same position, then you will always have an idea of where you're aiming, regardless of what the hell is happening.  At most, there was only ONE Level where Jacket in the first game wasn't perfectly aligned to the center at all times, otherwise though the levels were always floating in these weirdly pleasing colorful voids and the Devs didn't seemed to care about that, but HM2 has several levels where certain Areas are locked to the corners and you will have to approach the edges wether it's to continue fighting or to proceed, which means that aiming with the mouse is going to be a bit confusing at times as it breaks that seamless gameplay I was talking about as you'll need to find your Crosshair somewhere within the white or colorful pixels, it happened several times too many where I lost track of where I was aiming as I have to keep moving, in a game where time is key for keeping your Combo.  Even if you may try to compensate for being at the edge of the screen by aiming in a particular way like across a corridor, by going away from said edge, your aiming doesn't always align with what you were trying to do.  It's weird to explain, and I even feel weird having to explain it, but this is another problem where the gameplay isn't always consistent, especially when coming from HM1, and again while HM1 was only a one-off offender, HM2 has only made it several times worse as the buildings you're going through are oftentimes so large.\n\nThe story, I didn't dig all that much, and I also read the comics to try to make more sense out of it; it is weird as the continuity is all over the place and it switches through a ton of characters, personally I may prefer a more concise/focused story, but that in itself doesn't make the game any worse or anything, even HM1 has this \"Canon Vs. Non-Canon\" shit that I found mildly annoying to grasp, so I guess it's in line with the series, and HM2 does have a few moments where it uses the intertwined storylines to its advantage.  I'll just say this is more about personal tastes even if it did some cool things.\n\nBut yeah, IDK what to make of this one, it's still a well made game, but there's Evan which baffles me as to how he got away with his broken Combo System, it's annoying I kept losing my Score because I couldn't see my cursor due to the screen almost never keeping me in the middle now, and there's a tad bit less possible replayability than HM1, but again it can be fun just to go through and there's the Level Editor if you want more, that's always a plus.

If neutral was a thing I would most likely choose that.\nI want to preface that I only beaten the game once blindly and only the story.\n\nLevels feel wayyyyyyyy too overdrawn. Compared to 1 where everything feels 'snappy', 2 is to the point I feel like i'm being dragged a crossed the pavement. This applies to many elements to HM2, dying feels agonizing. I can die 1000 times over in HM1 and feel agitated but motivated to keep at it because everything is so short. 2 on the other hand, If i die on one segment and stay there for [X] amount of time, knowing that there is another segment right after, really frustrates me to no end. I feel like HM1 has at best, 2-3 segments per level while HM2 has up to like 6-8. WHY? That's way too much. I just want to wear a mask, kill everyone quickly and leave quickly. That's how it felt in HM1, in the sequel it feels like i'm in a never ending shootout where any mistake i make in one segment would push me back nearly 20-30mins of progress. And there's like 6-8 segments on some levels, so keep that in mind. I know I'm not good, I play very casually, but you can spike HM1 difficulty x20000 and see me die 100000x times but at least the segments are short, so it would still be tolerable. /rant\n\nThe story is cool and the beginning really shows you that this game isn't child friendly. Its dark, its gruesome, its bloody and thats how it should be. Its a messed up world in a messed up universe and even though the story doesn't seem really coherent it was an enjoyable experience.\n\nMusic is good, infact, i would debate its even better than HM1 in terms of music selection. Maybe I'm biased but Roller Mobster is goated, Thanks Carpenter Brut. \n\nSo overall, good music, interesting story, way too dragged out segments on singular levels.

This is one of those games where you can play the campaign over and over without getting bored. I believe it is to do with the scoring system because it makes you want to better your combos each time. The characters are great, more variety than the first and the music is so much better as well. Playing the game multiple times will make you start piecing together parts of the story so if you only play it once, you might be lost .\n   \n    The controls are great as usual and the game itself is pretty challenging at times, you will die a lot but it doesn't bother me like in most games where you die  a lot since the levels are that long. Think of this game like a puzzle at times, you have rooms of enemies and you have to approach encounters different ways or maybe certain ways to get through all of them. There are a good amount of weapons and the melee is fun too.\n\n    Post game, the real meat is the level editor. With the vast amount of user created levels, this bumps up the replay value incredibly high. Some people have made lengthy campaigns that pretty much match the length of the main game and the stuff people create is pretty awesome. I've been downloading one by one, all the most popular and high rated levels and campaigns and so far it has added 30+ hours after I beat the main game. That isn't even scratching the surface. I highly recommend this game, it is just too much fun and addicting!", "timestamp_created": 1692761462, "timestamp_updated": 1692761462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

additionally, devolver is one of my favorite publishers, as usually any game with them publishing is worth playing in my opinion. i've completed/reviewed a handful of games published by them already, and hotline miami 2 is no different in that it's an simply amazing game that is overlooked if you're only looking for AAA titles from huge companies with giant budgets. \n\nthe sequel plays similarly to the first game, only expanded upon. there's also almost twice as many 'levels' in the sequel compared to the first one. there's also thirteen playable characters compared to only two in the original. there's also a hard mode that is unlocked after beating the game for the first time, making enemies tougher, reduced ammo on all weapons, and things like auto-lock turned off automatically. a level editor was added in around a year later as well, with custom levels being published onto the steam workshop. visually, there are tons of great neon visuals, just like the first game, and as far as audio design goes, again like the first game there is another banger soundtrack with intense techno music. the gameplay itself features crisp controls and mechanics leading to great gameplay loops that makes every level satisfying once you finally beat it without getting killed.\n\nhotline miami 2 is a surprisingly expanded upon sequel to what was an already outstanding game that i loved. it's extremely stylish aesthetic is entertaining even before you factor in the open ended gameplay and engrossing story. there's high replay-value, even with poor AI that can be easy to defeat even on hard mode, and tons of unique little features that keep the game from becoming frustrating. add in the fact that you can buy hotline miami 2 on sale for 85% off, making it only $2.24 is the cherry on top of everything i've already described. i highly recommend waiting for a sale and buying it then, as even rushing through the story only once will still take a solid 6-8 hours depending on your skill level. most people will probably spend 10+ hours, while completionists are taking 30+ hours easily.", "timestamp_created": 1692677893, "timestamp_updated": 1692677893, "voted_up": true,

primero porque este no es un Hotline Miami esto es un juego mal hecho con el nombre de HOTLINE MIAMI 2 sin un dise\u00f1o.\n\nNo entiendo como los desarrolladores y testeadores no se dieron cuenta de todos los errores de acontinuaci\u00f3n:\n\nLos niveles son muy grandes haciendo que tengas que tener la tecla en el shift todo el tiempo, los enemigos estan mal distribuidos, las armas son casi las

and cranks it up to eleven. From its pulsating soundtrack to its relentless, heart-pounding gameplay, this sequel is a worthy successor that keeps the adrenaline pumping from start to finish.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Hotline Miami 2 is its commitment to pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games. The narrative weaves a complex and gripping tale, filled with intriguing characters and unexpected twists. It's a dark, thought-provoking journey that delves into the psyche of its characters, forcing players to question their own morality along the way.

Each level is a carefully crafted puzzle of violence, requiring precision, strategy, and lightning-fast reflexes. The feeling of satisfaction when you finally execute a perfect run is unmatched in the gaming world.\n\nThe soundtrack, composed by various artists, is an auditory masterpiece. The synth-heavy, retro-inspired tunes perfectly complement the game's frenetic pace, immersing you in its gritty, 1980s-inspired world. The music isn't just a background feature; it's an integral part of the experience that enhances the game's atmosphere and intensity.\n\nHotline Miami 2 also introduces a diverse roster of playable characters, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. This variety adds a layer of depth and replayability as you experiment with different approaches to the game's challenges.\n\nDespite its intense difficulty, Hotline Miami 2 never feels unfair. Every death is a learning experience, and the feeling of improvement as you inch closer to mastering each level is incredibly rewarding. This game demands your best and rewards you with a sense of accomplishment that few other titles can match.\n\nIn conclusion, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a triumph of game design, storytelling, and style. It's a game that will have you hooked from the first beat drop and keep you coming back for more, long after you've completed the main story. If you crave a gaming experience that challenges your skills, engages your mind, and immerses you in a world of neon-soaked chaos, then Hotline Miami 2 is an absolute must-play.

And even though the reviews already say that its very positive im gonna make sure that happens by typing this review anyways. \n\nIf you still have not played this classic arcade shooter then im just gonna say it, buy it now. But if your still not convinced and but are also scared of spoilers then your in luck cause im too lasy to explain and to theorize what happens. All im gonna say is that its a sequel but also in some parts its a prequel to flesh out some of the characters stories and to fill in some plot holes. \n\nAnyways the gameplay is basically the same as HM1 which is okay, the UI and visuals are in my opinion more appealing then the previous game and there are sorta kinda unique characters that have there gimmicks instead of you choosing your 15+ masks sometimes you choose 4 characters 4 weapons that you cant get rid of or your set with one character because its important for the plot. But some of those gimmicks are copy and pasted onto one of the characters that you get to play as but only near the end of the game but i guess you get a katana to compensate so i guess its alright. \n\nAnyways the enemies are basically the same as HM1 but with like 2 other enemies, katana dudes cause they are the most common they just chase you and are immune to gunfire, if you shoot them they just duck and stay still for like a second.\n\nAt least they added some new weapons but they also took out a bunch like the scorpion, the brick, throwing star, sledge hammer, etc. \n\nThe music is even better and less repetitive this time. If its one thing that this game did, was make me get addicted with the 80's despite me being 17 years old, and never living in said time period but i have gen x parents so i guess that also had something to do with it. \n\nAlso the achievements are fun to get but, the fucking infamous \"Genocide\" achievement was probably made just so then you could waste your life for 20+ hours, i bet they laughed there asses of coming up with that cause you really are an achievement whore if you can waste your time playing the game at least 50 times. \n\nAlso as of recently the original game is completely broken the game will crash as soon as you basically start it. So they quickly made a beta but it doesn't have the level editor which is terrible because i have heard it was really robust and popular and unfortunately i was too little to late to experience it unless if they can fix that is. \n\nAnyways TLDR 8/10 still worth it to waste my time to achieve genocide.", "timestamp_created": 1691525612, "timestamp_updated": 1691525612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143674906": {"recommendationid": "143674906", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996216580", "num_games_owned": 642, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1691524384}, "language": "english", "review": "Great!", "timestamp_created": 1691524428, "timestamp_updated": 1691524428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143664026": {"recommendationid": "143664026", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180499639", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "playtime_at_review": 7150, "last_played": 1699739629}, "language": "english", "review": "i will hotline real life miami.", "timestamp_created": 1691513240, "timestamp_updated": 1691513240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143662689": {"recommendationid": "143662689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140014258", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1632830854}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great, however it's not as great as the 1st one.

you'll simply phase into the zone, forgetting reality itself as time basically vanishes ahead of you. \n\nPersonally, it has been and remains one of my favourite games of all time. The gameplay while difficult is rewarding and the sequel, aka. the one I'm reviewing does many things much better than the first one. First, it brings variety to the game play. You won't be able to select your mask on every chapters like in the first game, instead you'll be introduced to multiple characters, each telling their very own story and eventually interacting with each others. The story can be quite confusing at times, but keeping track of what is happening should not be an issue. \n\nAs for the variety these characters bring? A character in particular is a journalist, with whom you'll do pacifists runs (or not the game doesn't prevent you from beating the shit out of anyone but it does slow you down). Another one is in the vietnam, you won't be able to pick guns off of the floor and will have limited ammo, forcing you to be strategic on the way you eliminate your opponents. Then of course, you'll have a few fellas with goofy animals mask which will allow you to choose which mask you'll play with, granting certain perks depending on your choice of drip.\n\nFinally, let's get to the most important part: The music. The reason this game is such a gem is due to its OST, the gameplay and its core mechanics are simple yet polished but that isn't what drives the game. What drives Hotline miami is the pure chaos massacre you go driven by some of the greatest OSTs in indie games history.\n\nTo sum everything up, this game might not be something you'll be able to finish. Maybe at some point you'll be stuck due to its difficulty. However, get into it with the mindset that your goal is to get as far as possible, one level at a time. Eventually, you'll reach the end and won't even have realised it.", "timestamp_created": 1691447486, "timestamp_updated": 1691447486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143604668": {"recommendationid": "143604668", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379224061", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1840, "last_played": 1700198803}, "language": "english", "review": "i accidentally cured anxiety by playing this game wich mean i no longer get free money", "timestamp_created": 1691432390, "timestamp_updated": 1698141322, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143583530": {"recommendationid": "143583530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381124682", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1700146211}, "language": "english", "review": "this game tests my inteligence which is non-existant so i end up trying to do one level for 3 weeks (very long breaks included into that count)\ngood game tho", "timestamp_created": 1691408533, "timestamp_updated": 1691408533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435483872890472412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143573668": {"recommendationid": "143573668", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130144934", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 903, "last_played": 1700589594}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute peak gaming,everything from the visuals,to the soundtrack,the cutscenes,the characters and the story.\nNever thought a game I got for 2 euro would leave a mark so deep as the Hotline Miami series did", "timestamp_created": 1691393198, "timestamp_updated": 1691393198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143571845": {"recommendationid": "143571845", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092515923", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 1251, "last_played": 1700627694}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the greatest games I've ever played.

It consists of multiple characters with different goals and morals existing in the same reality as Jacket did. It tells the story from every perspective, from people who wanted to grab the same 15 minutes of fame, to what was going on inside the mafia, and even Jacket's only friend, who only appeared as a ghost from his past in the original game.\n\nIt gives such a thorough look and explanation to an amazing world built my some very talented people. It makes you feel the anguish as you brutally murder thousands of people, just for you to feel the guilt afterwards. It has a lot of metaphores, twists and turns, and send you on an absolute acid trip with probably the best soundtrack ever made in the history of video games.\n\nPersonally, this is one of the rare times where a sequel absolutely outdid its predecessor in almost every aspect, and I'm tired of pretending it didn't. The gameplay is smoother, the maps are more unique and bigger (albeit with a difficulty curve), the scope is increased but not dramatically, and delivers one of the most gut-wrenching endings I've ever experienced.\n\nIf you've played the first game and are looking for the same action here, you will find it, but please, do this stranger a solid, and listen to the story. You will not regret it.\n\nHere is a video on the game that explains everything way better than I ever could: https://youtu.be/W8PXA2lZf3E\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691370077, "timestamp_updated": 1691370077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143559241": {"recommendationid": "143559241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880423336", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2521, "last_played": 1693611717}, "language": "english", "review": "I like hurting other people richard\n\n10/10\nGreat game play\n\n10/10\nModding community", "timestamp_created": 1691368999, "timestamp_updated": 1691368999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143551116": {"recommendationid": "143551116", "author": {"steamid": "76561199494849725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2287, "last_played": 1691694555}, "language": "english", "review": "FUNNY", "timestamp_created": 1691358371, "timestamp_updated": 1691358371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143548648": {"recommendationid": "143548648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985675887", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1691355442}, "language": "english", "review": "you are tweaking off some percs during nuclear annihilation 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691355655, "timestamp_updated": 1691355655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699988126754760742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143540840": {"recommendationid": "143540840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069942973", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1898, "last_played": 1628436465}, "language": "english", "review": "I lost my grip.

game, HOW?\n\nThis game is unbearably awful in absolutely everything that it has to offer.\n\nIt spits in the face of everything that made the first game great, while being sluggish, offering a dogshit story and pacing, while being too tight in regards to how difficult it is to play. \n\n(not in how difficult the game is, and more how difficult it is to PLAY) \n\nIt feels like overstretched DLC. The chapters 16-19 of the first game felt more unique then this entire game. The devs made a lot of upgrades and sacrificed a lot of unique factors from the first game, in return for a more polished looking game, only to create a mediocre experience they don't fully develop on the extent that the first game did. \n\nDefinitely not worth getting\n\nAs its level design is way too spacious while not letting you pan out properly on certain maps. This ends up leading to a lot of frustrating deaths due to the enemies seeing you before your sight reaches them. Ex: Swan level \n\nAlongside these issues, each character story archetype has its own flaws, which truly boil down to a question of skill and if you are able to accomplish these missions while dealing with the limitations. \n\nBut that's the thing, all of these limitations are not fun. \n\n- Being forced to only use niche masks is not fun\n- Being forced into only using melee weapons is not fun\n- Being forced to use one gun and not swap in a level with \"only dies to gun\" foes is not fun\n\n\nAll of these game choices would have been fine, if they weren't forced upon you. Being able to have that freedom of how you approach to finishing a level, was what made every run and rerun in HLM1 so unique. In the second game, you are just forced to play the game the way the devs want you to play the game. You get little to no freedom of choice, which is why I find this game to be a bad continuation to such a solid series.\n\n\nThis game is just not fun, and while I didn't want to do so as I wanted to play this game instead, I think I would much rather prefer grinding out A+ scores on Hotline Miami 1, than play this game ever again. \n\n\nIf they ever release a Hotline Miami 3, I hope they simply remake the first games mechanics over the ones from this game.", "timestamp_created": 1691044741, "timestamp_updated": 1691290051, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.349872767925262451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143292398": {"recommendationid": "143292398", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053503686", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1697758376}, "language": "spanish", "review": "DEMASIADO BUENO ES COMO UNA DROGA, compralo", "timestamp_created": 1691022177, "timestamp_updated": 1691022177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143290338": {"recommendationid": "143290338", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985225059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1691018779}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game with one of the best gaming soundtracks I have ever heard. \nIt is tough.

I was spiraling out of control and became self-destructive. In a moment of overwhelming emotion, I punched some concrete and severely injured my right hand \u2013 the hand that not only worked but also held and carried my children to bed. The hand that was essential for me to continue providing for my family.\n\nLearning the severity of my self-inflicted injury, I sank into a borderline suicidal state. It was a stark contrast from the happiness I experienced just a few months prior, with no history of depression or anxiety. I was in a low spot, unable to see the light on the other side.\n\nDuring my recovery, I searched for something to occupy my time with my limited abilities. That's when I stumbled upon this game, and although I didn't play it for long, it had a profound impact on me. Even within a day or two of playing, I found a new sense of joy and hope for life. The pain and suffering that enveloped me began to dissipate, and I started appreciating the happiness of others. This game was a brief respite that allowed me to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nWith this newfound realization, I turned off the game and returned to work, enduring the pain in my hand with a newfound motivation. Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I embraced my responsibilities as a father and transformed into the person I needed to be in that moment.\n\nToday, I am on good terms with my children's mother. We have moved past the conflicts and hurtful words, choosing to be parents and friends for the sake of our kids.\n\nSurprisingly, life had another beautiful surprise in store for me. I now have three kids, and my third child is also four years old. I met a woman who went through a similar situation during my separation, and we unexpectedly found each other. Our relationship has blossomed, and we have been together for a year, finding genuine happiness in each other's company.\n\nThe moral of my story is simple \u2013 you never know what life has in store for you, and giving up when the odds are stacked against you won't lead to the brighter future you deserve. This seemingly insignificant game played a significant role in helping me realize that.

I fully believe this game would have been universally panned if it wasn't a sequel to, and shared the Hotline Miami name. \n\nThe levels are an absolute slog, lasting far too long with dozens of enemies and large open areas, which require you to play slow and methodical, completely abandoning the previous game's thesis of fast, no-holds barred, reckless beat em' up gameplay. There is absolutely no variety in how the player handles each level and encounter, with little player agency in terms of masks; and said masks give minute gameplay changes. [spoiler]The only major choices you get are in the first half of the game, which to be fair offers some very fun and unique gameplay. This however is extremely underutilized and only lasts for a short while before you are railroaded into specific gameplay encounters. The game would have benefited greatly by allowing the player these options throughout the whole game.[/spoiler] \n\nI understand wanting to make this game more challenging than the previous, and they do this by adding more enemy types, most of which feel extremely unfair towards the player. For example, there is an enemy which can only be killed using melee weapons, and utilizes a jumping attack to close the distance with the player. This would be fine if said jumping attack didn't clip through doors and walls to latch onto the player, killing them. I didn't have a single death from this enemy which I felt was my fault.\n\nIt's mind-boggling to me how utterly broken and unfinished this game feels; almost as if none of the developers actually played it prior to shipping it.

Most notably, the story. There are many interwoven story lines that are enjoyably intricate, compared to the original's story that mostly took place in the background through subtext. Another benefit of this diversity is the difference in gameplay styles between characters. This was hit or miss, but at least had good variety. However, as you'll glean from a lot of these reviews, levels drag on far longer than they should in some cases. For the first couple acts, I found these reviews to be unfounded, until I found myself in later levels desperately wanting levels to end so I could stop playing but being forced to finish in fear of losing progress. Despite this, I still found myself playing more after the level finished. I found it to be the same reason I find TV to be more palatable than movies.  Having bite size pieces gives the freedom of quitting when you want, even if you end up watching longer than the length of a movie. Levels would drag on for an hour and a half sometimes because of the difficulty level. Overall, this game felt more tedious than its predecessor, but for $2 on sale, I'm glad I played it all the way through and it is definitely a rewarding experience.", "timestamp_created": 1689446525,

Very, very interesting (and dark) story! The only gripe I have is the small selection of masks compared to the first game. It can genuinely make A+ level runs a nightmare sometimes due to the lack of variety in certain situations. Other than that, this game is sincerely some of the most fun I've had in quite a while and I cannot recommend it enough. It's such a trip.

major things worse. I do believe it is still worth buying and playing if you are a fan of the first. It is just important you understand what you are getting yourself into.\n\nFirst and foremost, hotline Miami 2 has better music, sound design, a better story and I think better characters than the first game. This is a game more ambitious than the first while also staying mostly true to what made the first game great.\n\nHowever, this game is far harder than the first game and not in a fair way. The levels are much bigger with larger open spaces and it just makes the game unfair. You will die a lot of times by enemies you cannot see because of just how big the open spaces are. Along with that the puzzles aren't as open ended as the first game. Many of the levels have just one path that works to solve the level. The game also mostly does away with the mask mechanic the first game had and this is sad because the masks help bring some variety to the first game. All of these issues can lead to an experience far more frustrating than the first game.\n\nWith all this being said it is still a fun game worth your time and I do recommend it at its price tag.",

I am really sorry to write this, but apart from the interesting twists and improvements to the mechanics themselves, this game simply discourages people from playing it because of the very poorly designed maps and completely random bugs, which were absent in the first game (or I didn't come across them). The problems are several: the maps are so big that even moving the camera with shift as far as you can, you still won't see the enemies that see you. For almost the entire game you have to hold shift to see what is happening in front of you at all. If you want to get high ranks for missions then you will have to learn dozens (if not hundreds) of invisible enemies. This is more than a waste of time. The game decides to take away all your freedom to solve maps the way you want and forces you to play a specific way (you have no choice of masks, most missions are impossible to play without firearms). Terrible bugs with doors that make enemies sometimes become immortal in them, and larger enemies as they walk into you in a doorway start behaving strangely, shooting blindly and losing ammo to nothing. The crappy map design was decided to be clogged up with whole armies of enemies, which makes this game even more of a no-brainer, and if you enjoyed playing with any tactics before, that's gone here. You have to learn to play a certain way, learn the position of enemies invisible to your camera, force yourself to play with firearms and try not to swear as a random bug spoils your game. With a lot of respect for the first game, I completed Hotline Miami 2. The characters, animations and graphics are cool. The music creates a very good atmosphere. The plot was... just weird, but that fits the atmosphere of the game. Still, I felt like this game was made by absolutely different people. The game lends itself to a one-time pass and there is nothing to come back to again, unfortunately. I prefer to remember later that it was quite fun to play, instead of remembering the large number of bugs and the incredibly badly made maps.", "timestamp_created": 1687979023, "timestamp_updated": 1687979023, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140859133": {"recommendationid": "140859133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202656729", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 1018, "last_played": 1700156825}, "language": "english", "review": "The base story + bonus map was completed in 15 hours by me.

recommend this game. I enjoyed the first half of it, but by the end of act  3 I was really starting to feel burnt out, and I just can't bring myself to care enough to finish the final act.\n\nObviously, this review is oriented more toward casual players on their first or second playthroughs, not hardcore players/speedrunners. \n\nThings I liked about this game:\n\nWeapon and mask variety has increased, and there are some fun new secrets to explore.\n\nThe level editor is great, allowing endless replay value if that's your thing.\n\nThe soundtrack and art fucking SLAP.\n\nThe story is really good!\n\nThings I don't like:\n\nEnemies react a lot faster than in HLM1, so it's less about improvising on the fly and more about frame-perfect memorization of enemy spawns.  AI is also pretty inconsistent across the board. They're generally pretty predictable, until they're not.  The way enemies react to gunfire is the biggest and most obvious chip in the AI's armor. They either hear you from across the map when they should have no way of knowing you're there, or you can fire a magazine on the other side of the wall without drawing any enemies, which can actually be a bad thing depending on your strategy for the level.\n\nKnives no longer 1-hit kill when thrown to make way for one of the mask powers, which I think is really lame, I don't see why they couldn't co-exist.\n\nDoor physics are still jank as hell.\n\nBeard levels are extremely unfun and tedious to play through, and pretty much neutered my drive to keep playing. Everything about their layout and the mechanics behind picking up ammo slow the game to a crawl.\n\nLevel design in general has had a pretty significant downgrade from HLM1. Cheap deathtraps and long corridors that you can't see to the end of but can still be shot from. Less secrets and fun things to discover, lots of cheap spawnpoints that can kill you before you've oriented yourself with the playspace, individual stages of levels are now on average about 3 times as long as they were in HLM1, meaning that you get sent back a LOT further on death, making this way more frustrating than the first title when considering all of the other level design quirks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nHotline Miami 2 has a lot going for it if it's your type of game. It sacrificed pretty much all of HLM1's accessibility and flexibility to commit to the \"speedrunner\" style of play, but if you're up for a grind then there's a lot of good stuff to unpack underneath.\n\nPersonally, I think it's less fun than HLM1, but still worth trying out. If it's not your thing, maybe just look up a story analysis and the OST separately.", "timestamp_created": 1687581988, "timestamp_updated": 1687582634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

To put it simply, the narrative and meta-narrative are both incredible. Unfortunately... this is NOT HM1's action reflex-based game, this is a puzzle game wearing the coat of HM1. That's okay, I ended up really disliking this new game design direction, but it isn't necessarily bad, just not for me. For what it is, it's well made. It's a GREAT die and retry puzzler if you're into those things, but it's NOT a good action reflex quick thinking game. Other than the gameplay and the story/commentary, everything else is obviously on point. The level editor is neat, the artistic direction is, well, it's HM, it inspired millions of artists, what else is there to say. \n\nTL:DR : Incredible and meta story, beautiful graphics and sound, disappointing for fans of the first game as this is NOT a sequel in anything other than the commentary and the artstyle, but it's good as its own experience.

Apart from a few minor issues, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\nThe graphics. Most people know to not judge a game too much by it's graphics, and this game is a prime example. Some people may see the simple graphics and get turned off by it, however there's a difference between \"good\" graphics and a good artstyle. Hotline Miami has a great and consistent artstyle throughout. The retro aesthetic is a great fit for a game set in the 80s and early 90s, especially for Hotline Miami. The graphics never feel off, and if anything improve the experience.\n\nThe soundtrack. I'll keep this point brief, considering everyone already knows how good this soundtrack is. If you somehow don't, well, it's amazing. Every soundtrack hits home and fits the atmosphere perfectly. Everyone who worked on this game's soundtrack deserve an award.\n\nThe difficulty. Hotline Miami 2 handles map design a lot differently than 1. Maps are more open, and there are a lot more people. Sightlines are often long, meaning you can easily be shot from off-screen. This has led to a lot of frustration among players, and understandably so. It's quite frustrating to be shot from off-screen where you can't see an enemy, however it's not something that ruins the game for me. I still think the map design is largely a step up from Hotline Miami 1. With time, you learn where enemies are and come from, making the process of clearing maps smoother. In addition, Hotline Miami 1 in most cases allowed you to pick from a large array of masks, some of which were quite overpowered. In Hotline Miami 2, you rarely get the option to use special abilities, in turn making the game slightly harder.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and fast paced, just like the predecessor. However I would argue the overall feel of the game has been improved, since the gameplay is less janky and bugs are much less of a problem. The gameplay is much more refined, whereas in the first game it felt a bit more loose. Though if you want to give Hotline Miami a go, but don't want the intense difficulty of the second game, I can still recommend the first one. It's still very fun, while not as challenging, though do be warned about bugs. As mentioned, the first game is a lot more prone to jank than the second.\n\nThe story is in my opinion, really good. It's expertly crafted and told brilliantly. Arguably the best part is that it's completely optional. The story is there if you want it, but you can simply ignore and/or skip all pieces of dialogue altogether if you simply want to get straight to the gunplay. Either way it's a great addition for obvious reasons.\n\nI highly recommend both these games. However if you plan on playing both, I recommend playing the first one first. Either way, it's a great game and I thank Dennaton for bringing us these two masterpieces.\n\n*Reupload", "timestamp_created": 1686929648, "timestamp_updated": 1691355828, "voted_up": true,

Now, the levels are long and big, easily overstaying their welcome. The amount of cheap deaths to enemies off-screen is simply endless. And it's frustrating. Sometimes, there is no way to know that you're within an enemy's line of sight, not even with shift view. The color palette of some levels is horrible. Completely white, whiplashing with the crosshair. I lost count of how many times I lost track of the crosshair during those levels.\n\nGone was the balanced enemy number per floor. Now, floors are littered with so many enemies that attempting a fast-paced run can easily result in a cheap death. Their AI is somehow worse than of its predecessor. Sometimes, they're blind, sometimes, they have sixth sense. Their behavior is just inconsistent.\n\nGone was the dance of death, high-octane gameplay structure of the first game. Now, it forces a more tactical approach, because trying the aggressive, fast-paced approach of the first game is practically impossible, considering the amount of enemies per area. Dying a cheap death in a floor after wasting so much time cautiously killing them creates no incentive to hit 'R' and try again with a bigger determination like its predecessor, it just creates incentive to hit the ESC, quit this piece of crap game and uninstall it. Seriously, baiting enemies into a corner to kill their dumbasses is not fun. I refuse to believe that Dennaton actually playtested this game.\n\nGone was the simplistic yet flexible mask selection that allows you to have perks and skills. Now, you're restricted to what the game wants you to use in a sort of loadout system. It's boring, it gives the player no freedom and completely restricts any creative approach.\n\nAnd gone was the sense of catharsis and gratification the first game gave us after completing a chapter. Now it's just \"finally dealt with this bs\".\n\nThe story is surprisingly engrossing and the soundtrack slaps (honestly, I wanted to hear a Perturbator music while playing a kickass game, not this garbage). Those are the only positives I can say about Hotline Miami 2.\n\nThis game is not only disappointing, it's also a piece of trash. It's a hollow shell of what Hotline Miami once was. And that's just sad...\n\nBut honestly, to Dennaton's credit, you can see they really tried to make a worthy sequel, not  a soulless cash grab, and I respect their passion and attempt. It's just that perhaps they were way too ambitious for what their engine and design of the first game allowed them to reproduce successfully.

I could've left this game in my library. I could've left it alone and kept playing Payday with the DLC. Like Icarus to the sun, however, I was gravely a victim to my hubris. The bugs, inconsistent AI and weapon system, poor placement of level design and assets had me on my knees, begging to all powers that be to release me from this torture. I will admit as a human being: I am not the best at this game. That doesn't excuse the random deaths from enemies seeing me through walls, invincible fat mounds of lard that don't die to a gunshot like a human being, and physically impossible feats of, what is to be summarized, bullshit.\n\nI loved the soundtrack.

[/h1]\n\nVideo game sequels are usually a simple undertaking, in philosophy if not execution. You take what was great about the first game, remove the bits that weren\u2019t, push the existing gameplay mechanics in some flashy new directions, and scale the whole thing up with a shiny layer of polish.\n\nBut what if things aren\u2019t that simple? What if your original game was fantastic precisely because it lacked the things that sequels traditionally bring? What if it was a blistering, adrenalising, punk violence masterpiece that thrived specifically because of its rough edges, singular focus, and brutally madcap nature? Then you have an interesting conundrum. And if you\u2019re Hotline Miami 2, you have a rather irksome case of Tricky Second Album Syndrome.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is not a bad game. At times it\u2019s incredible, a red-hot tornado of exhilaration, riding the knife-edge between abject terror and godlike empowerment. At times, as you drop into the stinking, neon-bleached pits of The Zone, flawlessly butchering, blasting and beating down room after room of instantly lethal, only half-predictable goons - your fingertips dancing to micromanage precision stealth, intelligent onslaught, and mutually lethal lines of sight - it\u2019s stellar. At times, it all just comes together, the violence, the pace, the intellect, and the incendiary soundtrack blurring into one glorious, messy, indignantly ferocious whole that no other game can match. At times, as you might have gathered by now, it\u2019s a lot like Hotline Miami.\n\nAt times.\n\nWhen it isn\u2019t doing that? It\u2019s losing focus. It\u2019s drifting away from the triple-distilled, acidic purity that earned the original game such a well-deserved place. It\u2019s trying admirable new things, and sometimes succeeding, but then becoming too caught up in those Exciting Big Ideas, leaving them somewhat over-designed, lying weighty and a tad smothering on top of the intricacy of what went before. It\u2019s not a bad game, but it\u2019s missing something. Something raw, and free, and alive.\n\nThe problems stem from - or are at least facilitated by - HM2\u2019s new narrative structure. Ostensibly set a few years after the first game (but jumping around a fair bit along the course of its deliberately disjointed delivery), you follow and play multiple different characters affected by the aftermath of original protagonist Jacket\u2019s rampage. There\u2019s a no-nonsense, greasy, up to his neck cop. There\u2019s a hardboiled, fearless journalist researching his next crime book. There\u2019s a pressured actor starring in a lurid film adaptation of the first game\u2019s events. At the centre of it, there\u2019s a new gang of animal-masked lunatics, influenced by Jacket, and out for a similar spree of partly purposeful kicks and killing.\n\nInitially, this seems great. A savvy, often semi-satirical discussion and reinterpretation of the first game, using the repercussions of violence and corruption as its canvas. A smart and rather satisfying scenario, even if, as it goes on, the story seems to grow pathologically terrified of coherence, throwing in new characters, curveballs, and sub-plots whenever things seem in danger of coalescing into gratifying completion. The thing is though, those various narrative tangents bleed directly into parallel problems with the game design. And, as the game bloats on into its over-extended running time, an overall loss of focus becomes the real problem.\n\nWhen not playing as members of the gang, things are, largely, good. The \u2018normal\u2019 protagonists play with the minimum of gimmicks, the action is as fast, flowing, but deceptively, sharply strategic as it ever was. Moment-to-moment, things feel pretty damn good, despite certain levels now seeming a little too set on providing a specific, \u2018right\u2019 solution. Contrasting the original game\u2019s improvisational, organised chaos, Hotline 2\u2019s missions seem to present more noticeable difficulty-gating to certain routes, with enemy placements and weapon drops sometimes even lending a vague air of Zelda-like progress. It\u2019s only a slight change, and one that will probably be most noticeable to those who haven\u2019t played the hell out of the original, but it does resonate with the game\u2019s later, bigger problems. Because then the masks appear.\n\nPicking up from the first game\u2019s buff system, whereby wearing different, unlockable headgear would imbue Jacket with various subtle, passive abilities, such as increased speed, greater resilience, or the ability to start a level with certain weapons equipped, Hotline 2\u2019s use of pre-masked protagonists cranks things up in both complexity and power. One Jacket fan, for instance, has an evasive roll. Another will score a kill with any object he throws. More overtly, twins Alex and Ash are controlled simultaneously, both following the same directional input while the former delivers chainsaw kills, and the latter uses pre-equipped firearms. Bear-headed Mark starts his levels with two MP5 machine pistols, which he can fire to the sides as well as dead ahead.\n\nThe first time you use any gang member, each initially delivers an exciting hook, a new spin on Hotline\u2019s core mechanics. Some of them are thrilling for their first minute or so of use. Problem is that they\u2019re so overt in their design and implementation that they immediately dictate your approach and flow through a level, steamrolling any other possibilities for the duration. Yes, Alex and Ash took me on a furious, pretty damn exciting spree of slaughter, once I\u2019d nailed the strategy of target-locking long range enemies for gunshots before busting through a door to unleash blade and bullet hell. But as is so often the case with novelty gameplay, once I\u2019d done it, I\u2019d, well, done it.\n\nMark amplifies the highs and lows even further, his rattling charges through his stages\u2019 floors creating an ambivalent blend of excitement at the rampage, and irritation that you have no choice but to alert every enemy in the area with your noise. It\u2019s doubly galling when you consider that he can\u2019t switch to another weapon until both guns are empty, and can\u2019t (slowly) reload until he burns off a full clip. Given Hotline 2\u2019s staunch demands on timing, the holdover randomness of the original AI\u2019s alert states, and the fundamental, second-to-second need to have the right tool for the job - exacerbated by the sequel\u2019s increased placement of resilient, Heavy grunts - and you\u2019ve got a scenario that frustrates as much as it excites. While the new mask abilities deliver a decent number of surprising, gratifying \u2018Holy shit!\u2019 moments, they also turn levels into pre-determined set-pieces, reducing nuance and burying much of the core gameplay\u2019s intricacy.", "timestamp_created": 1686084420, "timestamp_updated": 1687995512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139652827": {"recommendationid": "139652827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046188765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2900, "last_played": 1696337080}, "language": "english", "review": "just a longer and better copy of the first game", "timestamp_created": 1686077908, "timestamp_updated": 1686077908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139644801": {"recommendationid": "139644801", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172499322", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1717, "last_played": 1698323501}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing gameplay and story, in my opinion better then the first.

the player here and there while hotline miami 2 is all that 10x while beating the player over the head with the fact that it's supposed to be very difficult at times while making sure you know that violence is bad (a very basic summary, but it the best i can come up with for now lol).\n\nthis game was honestly pretty frustrating at times with the gameplay (i only had one small rage quit thankfully). i understand and respect the vision this has to offer, but i can't say i cared for it as much as the first game. a lot of the new characters aren't that likable and it feels a bit too depressing at certain points that it feels like the story feels purposeless (mainly because of the ending).\n\ni can see why this game had mixed reactions when it came out, as i'm not totally raving about this like i was first. the gameplay can be harsh and the scoring system at the end makes it even less rewarding (your score is heavily lowered if you take too long to finish a level, my highest score the entire time i played being just a standard B). i honestly have no want to replay really any of the levels like i do the first, but i will eventually anyways because i want to see all the secrets this game has to offer.\n\nmy only advice is to not go into this game expecting anything to really be like the first, that was the developers intentions (basically to trick you), but it had a rather negative effect on me to the point where i lost interest in the story around the second half and only really kept playing to finish it basically.", "timestamp_created": 1685862001,
