So much to hate.  Steep difficulty at the end makes the game impossible to beat.  Not for the Casual player.\n\nI got this game for the reviews and for the most part, its a great game.  Interesting story, Music is phenomenal and not a short game.  However its also an infuriating and frustrating game.  Especially late game.  Its not easy by no means and i'm not new to the metrovania genre, but the late game stages and bosses are almost impossible to defeat.  Really to the point of where i just gave up. Leveling up and getting items and relics don't do much as your progression doesn't match the enemies strengths.  Last 2 bosses, Captain Julius and the end boss can one shot you.  Whats worse is that if you make even a minor mistake, you might as well just start the fight over.  The regular enemies are whatever, not easy by any means, but you normally can make it to the next save and restore area.  \n\nI can't tell you the number of attempts i made with Ulv the mad knight and Julius but it was 2-3 hrs for each and wasn't able to beat either of them.  Just gave up, uninstalled and watched the ending and story recap online.  I won't be revisiting this game unless they rebalance the game.  Either drop the boss' health by 20-30% or make the hero stronger and decrease the damage you take.  \n\nGame isn't bad but its not for the casual player.  More for the season players.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700777029, "timestamp_updated": 1700777029, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151404392": {"recommendationid": "151404392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027893052", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1147, "playtime_at_review": 1186, "last_played": 1700736875}, "language": "english", "review": "good music but map design is kinda stinky....plus late-game bosses like to one-shot you", "timestamp_created": 1700768954, "timestamp_updated": 1700768954, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498920083045959473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151394151": {"recommendationid": "151394151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087679682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1581, "playtime_at_review": 1609, "last_played": 1700720639}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty good game.  I didn't find it as spellbinding as some people did, but it was fun.\n\nThe spirit weapon mechanic is really neat once you start getting enough useful ones that you actually feel inclined to swap your loadout around.  I actually had the sword guy entirely unequipped for a while-- his damage had fallen behind since I hadn't find any ancient souls for him, and just used Silva as my \"basic attack\" for a while, and i thought that was fun!  I kinda wish he hadn't just rocketed back up to being the best unlimited-use weapon and it'd been a more level playing field between him and the other major bosses.  \n\nMost of the miniboss spirits just felt basically useless, unfortunately.  Sharply limited uses, long cooldowns, unimpressive damage, and niche attack patterns.  The only ones I got memorable use out of were: [spoiler]Fallen Archer (deals massive damage to large airborne enemies), the dog and the bird (helpful on the 2 bosses that spawn ads), siegrid (kinda useful airborne AOE pattern, does lots of small damage so it synergizes with the immortal's crest i guess)[/spoiler]\n\nFantastic soundtrack, though.

I personally had the pleasure to 100% the game, over the course of a little less than 18 hours. It is a nice experience on sale, and definitely worth 12 euro. There are however distinct positives and negatives to outline. This review has occasional spoilers. \n\nThere is one fairly major issue that should be highlighted early: [b] Boss fights are not particularly impressive or intriguing. [/b]\n\nAs a person who has completed other metroidvanias such as Death's Gambit or Salt & Sanctuary (or even roguelikes whose bosses could be loosely described as metroidvania bosses, such as Dead Cells or Skul: The Hero Slayer), the bosses in Ender Lilies have often great visual designs with intriguing stories to them. Especially the latter point is improved by the cutscenes that play after defeating each boss. But there are clear missed opportunities on multiple bosses. \n\nFor example [spoiler];\n- There is no boss in the game that allows for platforming in their arena; each room is entirely flat, with no platforms.\n- New phases typically mean *one* extra attack, and perhaps a quicker animation speed on previous ones. That's it. \n- You can typically have the exact same relic setup for every single boss (although which spirits you want may vary slightly).\n- Even if you could change spirits to optimize some boss fights, it is entirely possible (and rather simple, even on the harder difficulty) to beat every single boss in the game by just left clicking them to death. \n- Every single attack from a boss in this game is red. It may be slightly different tones of red, but nontheless red. You can only dodge so many red orbs or red waves from so many bosses before the attacks start to look similar. [/spoiler]\n\nWithout direct spoilers, these issues were clear on every boss. I do mean every single boss. [spoiler] Typically, I look forward to the last boss of a game, and here the excitement was only due to story and music aspects. Not the combat [/spoiler]. \n\nThere is one more thing that could be brought up as a flaw. The platforming is overall fairly simple for a metroidvania. Compared to titles such as Salt & Sanctuary or Death's Gambit (or again, even roguelikes such as Dead Cells or Skul: the Hero Slayer), there are very few moments where a player in Ender Lilies have to push their limits when it comes to platforming. Although there is a lot of platforming in the game, it just is not very hard. \n\nThere does exist platforming puzzles, and a small amount of them could be challenging. That is where the myriad of movement abilities in Ender Lilies leads to a high skill ceiling with some cathartic moments (as there are secrets that are physically impossible without some awareness of the games platforming). But those moments are few and far between, especially for a player who is not going for 100% completion and likely will not even see those platforming puzzles. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nWith that out of the way, we can look at some of the [b] positives [/b];\n\n1. Exploration in this game is fantastic. The map is designed in such a way that a player can easily determine where the are paths yet explored, and where there could potentially be hidden items. Rooms are actually described as \"complete\" or \"incomplete\" on the map. Unless a player wants to save an hour or two of searching, then it is absolutely not necessary to use guides to find every secret. \n\n2. Weapons (spirits) are quite varying. Yes, they all have red animations, but many have different roles to play. It's not just \"ranged attacks\" and \"melee attacks\" due to a couple of reasons; [spoiler]\n- Different attacks have different amounts of charges, so they're not all spammable in the same sense as a left click sword swing\n- The environment (specifically the positioning of enemies) pushes the player to try spirits with different attack sets, to reach enemies in awkward positions or to hit multiple enemies in multiple directions at once. Some attacks are more powerful, but with a long wind-up time. Other attacks are automatic, which is useful when the context forces the player to always be on the move. [/spoiler]\n\nSo the enjoyment of combat rarely or never comes from difficulty (as it is comparatively simple for a metroidvania), but instead from the large amount of different moves that a player could use to clear an area. Optimization becomes the new source of enjoyment, not the challenge itself. \n\n3. The music is very atmospheric. Although there are not as many stand-out soundtracks as you would think from a list of 50, there are at least some that are quite nice and draws attention. \n\n4. The story! Due to the quality of life included in the game through minor mechanics (such as the map or the fact that players does not lose any progress on death even temporarily), it is quite possible to experience most if not all of the story without having to go through many hurdles. I would describe the story as bittersweet. It is also rare for a metroidvania to explore an environment where there truly are [spoiler] no friendly or even neutral NPC:s. At all. The world is more than just figuratively dead as every character besides the player is dead or wishes they were dead. [/spoiler]. Because of that, Ender Lilies is a fairly unusual metroidvania.\n\nSo to reiterate, Ender Lilies can be quite enjoyable in the right circumstances, with some areas where there could have been more. For me, it was specifically bosses and platforming that were underwhelming.

Para empezar, el mapa es una mierda, no sirve pr\u00e1cticamente para nada, el peor mapa que he visto en un metroidvania. En vez del cl\u00e1sico sistema de mostrar el laberinto unido con tu posici\u00f3n que caracteriza a esta clase de juegos, en este se nos muestran \u00fanicamente casillas unidas por l\u00edneas, como si de un mapa conceptual de lo m\u00e1s rudimentario se tratase. Me parece cero pr\u00e1ctico y, aunque lo usas a la fuerza porque si no es que no hay manera, sigue siendo el mayor problema que ya de inicio te tira para atr\u00e1s.\n\nVengo de jugar Aria of sorrow, el que se ha vuelto, para m\u00ed, el metroidvania perfecto; y es perfecto porque te sientes poderoso no porque sea f\u00e1cil, sino porque sientes c\u00f3mo el juego te recompensa conforme avanzas en el mismo, cuanto m\u00e1s subes de nivel menos da\u00f1o te hacen los enemigos y m\u00e1s da\u00f1o les haces t\u00fa.

I want to like it, but I can't. The art direction is good, but the gameplay ruins it for me completely.\n\nThis game doesn't respect your time. Unless you have lightning reflexes or watch all bosses on YouTube first, you will waste hours on attempts. Poorly telegraphed moves, constant and unrelenting reaction checks, severe punishment for missed attacks - it has them all.\n\nI also 100%d Hollow Knight and Elden Ring. Both felt easier and more forgiving. How do you like the fact that Ender Lilies boosts enemy HP and damage based on the number of bosses defeated? You toil away expecting it to become easier, but it only keeps becoming more difficult and slower-paced until the very end.\n\nLeveling and exploration are seldom worth it. There is no sense of accomplishment. Dodging is 75% of all combat. Parrying is generally unrewarding and often stunlocks or flings you away from the enemy you are supposed to stay close to. What's even the point? Oh, and whittling down enemy stamina breaks their stance for, like, half a second. Enjoy your one free strike.\n\nLevel design is hot garbage. The art is good, but the levels feel generic, disconnected and purposefully constructed as training rooms. There is no feeling of consistency throughout the world - just very basic levels, like in the old NES or SEGA games. Ori, Hollow Knight, even Bloodstained did it better.\n\nI'll admit my reflexes are slow (always have been), but this game is brutal to players like me. It offers very little in terms of cheesing enemies - you can't just compensate for the lack of skill by exploring or leveling more. Changing the loadout helps, but you still have to study every boss's moves religiously to even stand a chance.\n\nMalenia was less ridiculous and more entertaining than most bosses in Ender Lilies.\n\nThe story is not bad, just difficult to piece together due to the texts you find having no in-universe dates. It takes a while to figure it out.\n\nThe music sounds like something that belongs in a much, MUCH better game.\n\nI mostly picked it for the atmosphere, art, story and music. I left feeling spent and miserable. I work full days, and nearly any game in the evening feels like a welcome break. Ender Lilies felt like more hard work. So many poor design choices, so little to compensate for them.\n\nNever again.", "timestamp_created": 1700327836, "timestamp_updated": 1700327836, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 6,

"review": "Sadly, I dislike this game. It looks great, the music is good, but the combat is awful. \nEvery attack roots you in place, killing all momentum. This gives me the feeling that none of the attacks have weight. This is amplified by the stagger mechanic, which only staggers enemies when their respective bar is filled. Enemies seem to also have a lot more health that they would have needed. \nBosses (so far) also suffered from this. The fights took longer than I'd have liked, especially since the move set of those bosses is very limited, and they take longer pauses in between to not do anything or reposition. \nThe spirit system is a nice idea, having multiple tools and being able to adjust for the area you want to conquer, but since you have to level each spirit individually, there is not much incentive to experiment. \nWhile the assets look well-designed, the levels often feel like large boxes with some platforms in between. Rarely did I feel the setting of the level matched the room I was in (why would every room be 6-10 meters high?). The metroidvania style looking of areas behind required abilities is also a bit overused. I constantly encountered different types of \"cannot go there yet\"s. Maybe there are too many abilities or the devs locked too many paths?

So doesn't highlight each separate are, like Hollow knight for instance. \n- So many areas are way too vertical sometimes, with so many enemies, and some you have to dodge, so you end falling a lot.

And they give you no helpful indicators to make it easier to explore once you have new navigation abilities. You end up having to retrace the entire map, going back to the same areas over and over, every time you get some new ability, because there is no way to tell from the map if that's an area worth visiting. \n\nThe combat is okay but the enemies and scaling are terrible. They reuse the same sprites all over the place so areas bleed in together and barely have any identity beyond the backgrounds and these reused sprites aren't even pallet swapped or get new abilities. They do however get more HP and more damage. What this leads to is you never feeling like you're getting any stronger. A slug creature took 2 hits to kill and could kill you in 5 hits at the beginning of the game, and the exact same slug creature in a different section of the map will take 2 hits to kill and kill you in 5. Even if you now have a health bar that stretches across the screen and have upgraded your abilities to max so they do better damage, it doesn't matter. You will never feel like you're more powerful, and because of the way they scale damage and health it makes upgrading either, and tougher enemies, pointless. All the numbers change, but the game fundamentally stays the same. \n\nCombat is fun for the most part, but you'd best get used to making endless use of the dodge button. While many games have a dodge, you only need it in certain circumstances. The ability to simply move away from, block attacks, or stun enemies, allows for many avenues. This game doesn't really have that. You CAN stun enemies but my experience has been you either kill them before they attack, or you can't deal enough damage to stun them before they attack and take a hit. And many, MANY, enemies don't even have the sorts of attacks that can simply be avoided by moving out of the way, so many enemies you HAVE to use the dodge to engage with them. \n\nBetween the frustrating scaling and the endless dodging it got to a point where I wasn't even fighting unless I had to. \n\nLast thing worth talking about is the abilities. There are 2 kinds of abilities, the sort you get from main bosses, the the sort you get from mini-bosses. A lot of abilities end up being rather useless because their hit boxes are really only capable of hitting certain enemies, or, you throw out an ability that deals damage over time and the enemy simple leaves the area and you end up doing so little damage you might as well have hit them with your sword one time. While I did find some abilities that were handy, after several hours in the game, even though I'd been upgrading them, the damage fell off very harshly. It got to the point they were almost useless in boss fights, and eventually I had so many main boss abilities that worked better I never used the other ones. After 13 hours in the game if I got a new mini boss ability I wouldn't even bother checking it out. The main boss weapons typically do more damage, are less specific (so way more versatile), and usually have WAY more uses. \n\nAll that said, 90% of the time you'll just use the starting sword. Its the best weapon in most cases especially once you master the dodging and you'll probably make use of the giant club attack for its overhand swing (good for enemies above your head and not much else) and the energy ball attack which you can throw out pretty fast, you get like 80 of after you've upgraded, has good range, and good damage. \n\nAll in all, its a pretty game with a few good ideas but not enough to carry it. It really has the feel of a 5 hour game that was padded to heck and back to make it longer with littler thought given to how the game plays.

Al escucharla me sent\u00ed completamente maravillado, me pareci\u00f3 sublime (salvo por muy pocos temas, pero no me quiero adelantar). Luego averig\u00fce sobre el juego. Si bien me atrajo sus jefes de dificultad \"souls\" (patrones bien definidos, timing y un esquive con invulnerabilidad) y el ambiente oscuro, no me terminaba de convencer la (como le dicen mis amigos a Lily) \"mona china\" con la que uno juega. Por otro lado, el apartado gr\u00e1fico tambi\u00e9n me pareci\u00f3 sublime y si bien jugar con una ni\u00f1a indefensa no est\u00e1 entre mis preferencias decid\u00ed darle una oportunidad.\n\nLo que me encontr\u00e9 super\u00f3 con creces mis expectativas. \nLa banda sonora: no solo es excelsa, sino que acompa\u00f1a, y potencia, las zonas y los jefes; incluso esos pocos temas fuera de mi agrado (2) acompa\u00f1an perfectamente la zona con su opresividad. Por poner algunos ejemplos: Rosary intro, Harmonious y Bulbel (el excelente tema de los cr\u00e9ditos)\nLa jugabilidad: lenta al principio, va tomando con cada jefe un ritmo mayor y aunque las zonas no me parecen lo mejor del juego, cumplen con ser diversas, entretenidas y que no solo se pueda ir a lo loco. La mec\u00e1nica de los esp\u00edritus, que se obtienen al explorar y derrotar enemigos, aporta much\u00edsimo al gameplay y, aunque se puede pasar todo el juego con los mismos, sin duda se da la variedad suficiente para que, para cada zona y para cada jefe, haya una configuraci\u00f3n que se adapte mejor; algo que favorece much\u00edsimo al progreso y la estrategia. Como aspecto negativo debo mencionar que hay zonas sobrecargadas de enemigos.\nEl apartado visual: bell\u00edsimo, oscuro y melanc\u00f3lico. Sorprende como se encuentran tanto lugares preciosos, como otros sin duda horrorosos.Y no solo adornan sino que cuentan una historia.\nLa historia: si bien esta no me termino de llegar en un principio (y es dif\u00edcil de enlazar, ya que se cuenta a trav\u00e9s de documentos que uno encuentra, de los objetos, jefes y zonas, como ya saben que juego) al dejarla decantar cumple con ser una buena historia con sus toques profundos: el final verdadero toma mucho peso y emoci\u00f3n al comprender lo que pas\u00f3 en ese mundo. Al entender el peso, esfuerzo y sacrificio que impone el limpiar la impureza; y lo que implico nuestro viaje en esa aventura. \nLo t\u00e9cnico: nunca sent\u00ed tirones, ni bajadas de fps (y juego en una tostadora), siempre sent\u00ed que la respuesta era muy buena y mis muertes justas. \n\nHay muchas m\u00e1s cosas que podr\u00eda decir pero concluir\u00e9 diciendo que: fue una viaje que realmente disfrut\u00e9.

One on one the enemies are piss easy due to the barebone combat mechanics and movesets, but in order to pump this up to a \"souls-like\" difficulty the game bundles enemy types together because otherwise the game would be too easy. Ranged enemies having homing projectiles was a lame cop out, as I could not be more annoyed facing two melee enemies repeatedly chaining staggered attacks while two crows are sending homing projectiles in a alternating fashion basically suppressing me and forcing me to keep my distance while boringly tossing a spirit skill from afar repeatedly while constantly dodging the crow ranged attacks.\n\nThe art for the characters, enemies, spirits, and cutscenes were good, but the world design was fairly basic and boring save a few key locations for the time I played. I think for games like this they only have such high ratings because given the genre, style(art and it being 2D), and gameplay it's clear that all the gamers that would enjoy playing this game will have played it and the rest who wouldn't enjoy it would never play it. I thought there'd be more depth to the combat and level design, but the game failed to deliver that for me hence me refunding it.

It has a large world, many parts of which are closed off at first until you obtain certain upgrades. These come in the form of Spirits (weapons basically) and Relics (passive/slotted abilities). There lots of Spirits and they all do very different attacks. \n\nThe RPG-lite element/gimmick is you can level up your Spirits and therein lies my problem with the system. There are effectively finite currency for levelling them up, which is disincentive to try out different ones because once you decide to invest in a spirit, that will be much stronger than lower level ones. Some maps/enemies really need certain Spirits or you will be frustrated - it's the 'levelled up wrong' issue. The character also levels up gaining a bit of HP and I think there's also some scaling involved vs enemies but otherwise just adds nothing to the game. All-in-all I felt the levelling up system was just a detriment. At best, you would question why it even existed. \n\nThe levels are a mix of somewhat interesting spread between some quite long but dull areas. As the map is quite basic, it is frustrating to go revisit all the old areas again to try find which parts are now accessible every time you gain a new traversal tool. The bosses also have some balance issues. Depending on your Spirits (and which ones are levelled), can be immensely frustrating. They either crush you or you use some cheese combination of spirits/relics to brute-force it. I found half of them just not fun at all. \n\nDespite all the above negatives, it isn't a bad Metroidvania. It's \"okay\". What elevates it for me into Recommend is the presentation is top notch. The beautiful character design and animation work, decent music and writing, really sells the atmosphere and mood. Absolutely gorgeous. \n\nIn short, it's an OK game with some problems but if you are a fan of the genre and don't mind some frustrating design then it's still worth a try.", "timestamp_created": 1699137504, "timestamp_updated": 1699137591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149500461": {"recommendationid": "149500461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165177770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2219, "last_played": 1699250449}, "language": "english", "review": "The music is Beautiful.

The environment, the music, the combat, and the lore are excellently done.\nMy favorite part in this entire game is actually learning about all the characters in the game. I wanted to find and save every spirit because I wanted to know about their lives that led up to the Blight Rain via their description, dialogue, and flashbacks. I loved seeing glimpses of the lives of the different Priestesses that tragically perished in the end. I wanted to locate and read every Note in order to know the Spirits' backstories, the Priestesses' backstories, and the stories of the other characters.\n\nIf the creators every decide to make an Ender Lilies 2 or make a game similar to this, I have some suggestions for fleshing out the Spirits more:\n\n1. Bonding Events\nLily could unlock cutscenes of her having conversations with her Spirits by enhancing her Spirts. So when she enhances a particular Spirit, she will unlock an event where Lily bonds with that Spirit and learn more about that Spirit.\nYou could also have the bonding event show the interaction and relationship of the Spirit with the other Spirits. For example, we could see the strained relationship between Siegrid and Silva or the troubled relationship between Faden and the other Spirits.\nSince Lily is supposedly mute, the cutscene could have Lily expressing her thoughts through gestures and facial expressions. She could pout when she's mad, she could tilt her head when she's confused, she could have her eyes sparkle when she's excited, etc.\nHowever, I recommend that you don't give a Bonding event for the Spirit's final enhancement/upgrade because the cost for that enhancement is so expensive that it is impossible for a player to fully enhance all the Spirits in a playthrough unless they spend an absurd amount of grinding for all the needed Blight.\nI also suggest that certain Bonding events be locked until Lily accomplishes certain conditions. For example:\n- Siegrid's later events are unlocked after purifying her sister Silva\n- Fungal Sorcerer Melville's later events are unlocked after purifying Floral Sorceress. It's the same for vice versa\n- One-Eyed Royal Aegis' later events are unlocked after purifying Julius\n- Ulv's later events are unlocked after getting the Snowdrop Bracelet\n- Faden's last events are unlocked after getting the Aegis Curio\n\n2. Quests\nLily could get quests from the Spirits by unlocking certain Bonding events or advancing the story. These quests are used to further flesh out the Spirits associated to them and reveal more of their backstory. The player can earn Blight for enhancing Spirits, Relics, Amulet fragments, and Chains of Sorcery from completing these quests.\nYou could also use these quests to challenge the player by requiring the player to equip the Spirit(s) associated with the quest while that quest is active. It can be the Spirit is only equipped in one set or equipped in both sets, depending on the difficulty of the quest. And player could be required to equip multiple spirits for a particular quest.\nThe tricky part is how to code these quests into the game because, while these quests are active, the quests could change the Blight enemy placements and other factors in an area depending on what area Lily will end up in to progress the quest.\nAs for examples for possible quests:\n- Cliffside Hamlet Youth's quest is finding out what happened to his mother\n- Headless Defender's quest is challenging Gerrod to a fight with the former as one of the equipped Spirits\n- Verboten Champion's quest is learning why he had the urge to go into Verboten Quarter in the first place\n- Dark Executioner's quest is Julius trying to help the Dark Executioner with his dream of becoming a knight\n- Chief Guardian's quest is locating all the dead priestesses and providing them a proper burial\n(This quest can also be used to explore more about the priestesses)\n\nThese ideas were thought up by me because of how much I wanted to learn more and bond more with the Spirits of the game.\nI hope that, if you ever consider making another game like this, that you would find ways to have the main character bond with the Spirits and learn more about them.", "timestamp_created": 1698777698, "timestamp_updated": 1698777698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149263606": {"recommendationid": "149263606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068357355", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1698958084}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely lovely game, immaculate vibes, great storytelling 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1698773032, "timestamp_updated": 1698773032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149246082": {"recommendationid": "149246082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079451376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1130, "last_played": 1698593602}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[ENG/ESP]\n\n[h1]Ender Lilies ~ Quietus of the Knights ~[/h1]\n\n[ENG]\n\nEnder Lilies is a short metroidvania game, taking several elements of some games like Castlevania, Hollow Knight and the Dark Souls saga. In this title, we are a mysterious girl who awakens in a hostile environment in the continent of Finisterra. An endless rain covers almost the entire map, and every single creature you will face is blighted with a strange disease or curse, known as the Impurity. With the initial help of a Black Knight, the girl will face a lot of dangers while she purifies and saves these fallen beings, discovering the secrets this world has to offer along the way.\n\n[u]-First, this is a metroidvania game,[/u] so you'll find a 2d, scrolling game with enemies to defeat, items to interact with and secret paths and objects. And even if you can't find every single thing in your first visit (the map will indicate in blue colour if you haven't found everything in that area), don't worry, because as you keep exploring, you'll get more abilities that will let you move and enter where you couldn't before. \n\n[u]-Purifying is the name of the game, but you'll get rewards for it:[/u] Defeat minibosses and bosses to acquire their abilities and use them at your heart's content: with a maximum of three skills per set (having 2 different sets of abilities you can swap and use), you can have six skills to use while you explore Finisterra. \n\n[u]-This game takes several features from other games,[/u] such as the narrative of Dark Souls and the mechanics of the bonfire, or banks (as in Hollow Knight), allowing you to rest, but the enemies you have defeated will respawn. You can equip a lot of accesories (Hollow Knight) and there you will be able to equip accesories and skills and even enhance skills with items you will find while exploring. Also, the narrative is divided: your first friend, the Black Knight, will tell you some things as the game progresses, you will see cutscenes (memories of several enemies), and you will find pieces of paper and notes with messages, telling you more about the story of this fallen country.\n\nTo sum up, with Ender Lilies ~ Quietus of the Knights ~ you'll embark on a journey filled with secrets, dangers and mystery, while you defeat and purify enemies and acquire more knowledge about the past of Finisterra, all embellished with overtaking landscapes, a beautiful soundtrack and a good story. Being myself a huge fan of metroidvania games and all previous features, [b]I definitely recommend this game[/b] to those of you who enjoy a good story, being surrounded by mystery, a desolated background and good music. \n\n[ESP]\n\nEnder Lilies es un juego corto del estilo metroidvania, que toma muchos elementos de varios juegos como la saga Castlevania, Hollow Knight y la saga Dark Souls.

Una lluvia eterna cubre casi todo el continente, y cada criatura que te encontrar\u00e1s estar\u00e1 infestada por una enfermedad o maldici\u00f3n conocida como la Impureza. Con la ayuda inicial de un Caballero Negro, la chica se enfrentar\u00e1 a un mont\u00f3n de peligros mientras purifica y salva a estos seres ca\u00eddos, descubriendo los secretos que este mundo tiene que ofrecer.\n\n[u]-Primero, este es un juego metroidvania,[/u] as\u00ed que te encontrar\u00e1s con un juego de scroll lateral en 2d con enemigos a los que derrotar, objetos con los que interactuar con recompensas y secretos. E incluso si no puedes encontrar todos los secretos en tu primera visita a la zona (el mapa te indicar\u00e1 con un color azulado si no has encontrado todo en esa zona) no te preocupes, porque mientras sigas explorando y avanzando, ganar\u00e1s nuevas habilidades con las que moverte y llegar a sitios a los que no pod\u00edas llegar antes.\n\n[u]-El juego trata de purificar seres impuros, pero te dar\u00e1n recompensas por ello [/u] Derrota a minijefes y jefes duros para adquirir sus habilidades y usarlos como te venga en gana: con un m\u00e1ximo de 3 habilidades por set, (teniendo dos sets distintos de habilidades que puedes cambiar y usar siempre que quieras) puedes tener hasta seis habilidades para usar mientras exploras Finisterra.\n\n[u]-Este juego se inspira en otros juegos y toma varias de sus caracter\u00edsticas,[/u] como la narrativa de Dark Souls (encontrar\u00e1s diferentes objetos y papeles y notas con mensajes, cont\u00e1ndote m\u00e1s sobre la historia de este pa\u00eds ca\u00eddo), las mec\u00e1nicas de la hoguera de Dark Souls o el banco de Hollow Knight, permiti\u00e9ndote descansar, pero a coste de resucitar a los enemigos que ya derrotaste antes, etc. Puedes equiparte varios accesorios y habilidades e incluso mejorar estas habilidades con objetos que encontrar\u00e1s a lo largo del juego.\n\nEn definitiva, en Ender Lilies ~ Quietus of the Knights ~ te embarcar\u00e1s en un viaje lleno de secretos, peligros y misterios, mientras derrotas y purificas enemigos y vas aprendiendo m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s sobre el pasado de estos enemigos y de la propia Finisterra, todo esto embellecido con paisajes sobrecogedores, una banda sonora preciosa y una historia bastante buena. Siendo yo un gran fan de los juegos metroidvania y de disfrutar un buen juego, [b]sin duda alguna recomiendo este juegazo[/b] a aquellos que disfruten una buena historia, que les guste estar rodeados de paisajes desoladores, que les guste escuchar una buena banda sonora y que disfruten de buenas peleas.", "timestamp_created": 1698752306, "timestamp_updated": 1698752343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035129547119141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149238025": {"recommendationid": "149238025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346271726", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1370, "last_played": 1698762370}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like hk you'll like this as well", "timestamp_created": 1698737611, "timestamp_updated": 1698737611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149228471": {"recommendationid": "149228471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149832937", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1735, "last_played": 1698718130}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen metroidvania 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1698718204, "timestamp_updated": 1698718204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149225198": {"recommendationid": "149225198", "author": {"steamid": "76561199011021778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1698711679}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[ Espa\u00f1ol / English ]\n\nSI TE GUSTAN LOS METROIDVANIAS Y TIENES DUDAS SI COMPRAR ESTE JUEGO, SIGUE LEYENDO:\n\nComo fan de los metroidvanias y habiendo jugado tanto muy buenos t\u00edtulos como malos, este juego es notablemente bueno y totalmente recomendado.

The answer is \"YES\", highly recommended.\n\nHowever, there are some areas that could be improved:\n   - The map is not very intuitive and confusing.\n   - The communication between areas could be better.\n   - The performance is poorly optimized in the \"Witch's Thicket\" area (noticeable FPS drop).\n   - Some mechanics could be better explained.\n   - The Parry is unsatisfying, as it uses the same button as the Dash.\n   - The optional defense skills are very similar and not very useful.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698712717, "timestamp_updated": 1698712717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149189109": {"recommendationid": "149189109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275887212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1540, "last_played": 1698667244}, "language": "english", "review": "Great package!!

worth the price for the Music and Art alone. The lore isn't as vague or as hard to piece together/understand as most titles in the genre and the BGM/OST adds weight to the somber and dreary atmosphere of the game. It also gives further strength to the heart stirring lore of the game, the story pacing is, in my opinion, just right in the sense you are not overwhelmed by the lore dump or you are not completely clueless on what is going on. Also, for those perceptive ones, you get a foreshadowing of the \"BOSS\" you will be encountering at the end of the general area you are in as well as learning more of what happened to them and how they ended up the way they are. \n\nCombat-wise, it is unique that the MC cannot attack by herself but instead relies on the spirits of those she has defeated to gain new attacks, combos, passives and utility which in turn helps in the progression/exploration of the game in general. You get 2 three attack slots that you can alternate (for a total of 6 spirits) throughout your journey which you can change with any spirit combination in rest areas so to say that there are a lot of spirit combinations you can do is an understatement. My advice, you do you and test them all out to see what fits your playstyle though sometimes, you might have to slot in some of the ones you don't like just to get through certain areas. \n\nLots of pros (which I won't get into much as the reviewers here already got it) but a definite con for beginners and veterans alike is the quite substantial damage received by being touched by enemies (not attacked, TOUCHED!). While you can avoid this and their attacks by using skill based abilities (parry/dodge) and timing, it is worth noting that the farther you go the more damage the enemies can do and the relics to reduce damage are, in my opinion. next to worthless and it is more apt to use those relic slots for something else (ie. better movement, more heals, lifesteal, etc). \n\nThe game is definitely worth the dosh if you can afford it though I always advocate getting games on sale. Not just for the monetary reasons but games on sale (esp. those on 50% above) means that it has been quite some time since its release and any/most bugs and all that has been patched and fixed.

like immersive dark fantasy \n\nIt's my first ever metroidvania and I absolutely loved the gameplay, it had a bunch of difficulty spikes throughout the whole game, but I really felt that I was learning every fight and making progress, there's no bs here, new enemy attacks will always surprise you but you'll learn them sooner than you think, especially with the bosses (by the time I was able to beat the final boss I could kill it without taking any damage)\n\nThe story wasn't very clear at first, but by the end I had understood most of what happened, although you'll probably have to find some youtube video if you want to understand the lore\n\nIt was interesting that there's next to no farming in this game, by the time I got to the end I was nearly at max level and had most of my abilities highly upgraded, though only a few of them were maxed\nDespite that you'll end up searching through the entire world for hidden things you might have missed though\n\nThe whole game will take you around 40 hours (a bit less if you use guides), and these 40 hours will be worth every penny;\nThere is some replayable content after you achieve all endings, haven't tried it yet but it's a boss rush, you may like it, you may not\n\nAll that and I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack yet... let's just say it goes hard", "timestamp_created": 1698098576, "timestamp_updated": 1698098576,

My first time through, I spent 28 hours in the game, and somehow only obtained one ending. (the default ending), and went on with my life, with the vague suggestion that 'I'll probably come back and see the others later'. I did enjoy the game back then, all the same. But going through it again? Knowing what I'm doing, getting to see every nook and cranny, and besting every obstacle to finally, FINALLY, after more than 2 years away, get to see all of the endings, and everything else that the game had to offer?\n\nEven though my experience with this second playthrough is very skewed with personal anecdotes, I can safely say that Ender Lilies is now my new favorite metroidvania, unfortunately dethroning Momodora: RUTM after its exceedingly lengthy, and well-earned rule over this list. This game has so many things coming together to weave the perfect storm, and it's truly beautiful. Musical composition, gameplay, an immaculately perfect blend of difficulty that I wouldn't dare change (and even if I wanted to, I can! Another nice thing to note that the devs threw in for finishing the game.), an enthralling plot that evokes deep emotions and powerful melancholy... It makes it such a unique experience that I think I'd struggle to find elsewhere. \n\nI actually started this second, new playthrough because I was feeling burned out while going through Lies of P, and I wanted something, in my own mental words, \"more relaxing\". Though that's probably not the first thing that comes to mind when seeing promo material or gameplay of EL:QotK, I truly feel that it is still accurate. The game, for lack of a better term, is utterly relaxing. It's comfortable, and subdued. This deadened world that the narrative invites you into is so declined that it invites you to adopt the same mentality. Like stepping through a graveyard as the last light of day slips beyond the cloudy mountains. \n\nEnder Lilies really is worth all the time that it asks of you.

Metroidvania's are my favourite genre and while this has good music and good combat it just didn't feel good to play. I think it comes down to a couple of main issues and a bunch of smaller ones. \n\nThe biggest issue is that the combat and movement in this game just didn't feel satisfying. Killing an enemy or a boss never felt fun, just felt like I pressed some buttons to make my character do some stuff. I think it's partially due to the animations just not quite being crisp enough. Also the bosses have way too much health. Their attacks are easy to dodge but you just have to do the same rinse and repeat move like 30 times to end a fight. It gets boring really fast.\n\nAnother major issue is the lacklustre platforming. The platforming in this game is pretty terrible. Mainly because there's just not much of it and when it is there it's super simple. Basically, it's an afterthought. The main draw of this game is the combat and ambience. And I didn't find the combat that engaging either.\n\nNow onto the smaller issues. Most elements of this game are mediocre to good. It's not that they're bad, they're just not great. \n- The music is good but each area has one track that plays over and over and over. I loved the music at first but got sick of it within a couple of hours.\n- Animations look a little clunky and make everything feel a little off, decent animations but not good\n- It's very difficult to run through areas that you've already been through without methodically taking out each enemy in the way, this can get really annoying as backtracking is necessary and becomes quite lengthy as you have to replay several sections that give you nothing in return just to get to the part you actually wanted to reach\n- Literally the worst map I've ever seen in a Metroidvania. It could work for a more linear game but for something this open world the flowchart map is really lacking. Just rectangles and lines. No idea what possessed them to make such a bad map.\n\nI've tried to play this game on two occasions a year apart. Both times putting in several hours and then getting bored of the game. I can see why people like this game but it's not my cup of tea and it's certainly not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1697303714, "timestamp_updated": 1697303714, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148219317": {"recommendationid": "148219317", "author": {"steamid": "76561199384524420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1449, "last_played": 1697298847}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler]Paid:$12.49[/spoiler]\nThere is no denying [i]ENDER LILIES: Quietus of the Knights[/i] is drawn from the same vein as [i]Hollow Knight[/i].

others (the 1st one you get i kept with me through the whole game, she's great) - and even then the ones you'd think to ignore have some use (exploration, clearing out enemies for you while you explore, etc). Relic system is fun as well, it's pretty easy to figure out and make builds, so you don't have to spend ages min-maxxing it.\nBig fan of the map too, you can quickly see at a glance if you've picked up everything (absolute life saver when running out getting all the collectables).\nStory is simple but it works with the medium, and there's some themes and such you could analyse too if you wanted to, spoilers: [spoiler] How the entire burden of the blight is placed upon a single bloodline of women, with their suffering starting when they're only 14, or how disposable the soldiers are. [/spoiler]\nIt's not really the type of story where you'd want a massive complex thing with loads of storylines, since it'd get confusing especially with how its told.\n\nDifficulty wise I had loads of trouble with two bosses [spoiler]The witch and Elv[/spoiler], and the rest were challenging but very easily doable (I think i did also overlevel a bit by routinely clearing out areas once new abilities were unlocked though, i was level 95ish at the final boss)\n\nSome good features to implement:\nA zoom in! I played on steam deck to 100%, but I wish I could zoom in at will so I could see the art better. Could probably do a hacked version by changing the resolution but it wouldn't look as good I think.\nSaved relic/spirit sets to swap out (eg for exploration/bosses etc), though it isn't too bad having to re-do them.\nClicking on a respite on the fast-travel screen rather than selecting it from the menu", "timestamp_created": 1697291882, "timestamp_updated": 1697291882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

In fact, this was the first early access game I gave a try.\n\nNow it has its cons, [spoiler]like an entire bloody area, called the twin spires,[/spoiler] slightly overkill backtracking for me and a lack of \"spirit interaction at respites\" with each other and Lily. Would have preferred for them to at least share brief looks with one another. [spoiler]Especially spirits that knew each other, when they were still human.[/spoiler]\n\nHowever, the vast majority of the game was awesome. Like the pacing for example, which was just great, especially how the game kept on escalating, the environments kept getting more extreme, darker [spoiler]and alien like.[/spoiler] However, this isn't just limited to moving through areas, defeating bosses and reading the lore, but also the character progression and what that really means in this game, for the main character.\n\nOne of the highlights was definitely the lore, which was on par with dark souls lore for me. Reading about a place, or the notes of a character, only to end up at that place and meet the character were a real treat[spoiler], especially the final one.[/spoiler] Although some parts of the lore could, have been explained better and more clearly. [spoiler]Like the war between the \"settlers\" (aka the people under the king of the first age) and the Ancients. Was there ever a war, against the Ancients? Or was it just the \"settlers\" against the blighted? The king wrote, that the attempts to coexist with the Ancients failed, but did they? Were the Ancients already blighted, when the \"settlers\" arrived?[/spoiler]\n\nAnother highlight is the art, especially the background/environment art. This is one of the most beautiful games I played. The art also serves both the lore and story, through environmental story telling[spoiler] and later helps with the shift of the game's tone.[/spoiler]\n\nAll of this was supported by the third highlight of this game, the music. Just starting the game and listening to the main menu theme, was quite something.\n\nThe combat was also pretty good, especially around the middle of the game, where I already knew what I was doing and could get in the zone. Some boss fights were challenging, but in an enjoyable way, it was no Sekiro though, obviously. I have definitely enjoyed this combat system far more, than Tails of Iron's combat, particularly because Ender Lilies is way more responsive.\n\nLastly, this game had probably the most satisfying [spoiler]true[/spoiler] ending, in any game I have played so far and the buildup to getting to the final boss, was something else alright. I wasn't even sad when I finished it, just grateful that I got to play this amazing piece of art.\nIt was almost a masterpiece for me, almost, with just a little bit more care in some of the lore bits, one nasty area improvement, some better backtracking rewards and some simple character interactions at the respites, it could have been one.

The art style, music, and world really come together to beautifully and though this is a wildly different game from Metroid Prime, it's one of very few games in the decades since to really bring me back that feeling of being a small child exploring a daunting, seemingly endless world of mystery.\n\nOf course, Ender Lilies has some solid gameplay to back up the presentation, though the combat can take some getting used to. Most of your attacks are very disconnected from your player character, behaving more like trapping tools such as those found on a character like Snake or Duck Hunt in Super Smash Bros. As a result, maximizing my damage output often seemed like less a matter of getting in and smacking an enemy and more a matter of understanding the exact AOE of my current attack set, how long each lasts, and how they compliment my current primary weapon choice. Also, bosses are by far the hardest part of the game, so expect to die a fair few times on all of them your first time through.\n\nBeyond that?

Another reviewer is correct that it seems like the dev team is imbalanced. The music fits well and improves the game. The art is above average and somber just like the music. Randomly the animations are much worse than most anything else which exhibits this uncanny cheapness that damages the mood. Level design and enemy placement is also definitely worse than the art and music. Nice selection of spells and weapons. And let's say the combat is generally pretty good. \n\nIt's all good enough, and I was in awe at times even if not particularly often. It did manage to suck me in, usually through art and music, but occasionally through a close boss fight.\n\n3 significant complaints:\n- Map sucks (no detail or accurate room shapes). Seems intentional but grew on me. They probably want you to have to pay attention during exploration. But lack of info and no markers means you're going to be wandering endlessly at times. Also makes some areas feel like an unnecessary pain to traverse.\n\n- Bosses not fair sometimes. Still mostly great fights, eventually, but some have one shots or near-oneshots that will cheese you for no meaningful reason. Annoying. Wastes a lot of time with sucker punches as the boss transitions to another phase and does some new thing to immediately kill you that you can't really predict or react to until some failures.\n\n-  Most annoying thing about the game: overabundance of enemies takes away from the nicely made environments and pacing as you explore. There are WAY too many enemies on every single screen. It's tiring and gets really old. I started just sprinting by stuff. It would be better if there was more enemy variation but it's kind of lacking. Otherwise cool areas just become annoying due to this.\n\nEither way this is better than almost any metroidvania I can remember in recent years. After Hollow knight (basically the best similar game ever), the only same-genre games I remember impressing me at all are blasphemous and this. \n\nHappy that I played this.", "timestamp_created": 1696754487, "timestamp_updated": 1696754883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147843360": {"recommendationid": "147843360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083584906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1696916484}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buena musica, buen gameplay y buena historia", "timestamp_created": 1696736883, "timestamp_updated": 1696916319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147841490": {"recommendationid": "147841490", "author": {"steamid": "76561199557826756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1696733628}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun metroidvania.", "timestamp_created": 1696733673, "timestamp_updated": 1696733673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147838225": {"recommendationid": "147838225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023786071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1494, "last_played": 1696728225}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Metroidvania perita.", "timestamp_created": 1696728270, "timestamp_updated": 1696728270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147829948": {"recommendationid": "147829948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100389944", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1838, "last_played": 1696696450}, "language": "english", "review": "Lily is literally a stand user.

Its biggest weakness being the default generic map. With a game that requires so much backtracking, this almost made me drop the game. I would recommend anyone who plays this game to use the steam community map. Trust me, it will save you a lot of time and frustration of the ridiculous amount of backtracking required to progress the story. It made my overall experience playing Ender Lilies so much more enjoyable.\n\nThe combat in this game felt satisfying due to the stunning visuals. Though I would've hoped they made the character be able to move while casting spirits to make game-play smoother. Even so, the combination of jumping, parrying, and SP abilities; along with a wide variety of Spirit combos available made the experience feel engaging and non-repetitive.\n\nThe OST is honestly so beautiful, though it can get old sometimes with the amount of times you get to hear it and backtrack through these areas.\n\nThe story is dark and interesting. Fitting of the scenery. The map itself tells a story on its own. A classic feature of souls-like games. The only problem with that the telling of this story and its plot could have been much better. Witnessing the animated cut-scenes after the boss fights was a treat, but they were either too short, or too vague. And the only thing left for the player is to fill in the blanks of the plot by reading scattered notes through exploration, In my opinion, its a rather messy and boring way of storytelling.\n\nOverall, I had a good time playing Ender Lilies. And I would recommend this game to anyone willing to put some time into a new metroidvania or indie title. It is definitely not a must play, it has significant flaws, such as the terrible mapping provided. Luckily, this can be remediated with the Steam Community Ender Lilies map guide.\n\nFollow the story of Lily, the last remaining White Priestess.

Se nos va desvelando a base de pinceladas y cuando vencemos a ciertos enemigos o jefes finales, que no son obligatorios pero ayudan a comprender la trama, hasta llegar al final (o posible final de tres diferentes), un buen aliciente para completarlo de varias formas.\n\nLa jugabilidad es muy cl\u00e1sica metroid, manejamos por los escenarios a Lily, respondiendo el control de forma correcta, por medio de \"habitaciones\" llenas de enemigos y objetos a encontrar, una vez exploramos podemos pasar a la siguiente o buscar otra posible salida, el consultar el mapa ser\u00e1 una constante a cada paso que demos, para saber hacia d\u00f3nde debemos ir o qu\u00e9 habit\u00e1culo nos falta por explorar a fondo. Muy agradecido el hecho de que cuando falta algo por recoger el cuadro del mapa es azul, y cuando est\u00e1 explorada por completo cambia a naranja. Buen detalle. Los mapas se van interconectando poco a poco seg\u00fan avanzamos por los niveles. \n\nEs importante el manejo en cuanto a saltos y acceso a zonas dif\u00edciles del juego, pero quitando algunos lugares remotos muy contados, no supone especial desaf\u00edo tipo \"Guacamelee\" o similares, con el tiempo iremos adquiriendo nuevos poderes y as\u00ed llegar a zonas antes imposible, otro cl\u00e1sico de estos juegos. El combate es otra de las partes que sustenta el juego, se hace de forma amena, r\u00e1pido, \u00e1gil y directo, podremos equipar dos conjuntos de tres habilidades diferentes e intercambiar, algunas infinitas, otras limitadas en usos, aparte, encontraremos reliquias muy \u00fatiles que nos ayudar\u00e1n al equiparlas (m\u00e1s vida, ampliar usos, mayor da\u00f1o), es importante saber cuales equipar en cada momento pues las ranuras son escasas y habr\u00e1 que gestionar el inventario seg\u00fan convenga en cada zona o enemigo. En cuanto a estos \u00faltimos mencionados, hay bastante variedad seg\u00fan la zona, engendros impuros desde simples espadachines a aberraciones enormes, junto con los subjefes que nos dan p\u00edldoras de historia al vencerlos as\u00ed como nuevas habilidades, y los jefes finales que nos dan mayores detalles y una habilidad indispensable para acceder a nuevos lugares. Los subjefes son sencillos (normalmente se encuentran escondidos en zonas de dif\u00edcil acceso) y los jefes basta aprender sus patrones para que tampoco supongan un reto frustrante. El dise\u00f1o est\u00e1 bien pero tampoco resultar\u00e1n memorables. Al eliminar adversarios subimos de nivel pero eso se traduce solo en un poco m\u00e1s de energ\u00eda y un poco m\u00e1s de da\u00f1o, testimonial.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente nos encontramos ante un juego con claroscuros, algunos escenarios son realmente bellos (todo hecho a mano) como zonas boscosas o la zona inundada, con fortalezas, aldeas, acantilados, y otros con un dise\u00f1o que me ha parecido horrible, como la zona oscura o la infestada de gas t\u00f3xico, pero todo muy cl\u00e1sico, destacando los tonos oscuros ante todo, el negro, rojo o verdoso. Puede hacerse repetitivo a este nivel pues normalmente se transita varias veces por los mismos lugares, y m\u00e1s teniendo que acabar en general con los mismos enemigos una vez descansamos para recuperarnos (como el subg\u00e9nero \"souls like\")\n\nEn cuanto al sonido, nos encontramos con efectos sonoros b\u00e1sicos y una elecci\u00f3n de melod\u00edas que aunque alguna en un principio puede resultar hermosa al o\u00eddo, al cabo del tiempo al repetirse sin cesar seg\u00fan donde nos encontremos acaban resultando irritantes, y como en el dise\u00f1o de niveles algunas son horribles. No tiene voces el juego, lo \u00fanico que se ofrece es texto en perfecto castellano.\n\nEn definitiva es un \"Metroidvania\" de corte cl\u00e1sico, a veces te encantar\u00e1 explorar algunos de sus escenarios y otros se atragantaran por el dise\u00f1o, estaremos dando vueltas en busca de alg\u00fan objeto, otras luchando contra enemigos que vuelven a reaparecer al descansar o intentando descubrir hacia donde hay que avanzar. Lo recomiendo, pero alguien que no tenga simpat\u00eda por este tipo de juegos dudo que le pudiera entusiasmar Ender Lilies.\n\nNOTA 7`5/10", "timestamp_created": 1696434012, "timestamp_updated": 1696434729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589041054248809814", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147626306": {"recommendationid": "147626306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010671262", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2153, "last_played": 1696429383}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat was pretty fun.\nThe plot was dark and intriguing.\nThe music/sound (for me) vibed well with the game play.\nWould recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1696429958, "timestamp_updated": 1696429958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147619237": {"recommendationid": "147619237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198954088005", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2074, "last_played": 1696816048}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic Metroidvania with tight combat and a novel upgrade and combat system.", "timestamp_created": 1696421241, "timestamp_updated": 1696421241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147583380": {"recommendationid": "147583380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043800552", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1290, "last_played": 1696687609}, "language": "english", "review": "ENDER LILIES: Quietus of the Knights is beautiful, in the truest sense of the word.\n\nIt's just delightful to look at almost everything - the backgrounds, the characters, the cutscenes.

So many great songs have found their way into my heart and my playlist.\n\nI love the dark and gritty world and atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed unraveling the story piece by piece and learning more about the people, their relationships, their mostly tragic demises and all the other events that took place here. I really felt immersed and touched a lot of the times.\n\nThe main boss fights are magnificent. Normally bosses stress me out, but these I really liked to duel. They're all unique, well-balanced and with an interesting backstory, and after beating them they present you with new abilities as they join your ranks as Spirit summons. Since your player character isn't the one actually fighting and traversing the increasingly difficult terrain, but your Spirits, you constantly unlock new combat moves, tools and movement options.\n\nThe aforementioned fighting and traversing are heaps of fun when your portfolio is steadily expanding and you can mix and match dozens of Spirits and other upgrades to suit your play style and to reach new areas. In the beginning, the game is rather linear, but soon the world opens up to you and leaves you to choose how and when to approach certain obstacles, at least to an extend.\n\nEven though the platforming isn't exactly something to write home about and the overall complexity and depth of the game can't be compared to something like Hollow Knight, the whole package is definitely a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nIn the end, if I want to experience a delightfully bitter sweet story in a gloomy but also dreamy world, equipped with my trusty Spirit companions and some of the best music I have witnessed in a game, I will gladly come back to ENDER LILIES.", "timestamp_created": 1696360929, "timestamp_updated": 1696451823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147562455": {"recommendationid": "147562455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057363272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1698655347}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a heartbreaking but well made game.  \nthe music sets a melancholy tone and the ambience only enhances this masterfully.\nthe game has a great set up for difficulty. it definitely feels more on the easy side (aside from bosses)\nonly because it is more methodical then reaction oriented. \nthe way you battle is not on you're own. it is by the spirits that aid you. to get a new spirit you must beat and purify it first. \nthere are 2 types of spirits. red spirits which are the main skill you will use and option spirits. option spirits only have a set amount of uses before you have to find a place to rest before you can use them again. red spirits generally have unlimited uses. you can have a total of 6 different spirits on you at once.\nyou only can heal 3x per life. you can get them back by resting.\nwhen you rest like most souls like all enemies reset.

It has an ambience, and even though I don't think the story or the narrative is of the best writing or epic, it drives the point home and sometimes nails it nicely. \n\nYou might get a bit lost sometimes, especially if you don't remember how the rooms are, and the game won't take your hand and tell you where to go. If you're getting tired and you're like me, you'll wander aimlessly like an idiot trying to find your way. Just go to bed and come back the day after, it's not especially tough to find your way. \n\nAs for the difficulty, I found it quite fair. I'm not the best gamer in the world and this game doesn't expect you to be. However it holds a certain standard, and will challenge you progressively. I liked a lot the fact that it doesn't punish you for dying, like Dark Souls or Hollow Knight. Instead you're put back in the last bench visited, and there's a reasonable amount of them. You can even teleport very early, which makes the game easier to complete (that and the fact that the rooms are telling you if they're completed or not). \n\nAll in all I think you'll have a good time there, sometimes a tad frustrating but I don't think that's necessarily the game's fault, in the sense that its doing the job well. \n\nThere's also a nice NG+ and stuff to customize after you finish all the endings, so go for it!

The artstyle, I guess? Just like the story, it isn't exactly charming or stands out on its own for it to be a big selling point for this game in particular (or any other game, to be honest, as graphics are something that should only complement the gameplay, which is the most important aspect of any game)\n\nAnd that's the only redeeming quality for this game. Now, the bad aspects:\n\n1. Story. Mediocre and unoriginal. It tries to do its storytelling through EXTREMELY quiet cutscenes, with no voice acting and barely any sound effects or music, and pieces of text that you find throughout the world. However, the story and setting is so unimaginably bland that after 30 minutes of gameplay, I couldn't be arsed to read or pay attention to anything related to lore.\n\n2. Combat. It's bad. Very bad. Considering that combat is supposed to be one of the main aspects of the game, I can't imagine who in their right mind would design combat like this. Unlike Hollow Knight (which I assume this games was heavily inspired on), when you attack in this game, you are stuck in the animation until it ends (including when you do aerial attacks). So there's no animation cancelling, no fluidity to the combat, making it incredibly clunky and an overall unfun experience. Also, the spirits that I got in my short playthrough are so useless that I couldn't be bothered to use them.\n\n3. Bosses. Keep in mind that I only fought the first 2 bosses. The first one was kind of ok, maybe a bit too easy. The second one was such a slog to fight against. Even though I defeated it first try, the boss had such a massive health pool that it made the experience miserable. Extremely easy to dodge attacks, accompanied by a 5 minute fight that overextends itself for no apparent reason.\n\n4. Exploration. VERY large and empty stages with little to no incentive to explore, as the upgrades that I found were so uninteresting that after 20 minutes of playtime, I didn't want to explore anymore. I mean, +5 max HP permanent upgrades and relics that increase my damage while in water (???) and that increase my max HP by 5, just like the permanent upgrades? Might as well just delete these relics, they add absolutely nothing to the game. It also doesn't help that, after the second boss, the game already made me backtrack to \"explore\" more the game with the ground pound attack. I know that one of the main selling points of metroidvanias is the backtracking after acquiring new powers, but making it happen so early in the game is kind of strange.\n\n5. Soundtrack. To be honest, it isn't that bad. However, one of the songs was so unbelievably repetitive, spanning across multiple screens of the game, that it made me mute in-game music. I've never had to do this in my entire life playing video games, ESPECIALLY considering this was under the 2 hour mark of gameplay.\n\nI sincerely don't understand what makes people enjoy or even recommend this game. There's no saving grace, no selling point, nothing interesting or original about it. It has to be one of the most bland experiences I've had with video games so far. It absolutely boggles my mind that this game almost an overall overwhelmingly positive review score.", "timestamp_created": 1696211322, "timestamp_updated": 1696211437, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469194293022155762", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147463549": {"recommendationid": "147463549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022278305", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1226, "last_played": 1696192592}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game for an alternative for Hollow Knight.

There isnt much to say except its exceptional.\n\n[i] nitpicking [/i] honestly the story is pretty good but there is 2 problems I had with it. Firstly there wasn\u2019t any NPC to talk with.\n\nWhy is that important? Because Lily actions might have an impact to the world. In every souls like, there is some sort of NPC, be it dark souls, hollow knight or lies of P. There is someone there that your choice to save the world matters. Ender lilies\u2026. Yeah everyone is either mindless monster or dead soooo who are we trying to save? The other kingdoms? For what? It just feels pointless and empty to try and save a ruin kingdom\n\nThe other problem I had was that both the knight and someone just outright says just leave as it\u2019s not my responsibility and my burden to do it. While I understand that Lily is trying her best and etc, both of them are right. No one to save, no one to come back to, a dead kingdom, a hostile environment, no appreciation from others and 2 people are telling me to run away and not shoulder the problem. So yeah\u2026 despite there is a choice to save them, the game outrights wants you to do the opposite. [spoiler] smaller nitpicking. Why bother with the saving if you, the clone of the priestess, home got invaded by a foreign army and was made to bear the burden. It\u2019s like someone comes into your house and took over it, then found out there is an infestation and make you do all the repair and money renovation to prevent your house from being a sh*thole.

be disappointed, but it's definitely a game worth checking out. while i found several aspects like combat or level design to be kind of flawed, it's good enough. and honestly the ost and some of the final cutscenes by themselves might be enough to justify buying the game\n\ncombat is... okay. i don't like standing still while attacking, that really put me off for a while because it made me feel like sometimes i had to exchange hits or use a lame ranged build. some other metroidvanias do this too and i'm personally not a fan, that kind of mechanic fits souls a lot since it encourages using map geometry and outflanking the opponent. but in 2D games where the enemy and you have only two directions of attacking, it can become kind of tedious and frustrating kiting back and forth. \n\nthe bosses are great, i loved most of them because they feel like a grand duel with both sides trying to exploit weaknesses and openings in the other. except for hoenir, fuck that guy and his summons.\n\nthe level design is the biggest complaint of people and while it isn't amazing, i didn't find it to be that bad either. it's entirely serviceable, just don't expect hollow knight.\n\nthe music is really nice, definitely worth putting a lot of the ost in your playlist. it can be very emotional and chilling like:\nlily, prologue, main theme, awakening, harmonious, a nocturne for all, dewdrop, grudge, bible outro, bloom intro, bloom outro, accolade intro, mother outro\n\nrelaxing and calming like: \nholy land, bible intro, debris and bugs, the white witch\n\nand even inspiring and adventurous like:\nnorth, pulsation\n\nthe usage of leitmotifs are also obvious, and very charming. but one emotion i feel like they weren't able to quite capture were more negative emotions like scariness/fear or tension, like compounding, the witch's breath or evil intro. that being said more melancholic/sad vibes were executed very well (mostly in the emotional songs), and it enhances the bleak atmosphere of the game\n\nthe art is okay, it does kind of look like a weird mobile game. i think the main character is cute but the enemies having similar head to body proportions as her, an anime child, just makes them look goofy, no matter how much blood they have on their ragged clothes or rotten bones and flesh sticking out of their body. none of them look intimidating or scary, which does take a bit from the experience.\n\nas for the story, i found it to be quite cliche and edgy at the start, and the melodramatic journals you find definitely don't help. when i finished the game though i grew to like it. there are definitely great concepts in the lore and story writing, and some of those great plot points being revealed with an amazingly emotional ost in the background does make them feel a lot more special. definitely worth watching the lore videos made by Indie Xplorer", "timestamp_created": 1695957101, "timestamp_updated": 1695957101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Tight game-play for your button commands and you are also reward for each monster you fight. The battle style is really adaptable, and was able to adjust it just right to support my style of combat.\n\nGreat atmosphere and the music in one of the earlier maps is such a mood! I have found myself humming the music sometimes while I wasn't playing. I now have it on my music playlist. \n\nThe story details are dripped in throughout your journey and consistently evolving if you look for it. Basically you get more weight to your actions the more you pay attention to the world around you. \nThe effect of the story on the main character was so gripping for me, and it made me want to see her succeed- if it is even possible. Somehow they made her delicate but so strong at the same time. It makes you want to protect her and also follow her into this world. \n\nIf you are teetering on if you should try this game, please do.

In a once beautiful kingdom known as Land's End is now in turmoil, ravaged by endless toxic rain and undead immortal monsters known as the blighted, a lone girl wakes up who may be the hope to ending this nightmare.\n\nOkay let\u2019s talk about the likes; the story is incredibly beautiful, with a great sense of melancholy and sadness as well as hope, it's the kind of story that touched me deeply and made me cry a bit, the story is also told not just through cutscenes, but with notes, item description and enemy description just like a good Souls like game making you piece together the story. \n\nThe gameplay is very good, it's hard but fair like any good Souls like game and it also takes a bit of inspiration from Castlevania not just with its design, you see you play as a little girl that doesn't really have any powers, but she can bond with the souls of the enemies and bosses allowing you to use their powers to destroy to fight kind of like Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow where you can gain the souls of enemies and gain their power. \n\nThere are also plenty of relics that you can find that can enhance your stats, health and or give you certain advantages. the game can also be really forgiving but still hard like after I picked up an item I was killed immediately after, at first I thought I had to go all the way back to pick up that item, but no if you pick up an item or got some experience and you die before getting to a save you don't have to go all the way back to pick up that item or experience again which I enjoyed.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful with an incredible use of bright yet somber colors with plenty of little details and incredible set pieces that just make you want to stop and stare at it. The levels are really good and breathtakingly beautiful, quite diverse with a wide range of worlds to explore from a cursed village to a creepy crypt to even the heart of the blight, all of it was breathtakingly beautiful to look at and explore with nice touches here and there that just makes the world feel alive.\n\nThe characters were very good, now there's only two main characters in the game the little girl and her protector, but through little dialogue and subtle gestures you really get to know them as people.  You also get to know the enemies and the bosses through cutscenes, notes, enemy and item descriptions which helped to endear these characters. The enemies and bosses are really good each one with their own horrifying designs, like undead demonic nuns and undead knights, I can see a lot of thought was put into these creatures designs and abilities and functions.\n\nThe cutscenes were really good very cinematic and detailed with a great use of shades of gray and atmosphere. The atmosphere is really good depressing but in a beautiful way as you wander through this corrupted and blighted land, it even got a little creepy near the end of the game. The music was magnificent each soundtrack incredibly beautiful and just fit the game so well, I especially loved the ending song it was well written and very beautiful to listen too.\n\nThe game also has some interesting little side bits like after defeating a boss you can fight that boss again when you go to a save, there's also notes in the game and you know I love notes because it can help with the world building and these notes do exactly that, you can also find out more about the world through enemy and item descriptions like any souls like game and after beating the game completely there's also a mode where you can make the game harder or easier if you're interested in a challenge.\n\nOkay let\u2019s talk about the dislikes; this game is almost perfect, but the only thing I would say it needs is voice acting, in certain parts of the game like when your companion talks I did miss a bit of what he said due to the dialogue being a little fast.\n\nOkay now that I've told you all this ENDER LILIES: Quietus of the Knights is not just an incredibly good Souls like metroidvania game, it's an incredibly beautiful and touching game that will make you cry a bit, it just has so much to love from the incredibly beautiful story, very good gameplay and magnificent music, I highly, highly recommend this game if you're a fan of souls like or metroidvania games you must get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1694299498, "timestamp_updated": 1694299520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145994930": {"recommendationid": "145994930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976671395", "num_games_owned": 687, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1028, "last_played": 1694278033}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game, highly recommended.\nGood Metroidvania and nice platforming.\nCombat is really good and skill system is very innovative and enjoyable.\nMusic is very good.\nOnly weakness is biome diversity.

You explore the world looking for the next boss and power-up that will let you explore more of the world. The combat is difficult to the point of punishing, but death has no cost.\n\n[b]The good:[/b]\nThe game is gorgeous. The hand-drawn art is just a joy to look at.\n\nThe music, while fairly simple at times, is somber, and sets the mood perfectly. Not everything needs a full orchestra, and I really enjoyed some of the piano-only BGM.\n\nThe combat offers a pretty good range of options, and none of them feel underwhelming. Plus, you can use so many at once, it allows a great deal of flexibility in how you approach things. Great game feel in that regard.\n\n[b]The bad:[/b]\nThe map. The map is just a series of rectangles with dots and lines connecting them. The only thing to distinguish each room is the shape of the rectangle. Rooms can be one of two colors, but that's only based on whether you have found everything in the room, not it's location.\n\nLeveling. This game didn't need a leveling mechanic. The combat feels great, but losing because the boss is just too high level doesn't feel good. But on that note:\n\nBacktracking. This is a thing in every metroidvania, I'm not opposed to backtracking. But this game had me so frustrated. The map is so unclear, I would visit the same rooms over and over to figure out if I had the power I needed now only to find that no...I don't. Or worse, I do have the power to make progress, but the room after that requires [i]another[/] power, so the disappointment just hits harder.\n\nThe biggest frustration is the loop I found myself in: Get frustrated by a boss I'm under-leveled for. Go exploring instead. Get frustrated because everywhere I explore requires a power I still don't have. But I've gained a few levels so I give up on exploring and go beat the boss. So I get a new power, which (after searching half the map because I can't remember where that power is needed) leads me to the next boss where the cycle begins again.\n\n[b]The meh:[/b]\nThe story is alright. It's not pushing any boundaries. There is nothing profound. There is not a lot of hidden mysteries by the end. But it's well written for what it is.\n\nThe penultimate boss took me like, 50 tries at least. I had use nearly all of my abilities to their fullest. It was frustrating at the time, but in hindsight, a really satisfying challenge. But the final boss? It took me 3 tries. It stays in one spot and spawns enemies.

Sencillamente es una obra digna de admirar. Este juego no es de gran dificultad, es todo lo dem\u00e1s lo que lo hace un 10 para mi. Existen muy pocos bugs que realmente no afectan a la jugabilidad sino que tienen que ver con el mapa, pero hay tan pocos que si lo juegas casual realmente ni los notas.

Los libros de texto, que informan muy bien de la historia, es un agrado leerlos al momento de encontrarlos ya que algunos los han escrito los personajes principales y te informan de como fueron sus recuerdos de la Doncella Blanca.

If you are into this kind of games, be warned that game is pretty difficult and some boss fights are very difficult - there is no easy mode, which is quite bad in accessibility sense, not all gamers can get through such boss fights, and some don't want to stress too much to see the full story. Game is slightly rough around edges with a lot of good moments and also some quite average moments which is a shame, this game could have been a real master piece.\n\nI was originally drawn to game by its visual style, but I think in the late game old school level design style sort of breaks the illusion of the style developers were going after, I couldn't care less how some castle looks if game goes to 80s style platforming with all the antics of that era. If you compare Ender Lilies to a game like Hollow Knight, it does challenging areas way better without resorting into in my opinion bad design choices. \n\nGameplay and character movement is pretty smooth, although it can feel in the beginning slightly laggy due to animations. Helper spirits that grant you new skills are visually neat, but also can cause hard to read moments in tight combat situations. Game protagonist is also (on purpose) weak and frail, and this theme is also there in every enemy encounter and boss battle, this can be a source of frustration, especially in early game.\n\nSlight spoilers ahead - game progression is quite uneven, there are several endings, although the first one comes suprisingly early without much effort, later endings requires visiting all the areas game has to offer, but the last one was way too grindy for me, so I resorted to using guides to get 100% instead of jumping from every ledge to find out if some hidden object is there or not. There are also some jumping puzzles which are actually quite neat.\n\nI wish the developers would have put more effort into level design and balancing the leveling up and overall flow, and making it match the visual quality of the game.

This was an amazing game with great visuals, very solid controls, and a great sense of challenge but isn't too hard. I picked this game up thinking \"oh hey, this seems like it might be like hollow knight!\" and boy, was I correct, but wrong at the same time. Although it is quite similar to hollow knight, the bosses are definitely a bit more challenging, which is nice because I fully went into this game thinking i'd clear the game with ease. spirits make the combat feel unique compared to other games, giving you a very wide range of different attack you can use, and some can even be used for traversing the game easier. The game has a great sound track that matches the areas very well, and the boss fights definitely feel quite balanced, but difficult. The areas do sadly feel a bit over populated in some areas, because the enemies will kill you in 3 hits if you aren't too careful. The controls feel very tight which is nice because the bosses require some slightly tight timing.

Cada \u00e1rea requiere un par de habilidades y artefactos equipados diferentes lo que hace que tengas que adaptarte un poco cada vez. Los jefes finales son muy divertidos, tienen tres fases y de nuevo hay que intentar tener la configuraci\u00f3n que mejor se adapte a cada uno de ellos. En otros del g\u00e9nero que he jugado cuando estaba c\u00f3modo con una configuraci\u00f3n con esa iba a muerte, o si acaso una para explorar y otra para jefes, pero lo divertido de este es realmente acabas usando casi todas las cosas que vas cogiendo, y con un sentido. El combate tiene cierta exigencia, los enemigos te pueden matar en dos o tres golpes as\u00ed que hay que jugar mucho con el dash, el parry y las habilidades.\n\nSobre la exploraci\u00f3n, hay bastantes puntos de descanso y ninguno alejado de jefes ni cosas as\u00ed para complicarte las cosas sin m\u00e1s. Pero lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado es que en el mapa se te marcan las habitaciones con un color diferente si tienes a\u00fan cosas por descubrir, y eso a m\u00ed personalmente me ha gustado bastante. No te lo ponen f\u00e1cil, hay que fijarse en paredes, hay jump puzzles, mini bosses y requiere volver cuando tienes nuevas habilidades, pero es muy gratificante despu\u00e9s de cada jefe con una habilidad nueva irse de paseo y c\u00f3mo te lo recompensa.\n\nOtros detalles chulos el que las armas que vas cogiendo son esp\u00edritus que te acompa\u00f1an y son ellos los que realmente ejecutan el ataque.

And will probably be what I remember this game for in years to come. The gameplay, while not without some frustrating flaws in the design and execution, is great fun and a good place to start in the metroidvania genre. The ability to create builds with up to six different attacks and skills gives the player a lot of flexibility, and options to try should they get stuck.\n\nThe story on the other hand is tragically weak, with its most impactful moments being only in the very beginning and the very end(s). The cinematics in between suffer from repeating already-known information or following a B-plot barely connected to the protagonist and her goal, and often feel like padding to fill the gaps betwen the A-plot's major moments. When finding Healing upgrades carries more emotional clout than defeating a major boss and learning their past, there's something amiss.\n\nAll that being said, the gameplay is still fun and engrossing, and the visuals and music are stellar, so it's not like it needed a perfect story to be worth anyone's time.

Everything has weight to it. If you chose to initiate an attack, know that you're dedicating yourself to that animation until it's done.\n\nAs such, the game is definitely more on the challenging side; but aside from a very few bizarre choices - it's extremely well balanced and fair. Just use the skills at your disposal, knowing that some are better for situations than others. That at times, it's better to experiment to find a proper strategy for what's ahead.

The unique art style was something that really caught my eye when I first heard of the game.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was that it wasn\u2019t very fun. Normally in these games the story or the idea of exploring the world keeps you playing. I never had the urge to learn more about the story or to keep exploring the world.  \n\nThe map system is not great. The map is worse than Super Metroid, a game made 30 years ago.

If I could hit that \"Yes\" button more than once, I would do it at least 10 times. I will now tell you why, in Spoiler-Free fashion.\n\nThe gameplay is very challenging in many ways, but never unfair, and especially never too punishing against player mistakes. Not losing your EXP or other resources on death and having fast travel available from very early on are two particularly big aspects that, honestly, surprised me, going in with minimal knowledge and expecting a 2D Souls-like that wouldn't show that type of mercy. The only real punishment being physical progress and, in the case of bosses, having to fight them from the beginning again, really minimizes any frustration of having to go through a longer section full of powerful enemies multiple times. All the EXP you gather stays with you, and checkpoints/shortcuts are plentiful.\nThe Spirit system in particular is a very nice take on equipping weapons and skills, reminding me of the Iga-vania Soul/Crystal system, but instead of relying on plain luck that a random enemy will drop the thing you need, all of your Spirits are gotten from boss fights in specific parts of the map and the Blight pieces necessary to upgrade them aren't hard to come across. With just a bit of time given to leveling up and upgrading your Spirits, you may eventually get yourself a really good party to take on most of the game with, only occasionally switching to your B set if it's safer for some situation or another, or at least that's how I approached things\n\nThe story is pretty light, which I feel just kinda comes with the territory of an extremely pretty dark fantasy Metroidvania game at this point, but if you just pick up the lore notes that are in the beaten path or in save rooms, as well as watching the bosses' memory cutscenes and going through the game, obviously, you'll get a clear enough picture of what happened to this kingdom, who all these characters were, why they did what they did and how you'll right their wrongs, but at the same time the game never spells every last thing out and leaves a handful of elements open to interpretation, and any reason to think more about a good game is welcome in my eyes.\nObviously not getting into spoilers, but it was honestly a story that made me quite emotional at multiple points, and that is certainly a very good thing.\n\nThe presentation, both audio and visual, is possibly tied with gameplay as Ender Lilies' best aspect. On a purely practical sense, the main character being a pale white in this dingy, dark world is perfect, as is every big attack being clearly telegraphed with orange flashes that are consistent enough across most enemies and bosses that if you can time one you can probably time every other. As for the plain beauty and spectacle of it? This game is an absolute FEAST of breath-taking medieval landscapes and architecture, from run down cathedrals, to bloody and broken castle halls, to a surprisingly bright and colorful sanctuary of witches (Or what remain of them, at least), every area in this game feels sufficiently unique and interesting just to look at. I feel it really says something that the developers added a \"Hide UI\" button to your save points, they were all but directly asking people to screenshot this game and its wonderful backgrounds and character designs.\nBosses take on grotesque powered up forms that range from a change in palette to morphing into complete abominations, with attacks that fill up the entire screen with their blood red and orange Blight, and every area and major battle is scored by some beautiful piece of music. This game has it all, with location themes being dark and somber or at the very least melancholy, and boss themes being intense orchestral pieces and tragic solo instruments that help tell their story.\n\nMy biggest critique of this game might be the map. It certainly shows the rough size of each room, and roughly where they connect to other rooms, and the squares do change color depending on if you've collected everything there or not, and it also marks rooms with save points... But that's about it. Where specifically the collectibles might be is not something you ever even unlock (or at least I'm pretty sure it isn't) to slightly help with 100% completion, you don't get to see your exact position, you don't get to see the actual shape of the room you're in, and you don't even get to place down your own in-game markers. I very much get what it's going for, being less of a clear-cut in-game guide to follow wherever you go and more of a set of hints and notes for you to look to as you explore, and it's somewhat like the old Castlevania maps that also had no color coding and minimal extrinsic pointers for where you should look for things, and while I can meet it on it's own terms I generally just prefer detailed maps over vague ones, and other people's opinions may differ in one direction or another. Although, that this is the only real issue I had with the game should speak volumes to its quality.\n\nAs I said at the top, if you're a fan of ANYTHING this game has going for it I cannot recommend it enough, at least not just in plain english. If you, like me, are always after new Metroidvanias to scratch that itch? Ender Lilies will give you the full dang Spa treatment.

If you are a metroid-vania connoisseur, you owe it to yourself to play this.\n \nIn an odd step, it is much more focused on tight, difficult combat, rather than smooth exploration. But it works! Extremely well in fact. There are obvious influences from FromSoft's Souls series. Boss fights are very hard, until you get the patterns down. Extremely satisfying too. When you get a bosses 'number' and dash around them like they can't land a single it, it feels great.\n\nThe scaling is well done. There are areas you technically 'shouldn't' be at, but you can still explore them if you're careful enough with combat. I think one issue I had is that [spoiler]doors opened by Faden aren't signified on the map. You should take a notepad and make sure you remember where they are.[/spoiler] I say this, because I had to figure out how to manipulate the game with certain spirit combinations to get 100%... when it was clear that, after entering the final room and obtaining the spirit of a Verbotan Champion, they gave me what was essentially a triple jump. Would have made my struggle so much easier. Still! You could say this is a testament to the game's fluidity. You CAN figure out a different path, you won't be blocked by it. In a sense it's a bit more fun that way. I had to use specific spirit combinations and very tight timing to get where I wanted to go. Woulda been so much easier with triple jump.... haha.\n\nThe visuals speak for itself, I think. The game is beautifully made. Lily and her spirits all have fantastic animations. I do think, however, that it isn't always obvious where you can go or what you can break, at the start. For example, the game never outright teaches you how to break floors that aren't marked by blight. Just gotta figure it out. And further, entering doors or other areas aren't always obvious- the map will tell you, but I think it shouldn't be necessary. There are things you would assume you can jump on, but are background pieces. Not a huge gripe, but it is to be noted.\n\nAll in all, the game is amazing!

It's not possible to get full upgrade of every spirits, so try out the one that fits your playstyle, and focus on those~\n\n[b] Scenery [/b]\nThe environment is very somberly serene. The environment tells as much story as the collectible lore scattered around the place. Take your time whenever possible to soak up the art in the bg~\nThe music is beautifully composed by MILI. Environmental OST accompanied with vocal is quite rare, even more so that fits so well as bg music.

It is nothing groundbreaking, but I enjoyed the sorrowful tale of this decayed world.\n\nCombat and bosses are difficult but fair, learning the patterns of bosses felt rewarding! (There are also saves right before a boss which is [i]so[/i] appreciated) \n \nExploration did get a liiiitle tedious as everytime I got a new ability I would try to get everything I couldn't beforehand (but this may be a me problem) but in the end game I feel like getting everything is very rewarding and in my opinion worth it. \nI did get 100% but it certainty took a good chunk of my play time. The great thing is that the game shows you when there is something still available on the map.\nHowever I will note I felt like some skills were way too late game [spoiler] There are 2 skills that are needed to gain access to some of the final items but being unable to get those items was making me crazy because you can [i]almost[/i] get a lot of them [/spoiler] \n\nOne thing I will note is that I felt like there could have been more platforming puzzles, perhaps this comes from my Hollow Knight experience but I did feel like there were only 2 or 3 of them and I wanted more.\n\nOverall I am very

I liked the implementation of some rpg mechanics (when you kill ennemies you get exp which increase your base damage). If you're a completionist this one is really easy : the map indicate if you've found everything in a given area.\n\n-Story : It has your typical post-apocalyptic/doomed world with clues from item description like your average souls game, but : this game tells a story that is easy to understand and that doesn't leave you wondering what happened and I really liked that.\n\n-Graphics : They are good, at first I thought I wouldn't like the art style but I think it has been really well done, still I find some npc models to be a little weird. A major complaint is that I really wish that the cutscenes were actual cutscenes and not just images, but it doesn't deteriorate the experience.\n\n-Music : It's really beautiful : there's one for an area with a woman humming that I really liked and one for a boss that was a absolutely beautiful violon solo. Those are just two that I loved.\n\nIn conclusion : 9.0/10, I wish it were longer. \n", "timestamp_created": 1690260631, "timestamp_updated": 1690260631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142738078": {"recommendationid": "142738078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194942643", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1240, "last_played": 1690150719}, "language": "english", "review": "Come on, take the bait - FBI", "timestamp_created": 1690253001, "timestamp_updated": 1690253001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142737751": {"recommendationid": "142737751", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057344913", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 982, "last_played": 1690321647}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Horrible, horrible que el juego se termine", "timestamp_created": 1690252455, "timestamp_updated": 1690252455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142729300": {"recommendationid": "142729300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413220985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1549, "last_played": 1690237440}, "language": "english", "review": "What a beautiful game.\n\nAlthough I'm dissatisfied with how boring most of the spirits (skills) are.\nI feel like they could be so much more, both gameplay and lore-wise.\nMost of them are quite conditional, and even so I haven't found their effects to be really useful.\nLoved sending the doggy to deal with enemies for me though.

need to learn how to read each one and know when it's time to dodge or attack.\n\nNearly all attack tells are well telegraphed, some added attacks you will have to learn from fighting (Mage boss 3:rd

only be dodged in certain positions -> if you don't know you likely die from it (Knight boss covers the screen, can't jump over or dodge, need to be behind him to avoid it)\n\nThere are some points i

This game isn't bad, but it's also not really that good.  This is an ungraceful interpretation of the action platformer genre - It's riffing off games that are executing its ideas way better, but it's also fairly competent in its own right.  At the end though, it's highlights don't make up for its many faults.  I played up through the 'bad' ending, though it's unlikely I'll revisit it.\n\nThe theme here is 'Clumsy'.\n\nStarting with its strengths:\n\n[b]Art, Animation and Presentation[/b]\n\nThe assets here are well done.  The 'hand painted' aesthetic is executed well, and the background art is a major strength of the presentation.  The music is above average, with a couple banger tracks mixed in.  The bright and colorful particles effects scattered throughout work as an effective contrast to the otherwise matte tone of the game.  A lot of this works very well and it seems obvious this was a game whose foundation started in 'art'.\n\nLess impressive is the actual animation work, which tends to be very rigid and more haphazard.  Some of the animation work is clearly in service of the art first and the gameplay second; the swing lines don't always match up with hitboxes, etc.  It's not 'bad', but it's an obvious outlier against the assets themselves.\n\nAnimations also fail to sell impact and force very well.  This is also partially a problem with audio design, but these things need to work together to more effectively sell momentum and weight.  This game struggles with this a lot.\n\nContrast is occasionally a problem, where reading what's happening becomes difficult.  Using the Orange Glow as a universal previs mitigated this problem A LOT - well done to whoever made that call - but the problem is not completely remedied due to the relative noisiness of the assets and animation at times.\n\n[b]Building a World[/b]\n\nThe storytelling here is among the places where larger cracks start to form.  I understand folks want to define their world and show it to you, but how much you do this with words needs to be very carefully considered.  There is a sequence where an NPC forces dialog on you, then you pick up a note, then 3 ft later more dialog is forced on you.  This is bad world building - I want to hit shit and you just delivered 3 chunks of exposition with a second of game play in-between them.  This is part of that 'Clumsy\u2122' that is ever-present here.\n\nI want to draw a comparison to Hollow Knight here, which uses exploration and its environment to tell an effective story.  There are a few 'tablets' in the world, and all but a half dozen NPCs who will spew dialog at you, but even with what is but a couple hundred lines of text, it has created a compelling, haunting and deeply engaging world.  Opening the Abyss in Hollow Knight and getting to the bottom is so much more powerful than reading a note you picked up describing it.\n\n[b]Combat Systems - Confused Design[/b]\n\nThe core combat systems are where the Clumsy\u2122 comes to a peak.  This is a 2D action platformer with combat to match - that is to say the majority of the technical elements are expressed by how you move and position yourself ((e.g., SotN, Hollow Knight, etc.) as opposed to how you explicitly respond with your toolkit (Soulslike, DMC).  Moving around the Y-axis is a big part of both how you traverse the world, and you how engage enemies.  In fact, many enemies are actually flying and are inviting you to do combat in the air.\n\nDespite this being the framework being clearly setup here, you have no access to attacks to strike above or below you.  Your default attack can only strike roughly in front of you and while it has a generous hitbox, it's not an adequate substitute for matching your scenario design with a player kit that matches.  Again, it's hard not to draw comparisons to Hollow Knight here, but you can also look at a game like Symphony of the Knight - a game that also lacks a lot of vertical attacking options - but the difference here is the vast, vast majority of enemies are grounded.  SotN's player kit is paired well with its scenarios.  The same cannot be said about Ender Lilies.\n\nBecause of this, combat on sloped terrain is difficult - you can easily swing right over monsters you are right next to on a downhill slope, and you just have to understand to not engage here or to use an extra attack\n\n--\n\nThis game also features a leveling system.  Levels just translate to damage, and so you can convert Time into Player Power which is...not great, but enemies of the same type actually start getting more HP as you advance in the game.  Providing 'Avatar Power' to player via levels is a choice, but to nullifying it by just scaling enemies up with more HP and more damage as you get more HP and more damage is asinine.  This isn't even serving the purpose of having a level system at this point.\n\n[b]Scenarios - Bosses[/b]\n\nBosses are actually a highlight and are generally fun to learn.  They were definitely my favorite part of the game and the feeling of progressing with each attempt was great!  They had generally interesting designs and felt fair and fun.  It is a major strength of this game and probably the tightest aspect of its gameplay.\n\n[b]Scenarios - Everything else[/b]\n\nThe same cannot be said for the world you traverse.\n\nMany enemies in the world are both designed and placed haphazardly.  The level design is not in agreement with the enemy design in ways that allow the player to feel like they are just cheating the entire way through.  For example, attacking enemies from below is a powerful option and enemies frequently have no way to respond to this, making this a risk-free option for players.  Since many places are laid out with several layers of thin floors, this isn't a strategy you can employ on a handful of enemies - this is a strategy that is ever-present and frequently available to players.  Whole scenarios are just compromised by allowing the player to hit mobs through walls and floors while they just stand there.\n\nAnother example:  There is a mob that disappears and reappears behind you before taking a swing.  Instead of fighting them, just find an edge and face the mob.  When they disappear and reappears, they will just reappear on nothing and fall to their deaths.  This particular moment is one where you get to feel clever as a player, but these kinds of issues are so omnipresent in the game that I'm not convinced this was really a designed solution.\n\nThere are also several monsters that fall apart to certain Spirits (spells).  Ranged attacks are readily available and trivialize a non-trivial portion of the world scenarios.  Some allow you to *really* cheat the system and swing several feet through walls and floors.\n\nAgain, this is part of the very Clumsy\u2122 implementation of scenarios in the game.  At its best you feel clever - like you solved a puzzle, but at worst, this ends up being tedious as you spot more and more cracks in the rules of the game.\n\n[b]It could be better.[/b]\n\nThere are a lot of strong Metroidvanias these days, and many of them with a focus on technical combat.  If this was released 10 years ago, I think I would have a lot of great things to say about it but the bar is a lot higher today then it was then.  A lot of the problems on display here were acknowledged and solved long before this game came out.  It's worth saying that none of these problems are necessarily a deal killer per say, but the sum of the problems are a lot to get over if you notice these kinds of things.\n\nThere are too many issues that have been adequately understood and addressed by other games for me to ignore.  The strength of it's boss fights and (most of) it's art direction is not enough to overcome the misses on combat design and world scenarios.  The game isn't overtly bad, but it sure is Clumsy.\n\nIf you are looking for combat-focused Metroidvania to play, then you could do a lot worse then Ender Lilies...but you could do a lot better too.", "timestamp_created": 1690153476, "timestamp_updated": 1690153701, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142669515": {"recommendationid": "142669515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403768780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1692223255}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente Juego pasaras horas y horas buscando el mapa porque no lo tiene sino que debes ir desbloquean el paso.

could be a bit complex but you will get use to it\n- good music though some areas might me a bit apprehensive\n- good story, try spend some of your time reading notes and watching memories\n- if the area is too hard, you can farm more and visit back later.\n- if you max everything but cannot defeat the bosses, just get gud\n\nWhat you gonna experience:\n- one shot some mob\n- get one shot by boss (not likely)\n- get rekt by mob (definitely)\n- successfully dodge the attack\n- successfully dodge the attack, just to get shot by another\n- hit the pot and jackpot will hit you back\n- try different load out, and use the old one if it not good\n- solving some puzzles but when you realize that it is a puzzle, you might solve half of it.\n- go back to solve the remain obstacles after unlock some useful tool\n- go watch youtube when you can't solve it.\n- purify those poor soul, also don't forget to purify yourself since you might lose the sense of time.\n- Finally, the feeling to

In my opinion, only beaten by FTL's OST\n+ Difficulty scales really well, maintaining a constant challenge throughout, while leaving past areas easier\n+ Storytelling is out of this world. The simple cutscenes do their job and the scattered notes tell a vibrant and rich story\n+ Hidden objects kept me scouring every wall for secret rooms and hidden items and lore\n+ Frustratingly, the game always made it feel like it was my fault when I died to a boss... which it absolutely was, never once did I blame the game for something, it was always me who needed to improve.\n\n=== CONS ===\n- Hitboxes make jumping puzzles rough at times\n- Beautiful music made me cry\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nMetroidvania fan?

This may be partially responsible for why there are a few games in existence that had to have been concocted when the developers had a conversation along the lines of let\u2019s make our own version of Dark Souls, but as a 2D metroidvania (Blasphemous and Salt & Sanctuary immediately come to mind). Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights would also be a game that could have been born from such a statement. Ender Lilies follows many of the familiar mainstays of the genre, but also doesn\u2019t want to make it too easy for players to conquer the game.\n\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights begins as a priestess named Lily wakes up in the cellar of a church. She has no memory of life before and it appears she\u2019s the only survivor, at least with her humanity intact. The kingdom of Land\u2019s End is in ruins as a cursed Rain of Death has transformed all people and animals into monsters who will henceforth be referred to as the blighted. Lily is defenseless and rightfully scared as she has no idea what sort of calamity has befallen her homeland. Luckily for her the Umbral Knight appears at the place of her awakening, an immortal guardian who will give his sword as Lily travels the twisted remnants of kingdom.\n\nLily is not a trained fighter. She\u2019s completely defenseless and at the mercy of the blighted. The Umbral Knight is effectively her weapon, as his spectral form will appear to cut down the blighted whenever the player presses the attack button. Lily\u2019s \u201cweapons\u201d come from other spirits she collects on her journey from purifying powerful blighted creatures, oftentimes the corrupted bodies of people that were important in Land\u2019s End or former friends prior to the Rain of Death.\n\nWhile thrust into a savior role, Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights doesn\u2019t simply make a presumably pacifist priestess Rambo when she wakes up and sees the destruction that has befallen her world. Her weapons that she collects are literally the spirits of the purified of blight lending their aid to her. The Umbral Knight, when assigned to one of the three spirit slots, will appear to swing his sword at the press of the attack button. Other souls lend their power in less violent ways but provide a means of traversal, such as navigating underwater or do a horizontal lunge midair. It wouldn\u2019t be a metroidvania if the player didn\u2019t encounter out of reach areas or treasures and had to backtrack after getting a special ability. Other aid may come in the form of an avian familiar that spits fireballs or casting a cloud of poison gas. The spirits that aid Lily serve different functions much as different types of souls may serve as subweapons in some other metroidvanias.\n\nThe story is naturally integral to Ender Lilies but the storytelling approach is minimal, especially by RPG standards. There are a few cutscenes where the Umbral Knight or other spirits of Land\u2019s End may fill Lily in on some of the events of the world, but these are few and far between. Most of the story and history of events is gradually revealed as Lily finds notes scattered throughout her travels. This approach works well for Ender Lilies. The lore is interesting enough where I wanted to learn what happens, but gradually revealing it this way keeps the interest level throughout the game and doesn\u2019t break up the action or exploration.\n\nAs stated earlier, Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights draws influence from Dark Souls and as such players can expect there to be a hefty amount of difficulty. In actuality, Ender Lilies is a challenging but to say it\u2019s as difficult as Dark Souls may be overselling it. Most regular enemies can kill Lilly in three or four hits and most bosses will probably take a few attempts to beat. The challenge is rather high but never feels insurmountable. Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is a good reference for difficulty. Figuring out enemy patterns and how to optimally juggle the different spirits will play a large part in a player\u2019s success. Lilly can also partially restore her health three times between rest points through prayer, mucg like the Estus Flasks in Dark Souls. Prayer does require a few seconds of stationary concentration to work and Lilly is vulnerable to damage during prayer. The map squares don\u2019t do much to tell the player about the layout of each individual map section. Finding all the hidden treasures, power ups and notes does require a lot of exploration to find where every little thing is stashed. The map makes this easier by color coding whether the player has found everything in a particular section.\n\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights is an atmospheric work of art. The fluid animation and art direction make the ruined world a thing of beauty in its desolation. The artists have taken the humans and animals of Land\u2019s End and twisted them into horrific-looking abominations. Something that\u2019s a nice touch in the animation that ties into Lily not being a warrior is when she summons her spirits to fight for her, her animation has her cowering or recoiling in fear, which is a small detail but it does a lot to convey the terror in this terrible world where she has awakened. The soundtrack is a thing of haunting, minimalist and melancholy it\u2019s the perfect audio accompaniment to the Ender Lilies\u2019 visual style. Oddly enough, the score has a relaxing quality to it, which may have been an intentional choice by the developers to help keep players calm during the more difficult sections. During the review I found myself prolonging my time in certain areas due to being enthralled with the music. The difficulty is tempered with the dodge mechanic that\u2019s rather forgiving when it comes to avoiding attacks, as does the rather frequent checkpoints. The game mechanics are smooth, and juggling the different attacks among the two loadouts is limited by player skill and not by faulty game design. Frankly, this could be my favorite metroidvania that wasn\u2019t made with Iga\u2019s involvement.\n\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights is a fantastic metroidvania. It doesn\u2019t do anything to revolutionize the genre, but it does excel at creating at creating a memorable experience that follows the familiar metroidvania template while still being unique. The visual style and amazing soundtrack complement each other well, creating a sense of tranquility in a desolate and horrific world. The challenge hits that sweet spot where the difficulty is high but victory is never out of reach, learning the enemy behaviors and getting an understanding of the collected abilities will allows players who persist to see the story to its end. Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights is a must play for fans of the genre as it\u2019s simply one of the best metroidvanias ever developed.", "timestamp_created": 1689616264, "timestamp_updated": 1689616264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653948783874511719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142278015": {"recommendationid": "142278015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052609310", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2246, "last_played": 1691840315}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best platformers I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1689613182, "timestamp_updated": 1689613182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142259288": {"recommendationid": "142259288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138954393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1316, "last_played": 1689590740}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it.

Personally, I did not find it very difficult, and combat is relatively straightforward, especially compared to other well known games of the same style, e.g. Hollow Knight. Exploration is rewarding, and some manoeuvring challenges are indeed challenging, but mostly doable (with the right items). \n\nLength wise, it is a relatively short game, taking me 20 hours for complete exploration and collection of every item in the game. The soundtrack has been praised as notable, and it is nice, though somewhat repetitive. Aside from obtaining an alternate ending, I do not think it has much replayability; a thorough completion on the first run through essentially allows you to have all play styles, experiencing with various abilities and items. Overall, a nice game to buy when on sale, or full price if you really have that Metroidvania, Hollow Knight style itch. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1689518993, "timestamp_updated": 1689518993,

I love how the story had went too as you progressed through the game.\n\nThe inclusion of the map highlighting if you found all the collectables was a nice touch as well because it can be tedious if backtracking to ensure you found every nook and cranny per area if the map didn't feature this.\n\nProbably the only drawback I have for the game is the \"shield\" gimmick for the enemies that \"break\" them and leave them vulnerable for a short time; the major bosses are fine, but I found mini-bosses and some of the common mobs recover in less than a second, so you're not really left with a proper opening if you took the time to break their \"shield\" HP.\n\nEnder Lilies was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I hope to see more from the developers in the future :)", "timestamp_created": 1689312456, "timestamp_updated": 1689312456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142037121": {"recommendationid": "142037121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068726440", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1527, "last_played": 1689294843}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ci", "timestamp_created": 1689310557, "timestamp_updated": 1689310557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142036272": {"recommendationid": "142036272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050186763", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 462, "last_played": 1689294487}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si", "timestamp_created": 1689309287, "timestamp_updated": 1689309287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142022867": {"recommendationid": "142022867", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063791358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1395, "last_played": 1689290781}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a wonderful game.

The sprawling labyrinth to explore, acquiring new abilities, leveling up, and finding secrets are all present and accounted for. But what sets it apart is the challenging yet enjoyable combat and the plethora of secrets to uncover.\n\nIn the game, I control Lily, a young priestess in a world ravaged by a devastating rain that turned people into undead creatures. Fortunately, Lily has the power to cleanse them, but she's not much of a fighter. That's where the Umbral Knight comes in, serving as Lily's sword and guide. I found the combat satisfying, especially when unleashing combos and upgrading the Knight's moves.\n\nBoss battles were a highlight, and defeating them granted Lily new abilities to access new areas. The game doesn't shy away from difficulty, and I had to be on my toes to survive. Experimenting with different attacks and strategies was key to success, and I enjoyed finding powerful new abilities that turned the tide in battles.\n\nThe map is expansive and divided into visually distinct biomes, each with its own music that sets the mood. Exploring these areas and uncovering secrets was a delight, though some items were a bit too well-hidden for my liking. Still, the game's color-coded map helped track progress.\n\nEnder Lilies doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's a well-crafted experience.

Dark-fantasy metroidvania, a dark and blighted world in which you must maneuver through and help restore; you control a young girl, the white priestess Lily, essentially the beacon of hope and under the protection of the Umbral Knight, you embark. \n\nThe game's thematic exposition is done well and of which may even go hand-in-hand with the gameplay elements. The character you play is Lily, not the spirits, and you command their offensive actions as Lily, so the gameplay is summoner-like; in the beginning all you can do as her is just move and dive around to evade the enemy while you exploit moments of vulnerability with attacks by your spirits. You begin with the Umbral Knight as your only ally at the start and awoken with you, and so your main attack is the basic sword strikes he provides. Basic doesn't mean bad though, he's your bread-and-butter method of attack and thus the main way to \"defend\" Lily on your journey onward, and what else can I say? It's an endearing theme that the deathless knight spirit is there to take care of the young girl. The game in general is about watching your movement to avoid damage and strike first or back, enemies will hit hard.\n\nWith the blight having affected the world, the only \"life\" you encounter are blighted enemies, so in your journey to purify the blight, you'll also encounter enemies to purify; minibosses of each enemy type and bosses will be fought, and on defeat, you'll purify them to finally grant them a release. Upon purification, an aspect of the progression system gets visibly employed as this is how you attain blighted spirits to fight for you. There is a levelling system, and the mooks you fight do boost that, so that is the other aspect. The third is collecting blighted souls; this is a \"currency\" you use to enhance your spirits, most often in large sum from extant corpses of blighted. You'll notice that on Lily's journey is a lot of collection and purification of blighted souls thus. It's a good and fulfilling progression system that ties in very well with how the story handles itself. \n\nWhenever you come across bosses, sometimes they have a brief verbal introduction, but they do always have some final lamenting words on defeat with a cinematic into their memories on their purification. Minibosses have final words too, so it's endearing to eventually acquire these spirits as they're not only your weapons, you do feel them to travel with you as not only do they literally do in their light form, they visually appear when you idle or are at a respite too, so they are able to help you in your journey despite their regrettable ends as having been blighted, though perhaps this is how they can make things better. As maybe one of their ways of thanks, defeating bosses and acquiring their spirits does enhance your abilities to fight, move and break certain walls to explore the map further. \n\nSometimes you get specks of speech from blighted corpses that offer souls as enhancing currency. This, along with the superb visuals of the game and the notes you find along the way are all the ways the game develops its lore and context, and it's done incredibly well; it's non-linear and the exposition is in various places as you go along the game, so it doesn't draw you in super-fast immediately, but as you go along and piece things together, it becomes fulfilling to get what's going on and why. These bosses, these characters, they're all unique not just in how they look with the thanks of the stunning art but as well as what glimpses of their circumstances you see of them. \n\nThe music is no lacking performer either, it's great and an important factor into how one experiences the game with its scenic dreariness, and I have to commend that it managed to give me chills and confuse me for an enemy lurking in the end-game area.\n\nThe rest is best explored and experienced. It's a great game, and a great explorative experience as a dark-fantasy metroidvania. There is difficulty, but it is fun to overcome the challenge with proper movement, combat and progression, and yet it's all thoughtfully done with regards to the setting of the game you're in, and with overcoming such tribulation lets you grant Lily hopefully the best end for all. I bought it on a whim to play on my deck and seemed to have 100%'d it in 9 days, one of the first games I've decided to 100% in a long while so you can take that as you will. It's a strong recommend for anyone who likes metroidvania games with dark-fantasy settings and the endearing aspects of having to help escort a vulnerable protagonist to restore a given-up-on world.", "timestamp_created": 1688758319, "timestamp_updated": 1688758507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141545541": {"recommendationid": "141545541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358284006", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1633, "last_played": 1688757090}, "language": "english", "review": "Banging soundtrack and the story aint half bad.

With its captivating art style and haunting ambiance, it immediately immerses players in a visually mesmerizing world. The melancholic tone set by the soundtrack enhances the overall experience, reminiscent of the beloved NieR series.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Ender Lilies adheres to genre conventions while introducing distinct mechanics. Combat requires precise timing, evasions, and strategic use of spirits obtained throughout the game. The Umbral Knight, the default and most frequently used spirit, serves as the foundation of combat, delivering reliable and efficient slashes. However, the combat lacks depth in terms of combo variation and creativity, potentially leading to repetitive encounters. Although visually impressive, boss fights may not pose a significant challenge to experienced players due to limited patterns and obvious telegraphs.\n\nExploration plays a significant role in the game, with backtracking and discovering new paths as key components of the Metroidvania experience. The rewards for exploration, such as new spirits and items, are well-placed and provide a satisfying sense of accomplishment. The meticulously designed world, from haunting forests to defiled castles, showcases the developers' efforts in creating an enchanting and visually stunning aesthetic.\n\nDespite these strengths, Ender Lilies falls short in terms of narrative development. The story is delivered lightly through scattered diary entries and boss monologues, lacking a cohesive and engaging overarching narrative. This may leave players longing for more depth and connection between the individual tales.\n\nOverall, Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights shines as a visually stunning and atmospheric game that offers a unique take on the genre. While the combat could benefit from more variety and depth, the immersive world, rewarding exploration, and captivating art style make it a standout experience for action-loving fans.", "timestamp_created": 1688737614, "timestamp_updated": 1688737614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693352401256561279", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141509255": {"recommendationid": "141509255", "author": {"steamid": "76561199289891544", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1674740195}, "language": "english", "review": "noice\nneed sequel", "timestamp_created": 1688720201, "timestamp_updated": 1688720201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141503083": {"recommendationid": "141503083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273476313", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1689037415}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Music Ive heard in Gaming\nGood gameplay \nFun Movement\nAMAZING ART\nFun Progression \nGood Level Design \nSolid 8.5/10 maybe it will go up i havent beaten it yet", "timestamp_created": 1688711062, "timestamp_updated": 1688711062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141502130": {"recommendationid": "141502130", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196686856", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1696214754}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la vida me hizo comprarlo pero dios me hizo amarlo\n", "timestamp_created": 1688709676, "timestamp_updated": 1688709676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141498073": {"recommendationid": "141498073", "author": {"steamid": "76561199441367118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1648, "last_played": 1688705300}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first metroidvania game I have played, and it surely blew my mind.

Ender Lilies is a dark and dystopian fantasy universe filled with various monsters and dangers. The graphics is made in a drawn style, that gives a special charm and uniqueness to the game.\n\nThe soundtrack in Ender Lilies is one of its strong points. The music in the game creates the atmosphere of mystery, gloom and emotionality, combining perfectly with the visual style and the plot of the game.\nThe soundtrack consists of original compositions that perfectly convey the mood of each location and event in the game. The music tracks can be dark and intimidating during boss battles, as well as melodic and emotional during exploration and encounters with other characters.\nThe compositions in Ender Lilies often use orchestral instruments such as strings, brass and percussion to create a deep and epic sound experience. Some tracks also contain choral arrangements that add an extra layer of emotion and drama.\nThe musical compositions help immerse players in the game world and enhance the emotional experience.\nOverall, the soundtrack in Ender Lilies is the most important element of the game that adds depth and emotionality to the game experience. It blends perfectly with the visual style and gameplay, making the game even more immersive and appealing to players.\n\nThe gameplay and story in Ender Lilies is noteworthy. Players take on the role of Lily, the last surviving priestess, who travels through the ruined kingdom, battling cursed creatures and freeing their souls. During her journey, Lily meets various characters, each with their own story and helping her on her quest. She also encounters powerful bosses, which are key obstacles on her path to saving the world (the bosses in this game are quite difficult). The plot of Ender Lilies explores themes of loss, loneliness, hope, and redemption. The player will have to uncover the secrets of the past and make difficult decisions that will affect the outcome and finale of the game.\nThe main gameplay feature is that Lily is unable to fight on her own, but can summon and control the souls of defeated enemies. Each soul has unique abilities and combat styles, allowing players to create a variety of combo attacks and strategies.\n\nAdditionally, Ender Lilies offers a variety of locations to explore, including dangerous dungeons, abandoned castles, and gloomy forests. In each area, players will encounter a variety of bosses that present a real challenge and require good strategy and skill.\n\nOverall, Ender Lilies is an engaging game with an appealing visual style, engaging gameplay, exciting atmosphere and music. It promises to deliver a lot of fun to players who love metroidvania and want to immerse themselves in a dark and mysterious world.\n\nPerhaps the review will be supplemented, most likely I will write more about the bosses in the course of further passing of the game.\n\nMy evaluation of this beautiful game is 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1688652219, "timestamp_updated": 1688652219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536694347858428955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141439654": {"recommendationid": "141439654", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049499424", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1695177151}, "language": "english", "review": "I find myself deeply immersed in the ethereal realms of \u201cEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights\u201d for an uninterrupted span of four hours, and it is with unabashed ardor that I express my utter infatuation with this exquisite work of interactive art. From the moment my fingers first graced the controller, I was immediately ensnared by the enchanting narrative tapestry, the resplendent animations that unfolded before my eyes, the entrancing melodies that danced upon my ears, and the overall captivating ambiance that exudes from every pore of this masterpiece.\n\nWhat distinguishes Ender Lilies from its brethren in the realm of Souls-like games is its benevolence, its graceful proclivity to abstain from relentless punishment and instead bestow upon the player a sense of agency and progression devoid of overwhelming tribulations. As an ardent admirer of this genre, I am profoundly grateful for the game's judicious equilibrium between challenge and accessibility, an equilibrium that perpetually captivates my senses and propels me forward with unyielding determination.\n\nOne facet of Ender Lilies that notably elevates the immersive gameplay experience lies in the capacity to acquire and employ the services of other valiant Knights or ethereal spirits as steadfast companions throughout the unfolding odyssey. Their invaluable presence not only imparts profound depth to the intricate tapestry of combat but also engenders a palpable sense of camaraderie and unwavering support, an amalgamation of sentiments that resonate with a resounding sense of fulfillment within the recesses of my being.\n\nHowever, I daresay there exist a couple of minutiae that could potentially benefit from refinement. The animation depicting Lily's evasive drop roll maneuver, though meritorious in its intention, regrettably manifests as an incongruous semblance of a floor-bound jump rather than a seamless and fluid rolling motion. While this peculiarity bears minimal consequence on the gameplay itself, it does somewhat diminish the overall polish that otherwise pervades this opus.\n\nFurthermore, a discerning eye may discern that bolstering one's vitality through the customary process of leveling up does not, in this particular instance, augment one's hit points directly. Instead, the fortification of one's constitution materializes through the unearthing and assimilation of disparate relics, a paradigm which, upon reflection, proves to be a negligible drawback when one considers the multifaceted strategic implications and personalized customization that it engenders.\n\nNotwithstanding these trifling reservations, it becomes indubitably evident that Ender Lilies stands resolute in its pursuit of unrivaled excellence. Its bewitching narrative tapestry, adorned with strokes of intrigue, harmonizes seamlessly with its resplendent artistic manifestation and its sonorous symphony, captivating all senses with its intoxicating allure. This captivating experience has enraptured my very essence, etching an indelible mark upon the core of my being.

While there are strong points to the game, there are so many minor issues that add up and take the fun out of it.\n\nI have played through the game to get all three endings, but I doubt I will ever play it again. It left that kind of taste with me.\n\nMore Detailed Review:\n\nEnder Lilies starts strong. The art is great. The music is solid. As you set off, it feels like it is going to be a great game.\n\nAs you progress and the map opens up, cracks show. The controls float a bit too much for the tense fights and platforming. Your foes quickly fall into three major categories: distance shooters, annoying sword and board, and fast and dirty fragile fighters. When the game wants to punish you, it throws several from each category at you. As you go further, the bosses turn into cheap tactic specialists. While you have a variety of spirits available, only a small selection of them are really useful. \n\nThe game also commits the sin of having a section where the environment slowly poisons you to death if you do not rush through it.  \n\nI rarely say anything about originality in games, since there is so little new in the video game world today. However, Ender Lilies lowers the bar for originality in games. [spoiler]If you have played Hollow Knight and any of the Souls games, you have played better versions of this game.[/spoiler] Combining the trappings of two popular games into a single one may seem like a brilliant plan. Doing so while adding nothing new and highlighting the flaws of both games is not.\n\nPlease, do not take this review the wrong way. The game is not bad.

I'm always a bit suspicious of having little white girls symbolizing purity and then undertaking a journey which uses purity to alleviate suffering of others at the expense of themselves. I don't mean racial commentary but more of a gender-role question: are you really comfortable with that idea of a little girl's journey through apocalypse? Who cares about gender? Fair enough.\n\nMechanic wise, it's not the most innovative but that makes the game more familiar for platformer gamers. Actually, if you have hands you can 100% this game. I'm personally a terrible player and have cleared the story.\n\nGame design wise, the maps are beautiful. The aesthetic truly encourages exploration. Level designs are interesting enough. Some areas are more open while others more funneled. It's got all the traditional, water level, poison level, jumping level. You'll definitely be able to pick out a favorite area where the environment and the enemies tickle your platformer fancy just right\n\nMusic wise, must have. Dude, just listen to it. But also don't forget to play the game.\n\nDid I miss anything?

because i was bored with diablo 4 after its first week of launch. And compared to that $70 disappointment i picked this up while it was on sale. I did not even look at reviews or game-play. But when i say that this game surprised me, that's an understatement. Its art design is beautiful and its enhanced even more by its soundtrack. the game-play is not too hard but it has enough difficulty that its more highlighted in the boss fights. A solid experience that gave me the feel of playing a Platformer, metrovania tied together with a souls like game-play. The one con i had at first was the map since it only highlights the zone but not where your character is located in that zone. but with enough time you begin to remember locations, and coupled with its fast travel system makes it more duable after the first 2 hrs in my opinion. Great game overall with great combat, collectibles, and amazing sound and art design.", "timestamp_created": 1688332255, "timestamp_updated": 1688332255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517786562442779541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141165002": {"recommendationid": "141165002", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126363681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1257, "last_played": 1688330275}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego con una banda sonora muy bonita nada que decir 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1688330385, "timestamp_updated": 1688330385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141155267": {"recommendationid": "141155267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193870301", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1688916043}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty fun metro darksouls like game  bit easy to get lost where to go after a bit", "timestamp_created": 1688322651, "timestamp_updated": 1688322651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141146424": {"recommendationid": "141146424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149628558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1293, "last_played": 1688313877}, "language": "english", "review": "A very enjoyable metroidvania. Short and sweet. If you are experienced the genre, completionist should take you about 20 hours. Some quick points:\n\n- Art is great but a bit dark to match the setting.\n- Exploration is adequately rewarded. Rooms with no more loot are marked gold on the minimap (love that).\n- Backtracking is a tiny bit scuffed in some rooms due to their size and lack of placeable markers in the minimap.\n\n[h1]Combat [/h1]\n\nFor me the game's true treasure is its combat. The game has a posture mechanic that stuns enemies when you deplete it. However, your character being a delicate little girl cannot attack with her own limbs. Instead, you get 6 slots for summons. You find these summons by defeating (purifying) them as bosses/mini-bosses. When you call them, you see the actual spirit attacking and protecting you. Very cool and fits the narrative. It also gives you great customizability in your build. There are basic attack summons with sword, hammer, claws, magic ball, throwing knives, PARRY SUMMON, poison mist, pet bird and more.\n\nOn top of the 6 abilities you get a unique \"full bar attack\" for each basic attack ability (red abilities). Dodging is slow to recover but i-frames feel very fair. There are also relics in the game that you equip for different effects but are mostly basic stuff like tiny hp on hit, more dmg, less dmg etc.\n\nCombat is fluid enough from the start but it gets criminally smooth when you are in control of the flow. This happens when you become familiar with enemy attack patterns (normal enemies have 3 attacks tops but mostly 1-2) and you get some parries and crowd control in.  \n\nOverall 8/10 if Hollow Knight is a 9.99/10.

After played this game and complete one ending, I can say that this game is worth the money.\n\nOf course this review is subjectively contain some bias cause of the Metroidvania and 2D artstyle which I both like. The thing you see alot in the review is the music and visual. For me the music is great and beautiful along with the most importance thing in a game is it fit the atmosphere of the game. The story get delivered by the cutscene and of course the music along with it, I personally cannot talk about the story cause I am the type that enjoy every story no matter how bad it is.\n\nNow for the gameplay. I can say that the gameplay is pretty good, you have your normal jump, attack and dodging like a 2D games but you also have barrier which can nullity an attack and stun an enemy if they melee attack your barrier. This sound great but then you realize that you can just dodging every single attack incoming and yes that include projectile so the barrier is rendering useless. Beside that, you can equip your spirit of the boss in your slot and the game offer six slots which divided into two sets and you can change your set with just a button which is nice and offer a diversity to the gameplay but in my playthough, I only use one set and not touch the second one at all (maybe this will change when I try other ending so I will update this once I fully finished the game). But this is not saying the game is bad, beside those two thing I mention, the rest of the game pretty good, there are many type of enemies and one of them now left me scare every time I see a big pot, the boss of hard but very enjoyable to fight once you learn their moveset. Also, the game let you re-fight the boss you used to defeated before so this game have a high replayability like you can challenge yourself by putting restriction for yourself for certain boss\n \nSo overall, I will give this game a 9/10 cause I bias against 2d and metroidvania also the music is nice", "timestamp_created": 1688269496, "timestamp_updated": 1688269496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141099917": {"recommendationid": "141099917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122019972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1523, "last_played": 1696906105}, "language": "english", "review": "Game good", "timestamp_created": 1688267917, "timestamp_updated": 1688267917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141093367": {"recommendationid": "141093367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102117845", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1689301555}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing, from the atmosphere to the music how it sets up the story telling with the amazing visuals and somber story, this game is the best it can be i don't have any recommendations for this game to be better, besides just more game, i'm giving it the extremely rare 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1688259485, "timestamp_updated": 1688586571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141091672": {"recommendationid": "141091672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056843131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1687631984}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

Now, to answer everyone's first two questions:\n\n[h1]Is this game like Hollow Knight?[/h1]\nExploration and progression are going to feel very familiar, even by general metroidvania standards. Your \"build\" is determined by your spirits (we'll get to that later) and by your relics, the latter of which work essentially the same way as charms in HK, only without the synergy mechanic. However, combat is a bit more slow-paced, more grounded (don't worry, you'll be fighting in the air a lot, but you can't bounce indefinitely like in HK, air movement and ground positioning are equally important; luckily, your grounded options are very good and you'll never feel \"constrained\"), and more RPGesque \u2013 instead of Zelda-style hit points, you have a proper healthbar as well as several stats, both defensive and offensive, that can be increased with collectables and relics. Also, backtracking feels so much smoother, partially because the levels are specifically designed to become easier to travel through as you unlock more powers, and partially because there's simply not as much walking to do due to efficient fast travel and a smaller map; the only issue is the lack of an option to mark certain spots on the map in order to keep track of what you should be looking for when you come back, but it's compensated by the fact that the map shows you whether you've fully completed an area or not. Finally, while the narration is not as cryptic, you'll still have to piece the story together on your own just like in HK or in Dark Souls. Speaking of which...\n\n[h1]Is this game like Dark Souls?[/h1]\nWhile combat revolves heavily around the classic invincible dodge, even more so than around jumping, it's still very distinct from Dark Souls; the pace is much faster, the mobility is much higher, and staggering enemies (think of when you deal a lot of damage to a boss in a short amount of time and they get stunned for a few seconds, except it applies to all enemies) plays a much larger role. That said, learning to recognise the enemies' animations and attack patterns is just as crucial, and once you really get the hang of it, you can start spacing some of them out instead of relying exclusively on i-frames, or parrying them for huge stagger damage. Moreover, managing your health is very important because your heals are also limited, although they can be partially replenished in some areas. However, if I were to pick just one thing that really made me think of Dark Souls \u2013 specifically the first two games \u2013 it'd have to be spirits. These are basically your weapons and spells, you can equip two sets of three spirits at once and switch between them at any time, and most of them have limited uses that, just like heals, can only be replenished at checkpoints or in select locations. Personally, I've always preferred this system to the generic mana bar, so I'm glad the developers decided to implement it this way.\n\n[h1]In conclusion[/h1]\nWhile the inspiration from their predecessors is clear, I think the developers have done an excellent job improving on both formulas, and ultimately giving this game its own unique identity.

It took the fundamentals, gave it a Nier and Dark Souls coat, but did not call it a day.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe first thing that normally caught one's eye are the visuals, and they are extremely important for Ender Lilies. It takes the innocence and typical barrier maiden tropes for the main character, clothes her in white and combines it by her standing with these monsters which embody different tropes in a zombified state.\nEnder Lilies has this 90s comic book charm of these overexaggerated works that want to be edgy, yet contrasts it with at times beautiful backgrounds which make in terms of world building less sense than they should. Although one arguably will never care as the atmosphere captures the individual while playing and only in retrospective such questions may be asked. \nThe post-apocalyptic look creates a visual style which is known from games like the Dark Souls series and executes well on how a world breaks down over time and which elements may remain and even stay beautiful. It is difficult to stress how well Ender Lilies does that, especially in its (rare) mostly monochrome and simple cutscenes with a great sense of direction to back up the substance which the game has. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nNow we are getting to the game part. Ender Lilies is a very basic metroidvania with the staples of the genre. Dash, double jump, wall climb and so on.\nThe movement feels a little weighty, but it makes sense in the context of the game as the main character is only a little girl. Who gets progressively weaker as her body breaks down, and your spirits quite literally have to do the heavy lifting. This dichotomy of how physically vulnerable you are and how much they need your willpower to even have conscience is quite beautiful and works well in the game. \nEnder Lilies has three distinctive gameplay loops in the most essential metroidvania fashion imaginable. \nThe first one is to traverse the area, and loot what you can get. \nAfter that it is about slaying the boss.\nFinally, you collect the stuff to power up with the upgrade you obtained. \nVery basic, still satisfying.\nThe boss fights embody different archetypes of enemies already fought in the game, but their move sets are pushed to the boundaries of what the game allows which makes for good fights. \nBosses are by far the best part of the game as they perfectly hover between being not too easy, but also not being frustrating. \nEspecially the early game is relatively unforgiving in typical metroidvania fashion, and it is important if one wants to enjoy the game, that a certain focus or mindset is needed to push through this early game. Keep in mind that not every enemy need to be fought. Just reach the next bench. \nThere are times when the game takes its concepts and uses them creatively, especially with its platforming that can be quite challenging in the endgame, if you want to find every lootable object. These are relatively rare though, and it marks the biggest \u201cproblem\u201d with Ender Lilies. \nThe game has no really original ideas or gameplay mechanics that make it stand out. \nOn the Shoulders of Giants\nThere is some clear inspiration from the metroidvania influx after Hollow Knight revived the genre. The level design, areas, relic system and so on are all carbon copies. Even some narrative beats are shared between these two games. \nThere is some clear inspiration and Ender Lilies does not hide in any game, but executes it well enough that it is not too obvious. Yet, there is this unfavorable comparison to be made:\nEnder Lilies is weaker than its biggest inspiration in every way, except for the music and maybe the story.\nIf you want to play a masterpiece, then Hollow Knight is your best pick. But after that?\nMaybe Bloodstained. And when you compare Bloodstained and Ender Lilies, I think Ender Lilies is going to make the cut, depending on your preferences of course.\n\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\nNow this is where the game shines. The downtrodden world with these masses of zombified enemies which showcase the different life circumstances of the inhabitants and how they got hit with the plague of this game.\nThere are many small touches to areas, and it showcases that the developers tried to make the game dense, despite not having limitless resources. And they absolutely succeeded. Even enemy repetition is never a problem as they are being used in different scenarios. As such it never becomes a slog to play through and keeps the player focussed and immersed.\nThe exposition dumps via collectibles or after clearing a boss are quite good and ask as many questions as they answer. Lore-wise Ender Lilies is not overly complicated, and every set piece gets exactly as explained as it needs to be. \nAll of these elements peaks, when the music hits just right. Ender Lilies soundtrack is phenomenal and used to great effect to characterize your surroundings and give them distinctive identities.\nThe music is nothing less than masterpiece quality and will definitely be the most memorable part of the game of anyone who starts it. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nEnder Lilies is not going to change your world or revolutionize what you understand under the word metroidvania. But it will offer you a great gameplay experience after an admittedly hard early game. Keep at it, and you will see some pure metroidvania essence, polished to a great degree. \n\n[quote=author]\nAs of now, meme curators dominate Steam.

Fantastic OST, great combat, deeply depressing setting and tone that's all about death and decay. I love it.\n\nYou play as a child named Lily, pretty much the last hope for an already long dead world, woken up by a soldiers spirit that's sworn to protect her lineage. At first Lily can't do much but jump, command the soldier to swing his sword and \"dodge\" not so gracefully, she literally just dives headfirst into the dirt and it's the cutest dodge I've ever seen. \n\nCombat is fast but most enemies won't be too challenging, but the bosses, my lord the bosses. Talk about difficulty spikes. If normal enemies test your combat skills then bosses test your will to live. Some of them aren't too bad, but some like [REDACTED] is the game crossing its arms and going \"No.\" I never felt like i had to grind to beat them, just focus or try a new tactic, but they demand you pay attention.\n\nYou do have plenty of options in combat though, Lily can command several spirits at once that can cause pain in various ways. For the sake of simplicity I'll refer to them as \"stagnant\" and \"furious\" spirits. You can \"equip\" any three of them at one time when taking a rest, some of them have infinite use and some finite. The finite charges are restored when resting so you're not gonna need to ever grind. \n\nAll spirits can be levelled up and as you might expect, get better in various ways. Chances are you'll find whichever spirits suit you and stick with those, i did. I do recommend you save up the material you need to upgrade spirits until you find your favourites, you're not going to find unlimited material on one playthrough. \n\nI've done two playthroughs, with the second one i 100%'ed the game with a total of about 41 hours, so it's not that long of a game which i think is good cause there isn't any filler, it's a really straight forward game with some optional areas to explore if you want to. Every map you get to has something worth finding, more of less. There's plenty of mini bosses spread all over which rewards you with new spirits.\n\nThere are multiple endings in a very \"Nier automata\" style, most of which basically tell you \"Yo, you're not done,\" and hint at where the \"truth lie.\" \n\nIn summary Give sequel please.", "timestamp_created": 1687969592, "timestamp_updated": 1687970281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I like that the main character isn't the one actually doing the fighting (at least physically).  It's very much how I wish summoner styled classes and characters played in other games.  \n\nI'm a fan of world settings where it's after some catastrophic event and the world your exploring is one that's either on it's last legs or has already fallen.  There's a kind of \"peace\" I feel as I progress and read all the lore items I pick up and piece together what happened.  It's one of my favorite parts of games like Dark Souls.  I've long grown tired of being bombarded with quest after quest and cutscene after cutscene.  This game has cutscenes but there aren't a ton of them, their usage makes sense and is usually reserved for things like after a boss.\n\nThis games soundtrack really helps set the tone of it's areas.  Sometimes I'd find myself stop moving through the level just to sit there for a minute and listen, and even going back to certain areas later not because I needed to backtrack there to get something but just because I was in the mood to hear the music.\n\nI'd say that combat is overall pretty good.  You have 6 slots for your different attacks, 2 sets of 3.  You can either hold a button to swap between the first and 2nd set, or you can have it be a toggle.  My only complaint about this is that if you have a skill that has one of the spirits passively attack with you on one set, and you switch sets to use a skill briefly and switch back it unsummons the passive spirit but that's not a huge deal.  You don't have a guard in this game, but there are two different spirits that function as parries that have follow up attacks, and you get an upgrade later that gives you another parry that isn't tied to a spirit.  The dodge in this game does get an upgrade later on but the default dodge is suprisingly good, you can reliably use it to i-frame through attacks and to go through enemies to get behind them.\n\nThe exploration is pretty good, obviously since it's a metroidvania it has backtracking as you get new movement abilities and stuff, but I didn't really find it to be that bad because of the map.  When every collectible is picked up in an area, that area turns yellow on the map, when there's still stuff to collect it's blue.  You unlock fast travel between rest areas pretty early on, so if you need to back track it's generally not an ordeal.\n\nCharacter progression was fairly straightforward to the point I didn't really have to think about it that much.  I never really had any points where I felt like I had to grind or farm,  it always felt like I could just try a different set of spirits of put on different relics whenever I had trouble fighting a boss.  You can ignore your level for the whole game, it's not very important since it's just stat increases, all the important choices come down to your relics.  Relics work on a \"cost\" system where relics use up anywhere between 0 to 4 \"cost\".  As you explore you'll find items that gives you +1 to your total cost.  Items with stronger effects generally cost more.  You can put on multiple relics of the same effect as long as you have enough cost, so you don't really have cases of one just being simply better.\n\nMy only real complaints for the game are two things, one of which isn't exclusive to it.\nI absolutely hate \"contact damage\" in games.  The enemy walking into me shouldn't do basically the same damage as one of it's attacks.  When contact damage exists, I stop seeing enemies as a living thing in the world but as a walking hurtbox.  It's something that incentivises \"safe\" play styles.  If you play aggressive and with mostly melee, you'll find a lot of times where you get hit not because of an attack, but the enemy bumping into you, sometimes it'll be because you dodged an attack, but because of the attack their body is now ontop of you so the instant your dodge ends you get contact damage.\n\nThe other thing which is that a there's like, 3 areas where to reach certain things you need to use specific spirits.  Normally in a metroidvania this wouldn't be an issue, but in this game, for about 90% of it, every time you hit a point where you can't get somewhere, it's because you need to kill a main boss and get a new movement tool from it.  The reason this is an issue is because up until this point, every movement you've gotten as an upgrade has been passive, you always have it regardless of what spirits you're using, and these last 3 areas, you need at least 1 of 2 spirits you get near the end of the game.  The problem is that because of how it was handled earlier, it's reasonable to just think you needed to go kill another main boss, but these 2 spirits are sidebosses that are entirely skippable, and you can be in a situation where you've already killed the final boss and haven't even seen these 2.  If you didn't have 90% of the game need these 2 spirits for their slight movement, why not just have made it 100% and just have them be optional movement tools, rather than have stuff that literally isn't doable without them?\n\nI have no idea how to do proper formatting on steam so to anyone that actually read all of this, sorry about that and sorry for rambling.  Overall, I had a really fun time with the game, other than two gripes, and the only things I could really ask for are obviously \"more\", and to be able to play the game again blind.  The price for the game is pretty fair for how solid of an experience it was, and even more so if you get it on sale.  I didn't mention this early because I didn't think of it, but I don't think I encountered a single bug, which is a little surprising these days.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1687910758, "timestamp_updated": 1687910758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675123751163482666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140819134": {"recommendationid": "140819134", "author": {"steamid": "76561199245685245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "playtime_at_review": 744, "last_played": 1700074373}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego! una obra de arte a nivel visual! y la jugabilidad ni se diga!", "timestamp_created": 1687908863, "timestamp_updated": 1687908863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140818069": {"recommendationid": "140818069", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056713654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1502, "last_played": 1687906879}, "language": "english", "review": "While the game's movement might seem clunky at first, once you adjust it becomes incredibly fun to explore and fight.

It's not terribly difficult, for instance, and the developers seem to have made the experience as non-frustrating as possible.\n\nThat goes back to respecting your time. In souls-games, dying is meant to be a setback or to invoke tension. \"What if I die before getting back to my 'insert odd currency here'?\" You don't lose anything for dying here, though. You just get sent quickly back to the last checkpoint you were at. which are abundant and serve as fast-travel hubs, and you don't even lose any progression that you achieved before dying. You can also just warp back to the last checkpoint whenever you want, like having infinite homeward bones.\n\nHeck, the game even lacks many achievements that you might expect. For instance, there's a boss rush mode unlocked at the end of the game, but no achievement tied to completing it. Or leveling all of your spirits to max, which would be quite the chore. There isn't even an achievement for beating newgame+. There is one for getting to level 100, but I only ended up needing to grind for the last ten and it still only took half an hour. It's as if they chose to exclude achievements that would have been too time consuming as to not waste the time of compulsive achievement hunters.\n\nEven the map handily shows you the rooms that do and don't still have stuff to find in, so frantic searching for those last few pesky collectibles won't be a part of the experience. \n\nAll this, along with the forgiving death and frequent respite points might make people think the game is too easy, but it is still a fair challenge, just not obscenely so, and, like I said, respects your time. It took me sixteen hours to 100% it, and none of that time felt frustrating, which, as someone with limited time to play games, I appreciate.\n\nIf you want a polished, compact, game with good art, music, and a decent story, this is a good purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1687810950, "timestamp_updated": 1687810950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140750012": {"recommendationid": "140750012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178605013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1568, "last_played": 1687789701}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant metroidvania, one of my all time favorites.\nFrom visuals, audio, gameplay and story everything is top notch.\nHad a blast playing it.\nIt was long enough but I was still sorry when it was over.\n", "timestamp_created": 1687807298, "timestamp_updated": 1687807298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140748782": {"recommendationid": "140748782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042114703", "num_games_owned": 580, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1688196723}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really on the fence about this review. If you're seeing this you can consider it more of a neutral review.\n\nPositives:\nMusic is fantastic. \nThe overall movement between levels is really well done.\nEnemy layouts are pretty well thought out IMO making traversing rooms a good balance of difficulty and ease depending on the situation.\nStory was relatively simplistic, but not bad.\n\nNeutral:\nThis took roughly 9 hours to complete endings A+B (final boss). Everything else is just purely backtracking through stages for completionism. \nOn that note, this game requires A LOT of backtracking. For this style of game it's not the end of the world. Just know what you're getting into. If you're coming into this game because it's sold as a souls-like it might get annoying.\nCost was about $1.5 / 1hr of gameplay on sale. I'd say this is neutral for a game like this. \n\nNegatives: \nThe absolute most frustrating part of the game is the hitboxes. You spend more time dodging the hitboxes of enemies than dodging their attacks. Some enemies have huge hitboxes. In the same way they say the camera is the greatest enemy in dark souls, the hitbox is the greatest enemy of this game. You can be charging up an attack and a random enemy from off screen casually walks into you for 50% of your HP. \nOne boss has 5-6 minions with huge hitboxes that teleport around the map randomly before attacking. This can create situations where you can't move because there's a wall of hitboxes blocking your way. Most bosses have a backstep meaning that even if you successfully dodge their attack, get to their blindspot, and attack, they can just \"dodge\" and run over you with their hitbox. \nIt may have been more apt to skin all these enemies as monster trucks and the game is just about avoiding monster trucks from running over you.\nBoss healthbars are fairly large. Paired with one boss that sits there blocking for 5 minutes for the first phase of the fight, makes for an incredibly long and tedious fight. \nParrying is useless in this game. Boss interrupts don't exist in this game. Using ring parry just gets you launched to narnia meaning you lose DPS running back across the arena. Using spirit parries is incredibly underwhelming. Low damage, no interrupts, high cooldown. Extremely underwhelming gameplay to spirit parry a hit only to get hit by a follow up attack while you're mid animation. \nI'm not a very good gamer but most bosses only took 1-3 tries including the ending B fight. I did not do any backtracking for equipment / levels either, and only 7 relic slots / lv66 by the time of completion.\n\n\nEdit: \nPeople have mentioned that NG+ improves boss patterns. I started NG+ and it doesn't seem that there's much appreciable change. Bosses certainly attack more and add 1-2 attacks to their repertoire but the fights are still stupidly easy, just they take longer because bosses now have more AOE to attacks, leaving you with less opening.", "timestamp_created": 1687805810, "timestamp_updated": 1688197140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470085442066192627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140747132": {"recommendationid": "140747132", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036244369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1687479346}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely one of the better metroidvania games I've played, and would recommend this with its unique gothic style alone.

I saw this game having a steam sale and bought it on a whim. Honestly just by looking at the trailers and pictures I thought that I might play the game for a bit but soon quit the game. Little to my surprise this game actually turned out to be one of my favorite games I have ever played. From art style to music direction this game is able to bring it all together to create a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere.\n\nAtmosphere, 10/10 (JUST LIKE DARK SOULS FR!)\nThe game starts off with the main character being awoken by the spirit of a knight. You wake up with no recollection of who you are or where you are. However, the spirit compels you to leave the structure with his aid. As you exit the cathedral you run into some sort of amalgamation of something that may once be human or animal. The spirit helps you get past them and once you exit the building, you find a desolate landscape with no signs of life besides the groans and cries of who knows what is out there... This is how the game opens, the player has just been dropped into the middle of no where with no backstory and its your job to find out what is happening and how to stop it. As you continue on your search, the game shows many vast different areas from the death-filled catacombs to a whimsical magical forest. As you travel to each area, the environment tells a story be it through the tattered and broken down buildings or the uprooted forest you are able to see a story unfold, one of despair or one of melancholy.  What's more is that the music all fits each area! Onto the next.\n\nMusic 11/10\nI am a tad bit bias when it comes to the music for this game. The music for this game is entirely made and composed by Mili. Mili is very well known for their song rightfully that was made to be the opening for Goblin slayer. They also made some of the music for Library of Ruina, which if you don't know what it is I suggest you take a look! Mili was able to enhance each environment by adding the most practically fitting music I could possibly think of. Each soundtrack is able to create a new atmosphere for each environment or at least enchance it. Not much else to be said here. LISTEN TO MILI NOW! IRON LOTUS!!!!! GONE ANGELS!!!!!!!\n\nStory 10/10\nAh what to say about the story, I personally loved it. It is however told in fragments, so to uncover the story you will need to piece together the information yourself. I do like this type of storytelling however to some this may seem like a con. Don't let this sway you from buying the game however as the story itself is very well made. Throughout the game, for every boss you killed you are able to uncover a bit of the story through memories. How it came this way, what happened, and so on.\n\nGameplay 9.5/10\nThe game gives you 2 \"loadouts\" to put your spirits into I like this feature of the game being able to pick and choose what you use without overwhelming yourself with control. The game also has you mixup the spirits you use when you fight each different boss and each area allows you to slowly build up your arsenal!\n\nConclusion:\nHonestly, I suggest you buy this game no matter what type of game you like. It's a great way to start metroidvanias being relatively easy to beat and 100% as well as being extremely forgiving.

I don't know why people love this.  Movement is slow and stilted, attacking removes all momentum from your character even when attacking in the air.  There is no reasonable hit stun on enemies and your character gets animation locked.  Hope you like dodge rolling because they have you doing that right off the bat.  Oh, and slowly jogging through the map.  I played all of 6 minutes and that was enough to tell me I would absolutely hate this game.  You can claim I didn't play enough, but if I'm this irritated with the controls in the first 6 minutes, there is no way I am giving it more time.  This isn't button placement, and I was already using a gamepad,  It just feels terrible to move the character around, and it feels terrible to attack.  Just another Metroidvania plagued by terrible controls that people love because they think it's fun for enemies to ignore everything you do.  (I don't care if there is a weapon later in the game that actually causes stun, the feedback at the beginning of the game is terrible.  I can only imagine the people giving it positive reviews enjoy memorizing attack patterns of every enemy in the game and care more about length than quality.\n\nEnemies ignoring your hits is not good combat.  Long grindy combat is not good combat.  Terrible controls that you're fighting to get to do what you want is not good combat.  Yes, they make the game take longer, but it feels terrible to play.\n\nI really wish people would stop calling games like this Metroidvania.  This is more \"side scrolling dark souls\" as both Metroid and Castlevania largely understood pacing, fun combat, and smooth animations.  Long fights were used to show you what zones you aren't ready for (and honestly in later installments got really hand-holding)  Both Metroid and Castlevania have hit feedback from the monsters, have momentum carry you through, and are more about exploration and boss fights than generic unit combat.  This is the opposite of all of that.  \n\nIt's fine to like something like this, but it's not a metroid game, and it doesn't feel like castlevania.  Bloodstained Ritual of the Night feels like Castlevania.  The game is actually fun to play because it uses what Castlevania does great.  It's not about getting \"hours\" of play time, because if that playtime is terrible and boring, who cares.\n\nA lot of people don't mind that stuff.

Protagonis gim ini bernama Lily dia seorang White Priestess yang hilang ingatan dan bangun di dalam kastil. jujur, saat pertama kali melihat cutscene sangat terkejut bahwa Lily ini adalah karakter representasi dari pikiranku selama ini. ( aku sangat ingin melihat dimana ada gim dengan karakter perempuan berambut putih dan serba putih nan anggun seperti 2B sayang kurang memenuhi ekspetasi pikiranku. kupikir aku ingin melihat sosok karakter 'White Queen' dalam sebuah gim wkwk.)

With that out of the way though, I want to say that Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights is an absolutely phenomenal game in several aspects and well worth a try.\n\nFirst let's discuss the visual and auditory design. This game, simply put, looks and sounds incredible. The landscape and entity designs are done extremely well and are very pleasing to just stop and stare at when you have a moment. Everything truly looks and feels the part of being in this decrepit and somber world while also maintaining compelling and interesting designs. And these beautiful set pieces are accompanied by a stunning OST; each area has a main theme with bosses having their own themes. The OST alone is incredible, but each track really helps lay down the vibe and mood of whatever it is you happen to be doing at the moment depending on the area. Props go out to the teams in charge of these aspects.\n\nNow with all of that said, great design doesn't mean that much without good gameplay right? Well, in that regard I believe that Ender Lilies is...pretty good. I would not say fantastic; a lot of animations lock you into them for a bit too long (which some enemies will ruthlessly punish if you want to use those powers), the guarding option feels too weak in a lot of cases (either putting you in disadvantage even if it works or being too precise to really slot into your attacks), some of the movement for puzzle solving does not feel intuitive (though this was like 3-ish times throughout the whole game), and there's a distinct lack of good anti-air attack options that don't have very limited ammo (which I wouldn't normally complain about, but there's also a decent amount of enemies that fly around that can be hard to chase down in the air horizontally). A smaller nitpick that I also have is that your jump-based vertical mobility doesn't really change that much from the start, which wasn't really a problem but was definitely weird that there was absolutely nothing else to get for that. Other than that though, the world exploration and combat was not bad at all and both eases you into concepts that you'll run into later and gives you plenty of chances to test out whatever you get before the next area and difficulty (minus one area I'm sure most players know about...). As previously mentioned air combat mostly sucks, but ground or low air combat is great, and there's plenty of different powers to get that facilitate a wide variety of play styles depending on what you want to use. Something I will additionally note in regards to the world exploration is that there's actually quite a lot that you can reach without certain power-ups if you can figure out how to use the powers you do have effectively (there's at least 2 areas I cheesed the intended strategy with clever use of spaced air lag and recoil from an attack); this game also values freedom of progression, as for the most part you can do any of the areas in whatever order you choose (though granted some areas will only be unlocked by beating the pre-requisite ones to my knowledge). So again, not amazing gameplay (and probably rougher than usual for metroidvania players) but I think it's perfectly serviceable with a fair amount of difficulty and freedom.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is the story; now while I'm not gonna spoil anything, I should note that the story is less told to you and more discovered in the form of notes and memories. Very little is directly \"explained\" to the player and is more inferred until you get more context as you progress. Despite this however, I feel that the story of Ender Lilies is one of the strongest parts of the game, giving you just enough background to really feel the situation that these characters found themselves in. It's truly worth the time and effort to fully piece together that story.\n\nAs for my final review, I believe that this game is quite a treasure; it has a riveting story, pretty good gameplay, and amazing aesthetic brought to life by gorgeous art and stellar music. I'm not sure if it's a great metroidvania, but if you are looking for a good game to sink some hours into I would definitely recommend at least trying this game out for yourself.\n\nEDIT: Forgot the final score: 9.5/10. 100%'d and would definitely play again.", "timestamp_created": 1687166043, "timestamp_updated": 1687166577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776761949062347412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140311319": {"recommendationid": "140311319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800690794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1690163355}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy entretenido y fiel a sus generos, totalmente recomendable!", "timestamp_created": 1687140373, "timestamp_updated": 1687140373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140301307": {"recommendationid": "140301307", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992491535", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1097, "last_played": 1687123333}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1687123399, "timestamp_updated": 1687123399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484251976013183594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140296388": {"recommendationid": "140296388", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387468770", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1827, "last_played": 1693940165}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutly stunning game!! the visuals and the stories of each character brought me to tears.

But this is one of the best metroidvanias on the market, and is just under Hollow knight for me.\n\nThe highest reccomendations for this game.\n\n(Also Lily is very cute)", "timestamp_created": 1687051643, "timestamp_updated": 1687051691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490018129348754883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140225151": {"recommendationid": "140225151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310730434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1114, "last_played": 1687018476}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1687018628, "timestamp_updated": 1687018628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140215248": {"recommendationid": "140215248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002263581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1687019973}, "language": "english", "review": "Another fabulous metroidvania second to Hollow Knight", "timestamp_created": 1687007136, "timestamp_updated": 1687007136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140205195": {"recommendationid": "140205195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095836848", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 7599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3393, "last_played": 1697213748}, "language": "english", "review": "Game design motion picture very pretty game.

You play as a small girl who is trying to stop the blight, a sort of \"The Last of Us\" fungus that makes everything insane and immortal. You fight and jump through boxy rooms smashing enemies and levelling up, interspersed with boss fights. The bosses are generally very good - although there are huge spikes in difficulty. Most bosses I killed in 2-3 attempts, but there were two which took me over an hour each. By defeating bosses, you gain traversal moves and combat abilities which you can swap out at every safe point. I did end up completely finishing it, but the story and cutscenes are bad - possibly due to lacklustre translation.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- An interesting thing about that game is that your character doesn't actually do any of the work. When you attack, you temporarily summon a spirit who attacks for you, and you sort of shy away\n- Instead of always having all abilities, you choose 6, and you can use 3 at a time, switching between sets\n- Spirits can be levelled up to make them more effective, increase combos\n- Some spirits are more effective than others in certain situations, so the main trick to bosses is working out which spirits would be best\n- Bosses unlock permanent abilities like double jump, and unlock that spirit with a special move. For example, the first boss unlocks a mac swing attack. Annoying that they're limited uses between benches\n- You can fast travel to any visited bench\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- The cutscenes and story are junk\n- The level design is very boring\n- Takes a really long time to get interesting\n- Really annoying, repetitive music\n- Levels. Enemies give XP\n- Just like Hollow Knight / Dark Souls, there are relics (charms), a number of times you can heal between rest points, and resting brings back all the enemies\n- Your character stops moving every time you attack, which makes combat feel very static\n- The UI, or the attack values are bugged. When I was level 85, my attack was 175. Level 86 it was 209. Level 87, back to 179.

"language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, good story telling, incredibly fun combat mechanics and a proper metroidvania experience. The music is exceptional and the world is morbidly beautiful (with incredible artwork all round). Boss fights are fun and not frustrating, and there are a lot of QoL benefits -- like not needing to replay the game to see all endings, a nifty map color scheme for showing you rooms you've not completed, permanently unlocked warping between checkpoints, etc. The game also has a variety of equip-able attacks/spells, so you can really match your gear and loadout with your playstyle (go smash with big hammer, pew pew with long range magic, in and out with agile swords, etc. and combinations thereof).\nIt's a very similar experience to Hollow Knight (in terms of world building and high level gameplay), but in a good way. The combat mechanics are fairly different; if you liked Hollow Knight, you'll definitely like this.\n\nCouple of small gripes: There are a couple of occasionally clunky movements and combat techniques. The boss fights were not all that challenging even for a first play through. I don't think any boss took more than 10 attempts to beat (with a large majority taking under 5 attempts, including the last few bosses). Map is kind of clunky and you can't easily look at room names unless you're at a respite (checkpoint/safe zone).\n\nOverall: Excellent game with super fun gameplay, great music and art.

And I can say this.\n\nThis game is universally praised in the art, music, atmosphere, and story. They are PHENOMENAL and I cannot stress this enough. However, that aside, there are some people that don't mesh with the combat and level design. And while I can understand why some of the fights/areas could turn people off, this game is an absolute home run for me.\n\nThis game is hard. This game doesn't walk you through where you're supposed to go. Most Metroidvanias don't, but you can 100% find your way into an area that is non linear and much too difficult for you. I also find it very VERY similar to From Soft games in terms of combat. I think this is where some people find issues with the combat in the game. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, I'M NOT GATE KEEPING DIFFICULTY. I genuinely don't think this game requires you to 'git gud' but it does require you to think. You will acquire spirits throughout the game and most of them will be useful in some situations, but there will be the core 5-6 that you rely on. I think that since some spirits require you to explore optional areas to find, some players could miss them and those spirits would be a LOT of help during some encounters. There is a charge mechanic where some spirits truly shine during their charge attack. All this being said, the areas are difficult, and the bosses get HARD. If this turns you off of the combat, that is perfectly understandable. For me however, I'm glad they didn't shy away on the difficulty aspect of it. Overcoming difficulty is always going to elicit a good feeling, but this game makes it feel like a whole cinematic fight when you finally get it right. Shout out to [spoiler]Ulv[/spoiler] for being far and away my favorite fight and soundtrack.\n\nThe movement in this game isn't extraordinary, but even starting the game I was trying to use attacks to slightly lift me up after a jump to try and get somewhere that I shouldn't be able to get to yet. That feeling persisted throughout the entire game and I loved every second of it. That being said it is fairly conservative in how many movement options it gives you.\n\nIf this game even slightly interests you, AT LEAST buy it on sale.

I played the first 7 hours of a 16 hour playthrough and literally stopped playing it for a couple years (partly because I forgot) because the story really got to me. That's not to say it's a bad thing - I resonated with this game more strongly than some people, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, the rest of the game is fantastic. I've played a gamut of Metroid-likes and true Metroidvanias like Symphony of the Night, so the gameplay wasn't overly unfamiliar. The fights are well-paced, barring one boss who is meant to be a game of patience, and the weapons and skills are nicely varied. Some of the common enemies are way more annoying than they need to be, and some have hitboxes that come out too quickly, but true to the genre, you don't have to fight EVERYTHING, especially since there are no drops to worry about.\n\nThe music and artwork complement each other perfectly. The music tends towards sad and somber, but has some darker tones for the boss fights. The artwork and scenery are beautiful: while the enemies are grotesque and the world itself is beaten down, there are bits and pieces that show you how the world used to look.\n\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It can be tough in places and grinding for levels doesn't always help, but the game never felt unfair.

The art in this game is amazing as are the controls.  The game also has excellent QOL features including:\n\n  - An excellent map that divides the game into \"cells\".  Each cell is colored blue or orange to tell you if you have collected every item in that area.  There are also red dots that show the presence of doorways that have not yet been taken.  It's a great mix of abstract and usefulness.\n  - The only penalty for dying is that you go back to the last rest site.  It's quite refreshing to not lose something and the game has enough challenge that this does not make the game too easy.  It also means there is no penalty in pushing ahead on little remaining health, which can be fun too.\n  - Great enemy design where sloppy play leads to taking quite a bit of damage but playing attentively allows most enemies to be defeated without taking damage (similar to dark souls)\n  - Teleport between rest site from the start.  Return to the last rest site at any time.  These things improve exploration efficiency.\n  - Enemies stay defeated until you rest. Thus there is no enemy-respawn penalty to leaving an area and returning later, as long as you didn't rest.\n\nFor me the only slight downside is that there are so many skills/weapons to choose from but they are expensive to upgrade, so I played though most of the game with just a few.  Having upgrades cover all weapon types would make it possible to experiment with them more.\n\nI'll also mention that I has zero crashes or other technical problems.

U travel across the map and return to locations after u collected more skills and experience. Depending on how u view it, It can frustrate u that u cannot slove this puzzle or more specifically blocked way because u havent been into the game far enough yet, but once u realize thats part of the game, it gets really fun because when u unlock certain skills u will have a neuron activation when remembering that u can finally cross this one area of the game or finally collect this piece of item. U can even choose after the prologue which area u wanna explore first so u are not forced to go through areas that u might not like. The further u explore the more choices u will have where to continue, it gets quite overwhelming at a certain point because u can explore so many areas but it makes u very excited and more curious to keep playing.\n\nThere are many different areas of the game and it makes u wonder if theres even an end. Therefore, there are various enemies u will meet and beat. The combat is simple and can get quite repetitive if u go across the same area. But the other half of the game is exploring. Because the combat is simple, its relatively easy to make mistakes at times. It may sound kinda confusing but u will see for urself.\n\nThere are Bosses aswell of course. The further u dive into the game the more unique the bosses get. Always more different compared to last one. The skill ceiling has great heights, u are easily aware of ur improvements mid-battle because of the simplicity of the combat. U will die multiple times when fighting bosses, u will probably clear the first one without death when u have some understanding and skills from similar games. But after that u need to learn the bosses and try to minimize ur mistakes. U will also learn strategies on how to fight the bosses along the way.\n\nIts important to keep the lore in mind because this is also what the game is about. Try to get into it, but u wont have the full picture even after completing the game. There are very great videos of explaining the lore and they dont take that long.\nThere are multiple endings in the game and u can reach all of them in one playthrough.\n\nThe game also wants u to use \"not intented\" moves to reach areas and find items which is such a rewarding and satisfying feeling. I had to watch a couple videos because I just couldnt figure out myself how to reach certain points or collect specific items.\n\nOnce u complete the game theres still some \"late game\" content for u to play which is a good touch. U can even play again with changing difficulty settings.\n\nThe soundtracks are great which suit the moment or area u are in. But tbh there are some soundtracks that I didnt like so much than the others but all of them have a charm and are great.\n\nSadly I cannot re-expierence it again even after trying to. \nBut u sure can and its worth it for 20 hours of playtime.\nI recommend getting the game when its on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1684330630, "timestamp_updated": 1685471850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138428410": {"recommendationid": "138428410", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068838323", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 597, "last_played": 1668204111}, "language": "english", "review": "The game as a Metroidvania fell flat for me.

I came into it thinking it was going to simply  be just another souls-like contender as many before it have tried to recreate the formula. This game takes the formula and throws it out the window, the gameplay isn't wholly unique but it brings concepts and gameplay ideas to the table that are very much enjoyable to experience. Specifically, the combat. Using the spirits of enemies you've \"purified\" to further your quest through the game world is such a fun thing, especially with how varied and fun they are to actually put to use. Stopping not only at combat, but utility and puzzle/platforming as well. \n\nNot only is the game fun, and enticing to explore, but said exploration is assisted by the backdrop of beautiful art and scenery, with environments ranging from castle ramparts, to the depths of fungal caves, to even an overgrown hellscape, with background sounds that made me jump and wonder,\"Who just made that noise???\" \n\nIf you own this game, I highly encourage you to play it at least once, give it a try. if you don't own it, I highly recommend you buy it and play it if you are a fan of souls-like games, or metroidvanias.

Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it and decided to refund. \nHere is my impression from the hour or so I played.\n\nThe combat is stiff and boring. It's like castlevania but without the weapon variety and no backstep animation cancel, which basically made the castlevania games feel fluid when they were otherwise quite rigid. You also continued the jumping motion in castlevania, whereas in this one you jarringly stop in the air and hover until your attacks are done. \n\nSpeaking of castlevania, the 'recruit dead knights' was a part I was really looking forward to, having been a fan of Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, where you could absorb enemy souls to gain new abilities. However, this is not at all the same. The abilities are from static encounters, not from a drop chance, so they're more like pre-placed upgrades than unexpected new things to enjoy having fun with. \n\nSecondly, the abilities have limited uses and cooldowns. So you're just encouraged to use the starting sword knight all the time. Even when you do use them they're pretty weak. You can upgrade them as the game goes on but there's really no point using them instead of the basic attack in the early game. You can use them in addition to the basic attack but there's little to no point unless you come across a kind of elite enemy. Even then, you're using up a resource that you might not get back for a while. So most players will likely get 'rpg syndrome' and try to avoid using them in case they need them later. Which basically means you might as well just 'get good' at using the sword and dodging. At which point there's no point having the extra abilities. \n\nAnother issue I had with the game was that the atmosphere and story feels a bit too edgy and like it's trying too hard to be depressing. The music is pretty much all very nice sounding but minor slow haunt-y songs. They're good songs but again it just feels like the game is trying to be more depressing than dark souls. I think even the choice of main character was intended to do this, as a young girl having to basically go around and 'purify the dead' is essentially having a young girl go around saying goodbye to everyone she ever loved while she regains her memories of how much she loved them as she says goodbye. \n\nAll in all, I can see this game appealing to people from an atmosphere and music perspective.

Here's a comprehensive spoiler-free review of it.\n\nStory: 9/10\nThe story in this game is told in a similar fashion to Dark Souls. Similarly to there, you play as a witness of a dying world, and most of the story and past events is told through environmental storytelling and item descriptions. While I do generally like this manner of storytelling, I sometimes lost track of where the story was, certain characters involved, etc. I think the game could generally benefit by making things a bit clearer, but that might just be my own skill issue.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nThe exploration and combat here are stellar and rival other Metroidvanias such as Hollow Knight. The main character, Lily, can't fight for herself, so she summons spirits of those she defeats to fight for her. You can have two sets of three spirits equipped, giving you the chance to mix and match them. On top of that, as you defeat bosses, you gain more abilities to traverse the world with, such as a dash, wall jump, and hookshot. The abilities and combat feel great to use, and a lot of the enemies throughout the world demand full use of that. It's interesting to see what combos work for each person. My one complaint is that a lot of rooms in the game seem like they just have enemies thrown in there, and it makes for a more tedious experience than a fun one.\n\nProgression: 7/10\nI've heard some reviews say that the game gets a bit empty towards the early midgame, but I never felt that. However, I did feel stuck in a lot of areas due to not having the required equipment. If you get this game, be prepared to backtrack. A lot. Additionally, the map doesn't help all that much. While it does have a room completion marker (which a lot of games DESPERATELY need), I can barely tell what area each room is in without having to teleport to a bench nearby.\n\nBoss Fights: 7/10\nA lot of the bosses strewn throughout the world are glorified enemies, allowing the player to get their spirit and use them in combat, which works pretty well. However, the real stars of the show are the true bossfights. They all have different phases, and keep you on your toes. In general, they're a lot of fun. However, true bosses are loaded with HP and take a while to kill. Add that to the fact that there are a few fights that feel a lot more tedious (looking at you Herrod) than the others, and some fights become more of a drag than a challenge. \n\nScore: 10/10\nThe soundtrack of this game is amazing. It perfectly encompasses the theme of every area, boss, and cutscene. I definitely added certain ones to my own personal playlist. My favorite has to be Accolades, both the Intro and Outro, though Bulbel gets a close second place.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nEnder Lilies has a soothing artstyle that, like the music, ties together well with the game's atmosphere. It gives a lot of contrast between certain areas, especially between the bleak and dreary top half of the world and the vibrant colorful bottom half. \n\nTl,dr:\n\nPros:\n-Interesting story hidden throughout the game\n-Fun gameplay which players mix and match for their own preferences.\n-Fun bossfights and enemies.\n-Amazing score and artstyle.\n\nCons:\n-Story can get confusing at times.\n-Progression requires loads of backtracking.\n-Map should have the area on it.\n-Many gank rooms and certain tedious bosses.\n\nOverall though, despite its flaws, Ender Lilies has rightfully earned a spot in my top Metroidvanias. Beautiful work. I would love a sequel, DLC, or even another game entirely that expands upon the concepts introduced in this.", "timestamp_created": 1683512249, "timestamp_updated": 1683512249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137976781": {"recommendationid": "137976781", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998197720", "num_games_owned": 975, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1464, "last_played": 1683506036}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, pretty graphics, solid control, had lots of fun, and the story is great", "timestamp_created": 1683506082, "timestamp_updated": 1683506082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137974929": {"recommendationid": "137974929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009765994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1691, "last_played": 1683500300}, "language": "english", "review": "Warning: This is a Soulsvania, not just a metroidvania.\n\nThis game is gorgeous. The graphics and the music are awesome.\nThe game itself is a metroidvania but with a big spoon of Darksouls. Nothing bad with that, if there weren't a few problems that make it frustrating:\n\n1. Ennemies don't get staggered when you hit them with most attacks. Only some strong but very slow strong attacks can do that.\n2. Ennemies can attack you while you are hitting them...\n3. Whenever you use a spirit, your priestess does her own animation that is independent of that of the spirit. Problem is, you can't move or dodge until that animation is over, even in the air. \n4. Most enemy projectiles home on your position, either fully or partialy. The fast ones curve to get to you, which makes them annoyingly hard to dodge. Whoever thought that this was a good idea is crazy. lol\n5. The game and the bosses are not really hard...until the last area. There are a TON of ennemies that can kill you in two hits and take a lot of punishment before going down. You are going to die a LOT. \n6.. The two last bosses have a ton of health and if you haven't grinded to level 90 at least, you will suffer.\n7. The last boss... He spawns flying monsters that shoot fast curved fireballs on you that do a ton of damage. If you could easily destroy them, that would be fine. But no: even at level 90, having a fully upgraded umbra Knight and  a few others, they were hard to take down. And there can be up to 3 on screen, on top of the boss...\nAnd there is more: to have the true ending, If you manage to beat him, you then have to beat him again while he does the same thing + new moves...

Nice and responsive controls that allows for a lot of movement options late in game.  It's not the most open movement, but it makes sense for the character.  Fighting feels decent with little to no delay (unless you go deep into combos).  Bosses are tough and REALLY emphasize pattern recognition, but are fair, especially with benches/ respites nearby.  Speaking of gameplay, there is a dodge mechanic and is nice & forgiving.  \n- The utilizations of the spirits makes gameplay itself varied.  It allows a player to play the game the way they want to play.  Thumbs up, there.  \n- The map in this game is one of the better ones that I've come across.  The color changes for item hunting and the clearly marked entrances makes things easier for exploration.  May still have to do some trial-and-error with exploring for progression, but it is still good.  \n- There isn't much sign-posting, but the way this game is set-up allows for natural progression through the game (for the most part).  It also gives a good job of letting you know EXACTLY what to do to unlock special spoiler-free things.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this game.

The word to describe most areas is again: generic. You explore a castle, a magic forest, sewers and catacombs that offer little to none redeeming qualities and have a soundtrack that can be a complete hit or miss, either it fits perfectly or it feels weirdly out of place. \n\nWhile the animations of the different movements you unlock by defeating mini-bosses and bosses are outstanding, the fact is that most of this abilities are gimmicks that you will most likely try once, see that they are inferior to the standard light and heavy attacks, never use them again.\n\nDespite having an excellent art style, most enemies and bosses are boring beyond belief. You fight an amazing variety of enemies like a slime, bird, knight, knight with hammer, knight with spear, knight with shield knight with horse, gargoyle and so on. And the fact that the lackluster variety of enemies are recycled in later areas makes fighting them a chore.

Slow, confusing, one path to blindly follow and hit creeps, oof. But eventually its good qualities start to show. So if you have the same issues as me in the first 2-ish hours, prevail it gets better, much better.\n\nPositives:\n- Bosses unequivocally one of the best of not the best aspect of the game. Unlike the respawning mobs which get more and more annoying and eventually you will start to evade them. Bosses always felt good, each one original, challenging but not frustrating, each one requiring a different set of abilities and attack approach. Marvelous, great job.\n- Abilities gathered from defeated bosses. You can choose 2 sets of 3 abilities bound to X, Y and B buttons. Feature which certainly elevated the gameplay, it was fun to experiment with different combos to defend Emily and reach secret areas.\n- Map + unpicked collectibles indication. The map is implemented well. Individual areas were displayed in the form of boxes with lines between them indicating open paths. Also the box color (blue vs. yellow) simply indicates whether or not you found everything there. Simple, functional, no handholding too much.\n\nNegatives:\n- Soundtrack, definitely the weakest aspect of the game. People are praising it because of its author and they like her songs, I don't care as a game soundtrack it's trash. Unfitting, unreactive, inconsistent, repetitive, and maybe 20% percent of areas are in complete silence... awful I've not heard worse background \"music\" in a game for a long time.\n\nNitpicks:\n- I still have no idea, what the benches are sorted by in the Fast Travel menu. It just jumps around the map.\n- After you spawn on a bench, you have to click to get up which takes a few seconds and then if you want to access it you have to click to sit again. Does it make sense not really, is it annoying, definitely.\n-  The shield cuck knights are not very well designed. No vulnerabilities, block everything and does a tun of damage. No they're not nowhere near the ending area.\n\nTechnical notes:\n- runs flawlessly on Steam Deck\n- getting 100% is attainable on the 1st playthrough without too much grind", "timestamp_created": 1682786599, "timestamp_updated": 1686013324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398550719022750854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137478149": {"recommendationid": "137478149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090385817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1682116325}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent metroidvania game with a great art style and good use of using enemies you purify as new skills/attacks.

It's the exact kind of slower paced methodical fighting that you find in the Dark Souls series when they're at their best.\n + The atmosphere is fantastic, music and environments come together to really create the sense of a world that has fallen entirely to ruin.\n + The platforming is pretty good, Heonir's ability in particular is a lot of fun to play around with.\n + The main bosses are very good. And are foreshadowed pretty well. There's only one name I read and expected to be a boss who wasn't one, other than that, whenever the game made me think \"oh boy, I bet I'm gonna fight [name]\", that was on the mark.\n + Pretty much all enemy types also have a miniboss variant, so if you want completion, you have to really learn how to beat each of them.\n + Beating a boss (main or mini) always gives a new spirit, which means each boss feeds directly into unlocking new options in combat.\n + This game has an interesting approach to the classic Metroidvania issue of \"how do we try and set this ability up for both combat and exploration use\" by simply saying, \"alright, whenever we give an exploration ability, we also give a spirit (a new attack) at the same time.\" This does work pretty well.\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n - The game could have more content. There's only 9/10 main bosses (depending on how you count it). Getting all endings and fully exploring every room on the map took me only 20 hours.\n - The final boss was a bit underwhelming, particularly the rematch for ending C, which just adds a new fight vs. the same boss, that judging by my single fight with it is easier than the original.\n - While I did eventually solve them, some of the optional puzzles kinda broke the norms established by how exploration worked in the entire rest of the game, making their solutions a bit unintuitive to me.\n\nAll in all, I think if you like Dark Souls, I suspect you'll like Ender Lillies. I'd wish there was more game to play, but for \u20ac25, this is still a pretty good deal.

The art at first was kind of meh to me (it was good but nothing crazy) but towards the end I fell in love with it. Incredible character designs and all the zones are beautiful. My personal favorite part of this game was the music, I'll usually play a video on my phone while I play games but with this game I found myself pausing the music during every boss fight because the music for each is so fitting and whenever the boss's phase changes, the music does as well (mostly keeping the same sound but with added stuff that makes it even more intense/stressful (look up Knight Captain Julius's theme, absolute banger.) Imo the story was cool but kinda lacking (then again I hardly ever pay close attention to the story in most games. All the different abilities and attacks you get mesh together really well and allow you to do some sick movement and chain attacks on bosses, once you figure out whats possible. The exploration is a little confusing because it lacks a little direction (its fine enough to get to the end but if you want to 100% you'll need a little googling) but compared to most metroidvanias I'd say it does a little better (the maps let you know if you're missing anything from the zone, real completionist friendly.  \n\nMy only complaints on this game have to do with the more early game content: for a platformer, the movement (like walk speed and jump height is pretty low) but once you progress its fine enough (still kinda slow imo but i guess thats personal preference).  Secondly the boss difficulty was a little over the place, most of the bosses had a similar difficulty (a welcome challenge, not so difficult to the point of annoyance, maybe like 5-10 attempts) but some were really hard (still the fun level of challenge) and idk if its because I had a cheesy build or what but the final boss was incredibly easy. I didn't mind this too much because I really liked the bosses design (probs top 5 imo) but it would've been better otherwise. And lastly, my only pet peeve of this game: autoclimbing ledges. Idk who you think you are but never put auto mantling in any game, especially a platformer. You can turn on a setting that lets you cancel auto mantle with a down input, but at that point why not just make that default and make a setting to disable it entirely?\n\nTLDR: I had a phenomenal time with this game and 100% it with all achievos, and unlike most games, it didn't feel like a chore to 100%. It was fun the entire time, isn't annoying to grind, and is a game you can set down for months, come back and still enjoy (which is what I did cuz of time issues.) Highly recommend for anyone that likes indie games, souls-like games, and/or platformers. I think it takes some of the best aspects of many game genres and bundles them together in a way that isn't overwhelming. \n", "timestamp_created": 1682118168, "timestamp_updated": 1682118168,

If you're willing to invest some effort into it, you can find some interesting aspects in the story, even if things appears unclear during gameplay. \n\nOverall, it's a good Metroidvania game, even though it doesn't revolutionize the genre and is a bit short. Nonetheless, it's still a good buy.", "timestamp_created": 1681669740, "timestamp_updated": 1681669810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

Only one or two areas are mandatory for one of the endings.\n\u2014 The music is AMAZING. It breathes life into the game in a way I have not seen in a long time.\n\u2014 The visuals and attention to detail is superb. Area designs are distinct enough you can tell each one apart easily\n\u2014 The writing for this game is surprisingly deep. It legitimately surprised me how in-depth it is\n\nCons:\n\u2014 Combat\u2019s a little clunky. Just like Dark Souls you can work your way into it and it feels satisfying at the end of it all, but certain mechanics weren\u2019t worth mastering.\n\n\u2014 Stilted setup for 100% completion. Around the 98% complete mark there were certain jumping puzzles where it felt necessary to utilize extra mobility from particular spirits. If you were to miss them for a most of the game it would leave the player confused for many hours.\n\n\u2014 Difficulty plateaus too quickly.  I beat all of the content in the game aside from the \u2018Level 100\u2019 achievement by level 90. The last 10 levels were a grind-fest and if not for the achievement I would of stopped playing before hitting it.\n\nOverall the game was an amazing play. I was able to approach the game my own way and even did a few areas to completion in different ways than would normally approached. \n\nThe game rewards keen eyes and good location-based memory. Remembering trends of the environment can lead to genuine \u2018aha!\u2019 moments after unlocking certain abilities and back-tracking to see if it works.\n\nEven with its faults, this game is an absolute masterpiece and its music will forever live on my cell phone!", "timestamp_created": 1681543052, "timestamp_updated": 1681543052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136717120": {"recommendationid": "136717120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300773136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1250, "last_played": 1681227264}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this genre, Game simply is not intuitive.

If you're a metroidvania fan, you'll appreciate the game's challenging difficulty, which is very similar to the Souls series, especially with regard to the bosses.\nThe story of Ender Lilies is one of its strongest points. It is told in a non-linear way, through cutscenes and interactions with the characters, which makes the plot quite interesting and captivating. The game world is full of mysteries and secrets, and it is a pleasure to explore and find out more about it.\nThe game is also visually stunning. The art style is dark and macabre, with a dark and oppressive color palette, which perfectly matches the melancholic atmosphere of the story. Each region in the game is unique and presents specific challenges, making exploration even more enjoyable and rewarding.\nEnder Lilies' soundtrack is one of its highlights. It is composed of beautiful and emotional music, which creates a perfect atmosphere for the story and gameplay. Each song is carefully chosen to match the events of the story, making the experience even more immersive.\n\nAll in all, Ender Lilies is an amazing game that combines challenging gameplay with an engaging story and an outstanding soundtrack.

Ender Lilies is a game that wants to be both, but really kinda fails to hit high marks on either. I finished the game with the \"bad\" ending, and I truly have no desire to play it any further to get the good one. This game frustrates me for a few reasons.\n[olist]\n[*][b]Pacing.[/b] Each major boss is an ordeal that when beaten rewards you with a weapon, a movement ability, and sometimes a slight increase to the amount you heal, and that's it. There are health upgrades in the game, but they're scattered around, usually hidden in boxes or behind secret walls, often inaccessible until you gain the aforementioned movement abilities, and usually for a measly +5HP apiece. When everything in the game deals a minimum of 30 for just touching them, this feels like an insult for the effort spent to get the extra health in the first place. Contrast with, say, Metroid games, where an energy tank might take similar effort to get but provide enough to survive more than a few hits on contact from fodder enemies on its own.\n\nThe leveling systems are also a major pacing issue for me. Most of the spirits in the game upgrade with one of two resources, which are available in small chunks in some areas similar to health upgrades, but you can also get them in smaller amounts seemingly by just breaking pots. These upgrade resources are lacking a clarity of purpose that could have instead gone hand-in-hand with the hilariously neglected player leveling system. Maybe leveling up could have provided you with at least a handful of these resources rather than just a flat (and negligible) boost to attack. Why does this game have a leveling system for the player at all? Even with what I thought was a fair amount of struggle and re-killing enemies over and over, I ended the game at a far lower level (low-60s) than other people seem to have. Was I supposed to be grinding? Big no-no. If I want to grind, I'll go play a JRPG. \n\nTo give an example, I experienced no worse feeling in the game than finding a creative solution to get to Ulv (parrying the flying enemies with Headless Knight kills them almost instantly where otherwise they were quite tanky) only to realize upon reaching him and finding some guides that I was hilariously underleveled and lacking in health, relics, and spirit upgrades. So I had to LEAVE, grind up, gain about 100 health, and then come back, and the fight became easy. Thankfully, the fast travel system in this game is very open, otherwise I might've quit then and there. If you want the player to not explore an area until they are higher level, that should be made clear much earlier than right at the boss's doorstep. Contrast to Dark Souls, there is an early game trap where the player might go a couple different places by mistake, but it's clear almost immediately these are places you should not be yet.\n\n[*][b]Combat.[/b] I'm not here to say it's too hard. I certainly struggled, but I get that that's the point. What bothers me most about the combat is that it rarely asks more of the player than some smartly timed dodges/parries followed by mashing the damage-dealing button of your choice. This in effect presents the souls-like element of the game, which is frustratingly dull in 2D. It's lacking the spice that I would hope to see in a metroidvania, especially one that gives you abilities like a grappling hook and a wall cling. Without integrating those into combat, not only is combat itself left out to dry, the movement abilities are also relegated to little more than fancy keys. It would've been nice to see a boss arena or two with close walls or grapple points scattered around, and forced you to use them to avoid attacks. Instead, every arena is an empty rectangle of varying dimensions.\n\nCombat itself, in the way the devs intended, can still get a bit fiddly. Big AOE attacks and pillars and things aren't always clear about when their hitbox starts and stops, or even sometimes WHERE they start and stop. This leads to some amount of trial and error and a lot of \"really? that hit me?\" that I didn't care for. The when and where could've both been fixed with more clearly-defined borders rather than soft gradients. I'm also just not a fan of damage-on-contact in general, but it's especially pronounced here when the player's true position can get obscured between your spirits, enemies, and their respective projectiles and other visual effects. That buildup of clarity loss led to more deaths than I care to admit. Contrast to another game with damage-on-contact like Hollow Knight, there are rarely clarity issues there because you and many enemies are big mono-color things with thick black borders.\n\nThe one credit that I will give to Ender Lilies' combat is that the variety of attack options is quite refreshing, even if I found myself sticking to three or four options. There are a variety of playstyles that seem to be viable, even just hanging back and throwing projectiles, which is quite unusual to see in a melee-focused game like this.\n\n[*][b]The Map.[/b] Oh my god, the map! I don't know what they were thinking with this, the damn thing provides less useful information than I would've gotten from no map at all. If you do buy this game, do yourself a favor and find a map online or in one of the guides on Steam. It's so bad. You will get lost, because the connections between rooms are unclear, and every room will eventually bleed into one another in your brain because even though the game says it's split into ten or so unique areas, it doesn't show this on the map at all.\n\n[*][b]Art Direction.[/b] While the hand-drawn aesthetic is very technically impressive and I'm sure a lot of love went into it, it's just so, so depressing. Aside from some slightly-different color cues, the areas are barely distinguishable from one another. Foreground objects will look like walls in cases where they quite often are not, leading the player to second-guess and hump every wall on the off chance that it's either a secret or just a poorly-placed pillar. Background objects are sometimes walkable platforms and sometimes not. Enemy animations are mostly tweened because I'm sure the budget went almost entirely to just drawing them with as much detail as possible. Every aspect is lacking consistency in some way or another.\n\n[*][b]Story.[/b] Or... what there is of one. It's at the bottom of my list because I recognize that it's the least important aspect of any metroidvania, but what's here is incredibly hard to want to engage with. Every story beat is told either through ambient dialogue from the first spirit you pick up, or bits of paper penned by various seen and unseen characters, or slideshow cutscenes. The sum of those parts is the standard hits of a dark fantasy \"world's gone to hell but maybe you can make it better\" plotline without much new to say or new ways to say it. \n[/olist]\nSo, yeah. I can recognize that Ender Lilies on the whole is a very pretty game, and definitely a strong first outing for its developers. However, there are too many little things that add up to a major detraction from the overall experience for me to recommend with my whole chest the way I will for some other metroidvanias and souls-likes. I recognize also that public opinion seems very love-it-or-hate-it split on this game (even though that doesn't seem to show in the Steam reviews), and while I think \"hate it\" would be a strong term for my feelings on the game, I definitely don't love it or even like it all that much.\n\nIf you haven't had your fill of drab dark fantasy, by all means buy this game. Maybe get it on a sale if you're not sure. Maybe you'll fall in the \"love it\" camp, but for your reference I would consider the metric for that to fall right around the fight with Gerrod. If you're not having a good time with the game by then, you probably will not magically start having a good time further in.", "timestamp_created": 1680997693, "timestamp_updated": 1681044017, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498204201459884644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136377302": {"recommendationid": "136377302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274248454", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1681058394}, "language": "english", "review": "Good soundtrack\nNice fights\nPretty difficult (for me)\nA shit ton of secrets\nPARKOUR!\nBosses really feel like bosses\nSometimes just dodging through isnt the best idea\n\nYeah full price is actually acceptable!\n\nWould defo recommend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1680996098, "timestamp_updated": 1680996098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136375260": {"recommendationid": "136375260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056659649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3882, "last_played": 1680723126}, "language": "english", "review": "I recently \"got into\" metroidvanias (air quotes because I kind of pass on anything that doesn't fit a certain aesthetic unlike a True Gamer) and I honestly adored this game despite not generally being one for this art style.

The animations are pretty good , world is built fairly , and story was enjoyable if you follow up with the cutscenes and obtainable story pieces. In my opinion, if the game had these specific elements more organized, more composed or maybe a little bit more complicated, it would've been a masterpiece;\n-The music in the game was making you feel that this world is mysterious and mystical, but considering our protagonist is a little girl trying to endure everything she is going through, i think it would've been better to put stronger music with more dramatic , sad , confusing elements. From start to finish the game's music and SFX did not impress me that much.\n-Speaking of SFX , even though i truly understand that our character uses spirits to fight, i think the hitting sense of the game wasnt strong and satisfying enough , which is a problem of SFX and VFX. Maybe the developers wanted to make it this way but its not my cup of tea.\n-Map. The game's map was sooo unsatisfying. Im not talking about world design but the ui. So game's map has these elements; showing up which level ur at, which levels does that level connect to, which routes have you not cleared yet, and if you've completely explored that level or not. That might sound enough but it isnt. First , i really wanted to pin my map with markings of my own like '''oh hey this mark is for locked doors, and this one for climbable walls i think''. I got to try every unexplored route after i got a new item, and it would've been easier if i had my pins. Second, some levels were kinda big and i got lost in it . I wanted to see where i was in that level and the map doesnt show it, since its really basic. \n-And lastly , i wish the game had a little bit of voice acting so that the world felt a little bit more livelier and the lines of the characters would've been a little bit more.", "timestamp_created": 1680948863, "timestamp_updated": 1680948863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136317216": {"recommendationid": "136317216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248969862", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1681379397}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice setting and music.

The NG+ is absolute fun if you love Sekiro / Wo Long NG+ / Nioh challenge.\n- Small enemies have \"move sets\" that is souls-like. The boss fights are fun.\n- No pitfalls and spikes!! I really have to admire dev for not putting them in!\nI mean I've been playing games since late 80s, and dying from pitfalls, spikes are just lame and old.\nI didn't finish Hollow Knight because of the annoyance of all the spikes ant pitfalls.\nIt's already 2000s, why still using / giving these same obstacle to gamers?\n\nI might sound a bit over, but I really really enjoyed EL much more than I expected.\nOnly thing I wish is dev could add and \"infinite parry spirit mode\" that I can play it like Sekiro on NG+\n\nDevs, thank you for this masterpiece.\nCheers.", "timestamp_created": 1680613699, "timestamp_updated": 1680613699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136072678": {"recommendationid": "136072678", "author": {"steamid": "76561199019122135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1630, "last_played": 1680798495}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La viciada que este juego me ha generado no es ni medio normal.

Recently I've been going through my wishlist looking for promising games that work well on the Steamdeck, and this one finally got enough reasons for me to actually get. \n\nOwh boy, I should've gotten this game way earlier.\n\nI started my playthrough on the steamdeck, where it ran without any issues (as advertised, really), and immediately after defeating the first boss I knew that this is a game I would want to 100%, as the fluid and smooth gameplay immediately stuck with me. \n\nThe game is quite open ended, especially compared to most metroidvanias, where you can even get the metroidvania-style abilities in different orders. (without using sequence breaks) Along with this it doesn't feel unnecessarily challenging to go to a \"later\" area before you've gone to prior areas, as I found no impassible challenge exploring some of the later areas before you're supposed to be there. (with one small exception which will be quite obvious when you find it)\n\nIt took me about 20 hours to get 100% in this game, 14 of which were played on the steamdeck and the final 6 were played on my home pc, neither of them had any issue running the game, infact, playing it on my pc made me realize that the game natively detects ps4 controllers and adjusts the button prompts, which is a much appreciated feature for someone that often switches between a ps4 controller on pc, and the steamdeck (which uses xbox buttonfaces)\n\nThe music and atmosphere in this game is amazing individually, but not just that, they compliment eachother a lot, and this, along with the design of the characters in the game, are used as a storytelling tool, something the game does really well without pushing it in your face with long cutscenes that drag on.\n\nDifficulty wise the game feels easier to me than some other metroidvanias, especially if you are persistent in gathering items and powerups, yet it doesn't feel like the game doesn't put up a fight, for some of the final bosses I really felt like I accomplished something beating them, yet they never felt too spammy or unfairly balanced, not even when fighting them out of order.\n\nThe game has multiple endings, and personally they, in a way, remind me of Hollow knight's endings, albeit more happy. Infact, if any of you are waiting for Silksong and probably have 20 ish hours to spare before its release, I highly recommend you pick it up!\n\nMy only \"complaint\" with the game is that it is a little bit on the expensive side for how much time it takes to 100% (blind), especially since the soundtrack (which is worth getting) is \u20ac 15,99, with the game being \u20ac 24,99, that makes for basically \u20ac 40, with 20 hours played, that's roughly \u20ac 2,- per hour, which is a lot for me. That being said, the game has build in challenge and boss rush modes that I am probably gonna get another 20 or so hours out of, bringing it down to a potential \u20ac 1,- per hour.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 9/10 rating, 9.5/10 if bought on sale for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1680555791, "timestamp_updated": 1680555791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136040585": {"recommendationid": "136040585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971442399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1651, "last_played": 1680523998}, "language": "english", "review": "The perfect Metroidvania!", "timestamp_created": 1680549249, "timestamp_updated": 1680549249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136035031": {"recommendationid": "136035031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893735112", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1680549554}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0410\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044f\u043c \u0434\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0441\u043e\u0443\u043b\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0434\u0436\u043e\u0434\u0436\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1680542712, "timestamp_updated": 1680542712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136027115": {"recommendationid": "136027115", "author": {"steamid": "76561199240388601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 723, "last_played": 1698408293}, "language": "english", "review": "The game may seem to be overpriced upon initial glance, but the soundtrack, the plot, and the experience of persisting through the endless nightmare of the blighted rain, came truly priceless.

There's some pretty deep lore and history behind the world & characters, despite how stingy the game tends to be at spoon-feeding the details to the players. The player essentially has to piece together clues (the environments, along with items they pick up) the series of events that took place through multiple eras, leading up to Land's End falling to the Blight.\n\nThe gameplay can be pretty slow at first. But that's fairly standard for games such as this one. I've seen several reviews complaining about the controls - specifically the dodge function. I never actually noticed anything wrong with it. The player is controlling a somewhat defenseless child, after all. And the dodge does get upgraded eventually. The density of the number of enemies in the latter stages did get a bit crazy down the line, but it wasn't unbearable. It's just difficult enough to be incredibly satisfying once you clear a difficult area or make it to the next respite. And unlike many games in this genre / style nowadays, it doesn't really punish you very much for dying. You always feel a sense of progress and forward momentum even during the times where you do end up dying and respawning at the previous checkpoint. I try to complete as much of every game I play, but I'm not quite a completionist. There are some achievements and challenges which simply take too much time and effort for me. But Ender Lilies' pacing was just right, so that I organically reached 100% completion without going out of my way for specific achievements.\n\nIf you're thinking of picking this game up but are still on the fence, I suggest just pulling the trigger and getting it.

The story is a blatant, boring, convoluted and meaningless copy of Hollow Knight.\n2. Bad game and level design.\n3. Enemy and boss damage scaling is INSANE.\n4. Genuinely pointless leveling systems.\n5. Relics don't offfer a lot variety.\n6. Abilities/spirits offer variety but no usefulness and upgrading is a chore.\n\nI'll go through my complaints point by point to stay concise, but i'll most likely ramble so have fun.\n\n1. The story is an actual nuisance to the game.\nThe only way to describe Ender Lilies' story is cringe. Not only because it's quite literally a copy of Hollow Knights story (to the point you can't even argue that it's using common metroidvania tropes), but also because it's so painfully trying to be deep and mysterious.\nThe story starts in a dilapitated kingdom, where all residents succumbed to a mysterious sickness and became these emotionless, hollow, zombified creatures without consciousness. You, as the Vessel, err I mean as the White Priestess are tasked to purify these people by taking on their Blight. Sound familiar? I mean Ender Lilies' STORY CULMINATES IN AN AREA THAT'S LITERALLY CALLED THE ABYSS. \nThe story is told through cutscenes after boss fights, and lore letters. The letters were fine to read, but didn't add that much to the game. The main problem with the cutscenes is that the game expects you to have an emotional connection with the characters from the get go. I think every boss fight is meant to feel like a fight to offer your friends salvation - but it doesn't. You don't know these characters, you start as a girl with no voice and no memories. These characters do not mean anything to you. All cutscenes play out the same. It's nothing but a depressed circle jerk containing one of two phrases: \"I couldn't protect her\" or \"I'm full of guilt\".\nTowards the end of it the story genuinely left a bad taste in my mouth. Because there is no narration they cannot convey a wide spectrum of emotional depth and resort to cringe ass dogshit LiKe wRiTiNG lIKe ThiS BEcAuSE tHe cHaracTer is SAd.\n\n2. Unremarkable areas and bad game design for a metroidvania.\nMost areas look good, but that's about it. Mid- to late-game areas are a convoluted and disorienting mess. The map tells you only in which room you are, but because room sizes differ wildly, but still look the same on maps, you have no real sense of orientation.\nThe only memorable area is the Verboten Domain (why this needs the german expression of forbidden, I cannot say) , but for all the wrong reasons. The other areas were tolerable at best but this dogshit had me contemplating to uninstall the game and remove it from my account. This area is a cesspool of poison clouds, insanely strong enemies and poisoned water. Just standing there does like 10 damage a second. You're pretty much required to equip a relic, which you can only find if you go through 1 of the 2 entrances of the Verboten Domain. But even with that, you can't freely explore because your healthbar becomes a clock counting to your inevitable death.\nMost areas offer collectibles in every room, and you'll have to backtrack to every room after every boss. The game tells you which rooms you have fully cleared, but the game will put you in rooms where you need ability 1, 2, 3 and 4 just to collect all items. And the worst thing is, there are no real collectibles. You'll only find relics or upgrade materials, thats it. There is nothing more to explore.\n\n3. Enemy and Boss damage scaling is the worst I've ever seen.\nIt's not even funny how fucking bad enemy health and damage is. I kid you not even with all three damage reducing relics equipped enemies in the last area kill you in 3 hits, they're all playing with actual military grade lasers while you're standing there with a soft dick in your hand. It's just not fun. It's not even an issue of skill anymore, it's just plain old bad game design. The game feels like it has no real progression. Yeah you get more stuff and new abilities and enemies get stronger, but it always feels like you're stuck in the first stages, where you can't really do anything. What's really bad as well, is that the game punishes you severely for getting hit, but expects you to kill everything hitless while being locked in 30 different 5 second animations you can't cancel simultaneously. It just gets so tiring.\nThe bosses were okay until the penultimate and final boss. I won't even do the true ending because it's way too punishing. The game went from semi-challenging boss fights to undodgeable bullet hell fuckery.\nAlso all bosses feel the same, because they play out the same. First Phase until 60% boss health, then second phase at 20-40% boss health and finally third phase at 0-20% boss health.\n\n4. Pointless leveling systems.\nYou have Exp in this game and can level to 100. Nice, but for what? There is no point to actually leveling your character, it's just something that happens. You don't get extra hp (you get these by collecting amulet fragments that give you +5 hp, again really bad game design), there is no skill tree, there are no deep stats, there is however an attack stat that gets progressively higher. But it's all just so pointless. Once you're halfway through enemy damage scales considerably while your damage output remains almost the same until the very end. \n\n5. Relic/charm system is bad.\nIt's Hollow Knights charm system but considerably worse. Relics just offer procentual stat increases. Move a bit faster, increase you EXP, increase your damage, decrease your cooldown. Thats it.  There is no depth to it, it's just there to be there. And anyways they don't do shit. As I said before, even with ALL health upgrades, all health increase and enemy damage decrease relics equipped, enemies in the last area kill you in 3-5 hits.\n\n6. Abilities offer no usefulness.\nTechnically there is a lot of variety to the abilities you can use. But there are no real combos and synergies between all these variants and a lot of them feel the same. The game just throws them at you and expects you to praise them for including all of these abilities on the surface level. The other issue at hand is the way you upgrade your skills. You collect blight which randomly drops from breakable objects or which you can pick up as collectibles. Then you upgrade your abilities. But you cannot respec. You basically have like 30 sub and main abilities but no way of interchanging them because all blight you invest is gone. So if you find ability variant 1 2 hours into the game, proceed to use and upgrade it for the next 8 hours, then find the same effect in ability variant 2 you've basically wasted your resources. \n\nI geniunely can't recommend this game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1680087711, "timestamp_updated": 1680087711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417700439691543579", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135655107": {"recommendationid": "135655107", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098551248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3438, "last_played": 1695975258}, "language": "english", "review": "You ever find that one game that no matter which way you look at it, just can't help but find it charming?

Outside a couple collectables I managed to find them all without looking them up after I beat the last boss. \n\n[b]Here's a bunch of smaller things that I liked:[/b]\nThe areas felt distinct, and the drip feed of new mechanics and moves kept exploring feeling good. Each of the enemies attacks had a readable tell that was easy to spot even in a hectic multi enemy fight. The different skills felt fun to use and experiment with. The boss fights were great, and a whole bunch of them took several attempts to beat! The game wasn't punishing for dying, which was nice because it had some really challenging areas that took a bunch of tries to fully explore. The game ended with me wanting more, which is awesome because so often I get bored of a game before the end.\n\n[b]These negatives are pretty minor but:[/b] \nIf you want to max out every skill the grind for materials after the non-re-spawning loot piles are gone is... veeery slow. However you get a lot more materials than you'd need to max out a full set of skills, plus maybe 3-4 extra.

It just show what I got for next level but I want to know more to make a decision which skill should I invested on.\nThe main skill somehow not feel attractive, spear and hammer combo too plain and not interesting at all. It felt so weak when compare to another weapon. It might balance well but that not how it feel like from player perspective.\n\nMusic and story are so so for me. I expected the background music more hype in boss fight.

The graphics are kinda nice, I guess I can say that, although hardly mind-blowing next-gen stuff here.[hr][/hr]The killer for this game are the controls.  They're just sluggish and bad, with commitments to slow animations that can't be canceled.  Overpress a command once and you're committed to the attack with no way to cancel out of it and dodge.  Every button press has to be deliberate and methodical with no room for mistakes.  That's fine enough in general combat, but irredeemable on boss fights.  The fact that bosses are given insane reach and teleporting abilities doesn't help.[hr][/hr]Boss fights are just boring slugfests with HP sponges where you can't even combo without the AI getting in a cheap shot.  That means every strategy is just single hit, dodge, dodge, dodge, wait for an opening, single hit, dodge, repeat.  Long and slow, with terrible command response.  You saw their attack coming from a screen away and you hit dodge for the millionth time?  Too bad, we're gonna get wonky with the timing and make you take two hits anyway, just to spice things up.  There's no way to tell how big your character's hit box actually is because you'll be taking hits even when you dodge out of the way.

some world of warcraft. Recently I was homeless and having a bad time, so I decided to try and fill my time with hobbies. I started hiking/walking for an hour every day. I also decided to start playing castlevania games. I had heard so much about SOTN but never played it much.I got sucked in. I'm currently playing 5 metroidvanias right now. Out of all of the ones I've played, outside of the castlevania series, Ender Lillies is by the my favorite. Something the castlevania series (aside from maybe order of ecclasia) lacked was difficutly with the bosses. Most difficulty derived itself from just being unfair but the games had ways to overcompensate either through grinding drops or finding secrets or learning enemy weaknesses, or whatever. The bosses were almost always easier than expected in those games. With many games invigorated by souls-like boss complexity and it's mixture with 2-d being well explored in other games it was natural that it would come to metroid vanias. Ender Lillies perfectly captures the reward for exploration and bosses that are hard but not too ridicolously hard. I got a house and pulled out my computer for the first time in like a year to play some games. Naturally I turned to metroidvanias on the PC. Ender Lillies was among one of the ones I originally pirated. I got Gerrard and the witch dead before I KNEW I NEEDED TO BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM. I have not completed it yet but this game is great. The difficulty thing though? In my first fight of Gerrard I think I was level 25. This play though I killed him at level 14. If you know the enemies well enough and have the tenacity, then you can fight most things in this game regardless of level. At least so far I think that. Meaning mechanics are rewarding to learn. Mechanics are relatively simple too and you need only learn the enemies attack patterns. It's interesting enough for roaming and puzzle solving. The bosses are touch but they all have 3 phases and you'll get better at these each fight without it being so entirely demanding you want to break stuff. Sometimes it gets close I guess lol. Leveling doesn't increase your health. It increases your damage, 1 for odd levels and 2 for even levels. It is more significant to upgrade your abilities for singificant damage increases but levels are there too. I just don't think you need to spend hours grinding out levels to fight a boss for the before mentioned reason and this one as well. It's much better to just get good at predicting the bosses attacks and making use of dodge or jump and getting your hits in. Sometimes bosses have periodic animations that knock back without doing damage. I like to heal when these happen, because the boss cannot be hurt during this animation but also doesn't do any damage to you. The game rewards exploration and back tracking. You'll get new items or spells with new bosses and minibosses and going back will net new rewards. These are usually so far affects on the environment. Like a new spell or ability can be used to open the way to a new route or item or needed resource.\n\nThe game can eventually become a bit overwhelming with exploration mechanics. To the point they are probably too far in number and sometimes leave you frustrated, because of no clear direction. The game will certainly reward you with exploration but also attempt to overwhelm you with many areas and the rewards have a lot of variety. I think this aspect of the game was done best at the beginning and becomes too numerous and time consuming later making me want to close the game after a short while of exploring.", "timestamp_created": 1679628524, "timestamp_updated": 1680457079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135265736": {"recommendationid": "135265736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351625501", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1246, "last_played": 1629680016}, "language": "english", "review": "Ender Lilies slaps; it has Mili music that's an automatic cop.

Would also like to raise the difficulty in bosses and maybe mobs, idk if its an option available but I couldnt seem to find it.\nFor the controls, keyboard are just wacky and needs customization asap unless you are the guy who plays on arrow keys and likes their combo keys on zxc,\ncontroller is plug and play and just perfect in default.\n\nWhat I like in all games regardless of genres is a good story, initially I would abandon this game if it weren't for the lore which kept building up and it may not look like it with 6hrs in but I am currently deep within taking my time reading every notes and noticing every detail, paired with an art style that I prefer and soundtrack totally worth every spent dime, i'm immersed within its story, you could battle out every single mobs insight or just give zero fucks and advance searching for every tiny white specks to build up the story. \n \nI highly recommend this if you like hk and especially ori, great game and ost is a must if you enjoy classical and opera music, either way its just in between, either you will love this or just hate it, I like it so far so thats that, not like my review really matters", "timestamp_created": 1679419431, "timestamp_updated": 1679420107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135101258": {"recommendationid": "135101258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145478914", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1274, "last_played": 1679407459}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen Metroidvania, un combate muy entretenido y variado, junto a un mont\u00f3n de bosses con dise\u00f1os muy chulos y desafiantes.
