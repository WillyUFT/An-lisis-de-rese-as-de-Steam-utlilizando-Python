On top of that, interfaces can be daunting, confusing, and sometimes counter-intuitive.\n\nIt's safe to say that Aseprite is nothing like that.\n\nAseprite is really simple for people who are just starting to understand pixel art. But the application also is very versatile for more experienced artists. As you gain experience with Aseprite, you can figure out more options to streamline your experience. But the things that the shortcuts and pop-up menus access are still accessible via simple buttons and tool options in the same window, making it so artists don't have to study shortcuts to only forget them two days later.\n\nThe overall layout of Aseprite is planned out well. The ability to split projects and objects between windows inside of the application itself is very useful for more complicated projects. \n\nI personally have no need for the open source part of Aseprite. But for those who do, it's a useful addition \nI'm sure.\n\nThere are plenty other useful tools in Aseprite on top of this. It would be too much to write everything.\n\nThe only real con of Aseprite is the frame speed when animating. It's limited to the hundredths decimal place, making it so more intricate animations (such as art syncing with music) need to be completed outside of Aseprite.\n\nOverall, really cool tool both for beginners and seasoned veterans.

If you don't fix AI aberrations, you'll have some fucked up blurs once you mix it with shaders and stuff inside your game, not to talk about art style consistency too.

From the moment I discovered it, I was blown away by its capabilities. The fact that it is open source and allows you to build it yourself is truly remarkable. However, I decided to purchase it on Steam because I wanted the convenience of automatic updates without having to manually rebuild the open source files whenever there is an update.\n\nNow, let's talk about the user interface (UI). The UI in Aseprite is a masterpiece in itself. It has a pixelated aesthetic that perfectly suits the world of pixel art. Right from the start, you get a sense of nostalgia and artistic inspiration. It's like stepping into a time machine and reliving the golden age of gaming.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Aseprite is how incredibly simple it is to place pixels. Just pick a color and place it anywhere you like. There are no additional buttons or confusing configurations to worry about. It's pure creativity at your fingertips. And when it comes to animation, Aseprite shines brightly. The animation tools are so user-friendly and intuitive. You can easily apply tags to certain frames, labeling them to avoid any confusion. The onion skins are not overly complicated, and you can customize them to match your preferred style.\n\nBut let me tell you about my absolute favorite feature of Aseprite\u2014the color mixer. It's a game-changer. If you're not satisfied with a particular color in your project, just open up the color mixer and make a few adjustments. It's like having a magic wand that can fix any color-related issue in an instant. The level of control it gives you over your artwork is simply astounding.\n\nAnd here's where Aseprite truly stands out from the crowd\u2014the ability to use and install community-made plugins. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities. You can apply different UI themes to customize your workspace and make it truly your own. Plus, the ability to export your projects to .psd (Photoshop File) format is a game-changer for those who work with multiple software applications. It seamlessly integrates into your creative workflow.\n\nLastly, I must mention the exceptional file recovery feature of Aseprite. It's a lifesaver when unexpected technical issues arise. You can rest easy knowing that your hard work is protected, and you won't lose everything in the face of a computer crash or power outage.\n\nIn conclusion, Aseprite has been an absolute joy to use. There are still a few features I haven't explored yet, but based on my experience so far, I can confidently say that this review encapsulates the countless hours of positivity I've experienced with this app. Whether you're a professional pixel artist or just starting out, Aseprite is a must-have tool that will elevate your art to new heights.", "timestamp_created": 1686045103, "timestamp_updated": 1686045103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86881256103515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139626014": {"recommendationid": "139626014", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066510123", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4295, "last_played": 1697319065}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most beautiful drawing app I have ever used I would give my life for this.

Some seem to find it good enough), since it allows for larger spritesheet importing and its animation tool is a decent upgrade from Piskel's (in which frames have pretty big icons and you have to do some scrolling to get there).\n\nAseprite also offers a list of preset palettes and allows you to easily create your own - I personally have added a few from Lospec and also essentially extracted others from some Kirby's Dreamland 2 sprites. Again, Piskel also has a palette manager, but it's a bit rudimentary and I am not sure if you can save them, although I am pretty sure you can in the downloadable version.\n\nA few noteworthy features I can think of right now are an outline effect that can be applied automatically and which settings can be edited and a tileset mode which has potential, but as nothing more than an amateur I haven't done much with besides messing around with it. Some features may require you to enable the Beta version.\n\nI think Aseprite has a friendlier interface than Piskel, but the latter still let's you more easily know what the framerate of your animation is. Aseprite is better for importing files and editing their content (which helps for modding) since Piskel will limit you and send you an error if the imported sprite is too big.\n\nFinally, Aseprite is also more consistent with it's default checker pattern, a case will always be 16x16 in your canvas (I am not sure if those can be edited, but I feel like 16x16 it's perfect), while Piskel's background checker pattern changes if you zoom in or out.\n\nIf you feel like Aseprite is missing functions, you can use a few add-ons, I'll list a couple here as examples.\n\nCenter Image Add-on: https://thkaspar.itch.io/center-image\n\nSprytile (add-on for Blender compatibility allowing to create stylized textures for low-poly 3D models): https://jeiel.itch.io/sprytile\n\nThat's all, I hope this review from a pixel art enthusiast was helpful in your decision making, be sure to check out Piskel first though, in case it is good enough for you.

No need to go through your layers trying to hunt it down.\n* [Shift + O] is the amazing outline tool you always dreamed of.\n* \"Symmetry Options\" is hiding under the View tab [Alt + V].\n* Learning shortcuts is pretty much essential in the long run if you make sprite sheets or animations, so I recommend trying to familiarize yourself with them as soon as you start, so you can start building that muscle memory now!", "timestamp_created": 1682671584, "timestamp_updated": 1685522018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824020802974700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137362235": {"recommendationid": "137362235", "author": {"steamid": "76561199127395648", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 248485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18064, "playtime_at_review": 25233, "last_played": 1700751287}, "language": "english", "review": "\nHaha 420 nice", "timestamp_created": 1682588775, "timestamp_updated": 1682588775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137353045": {"recommendationid": "137353045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125733210", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 87296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 843, "playtime_at_review": 39459, "last_played": 1700592379}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good alternative to Paint.NET, and an essential tool for any pixel artist's toolbox.", "timestamp_created": 1682566321, "timestamp_updated": 1682566321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137349402": {"recommendationid": "137349402", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025778307", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 114, "playtime_at_review": 1980, "last_played": 1700025011}, "language": "spanish", "review": "redkiller so far.ogg\nola cocoa", "timestamp_created": 1682558875, "timestamp_updated": 1682558875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137347938": {"recommendationid": "137347938", "author": {"steamid": "76561199117777984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "playtime_at_review": 2516, "last_played": 1699642731}, "language": "english", "review": "meow\n", "timestamp_created": 1682555911, "timestamp_updated": 1682555911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137347816": {"recommendationid": "137347816", "author": {"steamid": "76561199222934202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2218, "last_played": 1695239513}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this a week ago after using pixel studio for almost 3 years and Aseprite change my art from good to great!

Changing the UI and Screen Scale only somewhat fixes this issue and the results I've ended up with still aren't ideal (everything is very small although I prefer that to the default clunkiness).  \n\nMore UI customization would be an immense improvement because there is certainly a lot of good within Aseprite hidden behind a very annoying UI.\n\nThat all said, here are some of changes I did to cope:\n-Preferences > Experimental > Enable \"Use native file dialog\"\n-Change the hard to read pixel font: https://community.aseprite.org/t/how-to-change-ui-font/5023/6", "timestamp_created": 1682290512, "timestamp_updated": 1682292777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564169228076934814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137188797": {"recommendationid": "137188797", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229505861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 6735, "last_played": 1700541992}, "language": "english", "review": "cool animations", "timestamp_created": 1682274597, "timestamp_updated": 1682274597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137175999": {"recommendationid": "137175999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142732745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 68746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 401, "playtime_at_review": 53573, "last_played": 1700600328}, "language": "spanish", "review": "puedes poner pixeles, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1682260705, "timestamp_updated": 1682260705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137154304": {"recommendationid": "137154304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116812439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 98661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 89473, "last_played": 1700717949}, "language": "spanish", "review": "It has all the tools that a pixel art artist could need.

I discovered aseprite during the steam spring sale, but figured I should wait since the sale was only 30% - much less that what I usually wait for. Again, please note this is a way for me to limit my own spending and not to devalue the work the developers have put into the software. \n\n10 minutes later I\u2019ve bought aseprite.

Most of the free ones that I used were perfectly fine, but Aseprite had a lot more tools, options, and appeal to it. The UI of Aseprite is incredible. With everything from the buttons to the text font to the folders in the Open menu, everything has been pixelated to fit with the whole retro environment that Aseprite is trying to create for everyone who uses it. One of my favorite things that I discovered recently was that the Aseprite icon on the home screen blushes when you hover over it and can be pressed as a button. It doesn\u2019t do anything, but I still thought it was adorable. 20 dollars may seem like a lot of money to pay for something you could get a lesser equivalent of for free, but Aseprite was completely worth the money. It has so much more in store for any pixel artist than any free application will. Since a lot of other pixel artists that you may see online or in YouTube tutorials use Aseprite, it\u2019s extremely helpful to have access to the same set-up as the professionals. The tools and layout of Aseprite is the best part about it. The hotkeys for the tools are easy to learn, and knowing those hotkeys can make your art-making process much more efficient. If you don\u2019t want to have to memorize the hotkeys, the images make it clear what each button does. Some have functions specific to Aseprite that may be confusing to first-time pixel artists, but once you understand the functions, those buttons can begin to play a major part in your workflow.
