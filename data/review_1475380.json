"review": "*Played the game with Proton*\n\nTL;DR: Great Game for free, which provides ~1-2 hours of fun\n\nThis Game was great to play (especially for free) and i also really like the art-style and world-setting, but still had some issues with it:\n- The Final Boss can spawn many objects (the orbs), which use WAY to much memory (game can spike at ~9GB RAM while those are active) and have to restart the game to not lag anymore once a swap starts happening\n- I had out of some reason glitched through the door in Chapter 1 and could not get back out again (had to reset)\n- In the final boss, i had somehow managed to \"warp\" though the edges and fall to the void, which was a insta-death\n- It is not quite clear where a enemy can be hit while doing damage\n- The game is missing graphical settings (like capping the FPS, changing resolution and changing the Anti-alias effect)\n- Text (especially voice subtitles) seem to be blurry, which i think is related to the absence of Anti-Alias Settings\n- Game was short, whished there was more (literally just 2 chapters, [spoiler]one of which is the final boss[/spoiler])\n- Controls are not rebindable and the tutorial can be too easily skipped (i had multiple times skipped the tutorial voice subtitles because of playing around with the controls, and the explanation was just in the voice subtitles, no prompts)\n- Text translation was pretty OK, but could have been better\n\nEven with the mentioned issue above, the game played smoothly (except the mentioned memory issue) and gameplay was fluid.\n\nPlayed on:\n- Proton 7.4-4\n- Manjaro KDE Wayland (Kernel: 6.0.8-1)\n- GPU: AMD Vega 64\n- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X", "timestamp_created": 1670163660, "timestamp_updated": 1670163828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

The world and humanity got conquered by AI and the only thing that can save Humanity is Maya.\nBecause it is such a short game you don't really attach yourself to Maya or Max (which are the only primary characters) and there isn't any depth to the story which if fine cause the developers main goal was to deliver a short experience and showcase the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay oh boi the gameplay, it is simply fluid, fast paced, easy to learn hard to master, and FUN. There aren't many types of enemies but it does give you a challange and the whole time manipulation is done so very well that maybe other games like Quantum Break should take notes from. The game by itself is only worth it for the gameplay.\n\nGraphics and animation are not amazing (neither VFX or level deisgn or overall assets \\ models) but for a school project and as a Demo game it is above the expectations and I enjoyed for what it is.\n\nPlease give this game a try and I hope to see more future projects from Limited and maybe even a full fledged game.", "timestamp_created": 1665957006, "timestamp_updated": 1665957323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123892725": {"recommendationid": "123892725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293627438", "num_games_owned": 783, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1665872111}, "language": "english", "review": "Good concept, it will be better if that game become a rogue-like.

Expect to be done in an hour or so, maybe less. However, despite this, it is generally pretty well made. There are three combat sequences, the last of which is a boss fight that definitely tests your ability to pay attention in an otherwise fast-paced battle. It has a short tutorial at the beginning, prior to the first sequence, just to get you generally acquainted with the controls.\n\nThe first sequence feels thought out and complete. The environment is nice and sets the mood well, and while it is short and somewhat linear, it introduces a few enemy types gradually, and ramps up the difficulty through greater numbers of enemies and less convenient enemy spawn locations. It culminates to a final encounter with hordes of enemies in a way that does not feel cheap or unfair, and I quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe second sequence felt... rushed. It lacks a lot of polish. The environment itself looks very nice, but enemies spawn literally out of thin air. With a bit of extra work, they could've been entering from hallways, elevators, windows in the ceiling, you name it. But spawning suddenly right next to you is generally less than ideal. That said, the battle is plenty winnable, and leads into the final sequence.\n\nThe last sequence is the boss fight. There are no hordes, no mooks, no subordinates of any kind. There is only the Boss. And he can be rough, especially the first time through. Expect him to kill you a few times while you get acquainted with his attack patterns, as you use everything you have to fight him. The battle feels difficult, but not unfair (except that one attack that gibs you if you don't have both your abilities available... a little overkill, I think, but at least there's a way out), and though it is certainly drawn out, it does not feel forcefully stretched out.\n\nThe game is free, and it feels like the beta demo to a AAA title. While there are some glaring imperfections, they do not detract sufficiently from the game to make it unpleasant, and I would easily go as far as to recommend it. An entire AAA title built around this concept, merely expanding the story presented here to make it 10-20x the length but otherwise keeping the game much the same, would likely have been well received.

Likewise the choice to prevent users from customising their controls can render the game inaccessible to some differently abled gamers. \n\nWhile those flaws render this unrecommendable for PC gamers, the contribution of the students is of very high general quality.

The world and plotline are interesting even if you don't get a ton of it and the boss fight in particular is one of the most interesting I've seen in a shooter. You generally don't see anime themes in shooter games either so that was unique and the character designs are a ton of fun. The majority of my playtime was just trying to beat the boss and I died over and over, but every time I died I got a little farther and wanted to try again. Once you've memorized how to dodge each attacks you really feel accomplished by the time you finally knock him out and it's honestly better designed than the boss fights in most Triple-A shooters. I would love to see a full-length game based around this concept.\n\nAlso I liked that the three characters were named Maya, Max, and Blender.

Though the crosshairs are very missleading, the normal attack has an about 300% bigger spread then it is actually shown on the crosshair and the zoomed in attack makes you think that the spread increases in some way while it being pinpoint accurate the whole time. There is also no damage inpact/feedback for the player, if you get hit you probably wont notice half the time and just suddently die. Just a simple soundcue would go a long way.\n\nThe Ultimate ability often decided for itself where to shoot as it did nearly every time an 180\u00b0 turn, but since it drags enemies in it basically never mattered in terms of gameplay.\n\nThe enviorment, the OC, enemies and boss look very well made. Only a few models and just two levels, but hell for just that it looks great!\nThe translation for english is good, no obvious weirdly phrased sentences or sentences that made basically no sense.\n\nThere are some bugs like the resolution of the game being too big, making the HUD disappear off-screen which is pretty annoying but doesnt hurt the gameplay too much. The Boss sometimes gives no opening for minutes, so youre just there, dodging attack after attack for minutes.\n\nThe Boss has an one hit KO attack that is very hard to react to when you get to the low health for the first time which feels cheap. The flying enemies spam projectiles a bit too much, making it become a bullet hell very fast (even with abilities). And the AI for the ground minons seems pretty bad as they wont shoot unless they walked to where they wanted to.\n\nOverall, it has some flaws, its pretty good for the 20-60 minutes you can get out of it.

Needs more work on the storyline and skill based tree (if any). The game can get very boring fast if there is nothing else to upgrade or change. Think based on the probability of mobbing, the devs should consider any form of AOE damage like tossable ordnance, which could supplement during time freeze. I like the idea that we can do a rapid blast with the shotgun mode (main gun) and the midrange sniper rifle mode (during ADS). But there seems to be a slight non-register in some of the sniping angles. It also seems like the sniper isn't that impactful. Most of the time I just use the main gun. I also found a bug after finding 3 sets of data and you needed to unlock the hidden door. This is somewhere in the beginning of the game. Apparently, at times, you can ultimate near the hidden door and press 'F' to unlock the door simultaneously; the ultimate still works and you can unlock the door at the same time. As you guys (who have already played before) know, you can't move during the ultimate animation. Speaking of which, I REALLY feel that the ultimate animation could be improved, in terms of visuals, actions and length. Plus, I can't see the ultimate build up. Apparently, it just lights up after combating for a while. Usually it's better to check visually if you are reaching the ultimate, so that you can plan your next move. \n\nThere is REALLY too much talking, both in tutorial and main. Maybe could try to work on some way to compartmentalize the information. I would really like to see some sort of class based choice. With that said, could work on separated storylines to juice up the gameplay. I really hope not to see much in-game purchases at the moment. They should try to focus on the possibility of end game grinding/playing before considering other options. \n\nFor graphics, there is nothing we can change; understandable since it's still really fresh. Even with a GTX 1050, I7-8750H and 16Gb ram, there is SIGNIFICANT tearing and frame skips. My fps varies, as high as 100+ and down to between 45 and 60; usually the latter. BGM get boring REALLY fast. Nothing catchy, just upbeat and nothing else.\n\nAbout the character Maya, there is little about her at the moment and don't know what she's after. There is also little personality, which could be a trait of a robot? Idk because I don't know if she's a robot or not.\n\nConsidering all of these, I think this game has potential. You should try it out at least. Only slightly over 600Mb and it's still free (for now).

You have three abilities that relate to time manipulation and an ultimate that basically just kills everything on screen. Each of the abilities has a good balance with how powerful it is and its cooldown. The only weapon you are able to use can best be described as a rifle with a underbarrel shotgun. They both share the same magazine but you want to use them in different situations. Fortunately, the process of switching between them is as simple as holding (rfile) or releasing (shotgun) right click. The rifle's shots go much further and are more accurate, while the shotgun is able to fire much faster. \n\nThis game also makes for a decent aim trainer since every enemy can be 1-shot in the head and they approach from varying distances and heights. \n\nOverall, I had fun with completing the campaign in about an hour and a half.

Steam version was then released on late December 2020.\n\n[h1]Hope in The Near Future[/h1]\nThe Dawn has self-contained story; set in 2033 where the world is in serious economic crisis and artificial intelligence turns against human. Player will play as \u201cMaya\u201d, an experimental subject that escapes from AI facility, but also lose her partner \u201cMax\u201d by AI robot. However, Max somehow turns into digital form in order to guide Maya to the heart of city and destroy great AI ruler as the ultimate goal.\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2483831232[/url]\nThe story is pretty simple, self-contained, and something you could expect from hostile AI plot, but you might need to read both in-game short introduction and Steam store page to get the full picture. The story is pretty short (two chapters) and plays like the final act of campaign. So, there\u2019s not much room for world background and character development especially Maya and Max. I also personally like Maya\u2019s cool-looking and hybrid outfit design, somehow reminded me of Honkai Impact vibe.\n\nThe Dawn features two main locations; the urban area and the shrine. The theme represents the contrast between depressing world and hopeful Maya character; it also gives clear visual for the combat.\n\n[h1]Bullets, Time, and Pieces of Robot[/h1]\nAverage playtime is approximately 30-40 minutes long which involves shooting arena shooting, completing objective, and defeating boss at the end. Maya only wields one energy weapon, but features two shooting function (aim as level action rifle or spray as auto shotgun). It\u2019s kind of simple, but well integrated to keep flow of fast-pace TPS combat with tight controls and smooth transition.\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2483831638[/url]\nMoreover, Maya possesses \u201cTime manipulation\u201d ability from psychic experiment. She can dodge (Space), freeze time zone (Left Shift), reverse position / heal (Q), and ultimate skill (E). Most special abilities have different cooldown, except ultimate skill that require amount of target kills. These elements keep the combat more engaging especially freeze time zone where it can stop enemy movement and incoming projectiles. The game also encourages player to adapt and utilize different abilities / time management based on situation as the difficulty shifts drastically at couple last sections.\n\nI found boss fight fairly telegraphed and fun challenge as I learned his pattern and timing when to dodge and use abilities. Also, a nod to Nier: Automata reference.\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2483832014[/url]\nI dig into development history; the project went through trial and error and experiment of motion capture. You can notice from Maya\u2019s smooth animations and her credit dance. It results solid and satisfying punchy gunplay that I genuinely enjoy and demand for more.\n\n[h1]Technical / Other Mention[/h1]\nThe game is powered by Unity Engine, represented in Anime cel-shade style. Good detailed environment (some nice pre-baked interior lighting), flashy special effects, fully-dialogue Korean voice acting, and electro / bass / Asian folk music. UI is clean and well-designed. The game provides mostly solid 60 FPS (minor frame drops when horde spawned) and stable performance without crashes or glitches in my playthrough. \n\nSome of my nitpickings are lacking of graphical options and key binding (even the game only support mouse and keyboard by default).\n\n[h1]Closing[/h1]\nThe Dawn is another solid title that worth trying. It\u2019s short, enjoyable, and delightful video game experience that done right as Anime (waifu) style shooter (which I wish to see more or somehow overlook). You don\u2019t expect gameplay innovation in here, but fun polished project from people who love gaming and potentially becoming game developer in the future industry. And I hope for the best for them.\n\n[quote][i]If you found this review helpful, please consider and give a thumb up, any feedback and exchanging idea are very appreciated[/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1620718043, "timestamp_updated": 1620723885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892725527286529541", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91797527": {"recommendationid": "91797527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893929231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1620696513}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast pace and a fun challenge.

The performance of the game is pretty sus. Though on the surface not a very graphically intensive game (indicated by the recommended specs), it will bring any graphics card, from a scalper or not down on its knees with constant 100% utilization. There's also no graphics settings of any kind, and the settings in general is very vert limited. This segways into the art style and overall graphics. From a glance. it's very bland and deserves to be glazed over, but it actually fits with the dystopian-esque tone the game is trying to go for. It also juxtaposes the color and decor of the \"facilities of artificial intelligence\" (from the game description), which as of the moment only differ in color. The enemy design is also pretty lame and uninspired and feel kinda like placeholders. The boss is just also uninspired robot + hat + big hands. \n\nAlright, so for a 600 mb game, a short 1-1.5 hour story is to be expected, which was fulfilled. I also don't think I've seen an AI takeover in a dystopian near future before... I can't really make fun of the story, as it has a total of like 1 hour to build any world or character, so nothing I can say. All in all, its basically just background noise.\n\nGameplay? I don't know how to feel about it. It's fun. It's brainless monke brain fun. The movements look kinda janky and unpolished but feels alright. If you want to play a game for it's combat depth, it's not gonna be here. The 5 dashes + super fast cd, along with 2 simple abilities and 2 guns feels more atoned for an action mmorpg. The lack of a melee option cuts down on flexibility and depth (a shotgun takes its place, but whats the fun in that?). The dashes allow for very intese dash spamming with no real downside because of the short cd. The time reversing feels kinda useless other than its healing, because its just a more complicated dash but back to your original position. The time stop is a one that I've never encountered before and honestly pretty cool. Unlike the reverse, this actually was useful and almost necessary for a part with infinite waves. \n\nOh god. So the boss is relatively simple, just a mish mash of stuff you've seen before in souls-like and rpg  bosses. The actual points where you do damage is very ambiguous, as the boss has so much health that it could take you upwards of 10 minutes if you do everything right. It's pretty boring and its just a chore. \n\nIn a game about standing up to technology and A.I., I feel it might've been more suitable to equip our hero with a melee to compare and shine a light on the two sides we meet in the game. It'd also make a more interesting, exciting, and deep experience than the existing guns at your disposal. (yes ik its one gun, but it has two mode so...). With an overhauled combat system and expaned story/design, this game could be a masterpiece. Right now, it is nowhere close. Just like this game, I have no clue how to end this review, so give this game a try if you just wanna turn your brain off and kill something; its free! :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1620407401, "timestamp_updated": 1620407401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440212279558181763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91584636": {"recommendationid": "91584636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260478764", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1619729883}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best \"demo\" games I've seen on Steam.

I have a 2080 ti with an I9 9900KS and the GPU was running at 100%. This is understandable since the game is still fairly new and they are trying to get the base game out before trying for optimization but it would significantly improve the experience if the FPS was stable and consistent. The boss fight was way too hard for anyone who isn't a normal gamer so the boss's health could have been lowered so it can still be challenging without being impossible for a casual audience.

I won't nitpick about the translation grammar or small stuff like that since those things can be easily fixed as the game develops. What's harder to fix are flaws with the game's core aspects, so lets break this down.\n\nThe Good:\nThe time control abilities are fun to use, if a bit overpowered. In fact, it so fun that I still enjoyed this demo despite the fact that there's not much here yet. The fun of dashing behind enemies frozen in time for quick kills, or using time-stop to freeze a boss mid-attack can't be overstated. \n\nAaaaand that's where the praise ends, unfortunately.\n\nThe Bad: \nThe time control powers are somehow both too powerful and not powerful enough. The recall ability is nice, since unlike in overwatch you regenerate to full health after using it, regardless of how long ago you took damage. However, you can only get hit like 2 times before dying so you're basically forced to use it the instant you take damage. More player health and less regeneration on use would fix this. The time stop bubble is amazing in that it slows down the game's pacing just as much as the enemies. Having to stop to place the bubble, dash over to it, and stop inside to shoot enemies is antithetical to the normally quick combat. Sure, you could just place it and keep moving, but the other enemies move like normal when outside the bubble so staying inside means their projectiles can't hit you. A time stop that affects the entire level but needs longer to recharge (e.g. Za Warudo), would be much more fun while keeping the original functionality intact. The gunplay is as functional as it is dull. While blasting robots was initially fun, it got old after a few minutes. The time control kept things interesting, but you're still just shooing waves of brain-dead ai. Honestly, given the character's powers, a melee focused game would make more sense. Or, at the very least a mix of melee and guns (think DMC5 with timestop)\n\nOverall, the game needs more power balancing, gameplay variety and enemy types.

The boss fight was \"hard\" not because it had many uniquely difficult to dodge moves but rather the cooler stage left too little time to destroy , i stopped at that boss stage about 5 times all those times the boss was under 2 %. i also find it a shame that the ultimate was not used at the end of the game or at the boss stage.  The characters were drab and had no other motivation that's from themselves. There's a problem with game design and cooldowns. the bosses hand  swings should be timed to the mc's time stop.i should be able to bind my keys to what i want  like my dash to my shift key.  The game would have greatly benefitted from a melee attack by the main character. the sheld mobs were sometimes difficult to kill give them a lower turn rate. that being said i completed the game. also the bosses hand bugged out a whole bunch during my play through it'd just strike air. the scale was too ambitious if you had told me that terminal was just for the city i would have not minded it.\nTLDR; the game has alot of bugs and a few design quirks i dont abide by. The game's writing was also contrived and i feel like the scale was too ambitious.

When it starts to get fun you die so its like uhhh really... \n\nIf they had a colour palette and a more intense story then sign me up but this is so overrated. \n\nHope this helps: https://youtu.be/ganjNWub1vk", "timestamp_created": 1613062509, "timestamp_updated": 1613822584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86379963": {"recommendationid": "86379963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272202487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1613022778}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well designed, characters are very interesting and lead on to you wanting to know more about the story. A few bugs encountered along the way of the playthrough, but it's basically an alpha so this is to be expected.\nSome things I noticed:\n- The bullet when shot in sniper mode goes slightly above where the reticle is\n- It seems like headshots are the only way to deal damage to the drones and robots(Don't know if this is intentional or not)\n- When fighting the boss, there were a few times where I would beat the boss, but would have to restart due to death. I would assume that this is due to the bosses damage effects lingering during the cutscene. Also during the boss fight, the corners of the arena could be clipped through.\n-When slowing down the bosses hand in the timefield, damage wasn't able to be done to any parts of the hand inside of the bubble, making you have to do precise timefields in order to actually be able to shoot the hands and do the big damage.\n- The enemies hit VERY hard, especially the robots with shield. Half of your HP in one shield bash. These were easily the hardest part of the run IMO, as it also took some very tight timing in order to be able to kill them before they shield bashed you(Although sometimes when they repositioned they were able to be shot from behind, thank god they don't turn to face you with shields while moving.\n", "timestamp_created": 1613023351, "timestamp_updated": 1613023351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86368518": {"recommendationid": "86368518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965859947", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1612332218}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't play that much but the concept is very interesting.

It must be the trailing system and a bug where they would not hit the ground after the first dash, so they followed me.\n\nNit-picks:\nI would have preferred that, after destroying the 4 nodes, Blender wouldn't die instantly. It would be better if you had the chance to destroy him yourself by leaving him vulnerable or something. It would feel more satisfying that way.\nThe game needs more polish but I really can't complain because it is an indie game made by student(s) and you can't expect AAA level of polish so soon.\n\nI didn't really mind the bugs and powered through the bad FPS of the street level because in the end it's still a very fun game and to know that it was made by a student or a team of students is very cool.", "timestamp_created": 1612836499, "timestamp_updated": 1612837124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86236589": {"recommendationid": "86236589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162175589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1612830375}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a very nice game voice & song & other very good just I can say for everyone test this game for one time and developers please create more section and other for this game.\n\nsorry for my bad english.

I started constantly playing it and enjoyed every second of it, Despite my pc not being able to handle the graphics that well. But theres a few problems I dont like\n\n1. You can easily clip through the map and die, And overall with that dash move you have it can make you even clip through for example the walls where you fight the boss. When you clip through the walls you go through the floor thats there, It isnt even solid actual floor and you end up dying because you fall out of the map. Its really annoying because I was pretty far into it then died, I had to start all over again. The same happened with me when I was fighting enemies, I just randomly clipped through the floor and died. The checkpoints where you spawn back can be annoying to start all over again with something really hard, But I actually am fine with that because you do it over and over until you get it right which happened to me, I only dislike it a lot if you keep clipping through everything and dying. A little note about the boss as well, When it smashed its fist into the ground into my portal thing (sorry I dont know the name) to get stuck on to hit its hand, It sometimes smashes it on me while Im in the portal thing or even outside of it normally. The hand gets stuck like its supposed to but then Im stuck and cant move, Shoot, Or anything and I miss an opportunity to hit it, I dont even die I just am fused in its hand, I cant even dash out, Nothing. Its not fair\n\n2. I like that you translated it in a lot of languages, But theres no point to it if theres no English audio or even subtitles, This could probably go to any language thats in this game. Ive looked in the setting and there was nothing of the sort, That makes me not know what Im doing and overall play a game blindly only enjoying the simple things, Like the attack mechanics and how hard it is. I dont know anything of what the story is and what Im supposed to do, Or even what my moves are called which probably seemed obvious just by me writing this review\n\n3. Sometimes when I do a move that I want it doesnt do it right away, For example the dash which is the one that it happens to the most. When I try dashing sometimes it doesnt even do it when want it to? I do the move like the dash, And I can see the purple but I stay in one place, Then I die unfairly because of robots attacking me, Its really unfair\n\n4. The graphics look ok but the city you are in looks pretty bland, You should add more stuff to it and color and make everything look better, The boss area looks ok but honestly if you want to go all out you should redo everything on how it looks and make everything look prettier and better, This might be an opinion/preference but honestly imagining everything redone with nice aesthetic is really pleasing \n\n5. Last but not least the settings in general. The settings barely do anything and have little info, The only thing it has is to change the language of the game (like I said no audio at all and subs), And the aim sensitivity and thats it. Id like to see more variety honestly, For example the quality of your graphics, Or even the lighting etc. Just something more\n\nI honestly really enjoyed playing this game trust me, And I could just look up the story myself and see what everything means, But at the same time I shouldnt have to do that. A game should have english subs at least if it has a mode for english, To me I feel theres no point in adding languages if i dont know what Im doing. I know its annoying that Ive mentioned the audio/subs and about it being unfair a lot but honestly its frustrating because I liked this game\nI really hope you can fix all of this or even the major small things ive mentioned here, And even if you have to change this game to where you have to buy it just to improve all of this and make the game more advanced or look better honestly I dont mind. I want to see better from this game because it does have potential\nSorry if this is really long I just really wanted to say all that I feel to this game, I hope some of you agree with me too. If some of you want to play this game honestly go ahead, Im just telling you what struggles you will face while playing this game, Thank you for reading", "timestamp_created": 1611358766, "timestamp_updated": 1611359835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4458598792552948", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85155847": {"recommendationid": "85155847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074429446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1611337653}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a really good game.

This game was free and I hadn't expected much. What I got was a combat system that challenged me to think about when and how I use the abilities they give you. Each time I died I had the ablilty to choose how I approached the battle, defensive or offensive, fast or slow, sometimes I wish there was a melee attack or the gun held more ammo but otherwise the system is pretty smooth. \nAt the time of writing I havent beaten the boss on the Chapter 2 Part 2 \nBut I have noticed a few bugs that arn't game breaking they are: \n* when dashing down a flight of stairs you sometimes will hit a invisable ramp.\n* (could be intentional) when a battle starts you see \"system_Battle\" it couyld be code or just becasue in the future.\n* If move after you press \"E\" your characture can sometimes not show up in the animation that plays.\n*Fell out of the world when dashing on the left railing during boss battle.\n\nThis game is really fun and its really a change of pace I enjoy. Keep up the good work developers and I hope my little review helps you out at least with a few bug detection.\n\nEdit #1 The boss is really hard, his attack patterns are so strange and I have no idea what the one where he puts down containers and you have to shoot them from 100% to 0 are. But I died ugh.\n\nEdit #2 It seems I played the game way differently than the creator did. I zoom around fast paced shooting and going ham on the movement system.

You start the tutorial, you end the tutorial and you go straight into war. I recommend reading the initial comic, it's not very long and it's the only backstory there is (I skipped it thinking there would be more lol). Besides, there are only two chapters, so the game turns out to be a little shorter than expected (I have already finished it with my 1.3 hours registered).\n\nGAMEPLAY\nCool. You have four abilities: Blink, Rewind, Time-stop, and your Ultimate (which one-shots characters). If you have played Overwatch and League of Legends, think of the main character as a mix between Tracer and Ekko. You may get to use your Ultimate like four times in the whole game, so get used to the rest of the abilities.\nThere are three kinds of machines: normals, normals with shields, and flying mechanical birds. Watch out with those birds, in my opinion it's best to focus them since they fill the map with bullets very quickly. The AI is a little clunky sometimes since it may not notice you at first (which is great for you).\nYour main weapon is a shotgun when not aiming (useful to spam bullets on robots), and a rifle when aiming (useful to get those flying mechanical birds).\n\nWHAT WOULD I LIKE TO SEE IN THE GAME?\n- Multiplayer. Definitely. I would love to see it here. These 1.3 hours could have easily turned into 3-5 or maybe more if some kind of multiplayer was added to the game.\n- Power-ups. They don't have to be overly complex: maybe a health-kit, more damage, stamina boost... Basic stuff.\n- More weapons. The main one is good, but something like a sniper rifle, a grenade launcher or a missile launcher would be very cool to have.\n\nDO I RECOMMEND IT?\nIf you don't like games with little story and thinking, and mostly shooting: no. There are only two chapters. You will feel empty when finishing the game (\"that's it?\"). Moreover, there is not much strategical depth to the game other than the three basic abilities and the ability to clear some screen space with your Ultimate. Otherwise: yes. I mean, it's free and it's two hours long at most. Cook a pizza in the oven and 20-30 minutes later when it's done (or burned) you may have already reached Chapter 2. It's a bit frustrating to die over and over in some parts due to the high quantity of enemies, but you can take that as a test of your ability/reflexes.\n\nHOW TO BEAT BLENDER (FINAL BOSS): STAGES AND GENERAL TIPS\nSTAGES\n- Hands (grab or punch): easy. Time-stop yourself, when the hand is frozen go behind the hand and start shooting like you're mad. If you don't have Time-stop, stay back and blink forward (grab) or stay in place and blink to any side (punch) when you predict the hand will start moving.\n- Laser beam: keep moving to one side, use your Blink whenever possible, use Rewind when you don't have any Blinks remaining and the beam is close. When he is tired, shoot his hands while moving towards his back. 2 full chargers should go towards his hands. His back is destroyed in roughly 12 hits (which deals 10% of its health), so manage your time remaining as you wish. I recommend Rewinding when you feel like the beam is about to go off in order to win some time.\n- Missiles from its back: Time-stop yourself, then leave the zone when the rest of the missiles have stopped. Try to stay on the center of the Time-stop zone, you can still get hit by the other missiles's Area of Effect. You can also Blink or Rewind, but I recommend Time-stopping because of the AoE of the other missiles.\n- Two giant purple circles from its hands: it should not be hard to dodge them with Blink.\n- Bullet hell (many giant bullets): there is usually a path to escape them. You can tank one if you feel adventurous. If you think you can't escape, Time-stop yourself.\n- Many bullets targeting you (little red circles): I recommend Recall or Time-stop. Blink if you feel like a b0ss.\n- Last stage (coolers): \"all or nothing\" stage. Watch out when he is at 15% health or less. If you don't destroy the coolers he creates, you will be instantly deleted. You have enough time: focus on the coolers, shotgun them if you can. They are destroyed in 4 hits if you are aiming.\nGENERAL TIPS\n- You can aim + shoot him in the head. A full charger is like 1% of its health, worth if you don't have anything else to do. You can also shoot its hands when it has them resting on the floor (for instance, when it has stopped laser-beaming you as I say on STAGES), take any chance you can get.\n- Try not to Recall unless absolutely necessary (i.e. you are grabbed by its hand or you are low on HP. See also STAGES as for my recommendations on when to Recall). You can Time-stop more often, but I also recommend you save it for the things that matter.\n- You may die some times. The boss is not easy at first. You will learn from your mistakes and in the end you will defeat it.\n\nGood luck, and have fun!", "timestamp_created": 1610714410, "timestamp_updated": 1610792485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84723310": {"recommendationid": "84723310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258499376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1610445040}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1610711784, "timestamp_updated": 1610711784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84717731": {"recommendationid": "84717731", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070510302", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1611674568}, "language": "english", "review": "A very decent game nice sound track, many languages to choose and a good AI.

Its short, but fun, so i'll write a useful review of it since so many AAA games fail to do a couple things this game does nicely.\n\nTheDawn is a third person wave based bullet-hell(ish) game that takes the idea of being able to gently manipulate time and uses it liberally, with a focus on \"dont get hit or die\" mixed with \"Prioritize targets\", which sounds like a cocktail shaker with cocaine in it on paper.\n\nIn practice, its better. The story is kinda there, and in such a way that its not too important, but also not in such a way that it stops gameplay forcefully without thinking, which is somehow a refreshing thing to see. The gameplay is simple, Go to area, hack thing, shoot enemies of different varieties in a semi-wave based way. You have quite a few things to do this with, the shotgun which is good against single targets close range and thats it, and the rifle which is good for any target period minus some parts of the final boss and shield bots.\n\nThe powers are more or less the butter and bread. You have time bubble thingy that stops all BULLETS (except your own) and enemies in their place, however is countered by drones that fire beams, which arent effected by the bubble. Theres the rewind, which is essentially a budget regenerating health kit, and also a godsend against the final boss. Theres the dash, which puts gungeons dodge roll to shame with how easy it is to use, seeing as it recharges over time but you need to use it efficiently since that recharge time isnt enough to be spammed. and then there is the ult, which i think i can just say \"nuff said\".\n\nSpoilers from here on so if you give a fuck about the final boss then i'd suggest leaving. Not sure why you care that much though.\n\nThe final boss is bullshit, but in just enough of a way that you actually feel bad-ass as you fight it, with a lurking feeling of \"i could possibly fuck this up at any moment and its pretty much only my fault\". The only exception to this being the instant kill time trial that is the final attack and is utter horseshit with how precise it is. That being said, every attack is forecasted beforehand, which is great cause that means you can actually learn about how to dodge the next attack. Genuinely surprised how many games recently fail to do that but hey... The only major BS part about it besides the final attack is that all the attacks are random, but because they are forecasted, it means that you will be learning what animation means what as you fight him. or die to him, like i did.\nAnyway, you kill big bad and the game ends, without much of a celebration in it at all. \n\nOverall, games fun, and has relative amounts of replay in it if not all that much.\n7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1610134519, "timestamp_updated": 1610134519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84308321": {"recommendationid": "84308321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347293117", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1610132656}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is very laggy and you can not turn down the settings.

You basically have to predict it which isn't always easy. And if you're unlucky that round of fighting the boss, he'll decide to do that several times in a row instead of his much easier to dodge laser attack. Now should you manage to survive despite all that and the occasional bugs (such as him refusing to show his weak point) and get to the end of the fight, you have the boilers you have to destroy in a SUPER tight timeframe. The devs need to add a couple seconds of extra time *at least*, it feels terrible only needing one more shot and getting insta-killed. In any case, besides the boss fight issues it was fun going around and killing enemies with time powers - the game has a lot of potential so I'm a bit sad that the devs don't plan on developing it any more.

It has some cool ideas that play with the concept of time, being able to rewind yourself to recover HP or stop bullets mid-air plus freeze enemies on their tracks is fun and simple to pull out, yet is also a bit strategic since you are loaded with waves of them. Controls on the keyboard took a couple of minutes getting used to but other than that it was smooth sailing overall.\n\nThe enemy design is made so that you use your abilities smartly, which is a good choice. Freezing the boss movement can allow you to find weak spots for huge damage while your other skills can save you from death or a mechanic. The story is kind of simple and something I find that a lot of reviews didn't mention is that yes there is hacking in this game, but is automatic, you only hold F during it so there are no true \"hacking\" bits into it.\n\nAs a free game, I recommend you give it a try! Is a perfect way to unwind and try something fresh without spending a dime nor getting into a compromise of 40+ hours.

You cant change the keys but they are very basic and not many keys to press so could be a good game to get used to pc, also this game uses a time mechanic which may help you to get better at timing specific things in other games, then again it is only like 40 minutes of game so it can be played in 1 sitting if you don't have a lot of time to play something. As of when I was playing this game, when you paused the game the dialogue will continue to play.

That's the only thing it has going for it, and that's why it's so highly recommended. Who doesn't love free things?\nSadly, it being free doesn't mean it isn't a waste of time. \n\nThe game is just bland as bland can be. Your abilities are as follows: Shoot, dodge, heal, aoe time slow, ultimate ability. The combat consist entirely of just dodging around enemies and shooting them, no skill involved at all. The time slow ability is also inconsistent and doesn't always work. The entire challenge of the game is just from the same 3 enemies being spawned over and over again while you're confined to a small little area. \n\nOn top of the combat being the same thing over and over with very little to actually do aside from dodge-shoot-dodge-shoot, the AI is pretty horrible. Two of the 3 enemies will, more often than not, just walk towards a set point before starting to shoot at you. It seems like they're glued to a motion node and can't do anything until they reach their mark. The weirdest thing is that they aren't consistently like this, so sometimes an entire wave of enemies will walk straight past you, other times they'll all function correctly. \n\nThe final boss was kind of neat at first, but it's just the most grindy kind of experience that's harmed by the combat being so lack luster. You just spend 8 or so minutes shooting over and over again while dodging, healing, dodging, slowing time when the ability is up, and then dodging some more. There is also a phase towards the end where if you don't shoot 4 things fast enough, you get instantly wiped and have to start all over. The cherry on the uncreative cake is the blatant \"inspiration\" from the NieR franchise's specific type of bullet hell. They have almost identical speed, size, and graphics. There is almost literally no difference at all. \n\nAll in all, this game isn't worth most people's time. If you've got nothing at all to do and you're looking for a quick way to kill some time, this might just work, but if you're expecting something fresh, keep looking. It's nice that it's free, but not only does it bring not an ounce of creativity to the table, but it's just a bland experience over all.

Thankfully the game has English subtitles, which I am used to and am completely fine with.\n\n\nIf you'd have told me that TheDawn was made by a single developer I could have believed that, for the game is simple and rudimentary.\nDespite that, there isn't much to complain about technically, largely due to the lack of things to complain about.\nI did glitch through one of the zone boundaries in Chapter.2 once, which instakilled me once I fell off.\nIn addition I was once told to destroy a \"cooling system\" that looked more to me like some kind of nuclear reactor, but that's a minor complaint.\nThe options menu is extremely limited, and the game can be completed in under an hour if you are good.\n\nThere is also no difficulty setting, although in truth it hardly needs one, as the game does demand somewhat decent reflexes and precision, especially for Chapter.2.\nThe main issue I really have with the game is that when you die you  after often forced to listen to dialogue or watch a cutscene again, which gets real old real fast.\n\nOverall, the game is short and fun, with a good challenge.\nIt does lack replay value, and it's short, but it is free.\nIf you like shooters then you should try TheDawn.\nI look forward to the developers next game, or a bigger and better version of this.", "timestamp_created": 1609410900, "timestamp_updated": 1609410900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83639675": {"recommendationid": "83639675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305723183", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1609878003}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

A little passion project worth admiration, really inspiring. As an aspiring game dev, this goes right up my alley as stuff I'd like to make or be part of in the future.\n\nAs for the game itself, the gameplay is basically shoot, dodge, ability, shoot. Although there's no character progressions, it allows for quite a few strategies to defeat the same enemy. Most people would probably time stop a shielder to then shoot them from the back, but I found that if you're quick enough, you can turn around and teleport backwards, lining yourself up to shoot them from the back before they have a chance to turn around again. For being so simple, there is space for differing styles of play, precisely the kind of creative freedom that should attract players.\n\nMy only issue is that there is nothing resembling melee combat, but I suppose that's not what this game was going for. It's pure gunplay and it does that well. If it were a longer game I'd judge its lack of character progression or abilities/weapons to kick ass with, but since it's so short, it did everything it needed to right. So in reality, the only real complaint is that this isn't a big game. I'd even pay for that!\n\nAlso, wish everyone knew how to do a credits sequence like you guys ^^\n\nWith that said, I recommend this completely free 1 hour adventure to anyone who likes fast paced gameplay, a scifi setting, and anime aesthetics.

There are interesting mechanics at play, although a lot of them feel heavily under-utilized. You play as a standard anime girl who's apparently an AI (the writers just called robots AI) who has to liberate humanity by hacking things and destroying robots, to hack into the mainframe and save the world. For the record, every main character here is named after a major 3D modelling software (you're named Maya, your partner is Max, and the final boss is literally named Blender), so I'm not sure if this is some subtle hate message to Blender users.\n\nThe controls are standard shooter inputs; WASD to move, mouse to aim and shoot, and abilites with Q, E, and LSHIFT (you can't re-bind these btw). Your character can't jump, but she gains a Time-reverse which returns her to a prior position while restoring her HP, a dash with iFrames, an AoE slow, and an Ult (because it's 2020) that basically one-shots everything that exists on the scene. Shooting with LCLICK fires a shotgun you can spam as fast as you can click, and holding RCLICK before firing makes the camera enter an over-the-shoulder mode that turns your gun into a sniper rifle. \n\nThere are some improvements that could be done here. In the game, there is only one instance where aiming down with RCLICK is actually necessary (spoiler: it's the boss fight). Up until that point I found myself never needing to aim down as every enemy could be mowed down with a spam of LCLICK.\nThe Time-reverse feels incomplete, as activating it immediately sets your health back to 100, regardless of whether or not your health was 100 to the position it sets you in. Reversing doesn't reverse enemies and debris around you either, so it's purely a healing skill at best.\nThe Ultimate also feels like an afterthought. In the final fight, there is no way to use it (as to fill it up, you must kill fodder enemies), making it really just a rechargeable screen-clear spectacle to behold before the final fight.\n\nThere are some points in the game that could also use some polish. There is a segment where you have to defend against waves of enemies while waiting for a timer device to count down, but the timer shuts down three times, and each time you must stand in front of the device for four seconds while enemies are free to aim at you. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but this segment takes so long that if you die while restarting the timer, you are forced to redo the segment from the very beginning. A simple checkpoint after a reboot would've been nice.\n\nI could nitpick about the lack of video settings, but considering that this is a free game, I'll let it slide.

While the ult is helpful it takes forever to build up and the cool downs with skills dont help if your surrounded but other than that this game is a true hidden gem and if you do by chance find it i suggest you play it. Or if this ever becomes more than 3 chapters i know i would buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1609230882, "timestamp_updated": 1609230882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83460383": {"recommendationid": "83460383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406626377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1609229719}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the combat mechanics.

She can also rewind time to regenerate all her health as well as placing her back where she was a few seconds ago, like Tracer from Overwatch. Combine that with decent gunplay with a full auto shotgun / sniper, a really spammable dash, and a kill everything ultimate makes for a really fun yet challenging experience.\n\nNearly everything kills you in a few hits, but the game has a system to slow down time when you're in danger, so it never feels unfair. The boss fight however, is a bit ridiculous. Admittedly I died a lot to it as it has a lot of instant kill moves. Aside from that, there's really only 3 enemy types in this game as the game throws a bunch of them at you.\n\nIt's a short game, but do check it out. It definitely has potential to be a full release if it polishes a few areas. Mainly, better enemy AI so they can actually turn around to face you once you walk behind them. More interesting encounters? Eg. More planned out encounters rather them spamming them. The ultimate skill is very janky looking, with the cinematic camera failing most of the time.\n\nThe story is okay, it can definitely be improved upon.

The game play is pretty solid and I wish there was more stages and boss fights because the boss was pretty well made and was designed to clearly make you use abilities but if used incorrectly you where screwed by a few mistakes. Overall I really would like to see them expand upon the game.

It feels like a rough draft more than an alpha phase. The problem is there are too many bugs that are game breaking. Honestly I am more afraid of the walls/buildings than I am of the enemies. The amount of time of I have clipped through them and fell below the map is frankly silly even for a free game. Be careful in general using the \"blink\" ability as it can cause the falling through the map, or not even work at all (which leads to many cheap deaths). As for the combat, their are 3 enemies you fight that are very predictable, but they have odd quirks. For one they have the thinking process of a potato, but more importantly the flying drones seem to have infinite range with a laser and homing missiles, which is more annoying than difficult. \n\nThen there is the lord of Jank boss fight. A good bit of his attacks are instant KOs, which fine because some of them are televised. The problem is the FPS in the fight sometimes go to 10 (I almost thought it had froze on me during the fight, nope just low FPS). You also have to contend with the fact that you are dealing with moves that don't even follow their own rules. Using the stop time bubble to stop his grab attack can cause all sorts of collision issues. I have been grabbed and let go, teleported, and even just knocked all about the stage. There are plenty more things that make this boss less challenge and more annoyance. Can he be beaten? Ya, but I don't feel like trying to fight a bullet sponge boss with a semi automatic gun and abilities that like to guess if they are going to work or not. Maybe add some minor invincibility frames, ability to shoot the orbs, and perhaps not have multiple area effects go off the same time? \n\nOverall I don't recommend.

You won't find combat design at the quality of DMC, but the offering at hand is little to scoff at. Combat consists of shooting, short range dashes, a small aoe that can slow enemies and projectiles, along with a heal that doubles as a personal rewind or backwards dash depending on your use (think Tracer from Overwatch). There's also an ultimate that's essentially a kill-all-enemies button once fully charged. All abilities work on separate cooldowns. \n\nWith only one weapon present, it doubles as a shotgun when hipfiring and a rifle when using fine aim. Shots are chunky and just satisfying enough. Sound design is fairly good, and while I don't understand the language being spoken (chinese, I believe), it comes off as well acted and voices are pleasant to the ear. So that's fun.\n\nFinally, I only ran into one notable bug that I could notice. One time I had a major stutter during one of the final boss's more notable attacks, which knocked me outside the arena. I had no choice but to walk backwards and fall to my death. Other than that, only complaint would be that the boss had two moves that one-tapped me, both of which felt rather cheap and not well communicated.

And I am currently experiencing a bizarre mix of bliss and disappointment.\n\nLets preface this might as well be more of a tech demo than an actual game. It isn't the easiest game in the world, but with a reasonable degree of competence it can be beaten in an hour on average. It is free, of course, so that is more than understandable.\nWhen I first looked at it, It sort of screamed third-grade indie game on the cover, and it sure presented some of the traits you'd expect from one (I had resolution issues resulting in some UI elements being partly hidden, absolutelly 0 graphic settings, localization is amateurish at best).\n\nWhat I absolutelly did not expect however is the sheer amount of satisfaction I gathered from playing time-sniper-god. The controls are snappy and pristine, while things can get very chaotic (and deadly), the time-slow mechanics combined with your other crazy abilities give you plenty of leeway to cheat your way out of most ridiculous situations. Paper HP and Slow-motion on demand, a gun that packs enough punch to oneshot every enemy if you know where and how to aim, and a ton of enemies to shred through really sold the one-waifu army theme for me. All this does not even gloss over the boss, which is fairly well designed to test all of your abilities.\n\nNeedless to say, the disappointment comes from how much I wish there simply was more of it. And I very much want the devs to know that they really really should deliver more of it. I applaud whatever weird mojo they practice and would gladly throw bucks at a full-fledged game should they decide to produce one in the future.\n\nAll in all I'd suggest anyone who's into this kind of game to give it a shot, throw your bucks at the devs if they ever release more, and to agree with me on the note that Maya's pretty hot.", "timestamp_created": 1608945594, "timestamp_updated": 1608945594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823476552963256836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83156900": {"recommendationid": "83156900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973750695", "num_games_owned": 1527, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1608944014}, "language": "english", "review": "More please, for the love of gaming MORE.\n\n\nAn utterly adorable and charming experience", "timestamp_created": 1608942315, "timestamp_updated": 1608942315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83153256": {"recommendationid": "83153256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119421075", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1608938433}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short but fun", "timestamp_created": 1608938610, "timestamp_updated": 1608938610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83153134": {"recommendationid": "83153134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282960734", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1609172194}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun playstyle would love to see a similar Game from the Devs.", "timestamp_created": 1608938504, "timestamp_updated": 1608938504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83152421": {"recommendationid": "83152421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368850737", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1608937726}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1608937828, "timestamp_updated": 1608937828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83151783": {"recommendationid": "83151783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437571160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1608937006}, "language": "english", "review": "My PC isn't really meant for gaming, if it were it only plays games from the PS3 and XBOX 360 era, but not having the option to change graphical settings is unacceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1608937215, "timestamp_updated": 1608937215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.359976530075073242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83144624": {"recommendationid": "83144624", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021632259", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1608930496}, "language": "english", "review": "Had super fun playing this game! very optimized and awesome concept.

The situation was suffering from inhumane acts.\nThere, Maya, the hero with high fighting ability, born from many human experiments, challenged \"AI\" and stood up to release humanity from the control of \"AI\".\nThat is the content.\n\nHowever, as a free game, it is a surprisingly high \"difficulty\" STG, so it cannot be said that it is for beginners.\nBasically, if you are a player who has the skill to handle STG / winning style shooting, you can clear it in less than 30 minutes.\nHowever, if you are a beginner, you can say that it is a game that you can't get out of your hands or feet at all.\n\nIt is also important to note that unless the PC has higher performance than the minimum \"conditions\" of the PC, it will not operate normally.\nAt least, if the memory is not \"Intel Core i7\" or higher, or \"Rizen 7\" or higher, it often goes down for each OS.\n\nIn the case of a laptop PC, it is difficult to defeat the enemy in Chapter 2 due to the large blurring of the screen, but it can be cleared with certain STG techniques.\n\nHowever, unlike desktop PCs, in the battle with the last boss, if the enemy comes out with the \"final weapon\" as seen in the video, basically you lose.\nIt is difficult to aim the gun, and it is almost impossible to destroy all four final weapons in a short time.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there's no way to win.\nThe enemy's \"power gauge\" is displayed on the screen of the last boss, and the point is that you can clear it by giving \"0%\" damage before the final weapon is released.\nThe enemy takes a lot of damage, especially when he attacks his \"hand\", so if he wins by that means, he will be cleared.\n\nAlso, basically, for users with high STG technique, it is a level that can be cleared relatively quickly, and once it can be cleared, there will be points where you will get bored.\n\nAnd although this work is highly evaluated, it should be noted that it is not compatible with the controller in that the operation is only \"mouse and keyboard\".\n\nDue to the high degree of difficulty and the problem of operation, there are places where not everyone receives it.

You get a cut scene of sorts in the beginning and through out the rest of the game you have dialogue here and there between the protagonist and the other dude (heh already forgot as I was more focused on shooting robots lol). I'm not discrediting the story this game tried to tell, because I actually liked the idea of it and it was intriguing! \n\nI'd also like to bring up how the boss fight utilizes the ability to slow down time which is really fun (also love the bullet time when you get shot at with a laser, be it the boss or a regular enemy). It was also fun on the boss trying to kill it as fast as I could and somehow I had 1 cycled from the first fist smashing to lasers and attacking the back which was fun, might try and figure out how I did that and time myself for a challenge).

Rather, there is no optimization at all. Yes, I have seen the minimum requirement (and that it is rather high), and yes, I have at least the minimum requirement. However, for a game like this, I don't think it is necessary for the minimum requirement to be this high. I believe optimization can be made such as not loading the entire map unless it's necessary.\n\nYes, I wish to see this game grow and have more content.

I get making a boring grey city helps convey the tone of the story and helps make the main character stand out more but I wish it had more color/life. \n\n\nBut if you got 20-40 mins to kill, I recommend giving this a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1608685015, "timestamp_updated": 1608685015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82919733": {"recommendationid": "82919733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843110755", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1608670614}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the shotgun", "timestamp_created": 1608684536, "timestamp_updated": 1608684536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517045438289642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82919282": {"recommendationid": "82919282", "author": {"steamid": "76561199010558422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1608683849}, "language": "english", "review": "Although short, this is a fun game to just past time.", "timestamp_created": 1608683991, "timestamp_updated": 1608683991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82917903": {"recommendationid": "82917903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073712380", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1609096346}, "language": "english", "review": "This game need some improvements and bug fixing, but it's really fun experience. >3<", "timestamp_created": 1608682370, "timestamp_updated": 1608682370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697961926460266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82916356": {"recommendationid": "82916356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432668311", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1608786401}, "language": "english", "review": "ngl, this game is pretty fast paced because:\n1. the enemies always shooting at you even though they are behind you\n2. you need to aim to their heads because its one shot one kill\n3. some of the projectiles is like homing missiles\n4. this game doesn't have a difficulty, the difficulty is locked (maybe) by the devs of this game\n5. watch out for the projectiles that's coming to you because if it landed on you, you will take a lot of damage and i mean A LOT\n6. you need to rotate your mouse pretty fast because you don't want to get sucker punched from behind.\n7. the CD of the abilities is pretty slow, so you need to always think about when are you going to use your abilities.\n\nbut all and all, this game is actually good, a 603mb game with a generic storyline but the gameplay is pretty hard that you want to keep coming back, its 7/10 for me personally, maybe if they released the full game, its 8/10 maybe. but yeah, if you are a fast paced gamer and an aim god, this game is pretty good, i mean its free too XD. ok that's it, i hope the devs is going to implement the difficulty option because boi, it's hard. bye bye :D", "timestamp_created": 1608680440, "timestamp_updated": 1608680440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82915522": {"recommendationid": "82915522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166313721", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1609020095}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of fun, hope to see a sequel.

The gameplay was very smooth, the abilites took a little bit to get used to since the keybinds are weird. There were times that annoyed me, since the checkpoint system wasn't the best, but its whatever. It reminded me of the Doom Eternal, with the smooth gameplay and captivation.

Your gun act as a shotgun while not aiming with M2 but act as a Rifle when aiming with M2 and the damage obviously shotgun > rifle. I am not sure if they taught about this in the tutorial maybe i didnt see it or something.\n2. When playing the first chapter you are gonna get overwhelmed with robots coming at you at the last stage where you will be constantly fixing the god damn vending machine. You will know what i mean if you play it. So basically at this stage just go beast mode with your ability L shift[area time stop] on the DRONES and Space[Dash] dodge basically everything, try to take out as many of the drones ASAP otherwise you are just better off dead, REMEMBER to use your Q[rewind you back to where you have been in the last couple of second and full heals you]. Use your ultimate when you stack as many of the big fat shield and normal robots and everything goes boom. \n3. Chapter 2, now the first stage for this chapter is basically the same as the first chapter, you get tons of robots and drones spawning in this big hall not so big actually where you have to kill every single one of the robots and proceed to the boss fight BLENDER. \n4. Blender. You can beat it in 3 mins less or so if you know the mechanics of course. For my first try you really wont know much of the mechanics and i beat it around 15 mins+ Second try 3mins less. See how much of the time difference is? This boss is Dark souls difficulty if you didnt know any of the boss mechanics and gun mode like i do when i found out there is a shotgun mode when not aiming with M2. Its pretty easy tbh just use your L shift when his hand is gonna punch down while charging up you can see its red thingy on his hand and timed it with your L shift to stop its hand then go full KKona shotgun blast on the back of his hand. Same thing when he is gonna swing his hand towards you, just use L shift.  \n5. Now on to phase 2 where he gets mad and starting to release 100+ missiles on you. When he does that just find a spot where the missiles is not gonna hit or use L shift. There's more, he also releases THOUSANDS of DARK ORB towards you but you can combo it with your L shift again and stay inside for a period of time and find a chance to dash to other orb and side stepping them, they moves pretty slow in the later orb. Blender also have a laser eye mechanic where you just need to dash constantly so the laser wouldn't catch up to you. When he gets tired of all that he will went into a faint mode where you will need to shoot the red exposing core on his back with rifle mode. This phase 2 mechanics is RNG so sometimes all of the mechanics will happen but sometimes he wouldnt depending on how long your fight is.\n6. So thats basically it, when you get his health to somewhat 10% left he will start channeling a full explosion where you will need to destroy all pillar looking thingy on the ground and you have won! Congrats.\n\nOverall its a decent indie game of around 1 hour of playtime, I am sure you can squeeze it to around couple hours of it if you didnt look up the tips of course :D, play it when you have time i absolutely recommend this!", "timestamp_created": 1608308039, "timestamp_updated": 1608308039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82628953": {"recommendationid": "82628953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010084835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1608303658}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, but well made.
