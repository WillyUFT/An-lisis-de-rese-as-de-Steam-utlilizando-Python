It's not where Kidnapped Girl goes. It's too short and too shallow to be a proper romance story, but tries to be one regardless. It doesn't go far enough to be truly unsettling or suspenseful, regardless of your choices. It also won't satisfy people who are into BDSM as it doesn't commit to the theme in any meaningful way and has very little that could be described as erotic content (what is there is very vanilla and text-only).\n\nIt's pretty much a nothing game that serves as little more than a short distraction. The only real positives are the nice-looking art and decent (Russian) voice acting for the girl. Whether that's enough for you... It's for you to decide. At least you won't be risking anything more than ~30 minutes of your time, but I still don't recommend it.\n\n----------------\n\nPS If you're interested in quality visual novels, check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32980295/]my curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1664553416, "timestamp_updated": 1664553416, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546391725540161133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122498317": {"recommendationid": "122498317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067976492", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1663617848}, "language": "english", "review": "THE FUUUUUUUUUCK", "timestamp_created": 1663617909, "timestamp_updated": 1663617909, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122241875": {"recommendationid": "122241875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389197970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1663181720}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short and simple, but not bad.

I don't know if the translation was at fault or if it was the story writing. The whole game just felt really bland. I mean sure, it had some nice CG and some cool looking backgrounds, but in terms of story and character development, this game just doesn't have one.\n\n\nFor example, the main character, Clive, is supposed to be a \"Psychopath that has always dreamed of hurting others\". The supposed character development in this is: NONE , we as the player don't really know why Clive doesn't want to hurt Alice. I mean sure, the dialogue says that he regrets cutting her, so he rushes out of the room in shock. Now, this whole reaction in itself, is believable hadn't the story tried to introduce Clive as a person without little to no emotions.\n\n\nThe main issue, was that Clive got introduced to us as being this emotionless \"Psychopath\", which he really isn't. I think the story would have been a little more interesting had Clive's intentions been a mystery for the player. That way, we could have probably felt a lot more shocked when he suddenly \"Grabbed a knife and pressed it against her chest\".\n\n\nThis whole story lacks [u][b]Tension[/b][/u] and a good [u][b]Buildup[/b][/u]. I mean sure, you could say 30-45 minutes isn't that much time for a buildup, and your right, but that doesn't excuse the lack of sounds in the right places, and some fleshed out dialogue that is appropriate for said scene.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]My personal advice:[/h2]\n\nIf the developer makes another game in the future, I would focus more on the buildup of a story, differentiating between different narrative perspectives, dividing the \"all-knowing narrator\" from the \"player\", because, we already know the protagonists intentions and motives (His motive is not really clear, we know he picked up the \"Psycho\" ideas from movies) really ruins the suprise and leaves little to no room for any tension and development of characters and their individual thoughts.", "timestamp_created": 1654120465, "timestamp_updated": 1654120465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514450907707214355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116236124": {"recommendationid": "116236124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315388093", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1653753112}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was short but i enjoyed it.

Wonderful visual design, but the characters seem very generic.\n6. Clive doesn't have a design/avatar\n7. The background is quite futuristic looking, the thing i like the most is the visual design and the color scheme choice.\n8.

It didn't fully live up to the potential reading time that was said to be the case. (While I didn't choose the second to last option to see if she admits to being hurt, since it seems the first option doesn't matter at all, I disregarded it.)\n\nThere's a lot of room for potential within the story, since it is clear that, despite the protagonist believing himself to be a psychopath (don't pretend you didn't expect to see spoilers in a REVIEW section of a visual novel of a free to play.), he is, in fact, not a psychopath. While it can be argued that, to some extent, psychopathy can breed from the double suicide of one's parents, the outcome is highly unlikely since full-on psychopathy, like all things, needs to be curated, taught by parental or environmental means. That said, this factoid about the protagonist is excellently expressed through Alice's dialogue, and also the protagonist's own POV, since he only believes he's a psychopath since he came from a lack of home (the double suicide of biological parents), and the fact he watches and listens extensively to psychopath-related media. Yet, in contrary to all of this, he has a nice uncle, which allows next to no room for psychopathy. \n\nInstead, I believe that the protagonist is not only a self-realizing character who knows he needs to get his life together lest he ends up like his parents (whose reason for it is unclear, but presumably it's something related to money)... but he's also attracted to psychopathy itself, as weird as it sounds. Think: A beautiful, yet quiet girl who doesn't stand out a lot, who comes from a broken home, and presumably, has decent (but not at all notable) grades overall. Having actually come from a broken home of the lot that breeds emotionally and intellectually unintelligent people, it wouldn't be out of the question that Alice herself is indeed realistically psychopathic to a medically certifiable extent. Especially considering the fact that quiet, mentally unsound people tend to come from such places with all the issues that run rampant in them; or at least are on the verge of being mentally unsound, and only need a drug and a gun to go shoot up a school.\n\nI would like to see the visual short story upgraded to a visual novella or novel, with some added characters in-between. I feel like this admittedly weird, yet humorous concept could be further explored upon with other characters being added into the story. Perhaps the protagonist gets a best friend who also happens to be a genuine stalker that's obsessed with investigating people, and eventually at some point in the story, makes a bet on challenging his belief that he's psychopathic? Maybe make the bet that, if he proves to the protagonist that he's not psychopathic, he names the firstborn child after the best friend? I dunno, just a general idea.\n\nTL;DR: Great story concept, but could definitely use expansion.

Kinda weird how the dev decide to write a follow-up to this game which is longer without voice acting and missing several of the enticing scenes that would otherwise qualify this visual novel to fall under the nudity category. One of the other mods as written for this game acts as a alternative universe or a prequel to the game it was originally written in Russian which was later translated using Google translate. However the translations are very poor in this game along with the subsequent mods for the game however that does not take away from the core story of the game itself. An overall while the cover art for the game appears to portray a certain type of story it is quite different once you should play it for yourself. Overall the plot for the story is subpar with minimal interaction with the game itself. This probably represents a beta of a visual novel and could definitely see improvement in the future. While the suggestions I would make for the game is that we include a lot more options or interactive choices within the novel. As I believe that this would make the game a lot more interesting with more routes in the end other than the two routes that were given with the Steam achievements. Overall for the subsequent follow-up mod to this game I feel like it is on the right track of what it wants to be however I feel like the publisher will probably offer full version of the mods uncensored at a cost given the current history of DLC's for this game. If your 13-year-old boy looking to find some to \"tiddy\", you will not find it within the base game itself however if you're that horny I would recommend one of the follow-up mods to the game or alternative universe. One of such mods I played was probably 15 times longer the base game itself. And while it did use several recycled assets along with certain visual aspects that were probably taken from boondocks or rule 34 it did have some interesting dialogue that a user of a visual novel might be interested in. It also fixes some of the previous complaints I had with the base game where unlike the base game this alternative universe actually provides some background information on the characters provided.", "timestamp_created": 1631345778, "timestamp_updated": 1631345918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99131131": {"recommendationid": "99131131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198997423116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1631319490}, "language": "english", "review": "Story 10/10\nVoice Acting 10/10\nMusic 10/10\nVisuals 10/10\n\nGreat Story .It is so intense and deep .The Plottwists were amazing .Alice for Waifu and Clive best Boi.

Depending upon your choices, there are two separate outcomes: ending N.1 or N.2. You will only have two to three decisions before the game is over and you have reached a conclusion to the story. The story briefly touches upon mental and physical abuse. Such as prostitution and suicide. Despite that, the characters feel flat. It is a very straightforward game: there is a girl that is a nobody at school and a popular kid that is a \"so-called\" psychopath. *Spoiler* The boy kidnapped her after school on his seventeenth birthday. He turns out to have saved her from her horrible household and she has a form of Stockholm syndrome. \n\nThis visual novel is very bland, not that I was expecting much from it, but I'm dyslexic and finished it under an hour. Not trying to bash the maker of the game due to the fact I have never made a game myself, but the plot is extremely simple to the point where it falls so short of expectations I had for the game when first downloaded. the plot feels like it was made by a ten-year-old that was just trying to see if he could make a game. In the entire game, there are only 2 achievements, and they are for the separate endings. \n\nI would claim Kidnapped Girl to be a waste of time; it is very easy to get both achievements in under forty minutes, which is nice if that is what the player's goal was. Other than that, this game lacks content, and it is hurting the game. So, I unfortunately can\u2019t recommend this to anyone.\n\nI would give this game one star out of five, because there was that little amount of substance in the game itself. But there were places where the translation from Russian to English could have been more ironed out. However, the quality of the game such as the art and the soundtrack  was far from what I was expecting.", "timestamp_created": 1628809175, "timestamp_updated": 1628809175, "voted_up": true,

He's great at school and studies really well, which 99% of the men who play this game definitely aren't. He's very clearly an ideal male fantasy, the kind of person men fantasize about, thinking that they're like him. Clive is sadistic, at first, which many \"Sadistic Dominant\" men will gravitate towards. \nAlice, the girl that was kidnapped in the game, is seemingly quiet and unassuming girl that Clive kidnaps. However, once kidnapped (after her first date with Clive, btw), she starts falling for him, since Clive admits to liking her. Alice is being abused at home, if you couldn't tell, and someone like Clive telling her that he loves her basically makes the love story happen. It gets worse as the game goes on, where Alice turns into a caricature of a woman, saying things along the lines of \"I'd let you do anything to me.\"\nAlice is part of a male fantasy where they want a submissive and masochistic girl who allows them to do whatever they want to her. She's the kind of girl that men long for, a damsel in distress that only lets someone like YOU put her in distress.\nI'm not the kind of person that would enjoy a game like this, to be honest.

The story has a sort of \"look at me being edgy\" vibe about the protagonist's fantasies, but without any self-awareness or humor. That \"not for those easily disturbed\" warning in the description is just an extension of that cluelessness. Believe me, the aspects of this game that might disturb a person who's found and downloaded it are disturbing because of what they reveal about the dev: a worldview akin to that of a pre-teen who's simultaneously discovered fanfic and the wonderful world of self-mutilation. \n\nI guess what makes it so jarring and worth a negative review is that there's no POINT to any of it. There are maybe four choices throughout the story (in which nothing happens), and there are two (similar) endings. There's no sexual artwork or attempt to arouse the player beyond one shot of the eponymous Kidnapped Girl in a soaked shirt. Not even the main character's fantasies are interesting because they aren't fleshed out. \n\nThat lack of a point is what lends credence to the idea that the dev actually thinks this is a Dark Love Story, rather than a case of focusing on titillation at the expense of a story. And to that I say, dawg, finding a woman who is so damaged and vulnerable that she has no other choice than to be with you doesn't sound like a recipe for hot sex, much less anything else.

engaging story at times, and character development. That being said, there are some downsides that may turn people off from finishing such a short game. \nUnderstandably, this game was first developed in Russian, and then translated into English, and so it suffers from a loss in translation. Most of the story is parsed, but grammatically at times it took away from the story immersion for English readers. I'm sure it reads better in Russian (I am barely able to read Russian so I have no place to stand)\nIt is unfortunate that we have so many time skips in the story that things are lost in the way of character development.\n[spoiler] This is seen particularly in the first week, where we barely see Clive and Alice at school, and suddenly he decides he cannot stomach hurting her like he thought [/spoiler]\nI wish that this scene was extended to show more of the in between, to show character development between them, and give a legitimate reason why things developed as they did. \n\nI would love for this game to be remastered in language, VA, Sound Effects, and Story, and would definitely pay money for a longer more in depth look at these characters lives, where they came from, flashback scenes and all.", "timestamp_created": 1617623045, "timestamp_updated": 1617623045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89738662": {"recommendationid": "89738662", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074544051", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1614030959}, "language": "english", "review": "I need a sequel or atleast a longer story PLS", "timestamp_created": 1617584806, "timestamp_updated": 1617584806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89696997": {"recommendationid": "89696997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215035545", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1617535904}, "language": "english", "review": "good game just wish they added more gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1617535945, "timestamp_updated": 1617535945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89672495": {"recommendationid": "89672495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387847810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1595390947}, "language": "english", "review": "porn", "timestamp_created": 1617499836, "timestamp_updated": 1617499836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89662123": {"recommendationid": "89662123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198926116043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1617485305}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically it tells the story of a boy who wants to torture and commit feminicide, why?, why not?, according to the plot, but according to the time he discovers that the girl is constantly beaten by her stepfathers and she prostitutes herself in the attempt to get money to get out of this house, when the guy in the story discovers this, his mind breaks and/or they end up together or in the \"friendzone\" as the achievements represent, he gets a 6/10 score because this story is very relatable in certain cities and regions, where stepfathers always try to get rid of children, the minority in this case.", "timestamp_created": 1617485395, "timestamp_updated": 1643484172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485841184854507446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89595717": {"recommendationid": "89595717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405769193", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1617402891}, "language": "english", "review": "The story needs more work.

I want more! more overall, the story is quite touching and the characters are very nice; but Id wish for the possibility of this game to be 5 hours long gameplay or more and also It would be nice to have an ending called \"The Reformed\" where Clive \"the psycopath\" and Alice \"the pr0st1tut3\" become better changing thanks to helping/loving each other.\nI also really like that this game, by the title could seem like a very dark and sinister game, but it\u00b4s actually like a \"Damsel in distress\" mixed with \"Beauty and the Beast\" that makes this a loves tory out of everything that one could think as an stereotypical love story from before.", "timestamp_created": 1615180558, "timestamp_updated": 1615180558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

This is going to be hard, because to say to much, is to give it all away, but to make sense, I'd have to give it all away.\n\nLet's break it down like this, it's Russian voice acted with an obvious manga/anime inspiration. Both the art and music are simply lovely. The game is free, but you can give money to the developer as donations, and you can buy the soundtrack. I may or may not get the soundtrack, I've not decided. I liked the music, but I'm not sure I want to support this. But I'm not sure I don't want to either.\n\nThe story, is the Russian kind of odd. I played to completion and earned one of two endings. Not sure I'm going back for the other ending. The \"protagonist\" is a 17 year old boy, and the girl is presumably 16 to 18. You could interpret the plot (that developed for the ending that I received) in a number of different ways.\n\nThere is kidnapping and there is drugging. There are illusion to prostitution, torture, abuse, and rape. But what I got with my choices, the art didn't actually go farther than fanservicy.\n\nThe way it treats the subject matter is somewhat shockingly casual. I'm not totally sure if this is meant to get people to think, to introspect, or maybe to help get their jollies off. Probably a concerted effort to all three.\n\nThis is both disgusting and beautiful in the same way the movie, KIDS, is disgusting and beautiful. But this is arguably more twisted. I guess it gets the up vote even with me being conflicted, mostly out of appreciation to the developer for putting something like this that would leave a lot of people torn, or disgusted, for free.

Which kind of checks out, since the character seems both unaware of sex, and like he hasn't yet reached the stage of puberty where you care to learn more. Which is why there's no adult content in this, not that it'd be good if there were.\nUnfortunately, due to the amount of names listed in credits, I'd assume it was actually written by your friendly neighbourhood Russian neckbeard virgin, with a hardcore case of learning difficulties.\nI'm unable to take any of the content seriously. You get a constant feel of \"Of course that's the case, why wouldn't it be\" with every character development. Why are they living in a space ship? Great question. I wish I knew. \nIf you guys have played Steins;Gate, imagine Hyounin Kyouma, if he still acted that way after he had any sort of trauma, and everyone else told him it was super cool, and he was super attractive and incredible. \nMost unrealistic thing I've ever read.

He estado todo el cap\u00edtulo jug\u00e1ndolo en modo ventana con el traductor de google al lado. \n\nSe supone que es una historia donde tus decisiones importan (y deben importar, ya que hay momentos donde debes elegir qu\u00e9 sucede), pero solo tomas 2 decisiones que determinan el desarrollo de la historia, y no me parece ni siquiera que sean claves, as\u00ed que al final es un Corto donde hay que ir d\u00e1ndole click al rat\u00f3n para ir avanzando.\n\nEl chico es un psic\u00f3pata que sabe que es psic\u00f3pata (no es tan habitual saberlo ya a esa edad). La explicaci\u00f3n de por qu\u00e9 lo es, en teor\u00eda la da el T\u00edo, pero al final es un t\u00f3pico de todos los perturbados con pasado tormentoso. La historia podr\u00eda parecerse a la de Issei Sagawa, el tipo japon\u00e9s que asesin\u00f3 a su amiga y luego se la comi\u00f3, ya que \u00e9l al principio tampoco se atrev\u00eda a matar a las prostitutas a las que hac\u00eda ir a su casa, pero \u00e9l lo que quer\u00eda era com\u00e9rselas, \u00e9ste hacerlas sufrir.\n\nPara m\u00ed es una historia que no te la crees. Ni la chica que est\u00e1 mega-buena y no habla con nadie en clase, ni las razones del chico para hacer lo que hace. En teor\u00eda tienes que empatizar o con \u00e9l o con ella, y obviamente con el asesino junior no empatizas, pero es que de ella no te crees el personaje. Al final el mejor es el T\u00edo el empresario, que se marca un par de chistes sexuales se\u00f1al\u00e1ndoles con el dedo a lo Julio Iglesias. Y con eso me quedo, me re\u00eddo un par de veces.\n\nEn general, por el ingl\u00e9s que tiene, los personajes, la nula interactividad y la parte de la historia que yo he podido ver... creo que no es recomendable para la mayor\u00eda, aunque no consume mucho tiempo, para eso te ves una peli, no s\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1606451073, "timestamp_updated": 1606451073, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80392222": {"recommendationid": "80392222", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026705047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1593105277}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good.

"review": "The Good - Firstly, this Visual Novel looks good, the Cyberpunk feel is there, and the voice acting is top notch. Alice has Stockholm Syndrome and it shows. Sorta. The Uncle is acts like any Uncle would and appears to be a very smart and perceptive man, and its good. \n\nThe Bad - This story ends way to quickly, like extremely quickly. I see a lot of people give amazing reviews on the feeling they get from this story...it's all false. The idea is that the main character (Clive) is a psychopath, and wants to hurt people by torture and end their life. This character acts more like a dude with just a weird fetish and has no idea how to perform that fetish rather than be a murderer. He constantly brags about being a psychopath and a maniac....things people with that kind of mental problem dont do. Threw me off a lot. A lot of us can relate to some moment where we thought about what it would be like to murder someone, its a fairly common thought actually....this is not it. It's definitely heavily inspired by the anime tropes. I also find it a bit weird that just the female character is voiced....I would have not gone that route if everyone that has major dialogue moments in this story could not be voiced. \n\nConclusion - Regardless of how bad the Bad is for me, I want to assume they're going to add more to this story...but it's been out for a while. I understand that the artwork takes time...and that writing the story takes time, along with the coding as even the voice acting. The problem in the end is that the story is not even that long...I would say it would take no more than 15 -20 minutes to finish for those who read fast. 30-35 for those who read a little slower. That....isn't a lot for a Visual Novel, even a free one. Dont get me wrong, that's what has this gaming doing so well, it's free. \n\nThe problem is going to be the age ol' argument that why should I complain when it's free? Easily, because criticism can help make a game better, or help developers learn for their next IPs. Free doesnt make any product safe from bad reviews. And honestly, this isn't even a bad review, I just can't recommend it in it's current state. Period.

I wish there was something other than \"up\" and \"down\" vote. The VN had lovely artwork but the story was complete nonsense. The characters felt very unrealistic from the start and it didn't improve with the very short run time. The main character, Clive, was completely unlikable and a bit of an idiot. Alice was a power fantasy harem character...without the harem. Clive's uncle was so clueless and one dimensional, all of his \"jokes\" were completely from left field and utterly unfunny. The music was both beautiful and terrible. In the first scene I turned it off at the second song because it was load and distracting, it didn't fit with the tone of what was happening. But the ending song was very lovely and I watched the ending credits in entirety twice in order to hear more. The endings were okay but as the characters and the dialogue were so unlikable I didn't care about them. \nI think I have to give this a thumbs down. I didn't hate it, and the writer can certainly improve, but decent music and beautiful artwork do not make a visual novel. You MUST have a good story and likable characters or your medium falls apart.\n\nTL/DR: Story was contrived, characters were unrealistic, music was hit and miss, but the art was lovely. Try it because it's free, donate to the creators so they might improve their craft, but this wasn't good.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1605717362, "timestamp_updated": 1605717362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79447373": {"recommendationid": "79447373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114919704", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1605680338}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a nice, quick visual novel game.

Don't get me wrong we get to know Clive and Alice very Very well... but it feels like some things were loosely attached specifically the unseen side characters. The parents I wish were explored a bit more just to add more development to the main characters\n\nI understand this game is in it's beta and updates are happening on it in a fair pace, and the way it ends leaves for a great potential sequel if the dev decides to do it. And since it's in it's beta (I think) It leaves for more opportunity for the game to get updated and improved a bit, maybe we'll see English voice acting and more dynamic scenes.\n\ntl:dr Great game, Good story and graphics, Good for a start but needs a few tweaks", "timestamp_created": 1600469221, "timestamp_updated": 1600469221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76146712": {"recommendationid": "76146712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806528683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1605940877}, "language": "english", "review": "Poor imitation of the Witcher 3.", "timestamp_created": 1600390138, "timestamp_updated": 1600390138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508130073547363281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76145937": {"recommendationid": "76145937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119362786", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1600388499}, "language": "english", "review": "so for a free visual novel, i would say give it an hour of your time.

I mean After all i have like 200+ hours on DDLC. So maybe I enjoy this dark romance genre. If you love visual novels check this short one out or don't think you can read a lot try this one out. If you could get through it in one play-through, you're officially a pro go buy visual novels now!

was unconscious but notices she has bruises. after finding out she had already been defiled, he tried to play it off by telling her she passed out. she immediately knew it was a lie and calls him out. he finally spills his true intention of torturing her. she didnt seem shocked and didnt want to leave. she eventually leaves and comes back crying saying she wants to be kidnapped by main character.\nhe lets her live in his uncles mansion by hiding her for a month or so. in that time he eventually asked if she would agree to be tied up by him. thinking it was a fetish, she agreed since she fell for the guy for some reason. he took out a knife and pressed down on her chest. as blood is drawn he runs out of the room and questions his sanity. he questions why he felt so bad after doing something he wanted for so long. through terribly story writing the author pretty much is saying he is no longer a psyocpath and the main character is too out of touch to realize. he comes back and unties her and they have a little argument but she eventually cools down. some time passes and main character's uncle finds out she has been living with him. hes cool with it and makes lewd jokes. he reveals to her that main characters parents both killed themselves infront of him. after knowing this the girl felt more of an attraction to the main character knowing they both come from bad backgrounds. the main character went in to wake girl up one morning and she said nothing would wake her up, even if a rapist walked in. he jumped on the bed and hovered over her. she then invited him under the blanket (??? wtf is this story even) and they make out. and they become boyfriend and girlfriend. the end", "timestamp_created": 1596040818, "timestamp_updated": 1596040818, "voted_up":

It turns out that what is supposed to be a psychopath and an innocent schoolgirl soon becomes a BDSM story involving bondage and slight bloodshed with a dom and a sub.  Fortunately, the material is light, but that doesn't make it too great.\n\nSince this game is short and the characters are the primary focus, I would like to deviate from my normal reviews and perform an individual character analysis.\n\nFirst, we start with Clive, the protagonist, the psychopath, the...well...you.  Clive abducts Alice, a quiet girl in his class, with the fantasies of torturing her after kidnapping her.  He dreams of cutting her and reveling in his marks upon her skin.  Upon witnessing that someone has beat him to the punch and has already abused her, he gets second thoughts.  Immediately, he begins to fall for her while pretentiously thinking of himself in a positive light not unlike Light Yagami from [i]Death Note[/i].  He lies to this girl and to his doting uncle, without whom, he would be homeless on the streets.  Sure, we end up getting a sob backstory, but it does not excuse his actions.  Even though we end up in a position where we're supposed to like him or sympathize with him, I simply cannot.  This mentally ill and pretentious child never got enough beatings and would prefer to see others suffer at his hand just to his pleasure.  I personally despised this character from beginning to end.  There is no redemption for him and instead you just get a case where he's just annoyed by his victim.\n\nNext, we move on to the uncle, Edward.  Edward is a kind man who cares for his nephew, oblivious to what goes on through his nephew's mind.  He knows the backstory of Clive's parents and sympathizes for him especially since one of Clive's parents was his older sibling, so he assumes the role of a father to care for the young orphan.  Edward is simply a hard character to hate.  I agree with the sentiment of others that he is throwaway, but he seems to be the only thing that moved the story along since the other 2 characters would be stuck in this strange loop.  He has no real dynamic in the weird relationship, but that's exactly why he stands out.  To ground the story that's already quite a mess.\n\nFinally, we move on to our [i]Kidnapped Girl[/i] and the driving force behind the whole narrative, Alice.  Alice is a kind girl with an awful living situation.  When she's not in school, she deals with horrors in her daily life.  A victim in all regards who simply wishes for the best in life, for positivity, to be cared for.  She is Clive's opposite in every regard and whose nature is very hard to dislike.  I hate how she emphasizes about her extra-curricular activity, which only needs to be said once or not at all since it seems to only seek pity points.  When the protagonist chooses to harm her, I cannot do anything but feel bad for her, yet the story wants me to feel bad for the protagonist, who is simply a piece of sh*t.  Alice, who could have growth as a character instead chooses to fall in love with her kidnapper instead of scolding his actions.  Where you would expect her to beg for help or to scold you for logical reasons like the physical harm, she chooses not to act on those.  That's her biggest flaw as a character which reminds you of how unrealistic her character is.  When she's finally affectionate in both endings without the \"rap*st\" card being played, she's quite a sweet and loving character.  Both endings make Alice's character really shine as a sweat bean of a girl that anyone would be lucky to have.\n\nThe visuals of this game?  The CGs, portrait art, and the backrounds simply look fantastic.  The backgrounds are of a futuristic sci-fi building that...simply look awesome, yet this story may have been better with a more modern setting.  The Artwork includes only two characters.  Alice, who is simply a hotty, and Edward, an older and unkempt gentleman whose stress shows on his face with every appearance.  As for the music, it's pretty nice.  Both the visuals and the audio are solid points that this game has to offer.\n\nIf I have any problems I have not mentioned, it would be the occasional capitalized words throughout the narrative.  Aside from that, it would be the awful writing of the protagonist along with the unrealistic behavior of Alice who seems to think of her situation as a wonderland instead of a grim scenario.\n\nSo, would I recommend [i]Kidnapped Girl[/i]?  If I have to consider all aspects, I would say yes.  It's a short game that took me about 40 minutes to read through the bad route and 10-15 additional minutes to read the good route (skipping pre-read dialogue).  While I hated some of the writing choices, I cannot ignore the efforts put into the visuals and the audio as well as a few moments in the writing where Alice really shined as a character...when she wasn't getting off on the thought of being abused by her kidnapper.\n\n6/10  I can see where this was supposed to be a good idea as it went on, but it's only marred by poor choices of the writer who chose to employ his fetishes and poor character development.", "timestamp_created": 1595733496, "timestamp_updated": 1595733524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723041772842407227", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73288246": {"recommendationid": "73288246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387395836", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1595729235}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this is a really fun VN.

First off, Clive is extremely screwed up to betray her trust and try to hurt her again (When he cut her chest) after lying to her in the first place. HOWEVER I literally had to play this game the maximum four times to get the 'Happy Alice' achievement and ending. After focusing on the perceived character design, the choices that are made ONLY affect Alice's affection toward Clive in theory, even though he is the one who friend zones her, there is no actual way to convince Clive to date her based on logical choices. One player choice is a lie, and the other is a conversation he will never hear about. Despite the fact that the choices in the game do not affect Clive's feelings AT ALL both in theory and the story, they only affect Alice, who is friend zoned anyway. It felt like a guessing game instead of a good and logical visual novel. \n\nThe story and plot made me feel... sick honestly but, that would deserve my appreciation because I got one of two expectations that I had from this game, to either be entertained by a good story or to be entertained because of disturbance. This non-recomendation is only because the story and the choices in the game make no sense at all both logically and in character design. \n\nAfter all, it is a free game and there is no hate or shaming to either the fans or the creator intended through this review.

I understand stuff like this takes time and appeals to an audience like me, but I have a few problems with the game itself. \n\nNow, I really don't like to kink shame, BUT WHAT IN THE HELL IS THIS? \n\n     So I came across this game looking for terrible dating sim games, and I can say in that regard I was not disappointed. \nNow, I will say that the game isn't terrible in every regard. The art itself is done very well and some of the writing is pretty good. \n\n     On the topic of writing, it's not all without criticism. (Spoilers ahead!) The game starts out with our main character, Clive giving a monologue on how he's a psychopath and guys it's just \"We live in a society!\" After the monologue Clive kidnaps a girl named Alice on his 17th birthday. When Clive goes to be an awful person and almost tortures and rapes Alice, he notices bruises on her body and prevents himself from being an awful person.\n\n     Now, I really don't care what goes on in your bedroom or what you get off too, as long it's not awful or illegal. This game borders on illegal, and that's not good.\n     \n     Now, if you want to make a game to explore deeper into the more darker stuff, you can pull that off great, take for example DDLC. (I'm aware that's a much overused example, but it really does the job and doesn't come across as borderline illegal.) But Kidnapped Girl just comes across as a borderline illegal and really hammers in the idea that maybe people should stop making these types of anime dating sims.\n", "timestamp_created": 1595193847, "timestamp_updated": 1595193847, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393025130033493042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72962618": {"recommendationid": "72962618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958073199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1653277284}, "language": "english", "review": "I kidnapped a girl\nIt didn't work out as i planned\nWe're now dating\nWhat am i doing with my life anymore", "timestamp_created": 1595183496, "timestamp_updated": 1595183496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72961768": {"recommendationid": "72961768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220020587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1595181987}, "language": "english", "review": "i was wishing to do this in high school, I realize my dream now", "timestamp_created": 1595182157, "timestamp_updated": 1595182157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72942745": {"recommendationid": "72942745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342978286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1592762223}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful tale about a boy rediscovering his humanity, and a girl learning to love herself.

The premise starts out with a \"trying not to be wacky and serious dark beginning\" and ends up something that isn't that.  The story is rather short but that does not really take away much from the plot.  It's simply a short story and just because something isn't as long as say The Wheel of Time series that doesn't mean it's bad.  Overall it's worth 30-40 min of your day and if there was a more organic and less psycho way of introducing the main two characters then this could be a really good story that I would not mind watching if there was an anime adaption.  As it stands I say it's good and would recommend.  Not great but good.  This is where I think that the length actually plays to the strength of this particular game since devoting 2+ hours to have the resolution that you're given...  ehh... It would be unsatisfying.  I do wish there was more story development and character development.  There were some things that were brought up an were not further elaborated on...  Like...  You can't just say that particular thing and just not do something with it!  It does give an excuse for the start of the story-line but still!  As for the disturbing points on the game?  Kinda underwhelming.  I'll be honest it was not all too bad but I understand that some people faint at the sight of a drop of blood so I get it.  The warning is there.  You were warned.\n\nEither way, good game and I recommend.  Good art, cute character concept, very few choices and the story does not branch far from any choice made.  The writer of the story has a LOT of potential for a slice of life game.  That is a talent that they need to hone, it's not a negative criticism but rather an observation that it could be a underdeveloped strength and I'm interested in what potential stories come out of that kind of talent.  Not great but I honestly don't think a game this short could be great.  I give it a 4 out of a possible 7.\n\n\n\n***Maybe Spoilers, still trying to not give them but proceed with caution***\n\n\nSadly the situation with Alice, while is on the extreme end and may seem like much, isn't out of the realm of reality.  I think the story writer wanted to do more of a slice of life story but wanted a catch, a gimmick. a hook to get players interested.  If that isn't the case then I am at a loss for words.  While the game does portray itself in a certain light trying to be \"psycho thriller\" and \"kidnapping and torture\" the actual game play isn't?  Such stories are very difficult to write as you not only have to understand more than what the average person knows about psychopaths and how they act and the actions they are most likely to take.  You know...  Getting into the head of a murderer/sociopath/psychopath.  You have to describe these things in a story format that an audience, who's not well acquainted with that subject, can understand and bring about organic development that can be enjoyed.  I don't think this game achieves that but then that's aiming for a really difficult target.  Yes there was some character development with the parents thing, the events that happened afterwards being a tie as to why the story started the way it did.  But...  I dunno.  Kinda felt like the A plot on a Family guy episode that is quickly ditched to focus on the B plot that the episode actually is about.\nDespite all that, I do recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1594615312, "timestamp_updated": 1594615312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72597214": {"recommendationid": "72597214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271330147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1594607217}, "language": "english", "review": "scam the girl wanted to be kidnapped \nplay if your interested why", "timestamp_created": 1594607486, "timestamp_updated": 1594607486, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479043871164321899", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72594930": {"recommendationid": "72594930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170447026", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1594602594}, "language": "english", "review": "Just because a game is free doesn't mean you should play it. The only good part of [i]Kidnapped Girl[/i] is the art, which looks rather nice. Everything else about it is absymal.\n\nFirstly, the pacing is absolutely horrendous. Everything happens way too quickly, and it seems evident to me that the developer only actually cares about the ~drama~ of it all so they rush through 90% of the story to get to the dramatic parts.\n\nSecondly, these characters are pretty horrible. \n\nAlice is just our angst fest waifu, who struggles with being molested and beaten by her stepmom's boyfriend and having to do prostitution to make money. Only problem is, she seems pretty unaffected by it. She has this incredibly tragic backstory and horrible home life so we feel bad for her, but I don't feel bad for her when she acts like getting beaten and r//ped on the regular is just a mild annoyance.\n\nI don't understand how she's just cool with Clive kidnapping her. Maybe it could be spun into this tragic story of \"she was okay with it because he said he loved her and she would do anything for just a shred of love because she's never had any,\" which would be an interesting story indeed, but that's not the story being told. Once again, she just acts like being kidnapped was a mild annoyance, and chooses to live with her kidnapper and start up a romance with him.\n\nIt's not even really stockholm syndrome because he makes her leave but then she comes back and wants to stay, despite only having been technically kidnapped for a very short amount of time.\n\nAnd Clive...oh boy is he a hot mess. Look, I don't like to give flak to visual novel protagonists, but my god is he terrible. He considers himself a psychopath who wants to torture women, but with the love of our tragic waifu Alice who loves him despite him admitting to kidnapping and wanting to torture her, his urges are subdued. Yes, my favorite trope, the girl who can fix terrible men with her love /s.\n\nAnd look, I get where you were going with Clive, his parents' deaths really messed him up (as they should) and it made him think he was a psychopath, but the story really didn't out enough focus on his psychological issues and just gave them a passing mention. At least it's better than what they did with Alice's psychological issues, aka not touching on them at all.\n\nIn short, just don't play this game.

Their job is to support the story and their doing it well.\n\nThe art of the two visible characters is really well made, they are sharp, with a good amount of detail and attractive designs.

[b] I went into this game with the boys not expecting much, but was met with much more than expected. [/b] You play as a 14 year old edge lord who tries to let his demons out on this sick dude anime girl. However you are not 14 and are actually 17, I lied, but the story feels this way.\n\nActually though, some flaws about the writing. (I'll try not to spoil.) Some of the different aspects of the characters aren't consistent/make sense for the characters, reminding you that this is in fact a game. Some moments that should have a good impact just, don't give that effect. Most of the reason's why I felt an impact was because anime girl cute, and not anime girl well written, ya know? Even though I joked about it the main character really just acts like a 14 year old in their edgy phase, saying he's a psychopath when he is an ignorant little shit living in his own world. While some plot holes were filled in the end, most areas were left unsolved and the ending just isn't too great on how it was lead up to be.\n\nDespite the writing problems, this game definitely excels art-wise. The CGI's of the characters are perfect as well as the backgrounds. It doesn't add to the story at all but the 4 futuristic backgrounds are a nice thing to look at, however school is a void for some reason... cool. Although one detail stands out to me. You may notice the door in the background of the bedroom looks cool but dang is that an inefficient door. How do you open it? Maybe with the light sensor above it so that checks out but the fact that it isn't on the ground doesn't help its case. All doors are flush with the floor for ease of access but the fact that the lip you have to step over is on the door is there takes me out of this world. It may not seem like much but you have to go over that every time, do you have any idea how tremendous this little thing would be after going through that door over and over and over? The hallway has a regular door, why can't the bedroom? \n\n[i]That's all I have to say, the recap is 10/10 art but don't expect to find the next Hayao Miyazaki when it comes to story.[/i]\n\n[b]...until you encounter Edward.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1593103569, "timestamp_updated": 1628185579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730244934558868408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71325736": {"recommendationid": "71325736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233199848", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1593097943}, "language": "english", "review": "Very great story depth, EB Games Management Rates it a 10/10,\nLooking forward to the next one.\n\nEB Games Management.", "timestamp_created": 1593098275, "timestamp_updated": 1593098275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71324400": {"recommendationid": "71324400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198960900508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1593096407}, "language": "english", "review": "it was very fun to play through, i can highly recommend it, it reminded me of how me and my actual life is, so its fun for me, it has interesting story and i would love to see what happens next, this is almost a most try for people who like these kind of games", "timestamp_created": 1593096351, "timestamp_updated": 1593096351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71303379": {"recommendationid": "71303379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193455797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1593057661}, "language": "english", "review": "NGL this is a terrible game.

In all honesty, I just wish more decisions were added even if they were small little decisions just to make it feel like you had more control over the situation. I loved this game and at first played it as a joke by thinking, \"Kidnap Simulator\", but I started to actually enjoy the story. The characters did feel a little one sided at times like Clive is just the stuck up jock and Alice is the sad emo girl you see in class, but it was enjoyable to see how they acted when they were together and those were probably the best moments in my opinion. I think the game just needs longer time to truly flesh out these characters because this character combination could really create something amazing.

The story constantly bends the rules of the world and how basic humans work to make sweaty teens jerk off. the amount of reviews where people are celebrating and approving of the activities in this game sickens me.", "timestamp_created": 1592551884, "timestamp_updated": 1592783177, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45144355297088623", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71013519": {"recommendationid": "71013519", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036180919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1592548007}, "language": "spanish", "review": "gran experiencia inmersiva, buena animeacion y graficos gran historia y gran paja", "timestamp_created": 1592548147, "timestamp_updated": 1592548147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795862734317779541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71013254": {"recommendationid": "71013254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972541456", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1601642334}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game but i got both endings and got neither of the echievments", "timestamp_created": 1592547513, "timestamp_updated": 1592547513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71010433": {"recommendationid": "71010433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366213228", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1592837480}, "language": "english", "review": "Very appetizing story development.

Withdrawn into his own mind and hatred for other people who he perceives as weak. Finds himself drawn out of his shell by the concept of serial killers and psycopaths seeing in himself a kinship with these clearly broken people. Seeing himself as broken he gives in to his desires and kidnaps a lonely girl desperate for company, only to find he cant bring himself to actually do the deed - the sight of her abused flesh disgusting him. \n\nAfter realising he cant bring himself to hurt her he elects to just kick her out, but Alice goes home to find her abusive-drunken stepfather who molests her and tries to rape her. The realisation that a self proclaimed spycopath and kidnapper showed her more kindess than her own 'guardian' along with her own desperation for kindess makes her return to Clive. Begging him to take her back. What begins is Clive trying to understand his own feelings and desires while Alice clings to him, hoping he will love her back.\n\nThe most telling scene is later where Clive decides to tie Alice up and brandishes a knife, thinking his feelings for her must be a desire to fulfill his twisted fantasies. Only for when he sees the fear and pain in her eyes, he realises he never wanted this. Disgusted he leaves her, hating himself.\n\nEven with this, Alice still feels safer with Clive than she ever did at home so she stays by him. Finally starting to understand him after Clive's uncle explains he watched his parents commit suicide when he was 7. Alice elects to make Clive love her back and finally after understanding each other better they finally do fall in love and start a relationship.\n\nIt was painfully short, but I loved it enough to donate to the author and I hope to see more from them some day.", "timestamp_created": 1592522392, "timestamp_updated": 1592522392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606123983860015869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71001933": {"recommendationid": "71001933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259395158", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1592521725}, "language": "english", "review": "My speedrun for this game is 1 miute 58 seconds", "timestamp_created": 1592521765, "timestamp_updated": 1592521765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669386684894561768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70999669": {"recommendationid": "70999669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216617601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1663868975}, "language": "english", "review": "A good visual novel story.", "timestamp_created": 1592517405, "timestamp_updated": 1592517405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517368495464324951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70997239": {"recommendationid": "70997239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025198614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1592512797}, "language": "english", "review": "Had potential but very short and story did not go anywhere, seemed like the first chapter of a book and was surprised it ended so abruptly", "timestamp_created": 1592513116, "timestamp_updated": 1592513116, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70996994": {"recommendationid": "70996994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114611417", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1592512023}, "language": "english", "review": "At first I was a bit sceptical about the storyline since it seemed to lack details since no one seemed to notice anything.\nThough throughout the game, things were cleared up and resulted in a really enjoyable short story game.\nThe only thing that I would have wanted more has to be a bigger pool of self-made choices.\n\nGreat game, can't wait for part two if it's going to be made!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1592512696, "timestamp_updated": 1592512696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70996950": {"recommendationid": "70996950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137363142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1592512517}, "language": "english", "review": "meh. . .", "timestamp_created": 1592512618, "timestamp_updated": 1592512618, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70988157": {"recommendationid": "70988157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060576203", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 604, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1592498673}, "language": "english", "review": "Teen thinks he\u2019s a psycho.

However, he changes his mind and starts to learn that Alice has quite a tragic background.\n\nThis game is a visual novel which means it is just about reading the story. There are a few choices to make along the way and two endings to achieve. It should take around a half-hour to read everything.\n\nStarting off with the art, it is generally good. As is the case with most visual novels, this game sticks to a rather standard anime style for its characters. Its use in the game is okay, but nothing too spectacular. The background art is interesting and it evokes a kind of futuristic setting, though it is unclear why this is.\n\nThe main reason to play any visual novel is the characters and story. To cut to the chase here, both are terrible. There are only three characters in the game. These are the aforementioned Clive and Alice and also Clive's uncle and guardian Edward. Clive comes off as a really unlikable protagonist, though I do not know how he could possibly be written as a sympathetic character considering he is openly psychopathic. He also reeks of being a Mary Sue and at one point is said to \"have excellent grades,\" \"get prizes,\" and \"good at sports,\" but, aww geez, he is still not happy or content! Even as Alice falls in love with him, he just pushes off her advances like some stereotypical misogynist who sees himself above feminine wiles.\n\nAlice is also very crudely written. Despite ostensibly being a high school student, she is depicted as being a prostitute forced to sell her body on the street for unclear reasons. She is also shown as having been beat up and mistreated by her stepmother. This just feels like a pathetic attempt to torture a character so the player-character and, through him, the player are supposed to sympathize with her. But it all just felt so ham-fisted and stupid. Instead, she comes off as nothing more than an object in Clive's story with characterization that does not make a lick of sense. The establishing premise has her literally kidnapped by Clive and almost tortured/raped by him, and yet not only is she rather quick to forgive him for such gross transgressions, she starts to fall in love with him. It is like some twisted Stockholm syndrome story. I mean, keep in mind that what Clive does makes him a [i]literal criminal[/i], but, hey, Alice is okay with it because I guess Clive felt a little bad, or something.\n\nThere is not much to say about the Edward character other than he is little more than a \"cool\" uncle type who cracks a few sex jokes.\n\nIf it is not clear from the above, the writing overall in this game is abysmal. The whole premise of the game of kidnapping a girl is treated shockingly flippantly. I mean, this is a game about kidnapping and trying to torture a teenage girl, yet it never feels like the game takes any of this very seriously and certainly does not try to depict these horrible things realistically. Heck, they even managed to throw in a couple of rape jokes, too! Also, though this is a minor point, the setting appears to be some kind of futuristic or science fiction setting (or, considering all of the neon, perhaps what the 1980s thought the future would look like), but this fact is not even mentioned once. Why include it?\n\nOverall, this game's very existence is baffling to me. The characters are appallingly written and act in ways that are incredibly unrealistic. I really have no idea what kind of target audience the developers of this game had in mind except maybe for those with some kind of weird kidnapping fetish if only because I cannot see anyone else who would enjoy this garbage.
