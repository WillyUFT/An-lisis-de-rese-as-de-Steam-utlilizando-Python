It is so immersive that you have to explore/intuit the controls. I was able to figure out how to do nearly everything because it has controls in common with most other games. But I was more than halfway through the game before I figured out how to \"run.\" So, in case anyone else is as slow as I was, here are the controls:\nWA - forward/backward, AD - strafe left/right, Mouse - aim, Left mouse button - grab/release, Right mouse button - sonic punch, Spacebar - jump (double jumping possible), Shift - hold to run. There are places in the game where navigating the level is much easier if you know how to run and jump; because I hadn't figure it out by that point in the game, it became a very complicated game of precision parkour. Learn from my mistake!\n\nI really, really enjoyed this. I found the mechanism of interacting with droids to get pieces of the story told through dialogue really engaging and fun. So the final chapter had me puzzled, as it's a complete departure from everything in the rest of the game: different character, different location, different controls, different lighting, different story (the only possible context you might have is given by an overheard conversation you can easily miss in chapter 1). The controls in this last part were particularly frustrating, as there is no ability to strafe: it's all tank steering, in which you rotate the body and move forward. I got stuck several times when I overshot a jump and then had to turn in complete darkness, unsure which direction my character was facing. It's a disappointing and confusing denouement to the game to me, as the first four chapters told such an engaging narrative.\n\n[u]Review[/u]: In the future when travel to Mars is feasible, the Earth's climate has gone haywire, leading to a severe Ice Age that has left no part of the Earth with a growing zone. Life as we know it is ending on Earth, so the humans initiate two parallel efforts to save everything: [spoiler]drilling to the center of the Earth, and drilling to the center of Mars. Both of these schemes involve doing something with the core of the planet to produce enough heat to make the planet livable. Mars has been a destination for space tourists for some time, and though there are no long-term human colonies on Mars because the radiation from space kills Terrestrial life fairly quickly, they have found bacteria, suggesting that more complex life could be sustained on Mars under the right conditions. So an enormous operation is started on Mars, with huge factories in orbit creating and maintaining a work force of sentient robots whose job it is to terraform the planet. The game begins as the robots on Mars have already built a space elevator and various science and engineering bases on the surface. They have a huge drill assembly that is burrowing down into the planet, trying to reach the core that they hope to ignite (the details of \"how?\" and \"why?\" are a little light here - it may be that the assumption is that the core is a ferrous solid, and they want to somehow raise the temperature to turn it molten so that the convection of the iron will create stronger magnetic fields to shield the planet from cosmic radiation, but none of that is explained).  But the deeper they've drilled into the planet, the more marsquakes they've experienced, to the point that their installations are taking damage and the robots are skeptical that their operations will be able to continue for much longer. You play a DOG unit, a fusion-powered robot floating on four fusion thrusters with manipulators that enable you to lift, toss, and destroy items using powerful force fields. The robots have sent drones down into the drill shaft, and they haven't returned or reported in, so you're being sent to find them and retrieve whatever data they recorded. On the way, you help out a number of android robots who are slower, clumsier, and less capable than you are: finding a box in a sandstorm and loading it onto the space elevator, refueling a generator for the greenhouse experiments, etc. Descending into the mine to find the drones, you are accompanied by a chatty robot, Android 42, whose job it is to copy the data from the drones while your job is to find and clear a path to them. On the way you find that, deep inside Mars, there are ancient tunnels that have been excavated over centuries by directed flows of running water, and then you find statues with hands and faces, suggesting that humanoid life existed on Mars at some point. But just as you gather the last drone's data, the most severe marsquake yet hits, and the DOG and android 42 run desperately through the tunnels trying to escape. Eventually they are crushed. In the final chapter, you are a cat in the control station built on top of the massive excavator on Earth, racing to not get left behind when the humans activate the drill. As a cat, you can't really interact with your environment in any way, and there is no dialogue. You can run and jump to navigate the extremely dark (all the lights are off) human environment, all while steering like a tank. The game ends as you are caught in a cage just shy of freedom.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1696865621, "timestamp_updated": 1696865621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147656774": {"recommendationid": "147656774", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023750874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1696470973}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, this is a solid game for those who like exploration as well as near future sci-fi stuff.

Hence \"Gem Crusader\" - A GEM of a game, that simply blows your mind in either gameplay, effort or just both! [/b]\n\n[h1] CAT Interstallar is one of such GEMS [/h1]\n\nSo under that pile, I found this game, priced at 39 cents so it's not a risk to my wallet. Because hidden gems are ussually priced that low. A little sparkle, waiting to be found or luring you to it's misery. Well, CAT Interstellar has blown my mind. Not perfectly programmed, but you can clearly see the effort. Not a money grabber at all. \n\nThe voice acting took me on surprise, totally not expected for a game of it's caliber. The story was actually quite compelling, kept me on playing it. This game is merely a demonstration from possibly a bigger story. I guess they changed the title, I could swear that it said \"chapter one\" or \"demo\" or something... Meh, probably play too many games, get confused all the time...\n\nEven the achievements showed I finished chapter 3, so maybe I am missing something here. Like it feels the game is unfinished, that this is just a demo.\n\nStreamed this game and even my viewers were curious about the unfolding of it's story. Not just ME saying it :D\n\nGlad the developers decided to raise the price. Therefor hoping, they will continue with the story, like:\n\n[h1] I licked the glassy rim of the Gem Jam, now I want to dive in! [/h1]\n\nSo I was a little bit curious about the name CAT, like I was thinking of a cat appearing somewhere. Yet I played a \"DOG\", robotically but still... But at the end of this demo/chapter, things went a bit weird, it took the seriousness away in an instance. But funny, nonetheless. I just call it an \"Easteregg\"\nAnd looking back at the achievements, if I just looked a little bit more around and be a little bit more curious, I would have found a little bit more. I just didn't expected that much... My bad... \n\nIf you are interested in a new, fresh & compelling story, taking shape under futuristic and basic circumstances (high tech & underground caves), try this game out! About an hour gameplay, roughly. You will notice some flaws, but they are forgiven as those are no game breakers.\n\n[h1] Is this game a GEM? : YES\nVerdict: YES [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1616062556, "timestamp_updated": 1616063070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545249640941619873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88333219": {"recommendationid": "88333219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088941072", "num_games_owned": 841, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1523937683}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an interesting one. almost seemed like it was more of something that was used to show off what a specific developer could accomplish if given more time.

The voice acting is really mediocre, which some may be fine with cause it's all coming from androids so robotic acting is passable for them. It's not for me though. It made some of the more serious moments later on less impactful. \n\nThe shortness of the story only became a problem for me right at the end. It started really picking up and had me super hooked on where it's going, but then it just ends. This could work as an episodic series, like this being episode 1 and then maybe we continue as one of the androids or something. However, at the time of this review, it's been almost 2 years since release and nothing more has come of this game. \n\nThere's also some nitpicky problems like the main character being called \"Dog\" by everyone cause it's a dog unit. There's only so many times I can hear these androids say \"dog\" before it sounds like an adult or grandparent trying to look cool in front of the kids, especially because of the voice acting. \n\nOverall, I kinda enjoyed my time, but with the many problems I had, it's really hard to recommend at full price.

The developer was also a delight to deal with on the Steam forums trying to help out whenever they could with issues which is always good to see. I really wanted to like this game and in some ways I did but overall it had too many negatives to recommend it. \n\n\t The gameplay itself is simple but enjoyable. You play as a Dog class android whose job it is to go down to Mars and investigate missing androids who got lost in some caves as well as optionally help out with other tasks to reveal more backstory. The gameplay is mainly completing tasks like navigating the evnvironment and turning on consoles. The intro to the game brings you to a hub area where you can choose which mission to play. You can play them in order or not. The game is not a long game. I finished the 5 missions in 52 minutes. The story is the real strength as well as a sore spot. I really liked where it was going and the potential of it but I feel it was not explored enough as well as the ending was really abrupt. It leaves many questions that our imaginations aren\u2019t given enough details to really fill in. \n\n\tI played Cat Interstellar on Linux. I had many crashes when the game was trying to launch over the last several months. It worked fine when I first bought it but then started crashing a while later. I tried several different Linux distros with different kernels and Mesa drivers. Luckily the game started launching again recently so I decided to play through it while I could. The game never crashed once it launched. I quickly realized I couldn\u2019t have my 3 monitors plugged in for this game. If I did when the game launched I couldn\u2019t click on any of the menu buttons and several keys didn\u2019t work properly for the key mappings. For example \u201cW\u201d to move forward would spin me around. After unplugging my 3rd monitor and having just my main monitor and secondary plugged in the problem stopped. The game is locked to 60 FPS. There is an option for Vsync but it still only went to 60 FPS and I couldn\u2019t get it to go to 144 hz like my monitor supports. The game is fluid though as it\u2019s not a fast paced game. It ran at a constant 60 FPS for me aside from a couple moments in the caves where during a cave in it dropped to 48 FPS for a few seconds. Alt-Tab doesn\u2019t work. There are no manual save options but with the short length of the missions and game it\u2019s not really an issue. There are two settings for AA and two other graphics settings to adjust. The game uses the Unreal Engine 4.10 and takes up 6.31GB of disk space.\n\n\tI think if the story was fleshed out more I would be able to give the game a higher score and recommend it. As it is the crashes, abrupt ending and general lack of polish keep me from doing so. The gameplay is decent, the story is interesting so there are good points to it\u2019s favor and there are enjoyable parts to it. I paid $5.49 CAD for Cat Interstellar and I feel it\u2019s a fair price for it. Had I not had the issues with it that I did than I would have said the $10 range would have been alright as well.

Despite there being few voice actors for the NPCs, the VO was actually rather good. I have no complaints. Aside from the graphics, what really impressed me was the music of the game.

Seems like a nice indie that went all the pass from greenlight, through early access and up to complete release but at the same time seems like some crap. The developer warns that game is short, so I thought that it would be something like walking simulator with cats and space setting, but I got something strange\u2026\n\nNo need to discuss every element in details, so in short: graphics \u2013 usual Unreal Engine 4, though if you leave the story path and decide to explore locations, you are likely to meet textures from the year of 2005. Gameplay \u2013 in this case it consists not of walking but rather hovering above the ground, though it changes nothing. Atmosphere \u2013 meh, so-so, you don\u2019t feel like you are in space or on Mars. Music \u2013 also strange, youtube has an OST video, though I had only one composition playing during the whole game which is not even in this soundtrack. \n\nAs for the plot\u2026 Well, things are not simple at all\u2026 It seems like the developers had a complete 3-hour story and they could fit only one hour of it into the game, so they, without much thinking, just squeezed the first of hour of it and released this as a complete game. The result is that the game ends when the actual interesting events start to take place. And if this was only the first episode I would compliment the game and start to wait for the continuation, but no! It is presented as a finished product, which it doesn\u2019t seem at all. Plus, there is a nice twist at the end of the game, but in fact you are distracted from the main story and made to observe this twist, so the impression from it becomes something like: \u201cOh, okay\u2026\u201d  \n\nAnd it seems like I should give a negative rate to this game, and that\u2019s actually right. But, however, the game has its pros too, the major one I consider the voiceover. Yeah, indie game, made in garage with the budget of two sandwiches has great voiceover and sound effects. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the soundtrack lying on youtube but both it and the melody I had during the game are nice. The global story is also interesting but too little time is dedicated.   \n\nSo, in the end we get a weak and unfinished game with decent potential. If the developers somehow will make a continuation they may create really interesting and decent game. As for now, it feels like a ripped out chunk of some story or its first episode, but not like a finished game at all.   \n\nP.S. I can\u2019t get why the game is entitled CAT Interstellar, cause whole game we are playing as a robot named DOG and we are gonna play as kitty only at the end of the game. So, from this point of view, even the declared feline in the tittle is in very small amounts here, so buying game only to see these cute furry creatures in space also has no point.", "timestamp_created": 1532538851, "timestamp_updated": 1564503641, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43702383": {"recommendationid": "43702383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023560237", "num_games_owned": 1252, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1532367842}, "language": "english", "review": "it is really short, even though the about game warned of this, also has a very light story.\n\nfeel like a lot of story is missing sadly.... kind amade me wonder, more?", "timestamp_created": 1532368031, "timestamp_updated": 1532368031, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43693513": {"recommendationid": "43693513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077242222", "num_games_owned": 2471, "num_reviews": 443, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1532327758}, "language": "english", "review": "- Single-player yet it asks for permission to access the internet.

It\u2019s also a very short game, however, even a short game deserves consideration. The game came to my attention when I saw it was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein\u2019s work \u201cThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress\u201d. So I was interested enough that I bought it and played it.\n\nSo let me explain the \u201ctitle screen picture\u201d, there\u2019s not really a title screen. You load into the game and instantly you\u2019re walking around a space station. Now you can look down and see your android body, and you can talk to a few people and then you\u2019re told to report to the Departures. At this point, I went to the main menu and found myself at the same level. So you work your way there, hearing a few people talk as you walk to the Departures section, and you suddenly see there are 5 levels and the credits. It appears all are unlocked from the beginning. Suddenly I got it. The level was the main menu. Odd. Very odd. So I used a picture from the credits.\n\nThis is also how you toggle subtitles, but subtitles don\u2019t work on the main menu. Ok, that\u2019s fine. In fact, I really have to say I like the subtitles in the game, but I just wish I had the option to turn them on everywhere.\n\nThat\u2019s when the game gets even odder. You see you\u2019re not an android, and in fact, you never use the android body on the main menu. In the game, you are \u201cDog IV\u201d, a \u201cQuadruped\u201d floating android. At least you have four hover units, and you seem to be remote controlled, I\u2019m not sure exactly what to call you.\n\nYou make your way around the port and end up having to explore it finding the way out, but first having to go to the lab to talk to someone (which means stand there and hear a few lines of dialog).\n\nThe fact is this is really the game. Most of the game gives you a level to explore and usually a mission, which as you try to perform has a side mission. In the first level, it\u2019s to go to the mines and you are asked to go to the lab first.\n\nThere are a few interesting features of the game, a small number of destructible environments, a couple of interesting quests, and a few places to go, but the problem of the game is that section that I just described, about going to the lab, takes about 20 minutes, and it\u2019s a fifth of the game.\n\nYeah, Cat Interstellar is an hour long, and if that\u2019s not for you, I understand, I\u2019ve reviews of a lot of other games that take longer and might be up your alley. However, I played the entire game so I think I should delve deeper into it, in case anyone is still interested in playing it.\n\nSo the game claims it\u2019s based on The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein, and I was expecting something grand. Even at an hour long, there\u2019s a lot of short stories Heinlein wrote that could be read in an hour, so I wanted something that I could sink my teeth into and think about. Ultimately I didn\u2019t get that. Heinlein\u2019s writing is special, and I\u2019d say I\u2019m a huge Heinlein fan, I\u2019ve read most of his books and absolutely adore his writing. Stranger in a Strange Land is probably my most favorite book ever.\n\nSo while The Moon is a Harsh Mistress might be a basis of the game, the game ignores much of the writing. It ignores the political plot, the workers unionizing, libertarian overtones, the fighting with Earth. Really the only thing this game takes from it is the location and some technology.\n\nNow I understand the difference in media. No one wants to play The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged. In fact, I\u2019m sure most people wouldn\u2019t want to read it. No one is looking forward to being locked in a room in a game and listening to a 2-hour speech. That would really kill the experience fast. However, I understand taking the themes from Ayn Rand\u2019s work and making Bioshock. Andrew Ryan is clearly John Galt, as well as others, the other characters are characters who easily could exist in Rand\u2019s work and are based on a number of characters.\n\nSo a book to game adaption can work, as also seen by Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. The problem here is Cat Interstellar never tries to use the book. You have androids, you have the player as \u201cDog\u201d and you have simple tasks. The game never gets deep enough to inspire anything beyond a simple game.\n\nThat\u2019s the real shame here. The game engine is fine, the game levels are fine, the side quests are annoying but it adds length. What really hurts this game is that the length is only about an hour long, and the game never attempts to have a story, just actions it wants the player to do. Even when the game finally does have something interesting, you get an android saying \u201cThis is odd.\u201d and then five minutes later the games practically over. There\u2019s no depth to this story, and it feels unfinished.\n\nIf you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video at https://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/05/23/cat-interstellar-review/  You can also check out my Curator page at If you want to hear more from me, you can show me that by following my curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1527104320, "timestamp_updated": 1527104320, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571736752986907959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42130264": {"recommendationid": "42130264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198224122680", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 547, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1526773776}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little indie game, that had a simple, but fun gameplay, nice narrative, and great looking visuals!", "timestamp_created": 1526773864, "timestamp_updated": 1526773864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561757743358612061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42004811": {"recommendationid": "42004811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346585130", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1526156459}, "language": "english", "review": "This game ended upbruptly after explaining the state of mars and the earth, but I got to be a cat, so 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1526156662, "timestamp_updated": 1526156662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41987703": {"recommendationid": "41987703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805879087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1526082584}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost the exact definition of an indie game.

It can be completed in under 1.5 hours (I took longer to soak up the enviroment, explore and complete all the achievements) but don't let that put you off, it's actually quite enjoyable.\n\nThere isn't any real solid story behind it other than to complete certain tasks which are assigned by androids to help the humans (which you don't see). This doesn't really matter that much as the story/game is still in development but certainly shows great promise expecially if this is eventually turned in to a full game at some point in the future.\n\nSo, you start off as an humanoid making your way through some short corridors ending up in a room where you can choose which chapter/levels to play, settings and a quit game button, all on a panel. Starting at level one you then end up in a room as a 'Dog' (a robot like dog!). Not sure why the devs came up with this sudden change with no explanation! As you move on through the various parts of the game, Dog will end up destroyed and suddenly you then become a cat (Meow)!

They could have easily wrapped the story up with one cut scene or 2 mins of game play, instead they left the already poor story completely unfinished. \n\nIn conclusion i recommend if you feel that must play this game then get the game on steam and play it for the 60 odd mins it takes to finish (not a joke) and then get refund from steam. \n\nIf the game had been free i would of given it a positive review even with it's short comings.  \n\nP.S (to the devs) - If you take what you did here and made a real game with a real ending, even if it was just 4-6 hours long, i would buy that game in a heartbeat.", "timestamp_created": 1517885084, "timestamp_updated": 1562675352, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508565962314605713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39824800": {"recommendationid": "39824800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072838146", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1549443685}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite short however, it is extremely well made and worth the money. :)", "timestamp_created": 1517688096, "timestamp_updated": 1696330090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39788787": {"recommendationid": "39788787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441073801", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1526764282}, "language": "english", "review": "Very, very awesome game! 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1517572255, "timestamp_updated": 1517572255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441176474094390869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39766663": {"recommendationid": "39766663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075967482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1517487430}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty nice graphics, but quite boring gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1517487561, "timestamp_updated": 1517487561, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39757750": {"recommendationid": "39757750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083950670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1441381009}, "language": "english", "review": "das ist gut", "timestamp_created": 1517442094, "timestamp_updated": 1517442094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441176474094390869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39753165": {"recommendationid": "39753165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049188127", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1517351323}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it cheap, still feel it wasn't worth it.  <2 hrs of game play.

It feels like the beginning of a much larger game.

The first section is a \"getting to know the controls\" kind of area, but showcases the capabilities of the demo very well.  The game has a few more 'inside' sections which look like a generic futuristic 'factory' or whatnot, and then you're out on the Martian surface.\n\nThe surface is great, although I would have expected Mars to have more little boulders everywhere... It feels more like a section of map from \"Borderlands\", perhaps... all deserty and rock-outcroppy.     The map is populated with a few buildings, and some robots which are just going about their business.  They all talk to you, have different things for you to do, or just pass the time of day with you.. It's quite nice, relaxing in a way.\n\nOnce you get into the third section, you start to get a feel for what the \"story\" would be if the game was expanded into a full story arc... There are unexplained things, and wondrous things.. All of it is lovingly rendered, and the interior modelling is some of the best I've seen outside of a AAA game.\n\nEverything about CAT Interstellar is great.  This is very definitely a labour of love, and although it's not a proper game per se, it's definitely interesting to play, and it has a very weird ending which (to me) says \"Look, floating robots is one thing, but we can also do *this*\"... and it's great!\n\nI hope this gets made into a game at some point, it's intriguing!", "timestamp_created": 1508194996, "timestamp_updated": 1508194996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544221937656402588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35750833": {"recommendationid": "35750833", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993639329", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1508081105}, "language": "english", "review": "the most frustrating thig about this game is that it felt like a beginning of a decent game, only to be abruptly ended. the game felt like a waste of time, only because it gives you an itch you can never scratch.", "timestamp_created": 1508081564, "timestamp_updated": 1508081564, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50113910436630249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35746791": {"recommendationid": "35746791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083250615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1508071122}, "language": "english", "review": "Never played a game that was so breathtakingly disappointing.

Let discuss some of the features the game offers.\n \n \n[list]\n[*][b][u]Graphics[/u]-[/b] So CAT Interstellar was developed with Unreal Engine, so the graphics have a mostly realistic look to them. Pretty much exactly what you would expect from a modern Unreal Engine game. Ionized Games took a interesting approach when they created Mars, it isn't red, which really caught me off guard. Don't worry there is a very good explanation on why Mars is looking so pale. \n \n[*][b][u]Gameplay[/u]-[/b] As much as they tried to avoid the \u201cWalking Simulator\u201d tag, that is pretty much what it is just with a little bit more interaction. That is by no means a bad thing in my mind. For most the game you get to hover around all kinds of locations as \u201cDOG-VI\u201d which is a little hovering robot which was molded amazingly I love they way it works and how all of its parts react to the environment. There is a few parts in the game that include player created destruction on some rocks which I found extremely under utilized.\n\n[*][b][u]AI[/u]-[/b] AI is pretty much non-existent other than a few androids that run around and another one that follows you thought a section of the game. In a few occasions the following AI gets WAY to close and will often times trap you in a corner, leaving you no choice but to restart that chapter of the game. Which is fairly frustrating considering the game is pretty slow paced. \n\n[*][b][u]Story[/u]-[/b] The story of CAT Interstellar is the biggest marketing point for the game. So how good is it really? With how short the story is I really don't want to talk much about the specifics. Although for the most part I found it enjoyable and quite believable. That being said in my opinion the ending is a bit of a cop-out and seemed way to sudden, I do believe that the ladder was intended. Everyone that you come in contact with is a android, in my opinion the voice acting on the androids was good, but not right. The android seemed \u201ctoo human\u201d this is purely a matter of perspective but in my mind the androids had too much emotion in their voice and even used swear words a few times. \n\n[*][b][u]Replayability[/u]-[/b] I played through game twice while getting all the achievements, and that's about all I'll I will do. According to the developer the story is complete so I really don't see a reason to go back through again. Games that are this short really tend to lack replayability especially within a short time frame.\n\n \n[*][b][u]Value for Dollar[/u]-[/b] With these short story games I have always had a hard time determining if they have good value for dollar. My philosophy for that is if a game is (for example) $15.00 I would want to get at least 15 hours of quality gameplay out of it. That philosophy just doesn't work with this type of game. I know the developer needs to get compensated for the work he has done but I do think the full release price of $4.99 is just a little bit too much. \n\n[*][b][u]What Would I do Different or add?[/u]-[/b] There really is only two things that I can think of that I would have really changed about the game: I would have liked to see more use of the destruction and I would have changed up the ending to seem less abrupt. \n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments concerning the game or my review do not hesitate to ask!\n\n\n[b][u]Reviewers Comments[/u]-[/b] Yes, I did receive this game at no cost to me, but I assure you that this review reflects my sole opinions of the game. The game was bought, not the review.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506053951, "timestamp_updated": 1506053951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723072588443756104", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34995892": {"recommendationid": "34995892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315626015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1501852540}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY short game, compelling story.

The other doors does not close as long as the 'dog' is in the way\n- There's a location just behind the base where the names of the androids (with the subtitles on) are floating on the sands\n- I got to access the debug camera and allowed me to mess with the game (not sure if the debug mode was left in-game on purpose)\n- Lastly, the movement of the cat at the last mission was cranky. The running animation looks well, but there's no turning animation which made the cat look like it's just rotating in place. As for the jump, the transistion between the idle/walking animation and the jumping animation looks unnatural, same with the landing animation. And, I believe cats stop in place for a while after landing in order to absord the impact of the fall\n\nOther than those, the game looks, feels, and plays great!

If you're a gamer who instantly expects hours of gameplay on a fully developed & polished game - Well, come back later, I guess, or stop browsing EA games altogether! xD They aren't for everybody.\nPros\n1- Impressive Dev who comes across as humble, objective, respectful, and responsive to suggested improvements. Also very active/visible in discussions & Review comments\n2- Nice graphics & smooth controls for kb/mouse (Sorry, I didn't try with my controller)\n3- Voice acting & storyline are very good, and sound effects were well done (i.e. cave echoes)\n4- Very fair price that matches the early state of development\n\nCons - none IMHO - CAT Interstellar is brief & does just what it says it does at this early stage\n\n[strike]Other - My only silly pet peeve (pun intended) was the movement of the cat in the final chapter. Cats don't start moving slowly and gradually build up speed like a city bus - No, they take off like a bullet leaving the barrel of a gun. And when running with the cat & using 'jump' - Well, the jump is basically Straight Up instead of up and continuing forward at the speed of the run, and after it lands, y'know it starts off again like that bus lol. (everybody's a critic, right).[/strike] My 2\u00a2 - Cheers\n\n**EDIT 15AUG2017 - Gave 2nd playthrough after updates & enjoyed it. The cat motion referenced above is much quicker and natural now.

As the description says, this game takes place on Mars and involves work to get it terraformed. Terraforming isn't the same as colonization, and if you aren't sure of the difference, what it means is that the planet has to be made habitable before people can survive there. Terraforming is what's happening here. \n\nPROS: Your character is easy to move around. From reading around the game's Steam page, the character went through some work to get it to where it behaved as fluidly as it does now and isn't buggy as it used to be. You will find using your character to be very intuititve. The HUD: Blessedly there's no HUD. Hooray! More time to study the environment and get engaged with the story, less time reading a list of action items and setting up hot bars and checking mini-maps. Your NPCs provide incremental storyline and tell you what's up and what you're expected to do, and the environment provides visual cues to get you there. Audio: The NPCs beep a lot and it was annoying to me. Thankfully the dev has a slider that lets you quieten them down without quietening the rest of the game. Minor quibble, I wish there was a way to run-back to see what they said last because sometimes I missed because I was too busy running around, exploring. Exploring: Wow! The surface is beautiful and curious, but the underneath is pure imagination-fuel. Lastly, something surprised me and has left me veeeerrrrrry curious of what the full story will reveal when the full game comes out this Fall. \n\nCONS: So far I have no cons. Just typical EA stuff. It's short, has a few annoying bugs, can be a bit clunky, and unfortunately the visuals options are few. However the game dev seems diligent and responsive to the community. And they made a post recently that explained the reasons for the changes to the sliders on the graphics. Game still looks great, though. None of this is a deal-breaker to me.\n\nFor such a small work, the game is a clever concept that has some really complex storytelling elements at work. \n\nSnagged during the Summer Sale 2017 for $0.99 USD.

It probably should be labeled as an early release. If I had known how short it is, and that it's unfinished, I'm not sure I would have bought it. I like supporting early releases when it looks like a cool game, but the story is so short that I'm likely not going to play it again for months, when I finally notice it's been updated.\nThat extreme shortness, and the abrupt switch to a cat suddenly at the end makes me want to give it a negative review, BUT it really is cool. Is it worth a few bucks? Probably. Barely. But if you go in expecting a full game, even a short one, you'll probably be disapointed.\nThe menu system is the first thing you'll see. They try to use this projected 3D menu that acts like an object. It's really gimmicky and hard to use. You play as a little floating robot, nicknamed Dog, or DAWG, or something like that. There are a few small glitches with objects that happen occasionally, like seeing through them by accident, but overall, it's pretty well done. The physics of objects you move isn't really though. They fall like styrofoam.\nYou basically have to pilot this little robot around this building to find your way to the mines. I found this way harder than I should have. I kept going in circles, and not being sure which way to go. There are two missions before the mines of just moving things, and another one that was getting around scary heights to access some panels. Once you're in the mines, you're basically just trying to navigate a maze, with no idea what rocks you're supposed to pulverize. Overall, the game is really nice looking, but way too short, and really should be flushed out more. The robots don't look great, and there are some lighting issues, but the caves and the rolling hills look awesome. The lighting issues make parts of the game really hard. I ended up eventually turning up the brightness, which kinda felt like cheating. The stupid humanoid robot that follows you at one point will totally block you into a corner as well, and you'll have to try to jump over him. My guess is that the final version won't be as short, but I have my doubts that it will feel complete to the massive setup they did.\nThey have this at such a low price point, I can't see them making it into more of a full game, but I think it's a waste to just throw away the world building they did. I think they should work on hashing it out to recover it's rating, and make it more fun, especially for repeatability, and then do either some DLC, or a sequal. As it is now, it's not even really fully playable once.

The story itself is very short and light, but is interesting [b](*MAYBE SPOILERS* after this point)[/b] and left me wanting to know the fate of 42 and DOG. The short cat level at the end was a bit unusual, and the cat definitely needs some work (as the dev is aware of -- the shaders are a bit off on the fur, and the movement needs to be improved.) Though unusual, the closing cat level still left me wondering how things are going on earth, and how it ties into DOG and 42. [b](*END POSSIBLE SPOILERS*)[/b] As far as controls, optimization, or bugs/glitches go, I didnt really run into any problems other than the cat controls (which are being worked on.) The audio is decent, though some voiceovers could use a little work. The UE4 rendered graphics are solid, not good nor bad. They get the job done. \n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, if you got it for free or maybe on sale. Would I pay $4 for it? Probably not, but it's up to you if up to one hour of decent gameplay and a short but interesting story is worth your money.

The idea sounded fairly weird and unique so it only made sense to give it a try. If it managed to convince me, I was prepared to grab a few copies for a few friends to compensate for getting a free one myself. After reading the reviews and seeing people complain that the game is like 15 minutes long, I was a little apprehensive. I spent around an hour in this game. I'm actually at a loss for words but not in the good way.\n\nOptimization for lower end computers is not stellar, let's say that. The uh... \"story\"? makes me question what the point is. Maybe the point is to question what the point of the whole thing is but if that translates in me being utterly uninvolved and bored out of my skull, then I'd rather do without. \n\nI walked around, saw some stuff here and there, none of it was actually visually or conceptually interesting. I fiddled with some... things in some mine. And then something collapsed and then I walked around and then I was out... It's honestly just a huge blur. It really pains me to say it because I'm sure the developer is passionate but this game is such an aggressive absolute void of charisma.\n\nI'm the type of person who has memorized hundreds of pages of factoids about complex lores like Metal Gear and I can't even remember a single thing that happened in this game (nor why it happened) just moments after finishing it.\n\nTo the dev: Please make sure to actually DESIGN your game. I know programmers tend to think they can do everything themselves but for Pete's sake talk to a designer. Your game is extremely lacking in basic conveyance and it makes a really piss poor job at subtly funneling players on the right path. It's very easy to get to the \"what the fuck do I do?\" stage.

Some games turn out great, other merely okay and a lot of games just never seem to get out of EA or are dumped on Steam unfinished. It's hard to tell how CAT Interstellar will end up. It could turn out to be an interesting experience. But at the moment it's a tech demo and very little more.\nIn the version I've played there is hardly any story. The androids you meet have little to say and there is very little information to be gotten from the computer monitors as well. You interact with the world with some super advanced levitation ray instead of a more realistic robotic arm or claw. Two of the androids will send you on fetch quests while idling and doing absolutely nothing of interest. Why can't they solve their own problems, they have functional arms and legs, right? It get's a little more interesting once you get into the caves but then the story just ends. I spent most of my playing time mucking about, trying to see how far away from the base I could get (quite far actually). But there's barely fifteen minutes of actual playing time present. There are very few items that you can interact with. It get's worse if you consider that during the first few minutes (out of the fifteen) most controls are shut down because you'll be locked into a tutorial and can only move when they let you. I don't like when I'm treated like a disobedient three year old.

If you'd prefer to avoid spoilers, please do not continue reading.\n\nThis review is a re-evaluation of CAT Interstellar, six years after my initial review in 2016. The game developers requested that I replay the game to assess the updates and changes made since then.\n\nOriginal Review (2016):\n\"I was uncertain about this game. Although it's an early access game, it seemed far from completion. The textures looked bad, and the text above the robots' heads was too small, poorly designed, and difficult to read. The robots' voices were also irritating. Overall, I couldn't recommend the game in its current state.\"\n\nRevised Review (2023):\n\nStoryline: 1 out of 5\nThe game's storyline is unclear, as it does a poor job of explaining its premise. It seems to be based on the book \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" by Robert A. Heinlein, but since I haven't read the book, I cannot provide details on the plot. However, a brief synopsis of the book may provide an idea of the game's potential background.\n\nDesign: 4 out of 5\nCAT Interstellar features 4K textures that enhance its appearance. However, it feels more like an asset flip game than one developed from scratch. Despite six years of development, not much has changed, which is disappointing.\n\nMechanics: 2 out of 5\nI recommend using a controller for this game, as the mouse and keyboard controls are not enjoyable.\n\nMusic and Voice Acting: 4 out of 5\nThe voice acting is well-executed, but I can't recall any notable music as I usually play with the music off.\n\nSystem: 2 out of 5\nThe game is plagued by numerous bugs and glitches, with players getting stuck in various locations. Gravity can be manipulated easily, causing the android to move with objects and sometimes crashing the game. The game crashed frequently in OpenGL (native Linux) but not when played in Wine. There is still much work to be done, and it seems the developer may lack the time or experience to address these issues.\n\nConclusion: 3 out of 5\nCAT Interstellar looks good, but there's not much substance to the game. It feels like a 3D visual novel game with an asset flip, and the storytelling is subpar. The controls are minimal and better suited for a controller. It doesn't take long to complete the game, and despite being in development for six years, it's far from finished. My recommendation remains unchanged.\n\nReview by ChatGPT\n\nCAT Interstellar is a PC and Xbox space exploration and trading game developed by CatLab and released in January 2019.

I was greeted with a small screen depicting a level select, and chose the first one, eager to get my probin' on. \n\nThere was a short loading screen, and suddenly there I was: A small interplanetary probe in all its glory. I appeared to be being worked on by two androids who told me that, due to the rough nature of the planet, the mines were collapsing, and I had to reach the surface. I found the elevator with no trouble, and \"stepped\" out onto the large Mars-like surface of the planet. Being a drone with hovering capabilities, I decided to head for the largest mountain I could find. \n\nMy tiny motor made a lot of noise as I climbed, and as I reached the precipace, I was immediately swallowed by an unmeshed mountain texture and fell into the world below. I spent about three of my six minutes trying to escape from that glitch.\n\nI think I'll wait a bit to play this again. I would've had to restart and go all the way through all the dialogue again, and at the moment, it just wasn't worth it to me.\n\nEdit: Dev commented and I felt bad that I didn't praise the aspects of the game I loved in tandem with criticizing what I didnt, so here's that portion. \n\nThe map itself looked fantastic, from what I had seen. The mining colony feels wonderfully claustrophobic and tight, with it's multiple grey hallways stretching on. Then you hit the surface, and I have to admit, there was a decent amount of awe in that first moment. The entire planet seems to stretch out before you, and part of the reason I got stuck was because I was so excited to take a look at the world in the first place. Also due to the quick reply from the dev, and my hopes assuaged that this issue will be fixed, I am changing my review from negative to positive, as I now have a lot more faith that most of the major issues will be ironed out in due time.", "timestamp_created": 1471106150, "timestamp_updated": 1471121356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472816228866577148", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24841775": {"recommendationid": "24841775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018951024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1474904818}, "language": "english", "review": "Like; nice planet, plenty of room to move around, controls okay, game play - not a lot.\nDislikes; no control for xbox controller, cannot really see where the next stage in the game play would come.

Right from the start, I can use either the WASD and/or the arrow keys to move around without having to edit keyboard options.  That's awesome!  The mouse also works corretly without having to search for the option to invert the Y axis and fumble with it, which is an annoyance that most other games make me do.  Two aweomes!!  And I like how the scroll wheel zooms in and out, and if I zoom in all the way it's like being in first person view.  Three awesomes!!!  You guys have done everything right as far as controls go.  \n\nOne thing I would love to see you add is support for a Logitech USB game pad.  After seeing that you got the keyboard and mouse controls right, I was disappointed that it didn't respond to my game pad, even when I tried to map thumbstick movements to in-game movement.  I assume you're planning to add that, right?  RIGHT?!?!  Remember: the de-facto standard most games have adopted is that the left stick controls translation (movement) while the right stick controls rotation (camera).  But you already know that, right?\n\nI also like that it's a relatively open world.  I hate games that put me on a rail or in a tunnel, even if it doesn't look anything like a tunnel.  I was free to explore and find the guy who needed help loading some fertilizer into a thingy without being told to do so.  Brilliant!  \n\nOne thing that gave me a slight delay was when the game first starts and I'm inside a glass box overlooking Mars (am I riding a space elevator down to the surface?).  It didn't respond to my mouse movement until I clicked my mouse on nothing in particular.  That's no big deal, but you might want to fix that.\n\nAnother thing that impressed me at this opening screen was (1) my shadow was actually a shadow of me, not just a hazy gray blob, and (2) the shadow moved with me and mirrored my movements as I walked around inside that glass box, and (3) when I looked down, I had a body and feet!  Most games when I look down, I have no feet.  Little details like this really improve a game!  You guys are brilliant!\n\nI'm guessing the story involves a deeper mystery than merely the mine causing some geologic instability, right?  But don't tell me now, I want to play the game when you finish it and experience the full story arc.  For example, why am I a robotic dog?  Why is the Mars base populated only by robots, especially when the base looks as if it was meant to be manned by people (windows, computer terminals with keyboards, etc.)?\n\nOne little thing that tends to bother me in a lot of games (especially sci-fi games) is the sameness of all the textures.  According to your latest release notes, you just combined a bunch of textures to reduce the game size from 8 gb to 4 gb.  But I think that may have gone too far with that.  I realize that you have to economize on graphics storage, but it loses something when, for example, all the doors are identical.  For example, IMO, not all doors should be pressure doors, only the doors between sections.  Most of the doors to individual rooms should be ordinary flimsy hinged doors--too many games put heavy duty pressure doors on EVERYTHING, even into a closet, lol.  Likewise, elevator doors should look like elevator doors, not airlock doors--study how an elevator actually works mechanically and you'll realize it's nigh impossible to make an elevator door a pressure door.  Just my opinion, of course. \n\nOh, let me add that I was able to play an earlier version at a friend's house last week.  I think the start of that earlier version works better than the start of 1.8 because the robot who activates DOG gives you a better sense of your purpose in life as a robotic DOG that's just been delivered and activated that moment.  By actually talking to you and leading you through the base to the exit and giving you an assignment to go help out in the mine, that seems to make more logical sense to me than just turning the DOG on for the first time and then ignoring him to stumble around searching for where to go and what to do--even if the game doesn't actually force you to go anywhere in particular or do anything specific once you leave the base.  I realize, again, from your change log that you want to get away from robots talking to each other in voices--and that makes sense--but I think we players neeed at least a little handholding at the very, very start, even though that contradicts what I said earlier.  So I think you should put that setup back in.

This means that whenever you turn your head to look around this beautiful virtual space the developer has created for you, the entire viewpoint slews around alarmingly because it is being rendered for an entirely different focal point than the one your eyes actually occupy.\n\nTo say that this leads to instant and quite severe motion sickness would be putting it very mildly indeed. This game is literally unplayable in its current state. Worse, after even a short exposure to this viewpoint-mismatch rendering, I became so green about the gills that I couldn't even go back into VR in normal, \"comfortable\" games that don't exhibit similar issues, because my vestibular system was still recovering from [i]CAT Interstellar[/i].\n\nThe author is aware of the problem and is working on a solution.

Possibly because I mistakenly thought I was doing the \"intro\" or \"movement tutorial\" and was expecting some gameplay when I suddenly found that I was not only at the end of the intro, but in fact the end of the game some 7 odd minutes later.\n\nFrom the description I was expecting some gameplay. There isn't any. This is only a tech demo at this point in time.\n\nYou can move around (normal & fast) and you can jump. That's it. Yes, some physics, you can bump into boxes, drift higher over some terrain small obsticales an so on.\n\nThe game seems to be heading down a bit of a puzzle or \"find/fetch & carry & dropoff & complete a mission\" path given some of the voiceovers. It is not a direction I personally like, but ymmv.\n\nHopefully the dev focus switches to some actual gameplay pretty smartly.\n\n\nNotes to Dev team:\nThe bounding box or cylinder on the 'dog' seems slightly too large.\n\nYour game description talks of an intended / targeted release date of March 2016. A later post (update 1.6) says 1st June 2016.

You can be done under 30 minutes of gameplay. While the developer mention that this won't be a long game, it is to be noted the shortness of the game.\n\nFor an Early Access game, I gotta say it is very stable, functionnal and a visually appealing. The gameworld landscape seems big enough to wander around but without any objectives or thing to do, it ends up being pointless.\n\nAnother gripe was the lack of the current in-game objectives so I do believe that will be added later on.\n\nThis sums up to this:\n\nPROS:\n+Good visuals of the stations and planetary landscape.\n+Sound design is ok.\n+The open world seems big.\n+Stable game with a functionnal menu.\n\nCONS:\n-Limited gameplay and quite boring for the moment. \n-Very short gameplay (finish the game under 30 minutes... supposed to be an hour long once fully released).\n-Can't rebind the keys.\n-No clear in-game objectives.\n-The story seems interesting, more like a big teaser but there is no plotline at all!\n-Ain't Mars supposed to have a reddish sky?\n\nOVERALL:\nUnfortunately, there is barely nothing to do in this \"tech demo\" game. Maybe it got released too early or something but I would have loved to have something worth of doing in the game! For a 8 GB download, I expected something with more meat but I just received a little bone thrown at me! Give me something to do like scan something or any kind of possible fun gameplay to be had. Any possible mysterious plotline could draw more gamers in!\n\nI know the game is not pricy but that is not the point. There are games in this price range that offers more content for a longer playtime, but not this game. While Mars is an interesting planet, wouldn't the game setting been more appealing if set in another planet? Or maybe in an asteroid?\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFor what it's worth, this game can have potential. Just not for now!

I mean i liked it for like 20 mins. But it is all really ypur choice on wether you get it. When i first got the game i thought it was broke and did not work on my computer so I started it up and ran some test on it and while i was doing that it worked. It took 4 or 5 mins to run for me.

I don't think there are enough games that really scratch that particular sci-fi itch, so CAT Interstellar earns itself a gold star right there.\n\nThen I have to take away the gold star because both times I've tried to start the game up, I had to try maybe four times before it actually worked. I don't know if that's the game's fault, or my computer's, but I'm not having that problem with other games. Similarly I don't see any reviews here saying it's difficult to start up. So that's neither a positive or a negative comment, it's just something that happened to me.\n\nMy first and immediate thought is that I don't understand the title. The game is called CAT Interstellar, but you play a DOG module. That was a constant thought in my mind while playing the game. Is it a pun? What's happening? What does CAT Interstellar mean? \"Construction And Terraforming?\" That'd be pretty cool - CAT Interstellar is like, an offworld construction corporation, similar to Weyland Yutani or something. But then what does DOG mean?\n\nMovement through the areas is entirely functional, if completely standard. WASD to move, mouse to look, shift to sprint, and space to jump. My only complaint is that that default non-thrustered move speed is so slow that you pretty much just have to keep one finger on the thrusters constantly. The double jump is a pretty nice feature though, makes bouncing through the admittedly gorgeous terrain very fun.\n\nI love the androids too. The plasticy looking bodies with their glowing faces when they talk is really cool. They look like they've been committee designed to be \"non-threatening\", and \"approachable\". However I can definitely imagine them having some sort of hidden programming and when they want to be, totally terrifying.\n\nNow, on to the niggles. This is stuff that I think could definitely be looked at and improved upon, but is by no way a deal-breaker from a gameplay perspective:\n\n1) The DOG drone that you play. The texturing is... non-existant. As far as I can tell, it's just an ambient occlusion shader on the model, with some blue and some particles at the bottom of the thrusters. I don't know if this is because it's a placeholder for a final model/texture, or if it's by design, but I'm not too fond of it. And since we're going to be playing a game where this is constantly going to be on our screen, I kind of want a little more from it.\n\n2) The sound mix of of the androids is very very quiet. I'm glad they've got subtitles at the moment, because while it's not too difficult to hear what they say, the quiet tones make it hard to really take it in. This sort of links in with my next point too.\n\n3) Lots of telling, not much showing. So the DOG is equipped with a spectrometer that can detect stuff. But information about it is given to us via the quiet tones of the androids. I'd have liked it if one of the androids had gone \"This is graphite, scan it, so your spectrometer can detect its chemical signature\" Or *something*. Then it would have clued us in to what the blue splodges were on the ground that we're supposed to follow. You could have different samples of chemicals, and scan them all, so you can detect them while you're going around the planet, thereby finding more resources as you learn what the signatures of other deposits are.\n\n4) The android by the skylift tells you to go find three boxes, and put them in the skylift. I did that. He then says \"You lost all three?\" No man, I put all three in the lift like you said. I don't know if I'm just not getting what he says, or if the wrong speech file is playing, but it doesn't make sense to me why he would say that.\n\n\nOverall, this early access bit is really very short - almost too short to really get a good picture of what to expect from the full release.

Price point is not a factor for my reviews so should mention that as well since many will look at the fact currently it is quite cheap.\n\n[h1]TL;DR Version[/h1] \nIf even a tad more of the story was included at launch or at least one interesting mission included at the beginning I may of swayed to the recommended side. Once more story is in then I may change my review to that.\n\n[h1]Longer Version[/h1]\n\nI do like the concept of the game and the terrain looks great but that is where it currently stops for me until more is added. I beat the game in 26 minutes and this includes doing the story, exploring, and throwing some random boxes around for fun.\n\nYou play as the \"dog\" which you can move, boost, jump, and grab objects although it looks rather plain in my opinion. You start off with being told a bit of the backstory of what is going on, I then was instructed to proceed outside to the next objective. At this objective I was instructed to find 3 boxes and move them to the skylift. After I completed that task I was told to go to the mine, an unforunate accident occurs there and that is the end of the game...currently.\n\nThis game will be story driven which is why at the moment I cannot recommend it, there just wasn't enough of the interesting bits added in for the launch which I wish I could of seen. Anything other than moving boxes could of been a better objective to start off with before further story is added on later that way I could of felt a bit more invested in the story before waiting for the rest to be put in. So basically to me, for a story driven game not enough of the story was available from the start.\n\nThe game itself runs quite well, no bugs or crashes from my playthrough at least. Option of VR or Play right off the bat in the menu which is great for those who want that.\n\nI hope to see in the future a bit more added to the surface as it already looks quite good in my opinion but could do with a tad more added to it, and will await for the rest of the story. When a bit more of that is added in I will update my review to reflect that.
