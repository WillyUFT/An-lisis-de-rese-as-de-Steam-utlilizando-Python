that I could just play Diablo or Torchlight. However, one day the GF said she wanted to play a new adventure game and we had trouble getting our Minecraft working so we saw this and said, \"Let's try it out\". Turns out that was a great decision for both of us!\n\nMD starts off with villages getting attacked by an evil wizard known as the Illager. He is raising forces of evil and corrupting different biomes of the world. It's up to a bunch of heroes to stop his tyranny and save the captive villagers!\n\nThe story is very simple, and that's okay. You don't need a complex story for Minecraft, lol. Anyway, MD plays exactly like Diablo. It's an ARPG where you click and slay hordes of enemies and gather loot and gear for your heroes. There is a surprising amount of complexity that makes the game fun for both casual and hardcore players. \n\nAs you play through the game, your main hub is known as the camp. Progressing through the game will allow you to save merchants who occupy your camp so you can buy loot, upgrade gear, and gift players in between missions. It's fun to see the camp grow as you play and unlock new functions the more you progress, Another form of progression is the gear and weapons you obtain. Each one has extra \"traits\" you can use upgrade points to make them stronger. Some are pretty cool like giving your weapon a chance to do chain lightning every few slashes or have your bow pierce through enemies. Some gear has more than one trait you can add to it instead of just one and it's really fun to mix and match them to make great combinations.\n\nAnother thing I loved was how the game rewards you for exploration. You can find extra treasures, hidden caves, and even hidden levels if you're real crafty. It made it fun to go off the beaten path and look for goodies and I appreciate the game for that. Even though the main campaign was not very long, there are a lot of DLC chapters to play through and we are eager to dive into those next.\n\nNow for gripes. The difficulty can be a little jarring if you don't get your gear right. Luckily, you can easily adjust it, but then you can't get stronger loot which can get you stuck at certain points. I did not like the fact that you can only gift players once per mission. There is also the \"Battle Pass\" part of the game that lets you unlock other goodies. I didn't find them annoying or necessary, however, it can be annoying to some players, and just wanted to put it out there so players are aware.\n\nFinal verdict? We really enjoyed this game. It was the perfect amount of challenge for both of us and we are eager to dive into the DLC chapters. For $20, we definitely got our money's worth. It's a fun weekend game or co-op game to dive into with your friends, ESPECIALLY if you love Minecraft. It's fun to see how they used enemies from the game and Diablo-fied them. If you're looking for a fun and cute Diablo Clone, this may be the one to scratch that itch you have.

my hours are on the Xbox/MC Launcher version of Dungeons, not on Steam with nearly 200+.\n\nI really want to give this a positive review but Mojang really dropped the ball with this game and I can only hope Minecraft Legends doesn't suffer the same fate as Minecraft Dungeons and Earth did via slow burn or abrupt uncontrollable circumstance and not wanting to stick out the storm.\n\nThe main reason I chose negative is that it took almost 2 years to get basic features like a simple storage system/chest to be added which meant we had to choose what to keep.\nThis compounds with the event/seasonal exclusive weapons/gear you could get (which at the time before they got added to the Tower in that update) were objectively worse in power level so they were just a status symbol to show off to the tiny playerbase that you were there that was useless on the higher tier apocalypse difficulties. Not helping is that one of them being the corrupted pumpkin is still unobtainable because they didn't add artifacts to the tower despite their being in the steam and MC feedback site. Many request for QOL features fell on deaf ears for cutesy corp speak and additions that add little or are cosmetic instead of addressing problems like needless bloat and clutter (such as consolidating the reskinned gear into being a toggle instead of separate items entirely being one example of a missed opportunity).\nThe big elephant in the room is the one they neglected and gave a outright no to when asked to add; modding support or at least Steam workshop support.\nHalf the fun of being on Steam is the workshop and the fact they opted out of allowing you to mod more easily and safely by downloading mods through the workshop which is built in and instead just said no and offered no way speaks volumes to their attitude on modding outside of the Java edition which I'm convinced they only keep around to keep the Java devs employed and quell discourse because I'm sure they'd want Minecoin integration similar to what they did with Legends.\n\nWorkshop/modding support could have added a infinite content and extended the life of dungeons but instead Mojang opted to release a season pass system for this game, only released 3, then missed not only the winter event, but the games anniversary, didn't say or make a blog post about its birthday, then proceed to boast their player numbers of 25+M players in dungeons despite most of those being gamepass buyers who tried it and NOT concurrent players who return and then cut support/sunsetted the game about a week ago.\n\nNo goodbye, no fanfare, no final event, no cosmetic crossover/carryover for what you bought in MC Dungeons from the seasons passes/challenges like with Minecraft earth to keep as keepsakes like emotes, capes, or pets, no more events; its finished, over. The bare minimum they're doing now is just having a tower level be procedural generated off of present pre-sets every week while keeping purchase servers up for your cosmetics; that's it.\n\nTLDR; If you're thinking of buying this game for long term content or playing with friends, don't bother. The games officially over/discontinued and no more DLC or content is being made/updated. They did quite a poor job of marketing this game as well as their other Minecraft spinoffs or published games such as Minecraft Story mode, Earth, Scrolls(Callers Bane), Cobalt, and now Legends.\n\nDon't bother getting this game unless you REALLY like dungeon crawlers and even then there's much better than this game that are actually actively being updated. Legends sadly might follow the same fate as Dungeons if Mojang's actions with their past games are repeated.", "timestamp_created": 1696288131, "timestamp_updated": 1700688116, "voted_up": false,

There is also a tower mode where you start off with basic armour and gear and slowly progress up the tower gaining 1 piece of gear or armour every storey, as you progress higher and higher the levels will get harder and you will start stumbling across boss levels until you reach the highest storey level 22 and will get a prize of your choice and if you die midway you will also gain some gear but not as good gear. If you do find the game short you can buy the DLCs which either give you more skins or adds more levels to complete (all DLC is $29.95 AD).

Every power comes from your weapons so if you find a great weapon you'll use it for an hour and you'll play something else afterwards because it became obsolete in 30 minutes. Thus, you can't play a gameplay that you like for long (well you'll have to farm for weapons with those powers/enchantments). You're forced into a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and 3 artifacts. Just have to use the power of those 5 objets.\n\nAs a consequence, no build no class means there is absolutely no re-playability in this game... \n\nGive it a try when it's on mega sales because it's definitely not worse it at full price (knowing there are DLC as well, and I haven't tried those. \n\nToo bad as the game isn't badly executed, it's just a too simplified hack & slash.

changes.\n\nGameplay becomes very stale, with the only difference being that enemies get more and more ridiculous benefits and enchantments that the game becomes impossible to beat.\n\nThe controls are complete ass, half the time not even working as intended.\n\nThe AI is very bad. Half the time stun works, half the time it doesn't. Half the time enemies will walk up to you and do nothing. You can kill redstone golems by standing directly in front of them and attacking until it dies. You can spawn a pet (Wolf, Llama, Iron Golem) and they will quite commonly just stand there and do nothing.\n\nWeapon and artefact balancing basically doesn't exist, with many items being broken and some just being worse versions of existing tools.\n\nHitboxes are very whack, youre often able to hit enemies you didnt come five metres near to hitting- and enemies can hit you from where you just were before you rolled (rolling is essentially useless for combat).\n\nTLDR;\n\nGame becomes over boring and grindy.\nControls dont work half the time and are just awful in general.\nAi sucks overall\nBalancing doesnt exist\nHitboxes and hurtboxes feel like they were left in a prototype setting.\nAlso, the game will often spawn so many enemies that the game lags beyond belief.\n\nOh and another thing, this game has (on numerous occassions) crashed my entire PC, despite my PC running far more demanding games and has no struggle running it. It just randomly crashes.\n(it will also crash if you enter a game and leave in under 5 seconds).\n\nDo not buy this game and give money to Mojang.\n\nMAKE A FUNCTIONAL GAME", "timestamp_created": 1695124295, "timestamp_updated": 1695749581, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146560701": {"recommendationid": "146560701", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231319651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2171, "last_played": 1698684629}, "language": "english", "review": "meincamf", "timestamp_created": 1695078381, "timestamp_updated": 1695078381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146535139": {"recommendationid": "146535139", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216247601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 2150, "last_played": 1700699201}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1695047182, "timestamp_updated": 1695047182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146527267": {"recommendationid": "146527267", "author": {"steamid": "76561199389256590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 36609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36023, "last_played": 1696323714}, "language": "english", "review": "its gooooood", "timestamp_created": 1695036354, "timestamp_updated": 1695036354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146499129": {"recommendationid": "146499129", "author": {"steamid": "76561199197192250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1450, "last_played": 1697828200}, "language": "spanish", "review": "en mi opinion este juego es una obra maestra aunque no tenga tantos niveles  el juego tarda horas en completar i si quieres jugar mas hay dlc (=", "timestamp_created": 1694984727, "timestamp_updated": 1694984727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146490617": {"recommendationid": "146490617", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015249771", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1694974639}, "language": "english", "review": "It's alright at first, but then it turns into a slog for grinding/replaying old missions to get better gear.

Even after having to adjust to the game again I still love this game. It plays like Diablo but its very different in its execution which I can appreciate.\n\n[i]I do have my gripes however,[/i] small things like Chests just not being in alternate pathways, dodging slowing you down until your next dodge is recharged, the lock on being sticky dragged the game down for some of my friends. They're just annoyances for me, but they can be turn offs for others.\n\nCombat is very enjoyable, there are very few movesets I actually dislike, and all the weapons feel very unique. Artifacts are very powerful and all offer a unique purpose making combat very flexible and fun.\n\nMost maps are surprisingly open, with secret paths and entryways in each level, letting people like me who want to explore the entire map get plenty of enjoyment doing so. A certain [spoiler]Creeping Crypt[/spoiler] does get [i]too[/i] open tho, requiring multiple levels of time to explore, you are rewarded for your time however.\n\nThe game can get difficult if your not running a very powerful build especially on the harder difficulties, but you can get by running something unorthodox. Some things do unfortunately fall off though, like Summons.\n\nThere are no stats or spells of any kind, your build is entirely based on your equipment. I love this system much more than a stat system, allowing swapping a build easily without making a new character and making theory-crafting a build much easier\n\nThis game looks absolutely phenomenal. The post processing is just right, not being over abundant to keep its style intact, but also making the game prettier than Minecraft could ever wish to be. The builds for the stages look amazing too, with diverse sets of blocks and new blocks to make transitions from dirt to stone bricks look prettier than ever. I thought I was crazy being really inspired by some of the structures built in this game, but even my friend has gotten ideas for builds from this game too.\n\nAll the DLCs are amazing, with Flames of the Nether and Hidden Depths being my absolute favorites. They all add new stages and new \n\nOf course, this being a (fairly) modern game, it has a \u2728Battle Pass\u2728, but its one of the best in my opinion. Its a bit of a grind, but the tracks aren't time limited, they can be completed well after the season ends giving you ample time to get it done even if your behind. the premium track is only 4$, far cheaper than most games with a battle pass and includes particle effects for killing mobs, healing and teleporting to other players. It has pets, skins and capes to get too. The base game is kinda pricey for how short it is, being 20$, but the DLC is super cheap for just how much they add.

The audio mutes when you tab out, which i do like as a setting but i hate as a feature. then when i tried to log in, it didnt let me delete my text in the password bar for some fuckin reason and when i did type in my password after about four attempts, the login window just disappeared and i had to restart the entire game. when i did get in, there were even more issues.\n\nnot only is there NO wasd keys, you have to click to move. you click to attack. rolling feels like it does nothing because you can barely control where you go. the game feels like its been neutered, its not fun nor does it have a sliver of gameplay. you click on something, you shoot an arrow, click more, it just feels awful. i liked the game for having some mobility but this feels like some limp ass mobile game where you cant do shit. it completely ruins the feel and fun of the game, makes the rolling mechanic obsolete, but genuinely sucks fucking ass. i dont wanna click my shit, i wanna be able to move and attack shit myself, not click on a zombie and then the next and the next and so on. whats even worse, i dont have a controller. i was so happy finally being able to relive part of my childhood when i realised that fucking mojang made the worst fucking control system i have ever seen in a pc game. genuinely, moving around felt way too controlling and the most freedom you had while attacking was using your fucking bow. you need a controller to actually play the game. mojang includes so many accessibility options into their games but they cant even make it fucking fun for pc players despite uploading it to steam for fucks sake?\n\ntl;dr\ngame sucks unless you have a controller, if you dont then its a waste of money", "timestamp_created": 1693055620, "timestamp_updated": 1693055620, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483516484498977661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145050477": {"recommendationid": "145050477", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235259605", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1695878741}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best game out there.

There are many things that shine while playing with a non-gamer player: \n- Loot is not shareable. I would love to go for BIS item and play style, however, it's okay for me. \n- The combat mechanic is a little bit too easy and reward you for going crazy instead of respecting the boss mechanic. I had 2 boss fights, all of them rewarded you for rushing in and burnt em' down. The reaction time to dodge mechanic was insanely low and almost impossible to dodge (at least for me and my girlfriend). \n- On the other hand, there are sweet things bout this game. Firstly, thematic wise, it's really kid friendly (doesn't have any hardcore gore, betrayal, etc). Secondly, it's easy to cruise through a mission/dungeon just by running and slashing. \n- The dungeon map is pretty much linear, there aren't any thing to explore, just some extended areas that is obvious and you can't miss it. \n\nIn the end, if you are looking for any hardcore game, I suggest other titles such as Diablo IV for fast-pace, gear grinding or Baldur's Gate 3 for one of the best games ever created.

Their designs are very funny and unique. I absolutely adore the style and character given to them in the promotional animations, and I always play Minecraft with the Fresh Animations resource pack enabled. The relationship between villagers and illagers is so simple yet so unique. Illagers are classic mustache twirlers and it's always so refreshing to see those kinds of villains. Over the past few updates, villagers have been becoming more and more human, especially with the promotional animations, and I always feel like I should be there to protect them. I like Minecraft Dungeons, the main reason is because of how important villagers and illagers are in the game. I wish the iceollager won the mob vote, if there is ever another villager or illager related mob in the upcoming votes, I will vote for it without question.

All the momories and fun, weapon builds and diversity. Simple is more with MCD. \n\nHowever anyone buying this game in 2023 should be aware:\n\nI've been with MCD on the Microsoft store, swith, xbox, and steam. I've played this game since the start. I have over 300 hours across all platforms and saves (steam i got recently to play with my Significant Other). I am abysmally sad to see microcock has silently rug pulled a game they said to \"seasonally update\" after 3 fucking updates. November 20 2022 was the last update MCD received and iut's clear they have zero intentions to even put in the most basic effort of holiday event reruns to keep the game alive.. No more easily rerunable holiday or anniversary events, no updates on new content, no seasonal events past the third update despite promising seasonal consistent updates,. The last update added tower multiplayer, a new armor, and a new artifact. Since november 20 2022 the game has been purely fucking silent. No teasers, no more posts on the twitter even. The game for all it's worth got three \"seasonal\" updates that were minimal and often extremely delayed, then left to rot.\n\nFor what MCD has though, that rotting corpse is worth the memories. I just wish Microsoft would realize they have a big market to the casual arpg dungeon crawl audience and could actually compete with d4 easily had they just kept platforming and developing this game.

long-time fan of Minecraft, and when I heard about Minecraft Dungeons, I was both excited and curious. Let me tell you, this game absolutely lives up to the hype! It takes the beloved blocky world we all know and love and transforms it into an action-packed dungeon-crawling adventure that's both challenging and incredibly fun.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the game's visual style. The classic Minecraft charm is maintained, and yet, the environments and characters have been beautifully reimagined to fit the dungeon-crawling genre. Every level is a work of art, and the attention to detail is impressive, from the way the light filters through the trees to the unique designs of each enemy you encounter.\n\nThe gameplay is where Minecraft Dungeons truly shines. The controls are smooth and intuitive, making it easy to jump right into the action. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the genre, you'll find the mechanics accessible and enjoyable. It's an excellent gateway for players of all ages to dive into the world of dungeon-crawlers.\n\nThe combat system is addictive, and the variety of weapons and gear you can collect keeps you constantly experimenting with new strategies. The thrill of finding rare loot after defeating a challenging boss is incredibly rewarding. The game encourages both solo play and cooperative multiplayer, and teaming up with friends makes the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nAnother aspect that impressed me was the progression system. As you level up, you earn enchantment points that allow you to customize your gear with unique abilities, further enhancing your playstyle. This adds a layer of depth to the gameplay and keeps you engaged in the long run.\n\nI also appreciate how the developers continuously update the game with new content and features. It shows their dedication to providing a fresh and ever-evolving experience for players.\n\nIf I had to find a flaw, I'd say that the game's story could be a bit more elaborate. While it's not the central focus, a more immersive narrative would have added even more depth to the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Minecraft Dungeons is a delightful addition to the Minecraft universe. Its captivating visuals, addictive gameplay, and cooperative multiplayer elements make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and dungeon-crawling enthusiasts alike. Mojang has once again proven their ability to create compelling and enjoyable experiences, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for the game's future.", "timestamp_created": 1690259714,

I had played the game previously on Xbox game-pass, and had a decent amount of fun. But now that I've payed the $40 for the included DLCs, I seriously would not recommend this game.\n\nThe whole point of the game is combat, and leveling up your gear. The game fundamentally fails at this on numerous levels. The gear you obtain is almost immediately outclassed by randomly dropped loot from mobs, so there is no real incentive to upgrade the gear you have. Emeralds are another issue entirely. You spend most of the missions navigating horribly structured levels (I will go into detail later) for your only reward, if any at all, to be a couple emeralds which you can't spend outside of upgrading your gear (Which I've already explained is pointless.)\n\nThe level design is abhorrent. I often get lost trying to figure out where I'm supposed to be going, and this isn't helped by the fact that the only support the game offers (An almost invisible marker which is frequently covered by the HUD) only works half the time, and will often disappear completely, or as I have mentioned, become covered by the HUD.\n\nThis game has little to no redeeming qualities. Even the combat, which most dungeon crawlers are known for, feels clunky and unfinished. For the price, I recommend purchasing Diablo, or other established dungeon crawlers.

use. \n\nthere really aren't any major downsides besides the crappy keyboard controls. sometimes the game might crash, but that's just because my drivers are outdated and i don't bother to update

bought this game quite recently and beat the game in a day as the game is pretty short, it is very very fun when you start playing and playing coop with friends is extremely fun but after a while the game starts to get repetitive and grinding hours on end for good loot can be a tedious and boring process however it is still fun especially when you begin in the game and i thoroughly reccomend

The Social space also lacks some dearly needed features that its competitors have.\n\nOverall good for a few days grind if you're an adult but if you have a kid tagging along it may add more time to

not the Path of Exile experience Onee-chan had been expecting. All main story maps and DLCs were cleared within 10-20 hours, after which the objective of the game felt far more shallow. Darlings will find it fun to continuously polish builds and strengthen gear, but the gameplay begins to feel repetitive when clearing the same maps over and over again.\n\nUnlike Path of Exile, there isn't much replay value other than experimenting with new builds. The campaign was short and the incentive to progress post-game wasn't exactly strong. The lack of skill trees and an inferior version of gem links in the form of enhancements lack depth. Nonetheless, progression can be very satisfying and there is an abundance of playstyles to try out.\n\nIf darlings are getting an Online-Play Restricted error when attempting to co-op, make sure to check the Family Xbox Settings, and allow it to connect with players online. Darlings may have to amend this setting in the guardian's Xbox account if the account owner belongs to a minor.", "timestamp_created": 1687619608, "timestamp_updated": 1687805546, "voted_up": true,

a while. The general idea of a Minecraft-themed dungeon crawler is excellent. The mechanics themselves feel very good, but (especially on greater difficulties) it becomes an annoying grind that is only fun/satisfying with piercing weapons. The bosses are either too easy (like the supposed final boss) or will instantly kill you with extremely high DPS (COUGH, COUGH, CORRUPTED CAULDRON.)\n\n(SERIOUSLY WHY DOES A BOSS IN A MELEE-ORIENTED GAME INSTANTLY KILL YOU IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO IT TO TRY AND HIT IT WITH SAID MELEE WEAPONS?\nYOU KNOW, COUNTERING 'OUT DPS THE BOSS' METHODS COULD'VE BEEN DONE WITH KNOCKBACK ATTACKS.)\n\nAnyway...\nAnother main gripe is the controls. I understand some people have difficulty using WASD and the number keys simultaneously, but why are you forced to play the whole game like a point-and-click adventure? \n\nThis game has more 'Walk forward and hold M1' gameplay than TF2 and is easier to play one-handed than most porn games on Steam.\n\nThe cross-platform gameplay also doesn't work between Steam users and Minecraft launcher users, sadge\n\nIn summary, it's still pretty fun, but it's pretty easy to get bored.

Instead of classes your character build it completely reliant on the equipment you use. So there is no wrong skilling or hard decisions to be made, because everything can be changed with a few mouse clicks. There is also a simple upgrade system for weapons. For every level you gain, you get a gem that can be used to unlock skills in your gear. Gear can be dismantled anytime to regain all spent gems, so there is no wrongdoing here either. While simple, it still offers plenty of possibilities to form a character of your liking. The classic stereotypes like mages, summoners or barbarians can be put together with the right equipment. There are also some nice synergies between some equipment to make it even more efficient.\n\nDespite its simplicity and a shallow hit feedback from enemies, I had quite some fun with Minecraft Dungeons. I couldn\u2019t play it for hours without end, but for shorter sessions it is a nice gap filler. I recommend the complete package with all the DLC because it adds a lot of levels and variety to the mix. The game is rather short otherwise, but the open ended leveling process, highly scalable missions and seasons passes - that are not time-gated! - will give plenty of playtime if you are into grinding stuff out.

I've gathered a conclusion that while minecraft dungeon is a really fun game, the game becomes a wasted potential due to horrible and irresponsible management from the Devs.\n\nThe end game of the game is really pointless due to the fact that the only place where people would grind for late game gears is \"The Tower\". And the Tower is a comp-on content, which means everyone starts the run in The Tower with default gears given by the system, we can't use our own gears that we got throughout the game. \n\nNow, it's ok if The Tower is a content to grind for special gears to challenge other end game contents in the game, however, The Tower is  a content which invalidate all other contents. Because the loots dropped from The Tower are the strongest and most rarest loots, and are not possible to grind or find anywhere else in the game. In another word, there is no point in playing any other contents or raid or dungeons beside just constantly and repetitively grind The Tower over and over again.\nAnd after you've gotten the best loots from the Tower, you can't even use it in The Tower due to the comp-on aspect.\n\nThe RNG factor is quite horrible so you're forced to consistently retry The Tower to get the correct gear sets. Doing any other contents in the game is simply not worth it because their drops are never as rare as The Tower's.\n\nNot to mention, the biggest issue which is still on-going till this day, is there exist a abusive glitch in The Tower which anyone can do it to amplify the rewards to give out game-breaking gears with insane stats to 1tap or 2tap every max difficulties contents in the game. I have no idea why this glitch was never fixed.\n\nIn short, you are spending 40$ to have a game with a repetitive and messed up and abusive end game system, The Tower, which invalidate all other contents by :\n> Doesn't even allow you to use your own gears\n> Give loots far better than all other contents in the game so you are forced to spam the Tower.\n\nwhile also invalidating all your progress efforts putting into the game if you've grinded up to this point. Not to mention you can already gain access to the Tower after just 5-10 mins of playing because it's available right away just after the tutorial.", "timestamp_created": 1685268768, "timestamp_updated": 1685268768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489373177289962769", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139142969": {"recommendationid": "139142969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834659734", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1680106678}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a pretty good game though i get on and off this game pretty fast.

only the ultimate edition which means if you own minecraft dungeons and want to buy the dlc, you would need to buy the ultimate edition which doesn't account for the fact that you already own minecraft dungeons so it is basically you throwing 5$ away. seems very scummy and pointless.\n\nalso unrelated to the snakeoil salesman side of the game: the game is live service which means you have to be online in order to play the game which is very annoying for people whos internet went out or people with a device like the steam deck. so you should before buying this game consider \"am i going to be able to play this game or am i spending 20/40$ on a registration screen\"\n\nbeyond that a pretty solid game lol", "timestamp_created": 1682608828, "timestamp_updated": 1682608828, "voted_up":

the massively popular sandbox game Minecraft. Developed by Mojang Studios and Double Eleven, Minecraft Dungeons was released in May 2020 and is available on multiple platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\nAs a fan of both Minecraft and dungeon-crawling games, I was excited to try Minecraft Dungeons, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. The game features a simple yet engaging story that follows a group of heroes as they battle the Arch-Illager and his minions to save the land from darkness.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Minecraft Dungeons is its accessibility. The game is easy to pick up and play, even for those who have never played a dungeon-crawling game before. The controls are intuitive, and the game provides helpful tips and tutorials to guide players through the basics.", "timestamp_created": 1681893723, "timestamp_updated": 1681893723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601228296756744385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136946103": {"recommendationid": "136946103", "author": {"steamid": "76561199274609374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1685521774}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD GAME PLAY sry caps", "timestamp_created": 1681890751, "timestamp_updated": 1681890751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136944933": {"recommendationid": "136944933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301308312", "num_games_owned": 993, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1690962481}, "language": "english", "review": "deck support please \ud83d\ude4f", "timestamp_created": 1681887858, "timestamp_updated": 1681887858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759443759918213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136932236": {"recommendationid": "136932236", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112084056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 247, "playtime_at_review": 3604, "last_played": 1700681084}, "language": "spanish", "review": "siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiui", "timestamp_created": 1681860271, "timestamp_updated": 1681860271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136928783": {"recommendationid": "136928783", "author": {"steamid": "76561199299577388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1687986316}, "language": "english", "review": "please update more", "timestamp_created": 1681854693, "timestamp_updated": 1681854693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136916240": {"recommendationid": "136916240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152274091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1681839203}, "language": "english", "review": "The only issue I have is a small one.

mechanics and just builds on the world of minecraft so much more. The story revolves around the arch illager, a villager who finds a strange orb and becomes a cruel ruler, capturing and destroying them and their houses. The storyline isn't too special, however, to take down the arch illager, the player goes through many different areas and challenges, all with special secret areas that you can unlock within them. You can collect and make use of armors, melee weapons, bows, and items, all of which can pack a punch against enemy mobs. Melee weapons are, well, melee weapons, armors are armors, bows are ranged items, and all of which take on different variants and types, with an enchantment system in place. You gain enchantment points by leveling up, and they can be used to enchant any type of equippable. Enchantments can be tons of different things, from making a melee weapon deal fire damage, to making fire explode from behind you when you roll, to making pets deal more damage, to making lightning strike wherever you hit. You can equip up to 3 items, which can do different things, from summoning a llama to fight for you, to summoning a beam of darkness to engulf and destory your enemies.

The gameplay is not very engaging and quickly becomes tedious, especially when you're replaying the same levels over and over again. And while there are different quests and enemies, it all quickly becomes predictable and monotonous. The graphics didn't impress me either. They don't meet my expectations and seem outdated. I didn't expect such a level of graphics from a game released in 2020. Additionally, the game can be quite buggy, with lag and loading problems. But there are some pros. For example, Minecraft Dungeons can be interesting for those who enjoy playing co-op. Sometimes it can even be fun when you play with your friends. Also, the game can be simple for beginners who are just starting out in the genre.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a game with great graphics and an exciting gameplay, I would suggest looking for

I just wanted something simple to play while I listened to podcasts. But I was compelled to leave my first review ever because of the horrendous DRM applied to this game. \n\n-you need to login with your microsoft account to play. Which is fine except for that it doesn't seem to always remember your credentials, so you need to relogin often. And it makes it so you can never play truly offline.\n\n-say you switch between steam deck and PC. Every time you play on one device, when you finish you need to upload your character, then download it on the other device to play there. Why is this necessary???\n\n-on steam deck, I often need to restart the game multiple times to actually get to the game. Sometimes a white rectangle will show instead of the login box. So I restart. Sometimes I can't access the menu to download my previous save, so I need to restart.\n\nPlus some gameplay issues:\n- if you enchant something, you can't enchantment without getting rid of the weapon entirely\n\n-IMPORTANT: you can't ever truly pause the game, even in \"offline\" (but not actually offline, you still need to login) mode. Bring up the menu, you can still get attacked and killed by mobs. Some of the maps I've played can take at least 45 minutes to complete. Very weird choice.\n\nAfter the 5th time dealing with the upload/download thing, I got tired and decided to stop entirely. It can be fun, but not fun enough to deal with that.\n\nMicrosoft--if you're not going to take advantage of the cloud-save features that dang near every other steam game uses, including indie games with a single developer, don't put it here. I don't know much about game development or steam integration but I have to imagine your employees are capable of figuring it out, clearly this is a weird business decision.

I don't have any hours on steam, however I have over 100 hours in the game because I played on PC via Game Pass Ultimate. They even have cloud saving now. It was annoying to uninstall the game then try to reinstall it and find all my progress gone. I ended up losing some damn good loot and a build i was pretty proud of. I started over with the leveling because i basically had no choice. I beat the base game my second time around got to a decently high level with plenty of great loot just like last time. I uninstalled it having finished what I could without the DLC. Now that I have it on steam and they've added cloud saves, this becomes another game I can just play and chillax with the boys.

Handles like a drunken washing machine sometimes. Very easy for your character to pathfind into an obstacle, get stuck and consequently get killed. Inconceivable why a PC version of the game has controller support but not WASD movement support.\n- No auto cloudsave option despite requiring you to play with an active internet connection and being signed in to Microsoft Services.

It's point and click rather than WASD, which I don't really like and there's no way to change it (that I know of).\n 2)There's a lot of things that you can only do with DLC's. It really has the Destiny 2 effect where it says there is so many different missions, skins, artifacts, pets, weapons and places to explore only to find out that you need to pay 5:99 to unlock it.\n Other than that I totally recommend you give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1673921471, "timestamp_updated": 1673921471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130980126": {"recommendationid": "130980126", "author": {"steamid": "76561199361414588", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1694376139}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun, controller recommended", "timestamp_created": 1673888107, "timestamp_updated": 1673888107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130974049": {"recommendationid": "130974049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028402353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1699953143}, "language": "english", "review": "since blizzard decided to take a dumb on the diablo IP, this is a really good substitute", "timestamp_created": 1673881430, "timestamp_updated": 1673881430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759443759918213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130957040": {"recommendationid": "130957040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097771451", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 2398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1896, "last_played": 1686806107}, "language": "english", "review": "its pretty fun, even more so with friends", "timestamp_created": 1673855199, "timestamp_updated": 1673855199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130939405": {"recommendationid": "130939405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334122730", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1698848139}, "language": "spanish", "review": "BUENARDO", "timestamp_created": 1673827163, "timestamp_updated": 1673827163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130939342": {"recommendationid": "130939342", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005271910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 2742, "last_played": 1699583793}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego en si es muy entretenido, tiene buenos gr\u00e1ficos, buenas misiones, habilidades, armas y muchisimas cosas que lo hacen divertido de jugar, mejor si lo juegas con amigos\n\nYo tenia varios heroes bien subidos de nivel que jugue con mi amigo, al tiempo deje el juego porque mi amigo no podia jugar, y jugar solo a niveles tan altos no era muy f\u00e1cil\n\n1 a\u00f1o despues tuve que formatear mi PC por un virus y tuve que tomarme la molestia de volver a instalar todo denuevo\n\nhoy descargue el juego y me tope con la sorpresa de que la sincronizaci\u00f3n con la nube (lo que guarda tu partida) es MANUAL.

The DLCs are not that expensive, and grant something unique for every expansion, and new mechanics too.\n\nCons: \nStill alot of the game require you buying the DLCs to the game. Without them you are stuck with the first map, and the aincient hunt, the tower, and maybe 1-2 worlds on DLC maps for you to want to play more and buy them. Without the DLCs of the game the game can become boring really quick, since it's the same maps you are playing over and over again to gain new stuff from new difficulties, or just higher power level items.

Instead you have 3 pieces of gear, melee armor and bow (not ranged since I guess coming up with a long distance weapon that didnt involve sticks and string was too hard) but hey that would be fine if finding new gear was fun and exciting right?\n\n - actually finding gear is a pain in the fucking ass and 90% of the gear you do manage to scrounge up is garbage you'll trash for emeralds. actually exploring these pretty levels is NOT worth your time EVER, from what I can tell side paths actually having loot is based on rng so from my experience 70% of the time you end up with nothing 20% of the time you end up with emeralds and 10% of the time theres an actual chest with an item! (The chance of said item being usable being 1%...) For example I spent 20 minutes wandering through the first nether level exploring all the little nooks just to get 2 common weapons from mobs drops(I found NOTHING on the side paths) I immediately trashed. Like wow I really want to go see what garbage I can find on the next mission!\n\n- At first combat seems cool with the rolling mechanic but because someone with a dent in their head gave it a cool down combat boils down to 2 things. A: walk up to an enemy and spam melee while tanking their attacks or B: Sit back and poke every enemy down with a bow. There is also the alternative of C which if I dipped my brain into a deep fryer and smoked some black mold I think might actually be the way the devs want you to play, walk up hit an enemy once or twice roll back and wait 10 secs for it to go off cd and repeat! For all 100+ enemies on the level...\n\n\nIf I was still a child in love with minecraft I might actually be able to enjoy this but if you've ever played another rpg in your life all you'll be thinking is \"Man I could be playing something fun like rpg X instead...\"", "timestamp_created": 1673338729, "timestamp_updated": 1673338855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538936614990234375", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130555654": {"recommendationid": "130555654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052361950", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1690771514}, "language": "english", "review": "Saves don't save in cloud, so you have to download the save every time and upload it to play.

Dungeons is a fun re-imagination of the immensely popular and beloved game, Minecraft, as a dungeon crawler. The game expands on the already familiar mobs, both friendly and hostile, by introducing new variations as well as new mobs all-together. The world within Minecraft is truly brought to life in the movement of the player and mobs, but even more so in the graphics and sound design of the environments as well as the storytelling.\n\nThe plethora of different artifacts, gear, and enchantments create unique opportunities for combinations of abilities and special attacks to help overcome the onslaught of hostile enemies. With the game introducing seasonal events and weekly challenges replayability simply isn't a concern for me. While the game invites you to play with up to four friends, I've only had to opportunity to play alongside one. We had no issue playing between the Steam and the Minecraft Launcher versions. \n\nMy girlfriend bought the game for me as a Christmas gift, but I ultimately wanted the game through Steam for a handful of reasons. Steam is where most of my games are located, I enjoy the community aspect and tracking achievements, and I wanted the ability the play the game mobile on the Steam Deck despite it being listed as \"unsupported\".

The game has a simple but satisfying combat system, with a good variety of weapons and abilities to choose from. The levels are well-designed, with a good mix of enemies and obstacles to overcome. The game also has a progression system that allows you to level up and unlock new gear, adding a layer of replayability.\nOne of the standout features of Minecraft Dungeons is its art style. The game uses the blocky aesthetic of Minecraft, but with a more colorful and cartoony look. It's a unique and charming style that sets the game apart. The music and sound effects are also well done, adding to the atmosphere.\nThe only downside to Minecraft Dungeons is that it can be a bit easy at times, especially if you're playing with a group of friends. The game doesn't have much in terms of difficulty options, so if you're looking for a more challenging experience, you might be disappointed.\nOverall, Minecraft Dungeons is a fun and enjoyable game that's easy to pick up and play. Its simple but satisfying combat, charming art style, and replayability make it a game that's worth checking out.

I already played via Microsoft store, and rebought it for Steam with the DLCs. It's simple to play, but oodles of fun. You can play around with so many different builds from mage, tank, rogue and archer... or mix them all up and see what happens! You can keep plenty of armor sets too, so you can even change your 'class' after every mission if you want to, which keeps things exciting. There are plenty of secrets to find (secret levels and secret loot), and lots of achievements to work towards. The game feels balanced whilst allowing the players to feel powerful at the same time, love this. If you're a fan of Minecraft or ARPGs in general, you have to try this game, it's just awesome.\nPS... beware the Enderman.

This version through Steam does not seem to have the same problems.\n\nMinecraft Dungeons is more whimsical than the Diablo franchise, but still a lot of fun to play with friends. The amount of effort and detail put into this game is actually astonishing and every map has fun secrets and interesting visuals. Buildcrafting is diverse and creative and allows for a lot of unique playstyles and synergies. Most importantly, you can pet the dog in the camp.\n\nThe biggest downside--apart from occasional bugs--is some secrets are locked to a specific view of a map. If you didn't happen to randomly generate the correct view, you can't access that chest. This is especially annoying if it happens several times in a row. A fix that might help alleviate this issue is an option to remove the manual interact on doors, so even if you can't physically click on the door you can still access a hidden room if you know how to

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

designed artifacts, weapons, and armor types.\n- some of the best graphics (and play-style) i've ever seen\n- Good dlcs that are worth the money $$$\n- VERY, VERY easy to hack, mod, etc\n- quirky Easter eggs \n-  if you would like to collect all the items, that's an ambition that'll go for a loooong time\n- A light, accessible take on the dungeon crawler genre\n- family friendly, and just plain fun\n- new enchantments that spike the minecraft element, yet keeps the spin-off unique.\n(May add more)\n\nCONS: \n- the secret cow level\n- very repetitive, when you beat all the levels it will get boring\n- no proper trading system (but a merchant applies a {risky} substitute)\n- I still can't play multiplayer:( (PC only)\n- may be too frustrating at times\n- the main campain is incredibly short\n- unless you have dlcs, the game may feel unfinished to an extent\n- Rudimentary systems\n- Gold is extremely hard (long) to aquire.\n- WHY IS THE ACTUAL ENDING IN A D.L.C\n(may add more)\n\nNote that this is my opinion, and you can add or subtract from this anyway you like to fell comfortable, and you can see the pros obviously outweigh the cons", "timestamp_created":

The controls are simple and the gameplay is clear. After the first levels of the campaign, in which I searched every corner for secrets as usual, I realized that the game lacked depth for my taste. You don't really have to look for hidden boxes. You stumble over them on the way through repetitive level design and always the same hordes of enemies.\n\nThe items in the game come with randomly generated perks, which offer at least a touch of variety when looting the different dungeons. However, since the items also result in the entirety of the character development, this is hardly sufficient. Leveling is therefore monotonous and doesn't exactly invite you to play the game again.\nWith the right combination of items you can assign yourself to a certain class, which in multiplayer makes sense here and there from the gameplay, however, it is simply worth equipping the best possible items.\n\nThe \"campaign\" itself also leaves a lot to be desired. These wishes are partly fulfilled with the DLCs, but could have been included in the main game.\nThe monotony of the opponents can also be seen in the bosses. I can count them on one hand, so I'm not really impressed.\n\nIf the flattened gameplay wasn't enough, the controls are also mouse milking. A controller may help, but if you play with a mouse and keyboard, you can expect something. You navigate by clicking through the world, but the pathing is so horrible that the character keeps running in unwanted directions or moving back and forth very quickly on the spot. Positioning yourself to jump onto a platform, for example, is an ordeal in itself, as you can only jump in the direction of travel.\nIf you run under a bridge or a tunnel, the game sees this as pathable terrain and moves the character in a direction unknown to the player.\n\nI was too stingy and had to play through the game to sleep with the feeling of having thrown money out of the window. But the longer I played, the more the little things just mentioned got on my nerves. Maybe I'm just too old for a game obviously intended for a younger audience.\nIt just wasn't worth the 40\u20ac to me.\n\n\n- Graphic          8/10\n- sound             5/10\n- fun

Minecraft Dungeons at launch on PC via the MSFT Store. I loved the game then and I love the game now. It is a simple, easier take on the Diablo formula that is fun and refreshing while leaning on the popularity/nostalgia of the Minecraft franchise. Who would have guessed that one of the most popular games of all time that is based around player-driven adventure and narrative would lend itself well to another title that is based in that infinite world of storytelling and adventure? The game is not particularly challenging while providing constant dopamine hits in the form of an ever-steady stream of better and better loot. The game caters to many different playstyles and all around is mechanically sound. The game is graphically impressive for an Xbox Studios title, and the sound design is equally pleasing. I've had many, MANY issues with random crashes and being unable to play with friends, but the game is worth the hassle. I've been informed by child owners that the game is a good gateway for introducing more mechanically complex titles to your little gamers. Either way, I've had fun with this and you likely will too if you like Diablo or Torchlight.", "timestamp_created": 1668558067, "timestamp_updated": 1668558067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602225303649902344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125544313": {"recommendationid": "125544313", "author": {"steamid": "76561199309680471", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 867, "last_played": 1688429946}, "language": "english", "review": "Great! game", "timestamp_created": 1668551920, "timestamp_updated": 1668551920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125531371": {"recommendationid": "125531371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272697794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2992, "last_played": 1669512999}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1668532825, "timestamp_updated": 1668532825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125531098": {"recommendationid": "125531098", "author": {"steamid": "76561199408110500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1695917868}, "language": "english", "review": "Its very good game because this game has better graphics than normal Minecraft.

DONT MOVE THIS GAME TO ANOTHER DRIVE UNLESS YOU BACKUP YOUR SAVE. DOING SO WILL DELETE YOUR SAVE FILE. learned that the hard way and lost several hours of progress and lost some event exclusive items. another thing is that i wish there was an automatic inventory sorting. if you swap alot of your gear around, you will have a bunch of unsorted gear and will take a bit to find gear that you want. another issue is that just sometimes a dungeon's rng can completely ruin a run. if a mob has the worst enchantment combinations, its impossible to approach or even outright bypass and/or avoid. another thing i wish was a way to have an ingame bestiary or a guide or some sorts form some of the ingame mechanics, like which which rune combinations will get you a specific ancient during a hunt or which item can have which enchantments. final issue is that having items i cant ever obtained since i missed an event kinda sucks, as even though the event items are just reskins, its cool just collecting them and if im struggling on a level the gear is generally stronger than what i have. otherwise its an alright game. if its ever on sale and you want to get into dungeon crawling then pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1667248717, "timestamp_updated": 1667248717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4825572669506073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124734325": {"recommendationid": "124734325", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048870588", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1687974758}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game :D", "timestamp_created": 1667243137, "timestamp_updated": 1667243137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124730420": {"recommendationid": "124730420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149658015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1696783013}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and sweet, it's a really addicting game surprisingly", "timestamp_created": 1667237993, "timestamp_updated": 1667237993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124710207": {"recommendationid": "124710207", "author": {"steamid": "76561199248016207", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3185, "last_played": 1694453575}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

Now I've been an avid gamer since the days of the Atari, and have always loved a good dungeon crawl. After getting Covid I needed something to pass the time. So here's my review, from someone that still does not like Minecraft! :D \n\n[b] Gameplay & Mechanics: 4/5 [/b]\nHonestly, this is about as mindless and simple as one can get for a dungeon crawl. That being said, don't let it's simplistic nature fool you. That saying \"less is more\" definitely holds true with this game. The only reason this does not get a full 5 stars is that while it is simple, there is a decent lack of in-game descriptions as to how some of the mechanics work. \n\n[b] Visuals: 5/5 [/b]\nOk, so I've always been a fan of the 'pixel' art style, especially since I've gotten into VR gaming. This art style is also one of the reasons I never liked Minecraft. Now go figure, here I am praising them. The visuals in this game will definitely not win any state of the art lifelike awards, but it definitely fits the story and atmosphere PERFECTLY! Taken for what this game is, what Minecraft is, these visuals work. And to be honest, some of the maps truly are quite amazing... even for pixels. \n\n[b] Soundtrack: 4/5 [/b]\nSo the soundtrack to this game, by itself is rather pleasant and relaxing. If that were the only thing this rating was based on, it would be a 5. However, when you couple it with the story and different areas... some of them just don't \"fit\". Not to say that's a bad thing, just didn't give the proper feel in some areas. \n\nSide note, I listen to the soundtrack by itself for my reflective meditations in the mornings. That's how much I enjoy the actual soundtrack. \n\n[b] Character Development: 5/5 [/b]\nOk, so this section took me a while to figure out how I wanted to rate it. Because, frankly, there isn't any character development... not in the traditional RPG sense of the word. \n\nYou have your character, you can pick your character's skin (that has no impact on the game in anyway), and you're off to save the world! You have a few cosmetic options, and a few more unlocked along the way. And that's it... as far as the character itself goes. Yea, I know, this sounds rather lacking for an RPG... but it's quite the opposite. You build your character with the gear you equip. You have a melee weapon, ranged weapon, armor, and 3 artifact slots. Each one of these slots offers a unique play-style. There are literally hundreds of combinations you can make for how you want to play. Throw in a basic enchantment mechanic for your gear, and you're off. \n\n[b] Price Point, DLC, and Cash Grab: 5/5 [/b]\nSo with as simple as this game is, it is in fact a dungeon crawl. And what do we do in a good ol dungeon crawl??? We farm till we can't farm anymore... then we farm some more. Always in search of the perfect drop, the perfect upgrade. \n\nThe base game alone, coming in at $19.99 is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I have a scale, for every dollar I spend on a game, I want to get one good hour of play out of the game. Well, I've definitely gotten my money's worth. \n\nWe move on to the DLC; with 5 different DLC packs, each one costing $5.99, I was a bit concerned. However, each one definitely offers enough content to make it worth the price. Though, I would suggest buying the Ultimate Edition for $39.99. Even if you have reservations about playing the additional content, this is a MUCH better value than buying the base game and then DLCs down the line. \n\nLastly, we have that dreaded Adventure Pass. I hate.... and cannot stress this enough... [b] HATE [/b] the idea of an Adventure Pass of any kind in any game. You have me buy the game, then you have me buy the DLC to fully enjoy the game... now you want me to give you more money for rewards on playing said game? So yea... I saw this and almost instantly decided against this game all together. There are currently 2 seasons of Adventure Passes, each one costing $3.99. These are NOT included in the Ultimate Edition. (that kind of pissed me off honestly)\n\nHowever, for that little price point, you get a bunch of content outside of just paid cosmetic unlockables. They actually offer additional content as well. \n\nSo with all that, I can forgive the use of an Adventure Pass... this once. \n\n[b] Overall: 4.6/5 [/b]\nDo you like a good ol fashioned dungeon crawl? Than go pick this game up, you won't be disappointed. \nDo you want some fancy flashy dungeon crawl that takes hours to plan out your next move, and detailed character development... this is not the game for you. Though I suggest you play it anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1663928030, "timestamp_updated": 1663928030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count":
