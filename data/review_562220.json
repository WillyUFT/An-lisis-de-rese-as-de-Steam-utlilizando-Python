Each game in the series offers an assortment of colorful letters that can be used creatively to enhance your Steam profile, provided you're willing to put in the effort.\n\nBut here's the catch \u2013 some might not appreciate the fact that these achievements, when left uncompleted, can significantly lower your overall achievement completion average. To maintain your average, you'll need to meticulously play through every single level of every game, which can amount to hundreds or even thousands of achievements left untouched across the series.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Zup series starts off relatively easy, but there's a twist. Some levels are better suited for touch screens to nail the timing precisely. And let's not forget about the hidden achievements that require you to tap random parts of the screen on random levels. If you're aiming for that coveted 100%, be prepared to have YouTube at the ready and be ready to spend hours on end working your way through these games.\n\nIn summary, the Zup series is a unique achievement treasure for Steam design enthusiasts, but it comes with the caveat of potentially affecting your overall achievement completion average. The gameplay starts easy but can get tricky, especially when touch screens are involved. Hidden achievements add to the challenge, making full completion a test of patience and determination. If you're up for the task, dive in and design your Steam profile with a colorful array of achievements!\n\nDisclaimer: I DO utilize AI to assist in crafting my reviews. Here's how it works:\n1.

Zup! itself is very simplistic and casual friendly, while at the same time it's satisfying to complete.\n\nIf you have never played the first game, here's what you can expect from Zup! 2 and the original Zup! \nYour goal is very simple, get the blue ball to land on the green platform without any other blocks or obstacles underneath it. You can move the blue ball by clicking on a red cube, which will cause an explosion and therefore move the blue ball accordingly. Complete all the levels to beat the game and gg. Expect anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour of game-play from this game. Almost all of the achievements are unlocked via simply playing through the game, however there are a few that require you to click on random things in the multiple menu's and things of that nature. Nevertheless, all achievements are very easy to unlock.\n\n6.5/10- Not much was actually added to this game from the first, short of new levels following the same exact concepts from the first game, achievements icons that weren't previously offered and some nice backgrounds and emotes. Therefore, I don't find a need to change anything about the games original rating. So long as you're aware you're purchasing a game that was seemingly designed to make your Steam Profile look nice, you'll be satisfied with your purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1604763936,

Currently there are 15 zup games, any future ones will most likely hold this same criticism, however, I can only speak for the current ones.\n\nZup exists for one thing and one thing only. To pad your achievements on steam. Every level you play gives you a bunch of achievements, even just opening the game for the first time will drown you in achievements. One of the most common reasons for wanting said achievements is for your achievement showcase on your steam profile as each achievement in the game is a letter of the alphabet or a number this game will allow you to spell stuff out in there. If this is all you're looking for out of the game then I suppose it's for you.\n\nGameplay wise zup sucks. It's a physics based puzzle game with inconsistent physics and easy to solve puzzles (when the physics work). Each zup game is a clone of the others and really should just be sold as one large game since they are identical in everything except the achievements you get and the layout of levels. If they were all combined into one and even had a level editor so users could then create their own levels on the workshop then this game would be worth picking up and even worth more than the $0.99 asking price. But as it is I highly recommended against the game for anything gameplay related.

Why would you want to play these? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThere is no actual story here other than the stories you will tell people about how much fun the game is to play.\n\nCan\u2019t rate what doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in Zup! and Zup!2 is basically the same throughout. You have a blue square (in Zup!) and a blue circle (in Zup!2). Your goal is to get that blue object onto what I will call the \u201csafe platform\u201d. Doing so unlocks the next level. How you accomplish this is by clicking on explosive red boxes and create the physics based scenario wherein you try to manipulate the explosion(s) and reactions to said explosion(s) to get the blue object where it needs to go. The happens via the other objects, which are white, and serve as the core for manipulating the blue object.\n\nHow this  works is as follows: you create an explosion, which sends the white objects flying, knocking them into the blue object, sending them on their way. this is done in a multitude of ways throughout both games, which creates a compelling and addictive diversity to the puzzles. For example, in some puzzles you are simply blowing apart a structure, whereas in others you are essentially shooting white objects at the blue objects using proper trajectory and inertia. There are also obstacles placed throughout the levels to increase difficulty and the placement of the landing zone itself might be part of the puzzle as well rather than simply the end goal. Sometimes you even need to impact the movement while the pieces are already flying.\n\nThat is really about all there is to both games. Zup!2 features the blue object as a circle, which makes it a little more difficult since the circle rolls, and you will need to take that into account when trying to complete a level.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are pretty bare bones and simply serve as a means to an end. They aren\u2019t really an important aspect to the games. That said, they looks cool for what they are. Sort of minimalist early era gaming look (think Pong, but better). They are perfect for what they are set to accomplish however.\n\n8 out of 10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe audio is also pretty basic and really just serves to keep you a bit more engaged. Consider it to be much like an arcade game in this regard. Again, think Pong, but with explosions.\n\nNot enough to rate.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nFun as hell would be my verdict for both Zup! and Zup!2! These are really a simple games at heart, although some of the levels can be challenging. Despite its overall simplicity, Zup! and Zup!2 still manage to be addictive simple fun that you will enjoy. each game takes about a half hour to complete, and there isn't necessarily any replay value unless you simply want to repeat/revisit levels. One other thing of note for Steam users who like to dress up their profile pages: Zup! and Zup!2 feature a ton of achievements (around 250ish), and each drops as either a version of QWERTY or a fabled Steam icon such as the Half Life crowbar or Gabe-N himself. Additionally, both games are incredibly easy to 100% as well for the achievement hunters out there.\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

As usual clicking the red boxes make them explode, pushing the blue cube to different areas. Yellow cubes are not clickable and are used as blockades to help the cube reach the platform. The levels are just as what you expect from the zup! game. The first few levels are simple, it gets harder and harder. The games gameplay is still fun and worth the asking price. \n\nCONTROLS:\n\nUsing the mouse click red cubes for them to explode and guide the blue square to the platform, Its simple and straight forward.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThe game is Zup! the expectations of it all keep up with the first game.

I personally do enjoy this type of puzzle, but keep in mind the game is quite short, clocking in at about 30 minutes of gameplay for 66 stages, and its main selling point is a mess of achievements for the sole purpose of steam profile decoration. If you get it, get it on sale with the rest of them.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list][*]15 meg download, runs on a potato PC just fine\n    [*]Clean presentation, simple controls, simple gameplay\n    [*]66 levels with 11 optional free DLC\n[*]Cheap physics puzzlers tend to have bugs and unpredictable results when you redo stages. I couldn't find any such problems playing [b]Zup! 2[/b]\n[*]Slightly more challenging than the first; more precision timing based puzzles that rely less on random clicking.\n[*]A very easy 100% for achievement hunters\n[*]People who like to decorate their profile will find a wider set of characters in this sequel\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*]Even with more stages this game took me no longer than the first. I really think the ZUPs should be consolidated into less games.\n[*]While some stages have a little room for different solutions, it is largely the same, meaning low replayability if at all.\n[*]Nothing new - all the previous elements are here from [b]Zup![/b] making this feel like an expansion, not a new game. Why not introduce the silver blocks that until now have been DLC only?\n[*]While achievement decoration serves a purpose, it's also becoming ridiculous: doubles and triples of the same character in different colors per stage. Clear cash grabs like Gaben achievement.

Therefore, I will be literally copy/pasting this across all of my reviews.\nMany people call these games out, citing that they're card farming games. While this may or may not be true, these games have some very good puzzles. Sure, they're short, but I feel that the price I paid for them is well worth it (Less than a dollar for each game in the summer sale?!). Some of the puzzles are really well thought out and it feels good to complete a game like this. So here's the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Good music, never found myself reaching for the mute button. The music IS on a loop, but it's comparable to Hexcells' music, so if you enjoyed that game's music, you'll enjoy their music as well.\n-Well designed puzzles, especially in 4 and Zero.\n\nCould be a pro or a con:\n-A ton of achievements. If you don't want to artificially inflate your achievement count, don't play any of these passed 1 and 2. If you don't care or you in fact do want to do that, go ahead and play all of them\n-Feels like one of those games you would love to play on Flash sites like Newgrounds or Kongregate\n\nCons: \n-Short, but enjoyable. You could actually fuck the dev(s?) out of money by getting 100% achievements in less than the 2 hour refund period\n\nOverall, I enjoyed these games enough to recommend them all.", "timestamp_created": 1499279887, "timestamp_updated": 1499279887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502512574195861816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33248994": {"recommendationid": "33248994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304436813", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1499202890}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game ever!

The achievements have letters and symbols on them for people to spell out their names or whatever they want in their steam achievement showcase.\n\nIf you have any issues with getting past a level, you can just use the community guides and you should be able to get all the achievements within a few minutes (I got the cards, which is why I have many hours in all zup games). \n\n[h1][b]Overall...[/b][/h1] \nPersonally, I like Zup! Zero the best, because I like the look of the achievement look better than the other zup games. \n10/10 Definitely would recommend. Anyone over level 10 on steam should get this. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n-Good music\n-Easy \n-Achievements for profile feature box\n\n[b]Cons:[/b] \n-Hm.... Cant think of any\n\nDefinitely get the bundle so you can get thousands of achievements easily at a more affordable price.", "timestamp_created": 1493596188, "timestamp_updated": 1514085261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500990092754364014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31472562": {"recommendationid": "31472562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123080333", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1516824632}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and strategic, and extremely good for achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1493585502, "timestamp_updated": 1493585502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31463659": {"recommendationid": "31463659", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962090181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 842, "playtime_forever": 1936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1399, "last_played": 1502011887}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1493558658, "timestamp_updated": 1493558658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540118515491485596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31447851": {"recommendationid": "31447851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058587732", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1536016481}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game i love it :D", "timestamp_created": 1493495247, "timestamp_updated": 1493495247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31434431": {"recommendationid": "31434431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214074508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1493472076}, "language": "spanish", "review": "-En poco m\u00e1s de 1 hora te lo pasas.\n-La sensaci\u00f3n que da las f\u00edsicas se goza basto.\n-Montonazo de logros y tiene cromos.\nNota: 5,5/10.\n\n\u00bfRecomendable?

This game still has a lot of the problems that I mentioned in my review of Zup! 1, but makes up for these flaws a little with better level design.\n\nConsidering the low price, I recommend this game\n\nOverall:\n5.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1488521560, "timestamp_updated": 1488521919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30288466": {"recommendationid": "30288466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355704454", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1509295684}, "language": "english", "review": "Really short game, but fun!

Game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STIjAmZypzs\n+ 229 Achievements that can be obtained in ~25mins\n+ The gameplay is pretty fun. The goal is to land the blue ball on the green platform. To do this you must explode the red blocks which will launch the yellow blocks away from the blast allowing the blue ball to reach the platform. Most levels have multiple red explosive blocks, so your job is to figure out which ones to explode and when.\n+ As a sequel the main difference between Zup! 1 and Zup! 2 is the blue ball. Since it rolls, you have to make sure it doesn't roll off the platform. Zup! 2 also seems to rely a lot more on chain reactions, and levels that require you to slingshot the ball across the level with very precisely timed explosions.\n+ Creatively designed levels which keeps the game feeling fresh and enjoyable from start to finish. (pretty surprising considering how simple the concept is)\n+ The game has the right balance of not being too difficult while still being a fair bit challenging. Some stages make the player think a fair bit in order to find the solution.\n\n- Sometimes the physics feels a bit \"random\" making a few stages reliant on luck which can be a bit irritating.", "timestamp_created": 1486994428, "timestamp_updated": 1486994428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29893198": {"recommendationid": "29893198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035953669", "num_games_owned": 954, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1485645841}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing Zup! made me not want to play Zup! 2.\n\n5/10 \nWould idle for cards again", "timestamp_created": 1486969498, "timestamp_updated": 1486969498, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475715219974517822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29882885": {"recommendationid": "29882885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141226376", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1487056618}, "language": "english", "review": "simple game with small strategy. nice job", "timestamp_created": 1486933575, "timestamp_updated": 1486933575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29882016": {"recommendationid": "29882016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114582610", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1486163545}, "language": "english", "review": "It has some cool achivments", "timestamp_created": 1486930882, "timestamp_updated": 1486930882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29880503": {"recommendationid": "29880503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142237667", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1493824987}, "language": "english", "review": "An improvement over the Original in every way!

To do this you must explode the red blocks which will launch the yellow blocks away from the blast allowing the blue ball to reach the platform. Most levels have multiple red explosive blocks, so your job is to figure out which ones to explode and when.\n+ As a sequel the main difference between Zup! 1 and Zup! 2 is the blue ball. Since it rolls, you have to make sure it doesn't roll off the platform. Zup! 2 also seems to rely a lot more on chain reactions, and levels that require you to slingshot the ball across the level with very precisely timed explosions.\n+ Creatively designed levels which keeps the game feeling fresh and enjoyable from start to finish.

And I couldn't be happier with it.\n\nThey could have very easily just extended the model of the first game and given us more of the same, but I really appreciate how some serious thought appears to have gone into the layout of the stages as they've constructed some really clever puzzles. They're still all relatively easy to get through, but are way more fun this time around and more often than not they put a huge smile on my face.\n\nIt's stupid just how satisfying it is to launch the ball up into the air then nail the timing perfectly to hit it with another block and send it flying onto the target first go, or to send it hopping from one explosion to the next whilst dodging moving obstacles and still getting it home safe. That alone is almost worth the price of admission.\n\nWhile I still don't feel the need to run out into the street, grab the nearest stranger I see by the collar and yell at them to get this game as soon as they can, it's still an absolutely rock solid title that comes easily recommended and that I'd happily play more of.", "timestamp_created": 1485285675, "timestamp_updated": 1485285675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57946014404296875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29462063": {"recommendationid": "29462063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059573093", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1483562571}, "language": "english", "review": "For spending little over 40 minutes, you can complete the entire game.

This was mostly due to my prior experiences with Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017, another recent title that markets itself in a similar fashion. \"Short, Simple, Earn loads of achievements\". And I'd be lying if I said this game is perfect, but I have to give praise where praise is due. This game really surprised me!\n\nThe very first distinction I'd like to make between this and Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is that unlike that dissappointment, I would actually consider this a game and a rather enjoyable and intuitive one at that! It is clear that Zup! goes for the same demographic; achievement hunters, completionists, whatever you want to call them. I consider myself part of that group, so I felt inclined to give this game a try despite my rather low expectations. Very much like the building blocks that you interact with in Zup! my expectations were blown away! This is definitely a puzzle game first and foremost, and an achievement treasure second.\n\nYour objective is to bring the blue square onto the green tiles through the use of explosions. The red squares are explosive and clicking them will make them blow up, knocking any yellow and blue squares away in the process. It really is as simple as that. But just because the mechanics are simple it doesn't necessarely mean that the game itself is easy, in fact I'd say far from it.\n\nThe levels start out easy enough, and for the first few levels it feels like this might have actually been a bad choice after all, just another cash grab copy paste job with loads of achievements attached, but then you reach level 10 and things start to get interesting. As you progress through the game each level becomes more and more challenging and you need to both think of the right solution and make use of your reflexes and predictions to launch the blue square with the right trajectory and force to get it where it needs to be.\n\nSoon I had forgotten about my prior pessimism and was instead joyfully exploring in how many ways I could try to knock the yellow block-towers down and with what sort of speed I could send the blue square flying in order to solve the puzzle in front of me. The simple yet addictive nature of the game had caught me entirely off guard and I was getting more and more intrigued and hopeful for the next challenge the game would provide me with...\n\nAnd then it ended. Just like that.\n\nIf anything, that would be my only real gripe with the title, it is extremely short. I beat the whole thing with 100% achivements in only a couple of minutes, and I wish it would go on for a bit longer as I was actually having quite a bit of fun with it. But to be fair the game has a very low price point and the tags do describe it as \"short\" so I should have been expecting it to end rather quickly.\n\nAll that said, I hope you understand my thoughts about this game but in case I was too lengthy in my description of it and the enjoyment it gave me let me try to sum it up in a few short words:\n\nThis is a short but fun and intuitive physics puzzle game. I had a lot of fun with it and the achievements are a bonus rather than the main focus. I recommend this highly if you want some quick fun, and I suggest you pick up the Zup-Zup!

Why? Because it's pure fun for the half hour it'll take you to finish the game. In [i]Zup![/i] You need to get a blue cube to a green platform. You accomplish this by clicking on one or more red cubes that explode and send the blue and yellow cubes flying in the air. Sometimes a sequence of a few timed jumps is needed to get the blue cube to its target, but it's never a frustrating experience. It's just giggly fun. The game makes use of the Steam Achievements to add some more giggles by throwing an achievement your way for about anything you do in the game. You will easily get 118/118 achievements in half an hour. Seriously, if you want a cheap half hour of pure innocent fun, pick up [i]Zup![/i] when it's on sale.\n\nBut as for [i]Zup!2[/i], I have to say no. The only difference is that the blue cube has become a ball, which makes for slightly more interesting physics. But they have taken the achievements joke a bit too far in [i]Zup!2[/i]: you simply get 3 achievements for anything you do. In the first game, you get an achievement for starting a level and for ending a level -haha- but in the second game you get three achievements for each level and for each and every action that's connected to the Steam Achievements. \n\nNote that there is a [i]Zup!3[/i] which has over 1000 achievements! [i]Zup!2[/i] is already taking it too far, so [i]Zup!3[/i] is nothing less than over the top. It's only for people who want to artificially increase their number of completed Steam Achievements, but not for anyone else. \n\nMy advice: get the first Zup!-game and give the others a miss.", "timestamp_created": 1484536102, "timestamp_updated": 1484572182, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564504742622375488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29282145": {"recommendationid": "29282145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206881763", "num_games_owned": 912, "num_reviews": 412, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1522498554}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like the first game in the Zup era but much better!", "timestamp_created": 1484510663, "timestamp_updated": 1484510663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29281155": {"recommendationid": "29281155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034731240", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1527464222}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendado, es muy cortito pero pasaras un buen rato y si quieres logros rapidos aqui los tienes :)", "timestamp_created": 1484507724, "timestamp_updated": 1484507724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29276033": {"recommendationid": "29276033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101490302", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1641143580}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good Game!

What little there is in terms of graphics and physics is very well done. There are many things, however, that prevent me from recommending them:\n\n- Length and Lack of Content: 20 minutes each, if you work quickly, like I did. My time played on the second one is higher because I left the game on while I went out to do an errand. The music is just a few bars that loop over and over again. Perhaps there's something in the background that I'm not hearing, but it's so quiet that it doesn't make much difference. The music doesn't go anywhere.\n\n- Ease: There is in theory some strategy involved, but you can win most levels in a few tries by just randomly clicking. I managed to beat the final level of Zup! 2 on my first try, with only one mouse click. Perhaps this was intended as a grand explosion finale, but most other levels were like this, too.\n\n- Broken Puzzles: On many levels, you can win by skipping large portions of the level. In many cases, there are many ways to solve each level. I don't mean that in a fun \"alternate solutions\" kind of way. I mean that randomly clicking will often beat the puzzle on the first try.\n\n- No Replayability: Some games offer much less than this in terms of content, but are fun games that I would highly recommend. Tetris, for example, has much less content than this game, but is highly replayable. After you've beaten this game once, there's no point playing it again until enough time has passed that you've forgotten all the solutions (not that it would be that hard to figure them out again, anyway).\n\n- Achievement Spam: If you're looking for achievements, this game has them. Many of the positive reviews for this game cite achievements as a key feature. I earned six within my first sixty seconds. That's one every ten seconds. I got both games to 100% completion in the short time that I spend playing them. To be clear, I earned over 200 achievements in about 40 minutes. I had to replay one of the levels, since it didn't register the achievement for that level the first time. It only took me about ten seconds to replay it, though.\n\n- Better Options for the Money: For the same price, you can get a full-length pixel art RPG by some random indie developer. Generic? Sure. But you could actually have fun playing a game for hours on end. There are so many really good games out there for the same price, or even less. For such a low price, I don't feel ripped off by the developer, and I wouldn't really mind if I couldn't get a refund. Seeing as I can, however, I think I'm going to get something else.\n\nOverall, I think the concept shows enormous potential, but you won't find any of it in these actually existing games. I hope the developer refines the concept in the future, and makes a more challenging and engaging game.", "timestamp_created": 1484058460, "timestamp_updated": 1484058460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493307650089263916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29160433": {"recommendationid": "29160433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141042324", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1681416329}, "language": "english", "review": "-Crafted a badge for some game, then got a 50% discount for this one, so I said why the hell not.\n-Fired it up, got about 5 achievements just as a welcome.\n-Spent 30 mins passing levels and getting achievements without even knowing what the hell is happening.\n-Finished the game but didn't get all the achievements, so I opened a guide and found out where the secret achievements are located, it took me like 5 mouse clicks to get all of them.\n-Closed the game happily and found all the 229 achievements completed, so it drew a big smile on my face!\n-Was searching around and actually found a FREE DLC for this game, so I downloaded it and got 5 extra more minutes of gameplay, which drew an even bigger smile on my face!!\n-Everything was done and all the levels were completed, so I closed the game and checked my trading cards to find 4 cards were dropped, this time it drew a huge smile on my face that it even covered my eyes and I couldn't see!!!\n\n[h1]My feeling now:[/h1]\n-Feeling successful for making the best bargain in my life.\n-My life became much better and all my problems are solved now, all because of this game!", "timestamp_created": 1484049308, "timestamp_updated": 1484049308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29152342": {"recommendationid": "29152342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352361886", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492258663}, "language": "english", "review": "Yup! 2", "timestamp_created": 1484007278, "timestamp_updated": 1484007278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29151232": {"recommendationid": "29151232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100144730", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1482772502}, "language": "english", "review": "Well.. passed the game in 34 minutes... don't know if i would reccomend it.. it's to easy.. but still, if you want a bunch of achievements and easy ones.. well yeah, its \"great\" i guess.", "timestamp_created": 1484002675, "timestamp_updated": 1484002675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29148834": {"recommendationid": "29148834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058717943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1484006508}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El doble de logros, el doble de niveles.

It provides massive freedom rights to the player by letting him actually choose what to do in a way that no game has ever done it before.\nThink about how dictators and globalists try to take away your freedom by applying censorship, terrible AAA-graphics, massive marketing on every social media and similar diabolic devices like video games and you have an actual right to feel bad and enslaved. Then one brave developer comes along, drops this gem of a puzzle-based action-adventure-platform-shooter onto you and you feel the power of the people in your back.\n\nThe goal is easy: The ball has to land on the designated ground. Only when that happens and only when you - the funny and smart player that enjoys the freedom of the constitution - make use of your massive powers to accomplish it, then you are able to win.\nThe symbolism is clear: The ball is your freedom, your power to vote, your right to speak the truth and make your opinion heard, the explosions you cause by clicking on the globalistic, satanic red boxes is the power of the dictators crumbling under the power of your mouse cursor, that is obviously the power of the people, the pure essence of freedom and liberty that causes the cascade of events leading to your freedom being able to land on safe ground. Once you manage to liberate one level, the gate opens to the next big project, the next mission, the next dictator that needs to be crushed under your might.\n\nYou can believe me, I studied this game. Hundreds of hours of game time, dozens of essays, two books and a radio show that I developed solely to make the spirit of this game, the essence of freedom that this game represents and the shining sanctity that is the developer needs to be witnessed by more people.\n\nJoin the resistance, join the force of freedom and show your love of liberty and play this game.\n\nGod bless America.",

The objective is the same as before: get the blue block to the green zone, except now the blue block is round, which opens up more level designs thanks to the extra movement made possible by the new shape.\n\nThe amount of achievements (229) is even more absurd, nearly doubling the number in Zup!. As before, this is geared towards achievement hunters and profile decorators as there is a wider variety of symbols, with some Mandarin possible as well if so inclined.\n\nBesides the fundamental change in the shape of the blue block, gameplay is essentially unchanged. Some levels are slightly more challenging, but the game is on par with its predecessor in terms of difficulty, and should take the same amount of time to complete. There is also no replayability as there is little reason to revisit a level after clearing it.\n\nOverall Zup! 2 feels like an extension (or DLC) of Zup!, and like before, a big part of the game is getting the achievements to decorate profiles with. If that is worth something to you, then this game is worth considering.

ZUP! 2 adds a few new mechanics and some slightly more difficult levels this time around, all while flooding your overlay with achievement after achievement for every action you take.\n\nWith all the acclaim Steam users gave the previous installment, I wasn\u2019t surprised to see a sequel to Zup!, but I was looking forward to some hopeful improvements to the game and some added longevity since, as anyone who has played the first game, knows it can be completed in well under an hour. While Zup! 2 adds a few additions to the level design and some time-based puzzles into the mix, the game itself can still be completed in under an hour.\n\nThere\u2019s not much new to Zup! 2 that seemed to change, which can be construed as a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand, it is still an amusing game with modest puzzle designs and an entertaining concept, but on the other hand this would have been a great opportunity to really excel the brand forward into a provoking puzzler that captured a lot of what the previous title left out; in that regard, Zup! 2 fell short. \n\nHowever, the developers have certainly paid attention to the marketplace and know Steam\u2019s audience, as the achievements you earn are completely geared towards profile design and showcase artwork, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone who played the previous title. I even found myself conflicted on why I bought the game, undecidedly choosing and intermingling between fun and the desire for more options in my achievement showcase. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say anything else about Zup! 2 without putting in superfluous information. If you liked the first title, you\u2019ll enjoy this one, if you didn\u2019t like it then you will likely be unimpressed by its successor. We\u2019ll more than likely be graced with a third installment in the near future and I hope the developers take some time and really put some conscious effort into it; you can only ride the coattails of success for so long. \n\n \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\n[list]\n[*] Casual, stress free fun. \n[*] Great achievements for profile showcases.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\n[list] \n[*] Incredibly short.\n[*] Little to no replayability.\n[*] Only a handful of actually challenging levels\n[/list]\n\nOverall, ZUP! 2 is more of the same; a basic, physics-based puzzle game that is fun, albeit short and unembellished with overly complex level design. Play if for the fun or the achievements, but for those looking for a real puzzling experience, you\u2019ll find Zup! 2 doesn\u2019t fit the mold. \n", "timestamp_created": 1481576288, "timestamp_updated": 1481576288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602729439735412598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28331526": {"recommendationid": "28331526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035511315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 731, "last_played": 1559002081}, "language": "english", "review": "I paid $0.99 and got 229 achievements (100%) within 34 minutes.

I was like WTF there\u2019s a second one??? They are gonna keep churning these games out, really?\n\nI will say, some of the levels seemed like more of a challenge than most of the first game, there is a lot more timing involved in the puzzles in this one. The first one had free DLC that I didn\u2019t play cos I\u2019d already uninstalled it, so maybe that was harder.\n\nThere was one level that I actually cheated on on this. I still haven\u2019t figured out how to do that level. The ball kept rolling off the edge of the platform  (it has to come to a complete stop on the green platform to finish the stage) but there\u2019s a door that opens up that you click on to take you to the next stage, and it opened while the ball was still rolling, so without that oversight it woulda taken me a while longer.\n\nI\u2019m curious, is there not a limit to the amount of achievements a game can have, the first Zup had 118 and this one has 229, is Zup 3 gonna have 449?. Can a game just give you say 10,000 achievements, doesn\u2019t it defeat the purpose if you are handed them all on a plate just for clicking start or going into the menus lol. I don\u2019t care really, but I thought there would be a limit that devs could put on their games.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, these Zup devs have found an exploit in steam. I do like the achievements tho, it\u2019s Christmas colour themed, gives you some nice new customization options for your achievement showcase. They even give you these Chinese? characters to use for some reason, these characters could be telling me to go f*ck my mother for all I know lol, but they are there if you want them.", "timestamp_created": 1481053223, "timestamp_updated": 1481053667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574287772178649902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28224611": {"recommendationid": "28224611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967087500", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1482477421}, "language": "english", "review": "First game was excellent, and a great price.

This is like releasing Half-Life 3 at this point - the shoes are so big to fill, that \"Zup!\" might as well have been a pair of clown shoes belonging to Andre the Giant.\n\nBut here we are - \"Zup! 2\" is without a doubt the greatest game I've played all year, and very possibly the greatest of all time.\n\nWhere \"Zup!\" recounted the tale of the unnamed blue square, using revolutionary physics engineering to maneuver through life while finding himself surrounded by the vast legions of red, yellow, and green squares, \"Zup! 2\" continues on the nailbiting cliffhanger at the end of the first game. Blue square is dies, but not before leaving his physics-based heritage to his son, blue circle. Blue circle goes through the same adversity as his father before him, and without wishing to spoil any of the numerous twists and revelations revealed throughout the incredibly well-paced narrative, finds that not all is as it seems in this world of moral blacks and whites and greens and yellows and reds and purples.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the first, but this time, you control a circle instead of a square, which is absolutely revolutionary in its own right, and simply must be experienced for one's self. I dare you not to fall in love with the gameplay, along with the many laughs, tears, and fears you'll encounter along the way.\n\n\"Zup!\" is a masterpiece in its own right, but somehow \"Zup! 2\" manages to overcome that by being truly perfect in every single way.\n\nMove aside, No Man's Sky; there's a new GOTY in town.", "timestamp_created": 1480996070, "timestamp_updated": 1480996070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28213790": {"recommendationid": "28213790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078295360", "num_games_owned": 1583, "num_reviews": 183, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1664604073}, "language": "english", "review": "EZ Achievements 0.4 hr 100%", "timestamp_created": 1480995770, "timestamp_updated": 1480995770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554994404315948486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28213275": {"recommendationid": "28213275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970530938", "num_games_owned": 2700, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1480998014}, "language": "english", "review": "Comical number of achievements aside, the Zup games are immensely satisfying physics puzzle games, even if they're only 30 minutes long.
