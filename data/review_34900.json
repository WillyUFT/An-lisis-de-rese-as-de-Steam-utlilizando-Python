While it is heavily criticized by some for its numerous 'flaws', players find unique charm and amusement in its quirks and unconventional design.\n\n\"Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is a game that defies convention and embraces its eccentricity in a way that few other titles can match. While it's often cited as one of the worst games ever made, it's important to recognize the sheer audacity of its approach. This game is a masterclass in anti-design, turning traditional gaming norms on their heads.\n\nThe graphics in \"Bad Rats\" are reminiscent of a bygone era, evoking a sense of nostalgia for those who grew up in the early days of gaming. The simplicity of the art and animation harkens back to a time when games were created with limited resources, giving it a charming retro feel.\n\nGameplay in \"Bad Rats\" is anything but conventional. The puzzles are delightfully frustrating, with solutions that often seem counterintuitive. It's a testament to the game's unpredictability and refusal to conform to industry standards. It forces players to think outside the box and approach problems in unconventional ways.\n\nThe level design in \"Bad Rats\" is nothing short of chaotic, but that's part of its appeal. Each level is a rollercoaster of absurdity, where even the most carefully thought-out plans can go hilariously wrong. The game revels in its own absurdity and provides players with a unique challenge.\n\nSound and music in \"Bad Rats\" may not be top-tier, but they add to the game's overall charm. The repetitive soundtrack and quirky sound effects contribute to the game's offbeat atmosphere.\n\nThe user interface is a perfect reflection of the game's unconventional nature. It's clunky and confusing, but that's all part of the fun. The game's idiosyncratic approach to UI design is a breath of fresh air in a world of polished, cookie-cutter interfaces.\n\nReplay value in \"Bad Rats\" comes from the sheer determination to conquer its enigmatic puzzles and unravel its peculiar logic. Each level provides a new opportunity for players to test the limits of their creativity and patience.\n\nIn summary, \"Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge\" is a game that marches to the beat of its own drum. It may not conform to traditional gaming standards, but for those who appreciate its eccentricity and embrace its flaws, it can be an extremely entertaining and memorable experience. If you're looking for a game that defies expectations and challenges your problem-solving skills in the most unconventional way, give \"Bad Rats\" a try. It's a testament to the diversity and creativity of the gaming world and an underappreciated masterpiece that deserve more credit for the impact on the gaming landscape it tries to make.\n\n10/10",

Unfortunately, this bizarre concept is not enough to rescue the game from the depths of its own flaws.\n\n[h2]Gameplay (2/10):[/h2]\n\nThe central premise of Bad Rats revolves around solving puzzles by deploying rats and their special abilities to eliminate a cat. In theory, this could be an amusing and quirky puzzle-solving experience. However, in practice, the execution is so flawed that it becomes infuriating. The physics engine often misfires, leading to outcomes that defy logic. A solution that should work may fail inexplicably, leaving players scratching their heads and cursing the game's inconsistencies.\n\n[h2]Graphics and Sound (3/10):[/h2]\n\nVisually, Bad Rats is nothing to write home about. The graphics are dated, with uninspired character designs and bland environments. The soundtrack is equally forgettable, providing little to no immersion or atmosphere. While graphics and sound are not the primary focus of puzzle games, their mediocrity adds to the overall disappointment of the experience.\n\n[h2]Puzzles and Difficulty (2/10):[/h2]\n\nThe puzzles themselves vary in complexity, but their solutions are often far from intuitive. Players may find themselves resorting to trial and error due to the erratic physics engine. What should be a challenging yet rewarding puzzle-solving experience becomes an exercise in frustration, as progress feels more like luck than skill.\n\n[h2]Replayability (1/10):[/h2]\n\nBad Rats offers little incentive for replayability. Once you've struggled through a level and witnessed its quirks and flaws, there's little motivation to revisit it. The lack of meaningful progression or engaging story also contributes to the game's overall lack of replay value.\n\n[h2]Technical Issues (2/10):[/h2]\n\nBeyond the physics-related problems, Bad Rats is plagued by technical issues. Bugs and glitches are not uncommon, further eroding any semblance of enjoyment that players might hope to find in this title.\n\n[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]\n\nBad Rats, with its peculiar premise and frustrating execution, is a prime example of a game that fails to deliver on its potential. While it may appeal to those who enjoy bizarre and challenging puzzle games, its countless issues, ranging from problematic physics to a lack of polish, make it a hard sell for most gamers. Ultimately, it's a game that leaves players more irritated than entertained, making it difficult to recommend as a worthwhile addition to anyone's gaming library.\n\nEven if the game was kind of frustrating it was still fun with couple of friends and after a few drinks and on top of that I got the game on heavy discount, so no hard feelings.\n", "timestamp_created": 1695408265,

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The game is a physics-based puzzle game where players have to kill cats using a variety of objects like balls, explosives, and planks. Despite its seemingly macabre premise, the game's creativity and humor make it an enjoyable experience for players of all ages.\n\nThe game has a wide range of characters to choose from, each with its own unique abilities and specialties. These characters range from a suicidal rat who can detonate bombs to a mad scientist rat who can build complex machines to solve puzzles. The variety of characters encourages players to experiment with different strategies, adding to the replayability of the game.\n\nBad Rats' gameplay mechanics are simple yet challenging. The objective of the game is to kill the cats using the available objects in the environment. However, the game does not make it easy for players. The puzzles require careful planning, experimentation, and creativity to solve. This level of challenge makes the game incredibly rewarding when you finally succeed.\n\nThe game's graphics are simple yet charming. The cartoonish design of the characters and environments adds to the game's humorous tone. The sound design of the game is also excellent. The music is catchy and upbeat, and the sound effects complement the gameplay perfectly.\n\nOne of the standout features of Bad Rats is the user-generated content system. Players can create and share their own levels, adding to the game's replayability. This feature allows players to showcase their creativity and imagination and adds a level of community involvement to the game.\n\nPlaying Bad Rats has changed my life in many ways. It has helped me develop a sense of creativity and problem-solving skills that I have been able to apply to my personal and professional life. The game has taught me to approach problems from different angles, think creatively, and never give up on finding a solution.\n\nMoreover, the game has helped me become more patient and persistent in my endeavors. The puzzles in Bad Rats can be frustrating, but the game rewards players who keep trying and don't give up easily. This lesson has carried over into other areas of my life, reminding me to stay committed and focused on my goals, even when facing setbacks or obstacles.\n\nOverall, Bad Rats is an excellent game that provides an enjoyable, innovative, and challenging gameplay experience. The game's creative puzzles, unique mechanics, and humorous tone make it stand out from other puzzle games.

Remember the look on your face? Well that look, is the LOOK I had on my face while playing Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge. This game is an absolute masterpiece. If I could pick any one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be Runescape, but Bad Rats' the Rats' Revenge comes a close 45th in line for games I'd play for the rest of my life. I received this game from my good pal, Jason Delacruz, he told me this game would change my life. Indeed it did, and for the better, my wife finally came back and she brought the kids. My business went from the verge of bankruptcy to now having $4,500,000 in sales every month. I couldn't have imagined this game having such a huge impact on my life, but it did, and to Jason Delacruz, I owe my life. Without him, I would be alone, afraid, tired, weak, hungry, desperate, alone again, still hungry, scared, terrified, horrified, shocked, bamboozled, stunned, disoriented, discombobulated, out of my mind, losing control, and last but not least alone again. Did i mention, I'd be alone? I have since gotten my masters degree in thermonuclear astrophysics and currently have a internship at NASA starting March 28 2075, all because Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge. If you wonder if I'd recommend this game to anyone, the answer is YES, not only due to the FUN nature of this game, but for the sheer fact that I know, first hand, what this game can do for people. How it can turn someones life around in a matter of 10 seconds of playing. The developers of this game must be heaven sent, because they brought a miracle to me.

Might not suit the 'kids' audiences, though, since the levels can get complex and would probably be boring for younger kids, since it's not that fun to complete all of the levels with tutorials on how to handed to you by the game, since, as we presume, the audience doesn't understand the way to complete the level.\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2611 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nI'd say that it's somewhere in between the 'Easy to learn / Hard to master' and 'Significant brain usage' categories, but since it has a leaderboard of the fastest players for each player and a community of great and smart puzzlers, it can get a little more serious.\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2611 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\nAs I've mentioned before, you play just for your own fun, but if you get very good at the puzzles and the game, it has a big 'leaderboard' icon which shows the fastest people to complete each level!\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2611 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\nNo story whatsoever.\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\nIt's a lot of time for the price of the game, another reason to consider buying.\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\nThe price is alright, considering it goes on sale sometimes and/or you can use steam coupons and etc.\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\nEverything went smoothly as I remember.\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10\n\nJust because of the lack of resolution and full screen options it gets a huge negative point from me, but it seems that the developers listen to the communities petitions, for example the decision to add the games trading cards was taken from a community members petition, and take it with a grain of salt whilst having a good sense of humor with the actual game, it's a very unique one for the price I would say.\n\nGenerally, I'd say that this game was and is quite fun for me. I don't remember now whether I bought it during a sale or not, but it is worth the price anyway. If you like sandbox, interesting and funny puzzle games, then this is clearly for you.

The premise of the game is simple, you control a group of rats who are out for revenge against their feline enemies. The puzzle aspect of the game comes in as you try to come up with creative and effective ways to eliminate the cats using physics and functional objects.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is its humor. The game is filled with comedic moments and cartoonish violence, making it lighthearted and enjoyable to play. The game also has a good level of challenge, with 44 maps that range from easy to very hard. This gives players of all skill levels a chance to enjoy the game and make progress.\n\nAnother great feature of the game is its realistic physics simulation. The game offers a unique experience, where players can experiment with different solutions to each puzzle to find the quickest or most effective way to eliminate the cats. The 10 different specialist rats and 11 different deaths for the cats add to the game's replay value and overall enjoyment.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining puzzle game. The game offers a unique and humorous experience, challenging puzzles, and great replay value. If you're looking for a game that is easy to pick up and play, but difficult to put down, this is definitely one to consider.", "timestamp_created": 1676209802, "timestamp_updated": 1676209802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132498104": {"recommendationid": "132498104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308817394", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1674267934}, "language": "english", "review": "greatest game ever made", "timestamp_created": 1675993373, "timestamp_updated": 1675993373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132488132": {"recommendationid": "132488132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404402694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1675975647}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like sex but without the w*men", "timestamp_created": 1675975400, "timestamp_updated": 1675975400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132455207": {"recommendationid": "132455207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422950158", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1683917343}, "language": "english", "review": "i absolutely LOVED when the bad rats finally got their revenge on the cat by sending bumbabilan", "timestamp_created": 1675918826, "timestamp_updated": 1675918826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132297629": {"recommendationid": "132297629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002637002", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 331, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1675648484}, "language": "english", "review": "Physics based puzzle game wrapped in a visual coat of cartoony violence and gore.

This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube on his i Pad.

I actively hunt down to play some of the worst games out there and I was told this was \"Without a doubt... he Worst game of all time\". I find myself quite disappointed because not only is this not the worst game, it's full-on decent. Entirely forgettable and not must-play, but fully worth a 99 cent asking price.\n\nThis is basically a twist on the old series \"The Incredible Machine\" with a \"Mouse Hunt\" board game flavoring.  A cat has been trapped in a death machine and you need to build a rube goldberg contraption to trigger it. You'll be pushing the ball with the bulldozer rat, sending it flying with the baseball rat, or building makeshift catapults with the fat rat as a counterbalance. \n\nYou have access to several types with rats each with fairly unique behaviors as well as a number of boxes, barrels, boards or other tools that can help you build you machine. Easier difficulties give you fewer tools to play with and a more details plan that will help you solve the level. Top difficulty and you're free to create the craziest murder machine you can think of. \n\nThis is a relatively run of the mill puzzle game, except given an edgier concept. It's simplistic enough that it stays pretty lighthearted and the puzzles can be engaging enough... if a tad clunky on the execution. If you're in the mood for a machine building puzzle game or you have an irrational hatred for cats... this is a perfectly okay game.", "timestamp_created": 1669960703, "timestamp_updated": 1669960703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465882331132888794", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127737531": {"recommendationid": "127737531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027286516", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 31609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26668, "last_played": 1670254944}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler] (\u0d30\u2e0f\u0941\u0d30) [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1669958440, "timestamp_updated": 1669958440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551510214805603027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127723015": {"recommendationid": "127723015", "author": {"steamid": "76561199205013543", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1696377033}, "language": "english", "review": "add sex", "timestamp_created": 1669936665, "timestamp_updated": 1669936665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755850315093994141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127445473": {"recommendationid": "127445473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081051468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1679914726}, "language": "english", "review": "This game saved my marriage.", "timestamp_created": 1669664278, "timestamp_updated": 1669664278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516322433948516846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127212296": {"recommendationid": "127212296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963046802", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1670082168}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients:\n1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2. 1/2 cup white sugar\n3. 1/2 cup brown sugar\n4. 1/4 cup water\n5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n6. 1 pinch salt\n7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced\n8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie\n\nDirections:\n1.

my life.\n\nI am 27.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1663926998, "timestamp_updated": 1663926998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569082856178283691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122655410": {"recommendationid": "122655410", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026766144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1644467402}, "language": "english", "review": "rat   :)", "timestamp_created": 1663888163, "timestamp_updated": 1663888163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122622144": {"recommendationid": "122622144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047780681", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1668368508}, "language": "english", "review": "Best soundtrack ever !", "timestamp_created": 1663840444, "timestamp_updated": 1663840444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122503188": {"recommendationid": "122503188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115487063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1663384641}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece of gaming achievement, sure to go down in the annals of history as one of the most revolutionary pieces of our time.

Would you rather die to rats, or would you rather have cats take over the world? It's clearly obvious what the answer is. To further strengthen my point, check out this man right here. This man is clearly dedicated to Bad Rats, considering he has over 12,500 hours on it. People claim he is just idling, but why do that on such a great game when he could spend his time playing those lowly games that the foul scum of the elitists play like Counter Strike: Global Offensive and The Walking Dead. This is true dedication among all men, and we need to take the time to appreciate his courage and heroics. This is the solution to solving all the stupid problems in the world and ending all wars. We need to dedicate ourselves to playing Bad Rats for the rest of our damn lives.\ufeff Proof of hours: http://prntscr.com/7jnh5l", "timestamp_created": 1658303205, "timestamp_updated": 1658303205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119046427": {"recommendationid": "119046427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053282055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1658186088}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad rats", "timestamp_created": 1658188752, "timestamp_updated": 1658188752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119003674": {"recommendationid": "119003674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132751708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15922, "last_played": 1533460435}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty decent", "timestamp_created": 1658137778, "timestamp_updated": 1658137778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118935702": {"recommendationid": "118935702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198922768725", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1658018657}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is not fun\nhowever\nbad rats", "timestamp_created": 1658026183, "timestamp_updated": 1658026183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576995372772216797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118915211": {"recommendationid": "118915211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087795777", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1479, "last_played": 1657993604}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I like cats", "timestamp_created": 1657993349, "timestamp_updated": 1657993349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118890338": {"recommendationid": "118890338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136756091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1654384993}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actually very deep and intricate, osama rat is GOATed.", "timestamp_created": 1657954142, "timestamp_updated": 1657954142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506578981876373291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118889468": {"recommendationid": "118889468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085523852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1657952280}, "language": "english", "review": "is this even a game?? \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21", "timestamp_created": 1657952317, "timestamp_updated": 1657952317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490726560354232788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118847680": {"recommendationid": "118847680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014254879", "num_games_owned": 1219, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1457116550}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an absolute abomination that people review positively as a joke and give as a gift to people they secretely hate.

Well, it's kind of a long story. It was a dark and stormy night. My mother and father were walking down the sidewalk with me. Our house was across the street. We started to cross together and made it halfway through, when suddenly we saw two bright white lights coming at us so fast that my father barely had enough time to push me across the street. All I heard was a loud *klunk*, then it all went black. I awoke and saw my mother and father soaked with blood in the middle of the street, while a big yellow cat with a scar over his left eye sped away faster than the speed of sound. After that night, I had devoted my life to get revenge by cleaning up all of the filth that was on the streets once and for all. I trained hard and recruited many fellow rats to fight for my cause.\n\nWe all had one enemy, the cats. We had all been dealing with them for way too long. They would threaten us, beat us, kill us, and they even took away the ones we loved. It was our time to shine. We loaded up with cannons, bows and arrows, baseball bats, and even vacuums. We were ready to clean up all of the trash on our streets once and for all. The first cat was tough to kill, since we had no idea what we would be up against. We lost Jerry and Milton in the process, but we all knew what was on the line in order to exterminate all of the cats. After the 10th cat, we didn't even pay attention to the ones that had died because we had become used to it. After 20, it seemed that some were just killing the cats for sport. The 30th cat was a bit stronger. It had wiped out over half of our entire army, but Crazy Steve strapped on his vest and let himself get swallowed, where he detonated the cat and saved many of our lives that day.\n\nI will never forget the sacrifice he made. It was a rough day. Cat 39 had killed all but 8 of us. There was only one left. The next day, I saw him. He had a scar. It was him. It was the one who had killed my parents. I had trained my whole life for this moment. I had done everything I could to get the revenge I wanted. It was my moment. The first rat had blown himself up, along with the second rat. The third rat ran right into the cat and was devoured almost instantly. The fourth rat shot his bow and arrow straight up into the air and it went straight through his skull. The fifth rat had fallen on the sixth rat and crushed him, then was ran over by the seventh rat's bulldozer, who then was blown up by the sixth rat's bomb vest. It was just me. Me against the one who had killed my family. The one who had taken everything away from me when I was a child. The one who ruined my life and the sole reason of my hatred for cats. That didn't matter anymore. All I wanted was my revenge. I took the seventh rat's bulldozer, and I went full speed right up the cat's pooper. With my bomb vest on, I drove up as far as I could. I drove through his intestines and all around. I did all I could do in order to win. I didn't care anymore. I was almost there. I could almost taste the sweet revenge. I strapped the vest to the cat's heart, drove as fast as I could out of the cat's mouth. I was on his tongue when the blast went off. I was launched out of his mouth, and I watched as his eyes popped out of his skull and his head exploded and his guts went everywhere. I was soaked in blood and with a smile on my face, I said, \"Many before me have tried, but only the baddest will succeed.\"\n\nTL;DR\nOnly in your darkest hours, can you finally become a Bad Rat.", "timestamp_created": 1657842496, "timestamp_updated": 1661961975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118734590": {"recommendationid": "118734590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096210461", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1657696110}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad rats without a reasonable doubt is the greatest game to have ever graced the landscape of windows XP and vista.

Not only has \u201cBad Rats\u201d provided me with the best hours of my life, but it has also advanced my philosophical thinking. This game has given me a new outlook on the intricacy and cunning of rodents, how they can also have aspirations, professions, and a greater sense of meaning. Character design is flawless, with household favourites such as: bomber rat, lung rat and fat rat. Each character adds a new \"dimension\" to the level layouts, making every puzzle contain a seemingly endless number of solutions. What is there not to love about this game?!

You then spend 30 minutes opening and then closing various games, maybe open Youtube, expecting your reccomended to be any different than it was 10 minutes ago. This is a situation many of us get trapped into, and a game would fix that.  More specifically; Bad Rats: The Rat's Revenge. Bad Rats: The Rat's Revenge is a game of all time. It has graphics, puzzles, and sound design. In this essay I will be examining what makes this game notable.\n\nThis game really has gameplay. In BRTRR, you play as a group of rats plotting ways to murder, or 'Troll', a helpless cat. You do this by arranging various building blocks and mice in a way to press a certain object, killing the cat. The rats each have different abilites and ways of pushing the building blocks and the 'ball', which is the only object that can press the aforementioned object. You will be arranging the objects and rats in a way to push the 'ball' to it's desired location. It also has the only physics engine in gaming where doing the same thing twice yields different results, creating emmergent and diverse gameplay. This makes the puzzles. There are 30+ levels to complete with additional modes. Complete each level to achieve a 'Victory Royale'. Each puzzle also has more than one solution, creating replay value. There are also steam achievements. To quickly sum up what each rat and object does, the:\n\n- Baseball rat. This is the first rat you'll use. He uses his baseball bat to hit any and every object/rat in front of him. This can knock it far away or kill it if it's a rat. His famous catchphrase is \"Its rattin time\".\n\n-Archer rat. He shoots an arrow, hitting objects or rats from a distance. The effect is the same as the Baseball rat's bat.\n\n-Fat rat. By far my favorite, this rat is really fat. This is a reference to your mom. This rat does nothing and is only used for weighing things down, also like your mom.\n\n-Bomber rat. This rat is a muslim suicide bomber (not joking). He will blow himself up once something gets close to him, having a similar effect to the baseball rats bat, but it affects everything in radius.\n\n-Tractor rat. This rat operate the slowest fucking vehicle ever, and moves 0.0000001 feet a second in order to push objects. I rarely use him.\n\n-Canon rat. This rat shoots himself out of a canon.\n\n-Firework rat. This rat is tied to a firework and has does the same exact thing as the canon rat.\n\n-Suck rat. He sucks things with his sucker, can create a stream of air in order to propel objects upward.\n\n-Hamster wheel rat. he sits in a hamster wheel and will run, speeding up objects going on him. He also appears in one level.\n\n-Lung rat. This rat is a heavy smoker (reference to your dad), and uses his smoking power to blow objects away. Literally just the archer rat but with an anoying wheezing sound. His famous catchphrase is \"its blowin time\"\n\nGetting into the objects:\n\n-Plank. Can act as a bridge.\n\n-Balloon.

Do you know what that thing can do to you?\n\nVillager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.\n\nShrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob.\n\nSHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.\n\nThe mob gasp.\n\nSHREK: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...\n\nShrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear.\n\nVillagers: No!\n\nSHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.\n\nVillager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (Waves the torch at Shrek.)\n\nShrek licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The men shrink back away from him. Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches.\n\nSHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.\n\nThe men drop their torches and pitchforks and flee as fast they can.\n\nSHREK: And stay out! (looks down and picks up a wanted poster. Reads.) \"Wanted. Fairytale creatures.\" (He sighs and drops the paper on the ground.)\n\nTHE NEXT DAY - FOREST\n\nLines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying people for tuning in the fairytale creatures in. Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.\n\nGUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Next!\n\nGUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!\n\nGUARD: Get up! Come on!\n\nMama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.\n\nLITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.\n\nDONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!\n\nOLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (Smacks Donkey)\n\nDONKEY: Oh!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?\n\nGEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.\n\nPINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.\n\nPINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!\n\nGeppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?\n\nOLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.\n\nOLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Well?..\n\nOLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey again) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!\n\nOLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talking-est damn thing you ever saw.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.\n\nOLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!\n\nThe guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.\n\nDONKEY: Hey! I can fly!\n\nPETER PAN: He can fly!\n\nTHREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!\n\nDONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: Seize him!\n\nDonkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.\n\nGUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!\n\nDonkey escapes deeper into the forest and runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides behind him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!\n\nSHREK: Aye?\n\nTHE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?\n\nSHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)\n\nThe Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.\n\nDONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!\n\nSHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!\n\nDONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.\n\nSHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.\n\nDONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.\n\nSHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?\n\nDONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.\n\nShrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.\n\nDONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks!\n\nShrek walks off. Donkey reappears ahead of him, dangling from a felled log.\n\nDONKEY: Man, you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.\n\nSHREK: Why are you following me?\n\nDONKEY: I'll tell you why. (Drops from the log. Singing) \"'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have friends...\"\n\nSHREK: Stop singing! (Picks up Donkey by his ears and tail) It's no wonder you don't have any friends (drops him).\n\nDONKEY: Wow. Only a true friend would be that truly honest.\n\nSHREK: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?\n\nDONKEY: (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh...really tall?\n\nSHREK: No! I'm an ogre! You know, \"Grab your torch and pitchforks.\" Doesn't that bother you?\n\nDONKEY: Nope.\n\nSHREK: Really?\n\nDONKEY: Really, really.\n\nSHREK: Oh.\n\nDONKEY: Man, I like you. What's you name?\n\nSHREK: Uh, Shrek.\n\nDONKEY: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of \"I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me\" thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill overlooking Shrek's home.) Woo, look at that! Who'd want to live in place like that?\n\nSHREK: (Annoyed) That would be my home.\n\nDONKEY: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. (Looks at Shrek's \"keep out\" signs) I guess you don't entertain much, do you?\n\nSHREK: I like my privacy.\n\nDONKEY: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common.

oppressors, as well as the cascading influence for change that their actions often have on those involved. The game's story weaves a brilliant narrative tapestry following a fragmented population of rats using everything they have at their disposal to topple the figurative tower of systematic oppression leveraged upon them by the rule of the cat establishment. With each consecutive victory the rats grow in number and strength, as they are forced to devise increasingly complex tactics to maintain their onslaught of victories against the cat menace.\n\nA lesser game may stop here, but Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge however, takes a unflinching look at the deeper moral implications of such a conflict. The inspiration the game takes from the work of Nietzsche is quite apparent. To quote Nietzsche directly, \u201cHe who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.\u201d This theme of corruption of morality is clearly displayed through the sheer brutality of the Rats' actions. Thus where the moniker of \"Bad Rats\" finds it origin. A noble race of rats driven to horrendous acts in the name of the greater good, and at the cost of their own sacred purity.\n\nAny game capable of balancing such complex and emotionally poignant themes so eloquently is well deserving of praise and economic success, but a game that manages this in addition to providing such brilliant AAA quality gameplay deserves to be forever exalted is the halls of gaming history. This is not to mention to the incredibly reasonable price at which this game is offered.\n\nNeedless to say I rate this game as a perfect 10/10, and as an absolute MUST buy for any self respecting gamer!", "timestamp_created": 1652524474, "timestamp_updated": 1652929008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612253487110137939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115308789": {"recommendationid": "115308789", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960509452", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1661711489}, "language": "english", "review": "may allah bless the terrorist rat", "timestamp_created": 1652290481, "timestamp_updated": 1652290481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57825005054473877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115288521": {"recommendationid": "115288521", "author": {"steamid": "76561199136624826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1656988153}, "language": "english", "review": "bad rat\nfat rat\nhe is hot\nand you are not", "timestamp_created": 1652253825, "timestamp_updated": 1656283576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115274401": {"recommendationid": "115274401", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042753094", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1678753675}, "language": "english", "review": "MY FAVORATE GAME EVER", "timestamp_created": 1652222834, "timestamp_updated": 1652222834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538891494274139404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115211468": {"recommendationid": "115211468", "author": {"steamid": "76561199162638809", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1628302532}, "language": "english", "review": "I am but a slave to the bad rats", "timestamp_created": 1652111795, "timestamp_updated": 1652111795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115208919": {"recommendationid": "115208919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179563823", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 67278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67278, "last_played": 1602373155}, "language": "english", "review": "it's ok", "timestamp_created": 1652108212, "timestamp_updated": 1652108212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831338346004486084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115163457": {"recommendationid": "115163457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254007091", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1525340500}, "language": "english", "review": "rat", "timestamp_created": 1652028058, "timestamp_updated": 1652028058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114955715": {"recommendationid": "114955715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069422003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1651699400}, "language": "english", "review": "Racism and hard animal cruelty are far from the worst things that Bad Rats has to offer.

The physics are near perfect and the gameplay never gets repetitive. Every second I play this game I feel nothing but pure bliss.\n\nThe concept alone is enough for me to recommend this game. The pure earthshattering creativity that this game displays might be overwhelming to you at first, but trust me, once you get used to it you will never look at the world in the same way again. This game takes the classic duo of cat and rat, but instead of the cat hunting the rat... IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND! I cannot get over it! You play as RATS to kill CATS using BOMBS and MICROWAVES. Truely marvellous.\n\nThis game features multiple world famous gaming icons that rival the likes of Mario Mario, Master Chief, Cooking Mama and Pikachu. My favorites of these stunning characters have to be Bomb Rat, Fat Rat and Breath Rat. With household names like these being included, you expect a top quality game and I can confidently say that this masterpiece does not disappoint.\n\nOn top of that, this game's visuals are simply stunning. Rarely do I start up a game to simply gaze at its wonderful menu screen but Bad Rats has me doing this time and time again. This game doesn't just look good. No, it is a treat to the eyes, like a warm, soft rat is hugging your eyeballs. Often I just close my eyes to image what it would be like to live in the beautiful world of Bad Rats. I dream about it. I long for it. I cannot get enough of it.\n\nThis stunning game has one more trick up its sleeve. If you (rightfully) thought a game of this caliber would have a pricetag near the thousands of euros, you are gravely mistaken. This game costs no more than 99 cents. When I learned of this fact my mind was BLOWN. To this day I cannot believe it and it shocks me everytime I look at the pricetag. What a deal.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? How could I not. In my opinion there is not a single game on this planet that comes close to the grandness of Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge. I'd even go so far as to say that this is the PERFECT game.", "timestamp_created": 1649282351, "timestamp_updated": 1649282351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4,

Even solutions that work will fail 40 times before working because of luck and poor physics. It can be dumb fun for about 10 minutes though so thats something to consider. With that, here is a great Ratatouille recipe:\n\n1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n2 yellow bell peppers, diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups) \n\n1 large yellow onion, diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups) \n\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper \n\n1 large eggplant (1 1/2 pounds), diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 9 cups) \n\n1 large zucchini (1 pound), diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 1/2 cups) \n\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon) \n\n3 tablespoons tomato paste \n\n1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional \n\n1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 4 cups) \n\n1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped, plus more for serving \n\n6 large fresh basil leaves, torn, plus more for serving \n\n\"Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add the bell peppers, onion and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent and the bell peppers have softened slightly, about 10 minutes. Add the eggplant, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the eggplant is very soft, about 8 minutes. Add the zucchini and continue to cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, tomato paste and red pepper flakes, if using. Cook, stirring often, until the zucchini has softened, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the tomatoes, bring to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the ratatouille has reached a thick stew-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and basil with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon into a bowl and sprinkle with more fresh parsley and basil before serving.\"\n\nSource: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/ratatouille-5658876", "timestamp_created":

It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.\nIn the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.\nThe missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.", "timestamp_created": 1644203397, "timestamp_updated": 1644203397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109538630": {"recommendationid": "109538630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193866903", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 898, "last_played": 1653540087}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game of all time", "timestamp_created": 1644045788, "timestamp_updated": 1644045788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631732404232025146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109405087": {"recommendationid": "109405087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055463098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1643167637}, "language": "english", "review": "We are defined by our experiences and how they shape and mold us.

seirous crack\n\nand playing the game the interface is bad, mostly the object select because of the way 3d works you can easily select the wrong object, also placing the objects in the right place is hell because the game atuocorrects when it doesnt need to, and the positions reset when you can't place an object\n\ni didnt even mention the elephant in the room- the phisics. they are so inconsistant that the intended solutions might not even work half the time. plus for some reason the devs thought it was a good idea to use a 3d phisics engine in a 2.5d game, causing the ball and other ojects to sometimes go offscreen\n\nthe only saving grace for this game is that i can finally fufill my lifelong dream of violently slautering cats in the most overcomplicated ways

This could be seen as a critique because 7-12 million people were killed during the Russian Revolutionary War, only to prop up another totalitarian dictatorship that killed many more people and set up many other communist dictatorships that still exist today, such as China and North Korea.\n\n\nThe way that Bad Rats criticize capitalism is much more subtle, but the message is still there, in the act of buying weapons and vehicles from other rats, they are making those rats get rich off of the back of a terrible conflict.\n\n\nIf you look at the game in a different light when you could see the rats genociding the cats rather than fighting them or revolting against them.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1640463920, "timestamp_updated": 1640463920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465648829936981201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106515391": {"recommendationid": "106515391", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015234174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1641125118}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the reason i created a steam account.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that. I love killing cats.

HERE ARE 10 RAT FACTS SO YOU CAN EZ BEAT THIS GAME\n\n1.  Rats Can Swim\nBelieve it or not, rats could give Michael Phelps a run for his money. Certain types of rats can tread water for up to three days and hold their breath for three minutes. Additionally, some species can swim over a mile. And the stories about rats popping up in toilets is no urban legend. They can easily make their way up your pipes.\n\n2. Rats Are Revered in Some Cultures\nA temple dedicated to Hindu goddess Karni Mata in northwest India is home to more than 15,000 rats. These rodents are worshipped and protected, and human devotees of the temple believe that when they die, they will be reincarnated as rats.\n\n3. Their Tails Keep Them Cool\nRats don\u2019t sweat like humans, nor do they pant to relieve the heat like a dog. Rather, rats control their body temperature by expanding and contracting the blood vessels in their tails.\n\n4. A Rat\u2019s Teeth Never Stop Growing\nRats are known for gnawing on things, and with good reason. Their teeth can grow up to 5 inches per year. They have to chew on things to wear them down. In addition to wood, rats can also gnaw through lead, cinder blocks and aluminum sheeting.\n\n5. There Are Many Different Types of Rats\nMost people have heard of Norway rats (brown rats), pack rats and roof rats (black rats). However, what many people don\u2019t know is that there are 56 known species of rats in the world.\n\n6. Some Rats Get Pretty Big\nTrue there are some big rats out there rummaging through garbage cans, but the types of rats most people are used to seeing are small compared to some of their more massive rodent relatives. The Sumatran bamboo rat, for example, can weigh up to 8.8 pounds and measure 20 inches in total length. That\u2019s the size of a small housecat. While not as heavy at 3 pounds, the Gambian pouched rat can measure as long as 3 feet from nose to tail.\n\n7. Rats are Prolific Breeders\nOne of the facts about rats that most people are familiar with is that they can breed quickly. A female rat can reproduce every three weeks or so. And when she gives birth, the litter typically contains six to 10 pups. These pups become sexually mature when they\u2019re three to four months old, meaning they can begin spawning their own broods.\n\n8. They\u2019re Social Creatures\nMost types of rats live in communities, in which they groom each other, sleep together and even play. However, they are territorial, so they can turn aggressive toward unfamiliar rats. A group of rats is called a \u201cmischief.\u201d\n\n9. Rats Can Carry Pathogens That Spread Disease\nYes. One of the most well-known facts about rats is that they can carry pathogens that spread diseases that can affect humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), rats and mice can spread over 35 diseases. They\u2019re even responsible for an outbreak of monkey pox in 2003.\n\n10. Rats Can Laugh\nWhen rats play, they experience what researcher Jaak Panksepp calls a type of \u201csocial-joy.\u201d The result? They laugh, albeit not a hearty chuckle like you\u2019d hear from a human. Instead, they emit a high-pitched chirping noise.\n\nNow that you know these facts about rats, you can see why some people might keep them as pets. Nonetheless, that doesn\u2019t mean you ever want to encounter a wild rat in your house or workplace. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know how to keep rats away.", "timestamp_created": 1639395300, "timestamp_updated": 1639395300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584055483341217041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105727608": {"recommendationid": "105727608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140010054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1546397947}, "language": "english", "review": "my cat snowball died when i played this game", "timestamp_created": 1639338774, "timestamp_updated": 1639338774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105671838": {"recommendationid": "105671838", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071732185", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1656739469}, "language": "english", "review": "Its an absolute masterpiece of a game it truly is just complete the puzzle and kill the cat. as simple as that", "timestamp_created": 1639266879, "timestamp_updated": 1639266879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105427010": {"recommendationid": "105427010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995853052", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1671138029}, "language": "english", "review": "Increased my credit score and got me green card.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Let me ask you a question, what is Bad Rats? Bad Rats is\u2026 how do I put this into words\u2026 a game that every company strives their games to become. Bad Rats is the prime example of what a game truly should be.\n\nBad Rats, developed by Invent4, a game company that we all know and love, was developed in humanity\u2019s overall peak, July 20, 2009. July 20, 2009 is celebrated by many as \u201cThe Day of the Rats.\u201d \n\nNo more about talking how good Bad Rats is, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all eager on WHY it\u2019s the best creation man could ever think of. The Mona Lisa is only child\u2019s play to what Bad Rats has to offer.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we begin with the visuals. The visuals of Bad Rats is clearly ahead of time. Scientists from Harvard have conducted studies that because of how immersive Bad Rats is, one can simply unlock the 4th dimension by playing \u201cBad Rats.\u201d A quote from Thomas Jefferson once said, \u201cdamn this shit be bussin lmao.\u201d If you think modern triple A games such as Call of Duty: Cold War is \u201cone of the best visually looking games,\u201d then I have nothing to describe Bad Rats. I bought a rat from my local PetSmart and compared it to Bad Rats. I could swear that the rats from Bad Rats just look more visually accurate than my rat.\n\nOne must ask, \u201cif Bad Rats looks so good that it allows players to unlock the 4th dimension, how can I run it?\u201d Luckily for you, the developers of Bad Rats are no clowns. It\u2019s requirements are so minimal, that I have overclocked my rock in which I\u2019ve obtained in my backyard to run Bad Rats in 60k resolution all in \u201cbig rats settings,\u201d the highest one can put it to be and in 400 frames per second. I don\u2019t know how a game could look stunningly amazing and be able to run on everything, but the developers of Bad Rats just know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nEnough about the visuals of Bad Rats, let\u2019s talk about the actual gameplay and story. The story of Bad Rats is just better than all the games combined and very simple. Just kill the cat. Remember, sometimes simplicity is just better. The puzzles that Bad Rats has to offer is ahead of everyone. I quote from the man itself, Albert Einstein, \u201cbro wtf is this shit I can\u2019t do jack.\u201d If Einstein is incapable of solving such complicated puzzles, then how did the developers finish it? Simple. They didn\u2019t. They\u2019re simply waiting for super humans to exist to finish the game for them. How brilliant. Michael Jackson, a student from Stanford with a PHD in rats said that, \u201cif you wish to feel dumb, simply walk into the room where the Bad Rats developers are.\u201d After conducting multiple surveys, Mrs. Jordan has figured out that the average IQ of a Bad Rats developer is within the thousands. \n\nIn conclusion, Bad Rats is a game way ahead of its time. I highly recommend everyone to try the game as it\u2019s as cheap as something from the dollar tree and visually stunning. I highly recommend all users to buy multiple copies and start to spread it like the novel Sars2 COVID-19. I surely believe that by spreading Bad Rats, the word\u2019s average IQ would rise by 100.", "timestamp_created": 1629601098, "timestamp_updated": 1629601098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30,

We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, \"Anyone can cook.\" But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1627111019, "timestamp_updated": 1627111019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96262171": {"recommendationid": "96262171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057407707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1632533176}, "language": "english", "review": "bad", "timestamp_created": 1627081387, "timestamp_updated": 1627081387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625208556652069092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96224653": {"recommendationid": "96224653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127614178", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1630881096}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge and its successor, Bad Rats Show are more than mere games.

When I finally beat it, I sobbed for hours without end, and once I had finished that, I opened up a new game of Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, to go through the absolute majesty of it all over again.\n\nI cannot recommend Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge enough.

I was once  homeless and starving on the streets before a man walked up to me and said \"hey kid, want to battle me in a game of bad rats?\". Of course, I was confused at first. \"What is bad rats?\" The man gave me a sly smirk and adjusted his fedora and went \"How about you find out, kiddo?\" I was sketched out at first. Who was this man asking me to battle him in a game of bad rats? Little did I know this was the turning point in my life. This man was an angel from heaven. We went to the local library and booted up the old desktop. Thankfully bad rats runs on low graphics so it is accessible for everyone because bad rats doesn't discriminate (besides against dirty cats but they deserve it). He opened the game and let me look at all the rats. Never did I know there were so many rats in existence. It taught me the diversity of rats and about their culture. It was truly eye opening. As I set the totally not racist bomber rat down and attached a balloon to the batter bat, I felt the gears turning in my mind and I realized I love rats and I love physics. The man and me played bad rats every day for years, only encouraging my love for rat physics. I was able to use what I learned from bad rats to write a dissertation on the the aerodynamics and centripetal force offered by rats with a undeniable thirst for cat blood. This research was accepted by Yale University and I received a full scholarship for graduate school and skipped undergraduate. Bad rats made me a genius and now I make a billion dollars a year and can retire at 30 so I can play bad rats for the rest of my life until I die. I hope to be buried with my computer so I can possibly come back as a ghost and keep playing. \n\nPS. the man and me got happily married and had a bad rats wedding.

This game paved the way for the new golden standard of 3D video game design, and ever since the release in 2009, games such as Grand theft auto V, The Witcher 3, The Last of Us, and Skyrim have tried to attempt to mock this games deep lore and gameplay that has aged like a fine wine... but none of them have succeeded. Part of this is due to Bad Rats surreal world building, scattered throughout the world you will see empty boxes of pizzas, graffiti, and a general feeling of the environment being in a state of decay, the rats are no longer in their prime, their underworld has fallen apart due to the rise of household cats. The world building is so strong that you don\u2019t need to be told to kill the cats, you just know that that is what you are here to do and I think that is so gosh dang deep. Speaking of deep, let\u2019s get into the character design:\nGames such as Grand theft Auto V are praised for the use of swapping between characters while in the midst of combat, although this game had done it 4 years prior and LEAGUES better!\nGta has you swap between 3 relatively unique main characters to play as, meanwhile Bad Rats boasts 35 different rats to play as all with extremely different and unique abilities at their disposal.\nLastly, I want to point out that this games soundtrack is just superb, it really gives me this feeling that my pack of rats is tucked away in the back of a garage while a high school punk band is performing and some teens are doing the sex RIGHT ABOVE BATTLEFIELD \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\n\nOverall I give this game a 10/10, games have been

You try to soak up the caramel with the outer layer of the cake, but it's no use; eventually the caramel drenches everything into mushy, sticky mess.

It puts me in the minority and forces me to think about how, and mainly why, people like or dislike such titles. This happens to be [b]Bad Rats[/b]\u2019 case too. While this puzzle game does not have any redeeming qualities, it is still somehow popular enough despite being badmouthed for its gameplay.\n\nHowever, I found out that [b]Bad Rats[/b] are favoured purely because of one reason. Memes. Case closed.\n\nThat leaves people like me in slight confusion, though. How should I know what it is about and if it is actually a competent experience if everyone makes fun of it? Sure, that fact alone could imply that there is not anything good about it. That is not enough for me, as I would like to find out by myself. Well, let us finally dive into this quite a short review. \n[h3][b]The best-laid schemes of rats and cats\u2026[/b][/h3]\nWhat is [b]Bad Rats[/b] about then? You need to figure out how to move a ball to the other end of the level, where it is supposed to hit a tool, such as a shotgun, which would proceed to kill an unsuspecting cat. Well, that is all. There is no story, and this gameplay loop remains the same for the whole game. While it might sound like an unchallenging experience, beware that the opposite is true.\n\nThe ball will not move on its own, though. You need to use one of your wilful rats, such as the one with a baseball bat, to hit this round object and make it move. What if there is suddenly an obstacle in your way, as even a sudden high wall might prove to be a stumbling rock to your progress. That is the time when the sheer variety of rodents and items comes to play. Perhaps a trampoline would do the trick or a rat with a vacuum cleaner, who pulls up the ball with it? Maybe an explosion from a suicide bomber would move it across? As you can see, the choices are pretty unique and even quite hilarious.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2470391530\nWhile this approach might sound straightforward, the levels naturally become more difficult as you progress. The maps get more complex, so you will have to think about what combinations of rodents and items might work. I found this appealing enough, as it somehow forced me to discover the most effective and fastest way, which would lead me to a joyful victory.\n\n[h1][b]I am in incredible pain\u2026[/b][/h1]\nIf everything would work flawlessly, then I would not actually mind recommending [b]Bad Rats[/b]. However, there are several issues, which made my experience rather tiresome. Firstly, the visuals kinda put me off, as they are just bland and fuzzy. Secondly, the music is very repetitive, and I would swear that there are only one or two compositions. Now to the worse part.\n\nThe very first problem would be the game\u2019s physics, especially the ball\u2019s one. Even with the right combination of rats, its movement might be completely random, as it will suddenly jump around more than usual, or it will refuse to move further at all. I even witnessed it go through the walls several times, which started to annoy me quite soon. This problem forced me to restart some levels dozens of times before the ball finally decided to behave and reach its destination. The way the physics behave is just atrocious, and it totally ruined the bits of enjoyment I tried to have with this title.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2470396175\nApart from that, I had several technical issues, as [b]Bad Rats[/b] crashed numerously for me. Due to that, I even lost a bit of my progress at times, and there was no error message whatsoever. Perhaps my computer decided to stop my suffering by closing that app. Keep in mind that there are no autosaves, so I advise you to save at the start of every level. I mean, I would suggest you not to play this game at all due to these issues, but you do you. At times, my useable rats and equipment did not even load, so I could not interact with the levels at all, so I had to restart it. Again. I would not mind if it would happen twice or thrice, but as it was a reoccurring issue, it started to piss me off.\n\nThat would be all, as there are no other mechanics or a story to follow. While I have to admit that the aspects revolving around rats and their variety is quite good, this title as a whole is just a tremendously broken mess due to the abovementioned issues.\n\n[b]PC Specs and Performance[/b]\n[quote]I played it with an [b]i5 8300H[/b], [b]GTX 1060 6GB[/b], and [b]16GB RAM[/b], at highest settings, at [b]35[/b] frames per second, at [b]1240x1024[/b] resolution.

Overall, amazing game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1619387543, "timestamp_updated": 1619387543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598173201084136963", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90896632": {"recommendationid": "90896632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271820234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1654974436}, "language": "english", "review": "Rats", "timestamp_created": 1619356354, "timestamp_updated": 1619356354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90844656": {"recommendationid": "90844656", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132701923", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1693074313}, "language": "english", "review": "free", "timestamp_created": 1619278174, "timestamp_updated": 1619278174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90792218": {"recommendationid": "90792218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405966974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1619325394}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego me ah transmitido diversas emociones: Felicidad,Tristeza,Angustia,Adrenalina\nes una putisima obra de arte a nivel jugabilistico y gr\u00e1ficamente es ARTE.\nSPOILER\nLa mejor escena es cuando Fat Rat se junta con Arabian Rat todo para vengar la muerte de su padre,quien fue brutalmente asesinado por la banda de los gatos.Esa escena es arte puro,podr\u00eda verlo un mill\u00f3n de veces y nunca cansarme de las f\u00edsicas de desmembramiento a la hora de asesinar al gato.\n\nJuego recomendadicimo", "timestamp_created": 1619200957, "timestamp_updated": 1619200957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90791486": {"recommendationid": "90791486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334915434", "num_games_owned": 878, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1619139986}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si\n", "timestamp_created": 1619200035, "timestamp_updated": 1619200035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90683408": {"recommendationid": "90683408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170711711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1619015362}, "language": "english", "review": "This will be my first time giving a negative review,\n\nGame is utter Garbage, Trash.

I'm going to slave away at this shitty job straight through my 20's and until I'm dead, I thought. Before I discovered this game, video games had long ceased to be entertaining, only serving as a task to keep me preoccupied with fake rewards to distract from my worsening situation in the real world. That is until the game \"Badrats\" came upon my screen on the steam recommended section. What could this mean? I thought. Are these rats malevolent or simply of low quality? Or perhaps these rats are just in their cause, but are considered \"bad\" for the way in which they attain their goals. I had lost all of my money long ago, but as it would be near impossible to be in a worse situation than I was, I opened a new credit card in my name to add to my compiling dept. When I decided to purchase bad rats for 49% off at $0.59, I couldn't have possibly predicted what I was getting into, no one could. \n\n        Badrats breaks new ground in the standards for the video game industry. When I opened Badrats I was instantly hooked, the vast roster of over 10 rats and 40 levels provide hours of fun like you've never had before. The level editor also provides infinite replay value, so you never have to stop playing Badrats. Now that I have Badrats, I've begun acceling in both my private and social life. My ex wife, carol, has called me and wants to get back together. My manager over at 711  caught sight of me whistling the Badrats theme song and spontaneously pointed at me and said \"You're gonna be a star, kid!\", now I'm working on the set of the Badrats movie in hollywood. Badrats gives more than anyone could ask for from a $1 videogame.\n\n       The world of Badrats is both deeply beautiful, and philosophical. The vast open world landscapes of Badrats are something to behold. From perfectly crafted red brick backgrounds to incredible grey brick backgrounds, and even a cave system as a background once. Badrats never ceases to impress with its utterly stunning scenery.\n\n       Above all else, Badrats is a mirror, in which the reflection encompasses modern day political entanglements in the middle east and the deep rooted systemic racism in America. In Badrats your aim is to kill a cat with rats. But never is the question raised, why does the cat deserve to be killed? How did centuries of slavery and systemic poverty lead to the cat having to commit a crime in order to achieve higher quality of life, but ultimately end up imprisoned? The \"bomber rat\" also known as the \"muslim rat\" (most likely a follower of sunni islam) also makes an appearance in Badrats. Carrying an explosive vest that it uses to further the goals of the rats. This clearly pays homage to war on terror, and war in iraq in which sunni rebels took up arms against the government of Iraq and the American invaders. This rat is a deep representation of the ever prolonging of the war on terror.\n\n       Badrats has permanently changed my outlook on our world we all share. I'm on my way to fulfilling my dream of becoming an actor and pro Badrats player, competing at the Badrats International Tournament for a grand total of $2,000,000. It is impossible to truly sum up my love for Badrats in so few words, so instead, I would like to thank the developers, and tell the reader of this review, that you should buy Badrats right now.\n\n10/10!", "timestamp_created": 1618883072, "timestamp_updated": 1657084768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732060492038726807", "comment_count":

second look quickly reveals the Kafkaesque allegories underneath the thin veil. What many players fail to realize is that this entire game is a dystopian view on the reliance many quantum physicists hold on the famous thought experiment, Schrodinger\u2019s Cat. Bad Rats shows, with horrifyingly accuracy, the future of study in physics.\n\nAs man-kind grows nearer and nearer to unlocking the secrets of the quantum world, the thought experiment will hinder progress more and more. Bad Rats shows the feline genocide that will soon follow upon the completion of the grand unified theory, for with the paradox of Schrodinger's Cat ever looming within the minds of our greatest physicists, they will resort to running every possible scenario of cat death and life until every possibility is statistically accounted for. With string theory becoming more and more accepted this means that the possibilities are theoretically endless, which the game alludes to in the unforgiving Expert Mode.\n\nBad Rats is not an example of bad game design. It is a message. It is a warning. Above all else, it is a mission. To warn us all of the impending doom science will wrought upon us. With the united world pouring every resource and man available into research of cat death probability, incessant matter farming for industrial cat cloning and feline teleportation, we will no doubt drive our species to extinction. Our own hubris will very well be our down-fall.\n\nTrust in the Bad Rats, we are not meant to unlock the secrets of the universe.", "timestamp_created": 1617423930, "timestamp_updated": 1617423930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522374868392944336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89605725": {"recommendationid": "89605725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322493826", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1605320069}, "language": "english", "review": "rat\n", "timestamp_created": 1617418003, "timestamp_updated": 1617418003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652550160884857178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89279816": {"recommendationid": "89279816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985573424", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3781, "last_played": 1690144084}, "language": "english", "review": "life changing", "timestamp_created": 1616969637, "timestamp_updated": 1616969637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598575055599212646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89261150": {"recommendationid": "89261150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319369654", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2055, "last_played": 1641734776}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1616947751, "timestamp_updated": 1624254845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550561785697937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89224381": {"recommendationid": "89224381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129280583", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3413, "last_played": 1618106960}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a disclaimer, English isn't my first language, hope you guys understand!\n\nI received this game as a gift from a friend meant as a joke.

depression since. The doctor gave me all the anti-depressants he could, but they did absolutely nothing. My parents nor my \"friends\" care about me, why would they? Anyway \u2014 last night I was tying the rope which I was going to put around my neck when I got a Steam notification. It said someone has gifted me this game, this was quite unusual since I didn't speak to anyone since my pet has passed away. I accepted the gift as the message read:\u2014 \"This game is for you. I know you need it.\" I didn't give it much thought; a troll could've gifted this game to me as a way to humiliate me.\n\nWhilst I was putting my rope on my door frame \u2014 a thought crossed my mind: \"What if I tried this game before I go?\" I decided to try out this game and, oh my Goodness, amazing would be understatement for this game. I immediately got hooked and my depression was cured; my doctor said that my depression just going away was a miracle! Thank you Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge, you have saved my life full of sorrow. I now look for the day of tomorrow where I can play more Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge. This game is a must buy for everyone.

Bad rats is great at making the player feel emotions as when I first started this game i only had one thought, damn these rats are bad and then I started to cry. I cried because the gameplay and the music were just so well put together it was like nothing I have ever seen before.\n\nThis game has a hidden story that many people will think that it speaks about society and how these bad rats are viewed as rebels or scoundrels. However this game is actually telling a story about Harriet Tubman and the underground railroad. For generations the rats were enslaved by the cats in a truly awful way, but one day a rat by the name of Benson T. Fredrickson was able to escape death row and taking control of his master Seargent Scritcy Scratchy, Benson was able to open his eyes and see how the things that they were doing was awful. Benson and Scritchy Scratchy started an alliance and vowed to get all rats out of enslavement, thus they started making an underground railroad in the sewer system, a place where cats dared to go.\n\nAlmost nine months later Benson and Scritchy Scratchy were finally done the underground railroad, The two friends then went back up to the surface and started work on sneaking out all the rats. This went smoothly for a good while but as predicted the cats soon caught on to the plan and began to suspect that there was something going on. The cats increased security on the Rats and Benson and Scritchy scratchy only had one thing left to do. Start a revolution.\n\nBenson and Scritchy Scratchy snuck in to where most of the rats were being held and informed the rats of the plan. The next morning the rats started rioting against the evil clutches of the cat folk. Under the command of Benson and the power of Scritchy Scratchy the rats were able to overpower the masses of cats forcing them to retreat to a place that they would never go, the sewers. Benson and Scritchy scratchy have been taking torture devices from the cats and hiding them in the sewers, little did they know they would be able to use them against the cats.\n\nThat is where this game starts off, The player plays as a group of Rebel rats who have to show the cats just what they have been through, the strategy in this game is quite difficult as to show the struggle of the rats who are trying to fight for their freedom and be seen as equal to the cat folk.\n", "timestamp_created": 1612390150, "timestamp_updated": 1612390150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny":

My man Islamic rat, is my hero, I look up to him daily as he reminds me failure to praise allah will lead to a quick and swift death by explosion. Otherwise I'd say this game has the finest puzzles I've ever seen, in fact it once took me 90 hours to figure out how to place a rat.

What many players fail to realize is that this entire game is a dystopian view on the reliance many quantum physicists hold on the famous thought experiment, Schrodinger\u2019s Cat. Bad Rats shows, with horrifyingly accuracy, the future of study in physics.\n\nAs man-kind grows nearer and nearer to unlocking the secrets of the quantum world, the thought experiment will hinder progress more and more. Bad Rats shows the feline genocide that will soon follow upon the completion of the grand unified theory, for with the paradox of Schrodinger's Cat ever looming within the minds of our greatest physicists, they will resort to running every possible scenario of cat death and life until every possibility is statistically accounted for. With string theory becoming more and more accepted this means that the possibilities are theoretically endless, which the game alludes to in the unforgiving Expert Mode.\n\nBad Rats is not an example of bad game design. It is a message. It is a warning. Above all else, it is a mission. To warn us all of the impending doom science will wrought upon us. With the united world pouring every resource and man available into research of cat death probability, incessant matter farming for industrial cat cloning and feline teleportation, we will no doubt drive our species to extinction. Our own hubris will very well be our down-fall.\n\nTrust in the Bad Rats, we are not meant to unlock the secrets of the universe.", "timestamp_created": 1611466271, "timestamp_updated": 1611466271, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781093955039978027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85189127": {"recommendationid": "85189127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379335237", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 7260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7260, "last_played": 1581586101}, "language": "english", "review": "Its game of the year", "timestamp_created": 1611387562, "timestamp_updated": 1611387562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85187587": {"recommendationid": "85187587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253740336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1662074578}, "language": "english", "review": "don't", "timestamp_created": 1611385026, "timestamp_updated": 1611385026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486111104488372803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85178234": {"recommendationid": "85178234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074118188", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6161, "last_played": 1647473996}, "language": "english", "review": "it alright", "timestamp_created": 1611369581, "timestamp_updated": 1611369581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528301894664764404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85160815": {"recommendationid": "85160815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996051109", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1613337758}, "language": "english", "review": "help me god", "timestamp_created": 1611344138, "timestamp_updated": 1611344138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486111104488372803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85089513": {"recommendationid": "85089513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246252228", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1611236721}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad Ra", "timestamp_created": 1611236722, "timestamp_updated": 1611236722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501283228397369385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85067272": {"recommendationid": "85067272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203132772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1579222252}, "language": "english", "review": "Charlotte has these I think", "timestamp_created": 1611200352, "timestamp_updated": 1611200352, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85007983": {"recommendationid": "85007983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025630223", "num_games_owned": 3235, "num_reviews": 288, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 562, "last_played": 1609921209}, "language": "english", "review": "Everyone one knows this game is a meme.  \n\nIs it great?

Pero esto no lo es todo, y aspectos como algunos elementos jugables o la propia historia en mi opini\u00f3n no llegan a la excelencia t\u00e9cnica.\nEn primer lugar, la jugabilidad tiene dos partes totalmente diferenciadas, la parte de caminar y la parte de combate, esta ultima queda relegada por motivos de gui\u00f3n a unas 5 secuencias en todo el juego, a parte de estas secuencias podemos combatir contra unos humanos que encontramos (llamados Mulas), pero el juego te penaliza al hacerlo, b\u00e1sicamente el juego no quiere que matemos. Hasta aqu\u00ed no tengo problemas con esto, el problema es que el sigilo es anecd\u00f3tico, la jugabilidad no esta dise\u00f1ada para ser sigilosos, y choca bastante pues Kojima ya cre\u00f3 la 2\u00ba mejor jugabilidad basada en sigilo de toda la historia (ahora mismo el 1\u00ba puesto se la lleva The last of Us 2), por lo que ten\u00eda medios y conocimientos para crear algo mejor en este aspecto, no digo que Sam Porter fuese un Solid Snake, pero co\u00f1o, algo mas a parte de esconderse en el manido recurso de las hierbas altas...\nAdem\u00e1s, es francamente frustrante (que no dif\u00edcil) entrar a los territorios de los Mulas, y no ser detectado, por lo que al final es mejor rodear la zona siempre que sea posible. Y si te descubren, cosa probable, la situaci\u00f3n es mucho mas f\u00e1cil si te l\u00edas a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 con todos, y aun en Muy Dif\u00edcil (que es como lo he jugado), los dejas a todos inconscientes y a continuar con tu camino. No esta muy equilibrada la dificultad.\nEl combate con armas no lo veo tan malo como comentaban, pero el tema de la munici\u00f3n \"hematica\" me parece un recurso un tanto..... cutrillo, balas de sangre?? pos vale Kojima, lo que tu quieras XD.\n\nLa parte jugable relacionada con caminar esta much\u00edsimo mejor y mas inspirada, me duelen los ojos de leer la tontada de \"Es que es un walking simulator\", en ning\u00fan walking simulator caminar es importante, y por lo tanto jamas se ha prestado atenci\u00f3n a esto, en un walking simulator somos entes suspendidos en el aire que flotamos por el escenario, por que lo \u00fanico importante en ese genero es la historia, y nada mas. En Death Stranding caminaremos, claro, pero de la forma mas realista que se ha creado hasta ahora en un videojuego, el cuerpo tiene inercias, que var\u00edan seg\u00fan el peso que llevemos encima, o la inclinaci\u00f3n del terreno, el viento, vamos, que no es \"le doy pa lante y que camine el pollo\".\nLo que no me termina de convencer en exceso es la sensaci\u00f3n de estar siempre \"continuando\" la partida de otra gente con el sistema online de \"fusi\u00f3n\" con otros jugadores, cuando llegamos a un sitio nuevo no vemos estructuras de otros jugadores, pero en cuanto \"sincronizamos\" el territorio en que estamos, no va a haber un paso o monta\u00f1a que no este ya preparada por otros jugadores para que nos movamos mas f\u00e1cilmente. Esto se puede desactivar, pero es que tampoco he querido quitarlo por que aun as\u00ed es una parte del juego, y siento que sin esto tambi\u00e9n me pierdo parte de la experiencia de juego. No obstante es que muchas veces se pasan con la facilidad que te dan esos \"cruces\" con otros jugadores, por ejemplo a veces ver\u00e1s veh\u00edculos por todos los sitios que otros jugadores han abandonado, sac\u00e1ndote un poco del panorama \"desolado\" que intenta presentar el juego, con haber bajado el numero de estructuras que vemos habr\u00eda solucionado en parte este \"problema\".\n\nPero para mi, su peor punto es su historia, despues de a\u00f1os y a\u00f1os creando misterios con sus apote\u00f3sicos tr\u00e1ileres, de jugar al despiste en mil y una ocasiones, con gran pesar tengo que admitir que, al menos en mi opini\u00f3n la historia no llega a lo que se esperaba de ella. Ya no es que si se entiende o no se entiende, el problema es que es una historia tan abstracta, que intentar darle sentido es casi imposible salvo que nos valga la explicaci\u00f3n de \"Lo hizo un mago\". Tengo una bater\u00eda de preguntas escritas que si se llegan a responder es por los pelos y no se sustentan en nada firme. Para mi, Hideo Kojima he hecho practicamente un \"Perdidos\" de manual. Igual es que soy yo, y sus \"respuestas\" no me aportan nada, no lo se, pero desde que empec\u00e9 el juego varias personas me dec\u00edan que todo queda cristalino al final del juego... yo no he visto nada cristalino, y sobre todo un mont\u00f3n de preguntas sin responder, y s\u00ed, me he le\u00eddo todas las entradas escritas que me han ido llegando. No obstante el desarrollo de la historia ocurre como en Horizon: Zero Dawn, la mayor parte de carga narrativa es practicamente al final del juego, la diferencia es que este ultimo si que sabe resolver el enorme misterio que presenta el juego y de una manera magistral.\n\nEn definitiva, claro que recomiendo el juego, no es mal juego para nada, pero tampoco me ha parecido una obra maestra, lo tenia todo para serlo, pero para mi no lo consigue, y en parte por culpa de las \u00ednfulas de crear una historia tan pseudo-intelectual que no hay por donde cogerla, en esto Kojima deber\u00eda aprender un poco de Chrisopher Nolan.", "timestamp_created": 1610393517, "timestamp_updated": 1610393517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56204378604888916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84502768": {"recommendationid": "84502768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054331872", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1610384906}, "language": "english", "review": "very good immersive gameplay and music. one of the best", "timestamp_created": 1610385422, "timestamp_updated": 1610385422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84472392": {"recommendationid": "84472392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202989400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1562709380}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny rat go WWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!", "timestamp_created": 1610340362, "timestamp_updated": 1610340362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84437243": {"recommendationid": "84437243", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095780711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1612636922}, "language": "english", "review": "They fought and bit,\nThey fought and fought and bit,\nFought fought fought, bit bit bit\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1610294488, "timestamp_updated": 1610294488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84395130": {"recommendationid": "84395130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282727229", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1607710330}, "language": "english", "review": "these rats are bad", "timestamp_created": 1610238271, "timestamp_updated": 1610238271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711997091770172119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84317158": {"recommendationid": "84317158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357960453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1618491718}, "language": "english", "review": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer working in the fields a few thousand years ago.

I recall that when I first booted up this game, I was struck with a feeling of pure euphoria, so powerful in fact that I had to turn it off after half an hour because I feared potentially going into cardiac arrest. This experience has earned Bad Rats: the Rats Revenge it's place on a special pillar in my heart among the other great games that I have experienced throughout my life which have evoked different emotions to a beautiful extent. Bad Rats: the Rats Revenge is a game that I believe shouldn't not be explained, but shown. The developers of this masterpiece have set the price to the low cost of $0.99 USD, which is affordable for the average person. However, this game can be bought at a cheaper price during a Steam sale. If you crave some excitement or an unforgettable experience that you can look back on from time to time, I would highly recommend purchasing Bad Rats: the Rats Revenge, though it must be played in moderation as to not impair one's health.

For I have sworn before you and Almighty Rat the same solemn oath our forerats prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.\n\nThe world is very different now. For rat holds in his mortal paws the power to abolish all forms of rat poverty and all forms of rat life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forerats fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of rats come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of the Almighty Rat.\n\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to rat and cat alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of rat kind--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient rat heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those rat rights to which this nest has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\n\nLet every nest know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any rat, oppose any cat to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\n\nThis much we pledge--and more.\n\nTo those old rats whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful rats. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\n\nTo those new nests whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron cat tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the cat ended up inside.\n\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the cats may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\n\nTo our sister rodents south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good cheese--in a new alliance for progress--to assist free rats and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile cats. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the nest. And let every other power know that this colony intends to remain the master of its own nest.\n\nTo that world assembly of sovereign nests, the United Rodent Nests, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\n\nFinally, to those nests who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by cats engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\n\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\n\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nests take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of ratkind's final war.\n\nSo let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\n\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.\n\nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of cheese--and bring the absolute power to destroy other nests under the absolute control of all nests.\n\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of cheese instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stairs, conquer the kitchens, eradicate traps, tap the pantries depths and encourage the arts and commerce.\n\nLet both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Twitch--to \"undo the heavy burdens . . . (and) let the oppressed go free.\"\n\nAnd if a kitchenhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of cheese, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.\n\nAll this cheese will not be acquired in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be acquired in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Rat-topia, nor even perhaps in our lifetime in this attic. But let us begin.\n\nIn your paws, my fellow rats, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this nest was founded, each generation of rats has been summoned to give testimony to its nestial loyalty. The graves of young rats who answered the call to service surround the kitchen.\n\nNow the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear paws, though paws we need--not as a call to battle, though embattled we are-- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\"--a struggle against the common enemies of rats: cats, traps, boots and man itself.\n\nCan we forge against these cats a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all ratkind? Will you join in that historic effort?\n\nIn the long history of the kitchen, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this ratsponsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other rats or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our attic and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the kitchen.\n\nAnd so, my fellow rats: ask not what your nest can do for you--ask what you can do for your nest.\n\nMy fellow rats of the attic: ask not what nest will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of rats.\n\nFinally, whether you are rats of the kitchen or rats of the attic, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the house we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth Almighty Rats work must truly be our own.", "timestamp_created": 1605765395, "timestamp_updated": 1605765557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722462832927703857", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79464044": {"recommendationid": "79464044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043163536", "num_games_owned": 1347, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1639603788}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the rat", "timestamp_created": 1605711823, "timestamp_updated": 1605711823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707632005214691162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79436757": {"recommendationid": "79436757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301607184", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1638669434}, "language": "english", "review": "bad rat", "timestamp_created": 1605656457, "timestamp_updated": 1668897312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79368259": {"recommendationid": "79368259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198954176943", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1604223640}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck", "timestamp_created": 1605550403, "timestamp_updated": 1605550403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488013684749603271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79277905": {"recommendationid": "79277905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134549600", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1624591755}, "language": "english", "review": "rapture is coming, god will punish you", "timestamp_created": 1605396452, "timestamp_updated": 1605396452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51683276891708374", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79241516": {"recommendationid": "79241516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320277721", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1506025643}, "language": "english", "review": "vtnc", "timestamp_created": 1605345795, "timestamp_updated": 1605345795, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488013684749603271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79238849": {"recommendationid": "79238849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198959327097", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 798, "last_played": 1619502252}, "language": "english", "review": "best game evarrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1605340423, "timestamp_updated": 1605340423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511836707592010498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79207190": {"recommendationid": "79207190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355447427", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6347, "last_played": 1514796027}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

Thousands of years of advancements in technology, agriculture, social morals, and the ladder of social hierarchy allowed us to become a somewhat advanced species with knowledge of the stars, our home planet and beyond. This game is the physical and digital embodiment of the blood sweat and tears, along with the pain and suffering all of humanity has endured from the beginning. BadRats, as almost a poetic metaphor, symbolises the struggle of the lower/middle class citizens finally rising up against their wealthier, more powerful counterparts in society, beautifully demonstrating without error the divide between the rich and poor in todays society. Such class and perfection with its execution of higher thinking in this game is only rivalled by the finest literature: The Brothers Karamazov. by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I would even go as far to say that this game was based on the inspiring philosophical novel. The level of intellect required to play this game is almost NON EXISTENT in todays society, as you SHEEP fail to see the deeper meaning in this games flawless stature and gameplay. Its almost a shame really, that such a advanced back story and morality portrayed by the stunning characters goes un-noticed by the close eyed sheep who fail to read between the lines of this masterpiece.Bad Rats is a revolutionary first person shooter that sets a new standard for this era of gaming. This is game published by Electronic Arts and is developed by Dice on the new Frostbite 4 engine to provide a superior graphic fidelity compared to other marvellous titles including Crisis 3. The story of the game takes place in the year 2035 when North Korea officially ends the cease fire for the Korean War and launches a series of surprise attacks on the United States of America and South Korea. North Korea launches an overwhelming amount of long range ballistic missiles towards major metropolitan areas in the United States which devastates the population and cripples the infrastructure of the government to be able to function properly to contain control of the United States. North Korea launches a full scale aerial campaign on Seoul with a relentless wave of troops pouring across the DMZ of North Korea and South Korea. China and the rebuilt Soviet Union organized by Vladimir Putin has been supplying North Korea with highly advanced military technology and expertise has secretly been supporting North Korea for a war since 2006! You play as a squad in the Navy Seals for the United States called \u201cBad Rats\u201d Your objective is to assassinate all cats in the region of Asia to cut off all food supplies from the North Koreans and collapse the regime of Kim Jong Un. Using the destructible environments from the Frostbite 4 engine you must use the environment for a tactical advantage to exterminate all cats from Asia. Fan favourite maps return including Seige of Shainghai where you must collapse a skyscraper to kill all cats in the building. Facial scanning technology from LA Noire returns to add an extra layer of realism with realistic facial animation movements to add more emotion to the already immersive world. This is a highly addicting shooter that takes place in locations across the world from nuclear wasteland America to the glorious lands of North Korea. You have a massive arsenal of over 500 weapons to use with thousands of gadgets and gun camouflages. Bad Rats is integrated with the Steam Workshop which has created thousands of community maps and gun skins to be submitted into the game for future free DLCs called \u201cOperations\u201d. Each operation adds an extra layer of immersion into the game with a huge variety of community maps and skins to be added to expand the already masterpiece of a game. Bad rats is a very skill based shooter and requires extensive training to truly shine in multiplier. Bad Rats is the only first person shooter on the market to add a innovative competitive mode with ranks to determine your skill level. In multiplayer there are 2 teams. Counter Cats and Cats. The counter cats must plant a bomb on one of the two locations on the map to kill the population of cats in the area. The cats must prevent the counter cats or the \u201cbad rats\u201d from planting the bomb by either killing all the Counter Cats or defusing the bomb to save the population of cats in the premise.Bad Rats is a highly addicting shooter that any seasonal gamer should try out but I assume you already have! Bad Rats global sales have exceeded 1 billion on the first day outselling the Call of Duty franchise. It is very rare to see game a game this flawless since the release of Half Life 2. If you like first person shooter games you already own bad rats, if you don't you are missing out on one of the most brilliant game of this century.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nPros\nImmersive environments\nBalanced multiplayer\nOverwhelming amount of content\nGorgeous Graphics\nRevolutionizes the FPS genre\nFantastic and inspiring story\nGreat voice acting\nLike Half Life 3 but better\n\nCons\nToo much graphics\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1604713692, "timestamp_updated": 1604713692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73207467794418335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78851508": {"recommendationid": "78851508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098103053", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1604709116}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had this game for who knows how long in my library and I decided to play it through.

I\u2019ll give a short review of the actual game. \n\nThe first word of this game sums it up. Bad. This is a physics puzzle game where you go through 44 levels and use various objects and rats to kill a cat. You set up the scene and then hit \u2018play\u2019 to see how it works out. Sounds straightforward, right? Wrong. The physics are from another dimension where even identical runs produce different results. It\u2019s like you have RNG factored into your physics. You could set up a solution that solves the level, but it won\u2019t work because of the variable physics. Hit \u2018play\u2019 again, boom it solves the puzzle. \n\nBeyond the wonky physics, here are some other gripes. \n[list]\n[*]The ball can roll off the 2D level. With no discernable reason, the ball will go outside of the 2D plane and just roll away.\n\n[*]I played on the Easy difficulty at first, but after some levels I had to clear the screen with the included button. This works, but it also sets you to Expert difficulty which allows you to use all the available objects. \n\n[*]Save at the beginning of every level. Unfortunately, there is a timer for each level. Why? Who knows? But if you run out of time, that\u2019s it, back to the Main Menu. I mention saving at the [b]beginning[/b] of each level because your saved game also saves the current time left. Save the game with 10 seconds left? Well you\u2019ve basically destroyed any chance of finishing that level and will need to start the game over. Better yet, have a rotation of multiple saves.\n\n[*]Comically bad grammar on every single level help screen.\n\n[*]Graphics options are not saved. Every time you launch the game you have to re-select what you want. \n\n[/list]\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gone through some of the cons, ONE positive is the number of ways you can solve every level. A lot of the time the expected solution was different from mine. Being able to use all the objects/rats to make your own solution is great for creativity. \n\nWhile I finished the game and got all the achievements, I didn\u2019t enjoy myself and wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Avoid this one.\n\n[b]2/10[/b] Not good", "timestamp_created": 1599415351, "timestamp_updated": 1599415409, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47994270920753479", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75520854": {"recommendationid": "75520854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953400335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3336, "last_played": 1599874207}, "language": "english", "review": "bad rats", "timestamp_created": 1599364604, "timestamp_updated": 1599364604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553264617919921875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75450547": {"recommendationid": "75450547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057736387", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1365231600}, "language": "english", "review": "BAD RATZ IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE IT GIVES ME THE  FULFILLMENT  I NEEED TO  HASVE A GOOD LIFE AND BE HAPPY.

It is the fifth main installment in The Bad Rats series, following Bad Rats 4: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011. \nThe game's main story revolves around the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. \nBad Rats was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. The game was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly mentioning the character advancement and setting, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Nonetheless it received some criticism, predominantly for its melee combat and numerous technical issues present at launch. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and over 30 million copies on all platforms as of November 2016, making it one of the best selling video games in history. \nThree downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released\u2014Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn\u2014which were repackaged into Bad Rats \u2013 Legendary Edition and released in June 2013. Bad Rats \u2013 Special Edition is a remastered version of the game released for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in October 2016. It includes all three DLC expansions and a graphical upgrade, along with additional features such as modding capabilities on consoles. Versions were released in November 2017 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation VR, and a stand-alone virtual reality (VR) version for Windows was released in April 2018. These versions were based on the remastered release, but the Switch version's graphics upgrade was relative to its hardware capabilities, and it did not include the modding features.", "timestamp_created": 1598432158, "timestamp_updated": 1598432158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516322433948516846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74899070": {"recommendationid": "74899070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056354899", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1612843357}, "language": "english", "review": "poop", "timestamp_created": 1598375300, "timestamp_updated": 1598375300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535456180572509766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74898221": {"recommendationid": "74898221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043737343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1655361758}, "language": "english", "review": "Game of the century", "timestamp_created": 1598374241, "timestamp_updated": 1598374241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74820473": {"recommendationid": "74820473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130038487", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 994, "last_played": 1677307501}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly too far ahead of it's time.

This game is my life. And no, this isn't satire so grow up a little bit and understand passion when you see it. I have logged over 730+ hours and I intend to log thousands more. Not only do I play this game daily, but I put over 30+ hours a week into it at the minimum. If you can do math like me that puts it at about 4.28571429 hours a day. (no I didn't use a calculator, I can do math in my head.) Anyone who is just staring out on steam should get this game. It's cheap and user friendly. Not to mention is is only O N E  dollar! That is incredible! I have gifted this game probably 10 times and I'll do it again. I'm also a moderator in the Bad Rats discord, which I am highly proud of. I worked tirelessly to get that position and I think I'm close to getting admin. Anyways, no matter the type of gamer you are, Bad Rats is for you. Just don't think you'll ever be as good as me. Please give this game a chance to change your life like it did to mine.\n\nIf you can see the passion and effort I put into the game and this review please consider leaving me a +rep for bad rats on my profile.

Essentially we have 44 puzzles where you must get a ball to activate something that kills the cat.\nThere are a few items you can use to help you achieve that. It's a straightforward setup and with simple puzzles. It should, in theory, be extremely simple and easy to do. So, why is it bad?\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Physics engine - it reacts RANDOMLY on every attempt with the exact same configurations\n[*] The previous point counts for point 1 to 8 due to how many times you have to repeat solutions until RNG is your friend\n[*] The game is 2D, yet the ball rolls in a 3D space, meaning sometimes it will even exit the puzzle (Wut?)\n[*] Bombers are NOT reliable in any way. Sometimes ball goes up, sometimes returns to starting point...\n[*] The automatic angle setting in the wooden plank is infuriating to work with\n[*] You must have space to rotate things and then place them in the correct places\n[*] Only runs in windowed mode as far as I can tell\n[*] You must finish the game to get all achievements\n[/list]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] It has a tutorial\n[*] It's short, finished in 3 hours, and all achievements are easy to achieve\n[*] There's a very good guide on how to finish the game in the guides section\n[*] Usually it's free because one of your friends gifted it to you\n[*] Great game to prank friends with a steam gift\n[/list]\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nThis is a game that has been used as a joke for ages, one of the first shovelware bad games released on steam. It's not worth it to play at all, it's not fun, it just frustrates you. And even if you don't follow the guide, the solutions are extremely simple, so it's not even a mental challenge. It's just bad all round.\nGetting this game free is still not reason enough to play it. Don't waste your time. Play something else, anything else.\nUnless of course, you just want to experience how bad this game is by yourself.\nSide note, it's not AS BAD as some reviews make it out to be, but it's just not good.\n\n[b]Veredict:[/b] 2/10 - You get to know what the first shovelware game was like\n\n[b]If mine (And any other) review was helpful and informative, please mark it as helpful.\nWe should have good reviews in the store page, not jokes.

Despite this, I committed to not only finishing the game, but obtaining every achievement as well. As a result, I believe that I could easily not recommend this abomination of a puzzle game. Or can I?\n\nYou see, the game plays off pretty basic. You have 44 levels to go through. In each level, there is a cat directly under or inside a death machine of sorts, whether it\u2019d be a bucket of acid or a microwave. The goal of the game is to have a ball make physical contact with the death machine so that the cat dies. To do this, you utilize a variety of rats as well as other miscellaneous objects in order to move the ball all the way from its start to its goal. Now, it seems like a fun game, except that this is a physics game with a horrible physics engine. Suppose you have everything set up in a specific position. You start the level and have the ball start moving. It fails, so you try it again. Without a doubt, out of the 10 times you may try, the ball will end up moving completely differently in 5 of those tries. The reason? Crappy physics engine. Not only do you have to figure out how to exactly the move the ball to its goal, but you also require the RNG needed for the ball to actually move the way it\u2019s supposed to move.\n\nYet, despite its overall crappy gameplay, the game offers something. Something much more than just bad physics. It offers a story; a story that you can\u2019t see until you begin asking yourself questions. So, let me ask those questions for you. Who are you playing as? Why is the cat just standing directly under or inside a death machine? Who are these rats that are specialized in all sorts of different things? Another thing to note is that some of the rats, namely the bomb rat and the rocket rat, will explode after being used. Why are these rats so determined to have the cat die that they would give up their own life just to have it occur? What IS Bad Rats: the Rat\u2019s Revenge? Is it even the rat\u2019s revenge, or is it something more? I believe it IS something more.\n\nLet\u2019s start off with something simple: why is the cat, in each level, just standing under a death machine? Why does it make no effort to get away from there? It\u2019s not that the cat is trapped in its location. Part of the reason as to why the game is so crappy is that, while the level design is 2D, the ball will simply move away from the level. This means that the ball can not only move forward and backward, but left and right as well, which is a completely shitty mechanic. However, it proves that the cat can simply walk away from its position, but it doesn\u2019t. Now of course, the answer to this can be seen with the cat. The answer is this: the cat is shackled to a chain and ball. Now the question is why? Why is the cat chained up? To put it simply, the cat is imprisoned there. As it\u2019s shackled to a chain and ball, the cat can do nothing but wait for its death. This reminds me of a certain event that has happened multiple times. The event? Execution.\n\nThe cat is being executed; that much is certain. Yet, why is the cat being executed, or more specifically, HOW did the cat end up in such a situation? This is my theory:\nCats are regarded as rat killers, as they will be the pets that take care of a household\u2019s rat problem. In other words, the cats act as vicious rulers that decide whether the rats live or die. Now of course, the rats don\u2019t want to live in such tyranny. After years of enduring, the rats decided that enough was enough. They revolted against their feline rulers, and somehow won their battle. As a result, the cats either died, were captured, or somehow escaped. Those that were captured are put to execution, and we, the player, are the ones executing them. If this is the case, that means that Bad Rats: the Rat\u2019s Revenge isn\u2019t just a physics puzzle game; instead, it\u2019s a public execution designed to entertain the executioner and perhaps anyone else serving as an audience. \n\nOther questions now remain. Who are these rats and why are some of them willing to die? Again, further speculation would have to be made for this. This is what I personally believe:\nThese rats were trained during the rat revolution. After the rats won, they had no use for the skills they developed. However, with the introduction to the public executions of captured cats, they had use once more. In order to make a game out of the public execution, a simple \u201cmake contact between the ball and the death machine\u201d goal was created. In each level, these rats would be directed to help move this ball by using their specialty. The bat rat hits the ball with his bat, the tractor rat moves the ball with the tractor, and so on and so forth. Now, what about the other rats? The rocket rat is definitely a specialized skill, but the rocket rat we, the executioner, use does not display any sense of control with navigating the rocket. Instead, we are the ones who control its rocket. As for the bomb rat, that is definitely a designated role that certain rats may have played. Yet, why is such a role being utilized in an execution? Why give up their life just for a captured cat to die? These sacrificial rats were traitors to the aforementioned rat cause. Believing that the rats will, without a doubt, lose the battle, some rats joined the cats in order to safe themselves. However, the rats ended up winning this battle. What became of the traitor rats then? It\u2019s simple: they were captured and forced into sacrificial roles for the sake of amusement in the public execution. To our benefit, these sacrificial rats help a lot. Personally, I utilized the bomb rat countless times. Not only are they incredibly useful, but we end up disposing the traitorous rats in the process. It\u2019s a win-win situation, I suppose.\n\nThis is Bad Rats. This is a game that features the most god-awful physics ever to be used in a PHYSICS PUZZLE GAME, WHERE PHYSICS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. Besides this fact, the game also has a story. It has an untold story that features the overwhelming determination of who we consider rodents. We consider rats as measly animals that amount to nothing other than disease. Yet, this game tells the story of their courage and their bravery, as they stood up against the oppressive cats to win their freedom from hell. At the end, the rats did it. It\u2019s such an amazing story that it brings a tear to my eye as I type this out\u2026\n\nAnd thus, I bring myself back to the very first question asked. Do I recommend this game? This game of victory? Of determination?\nThe answer\u2026 is no. It\u2019s still a shit game. Still, do play it because it goes on sale for 50 cents and it\u2019s so awful that you must play it. Unless you have standards, which I definitely don't have. \n\nEdit: I was gifted the game. Thanks to the bastard who gave me this damned game.

"review": "[b] It's 2008, and the board at Invent4 Entertainment are gathered around the table. [/b]\n\"We need the next big game idea!\" the executive director, Mike Cheese said. \nEverything was silent around the table aside from the methodical wobbling of the broken air conditioner in the top corner of the dark, dingy room. The threat of of the global economic recession loomed among each member around that table. \"How could we turn this whole catastrophe around?\" They each asked themselves. For 14 long hours, the members sat around that table. Every hour that passed took one after another of the members, until it was 11:36:52PM Brazil time. That is when Mike Cheese rose his head from the grainy walnut table he had laid it against.\n\"Fellas\" He said.\n\"We are going to make a game about killing cats...\" All of a sudden there was a chill in the air. All the members suddenly awoke at this announcement. Could they trust their beloved executive director? Was killing cats an immoral act? Or were the years of institutional torment that the feline race had perpetuated onto rads and various other small rodents enough to justify such an act? Yes, yes it did, it did justify it.\nThe team immediately got to work, yes they had been in the office for 32 hours, but that wouldn't matter. The physics department made certain that each cat looked identical and died in the same agonizing way. The sight of which no player would ever forget. After a whole year of testing, tinkering, and perfecting the art of killing cats with offensive jihadi rats, the game was ready. [b] On the 20th of July, 2009, Invent4 Entertainment did the impossible. [/b] The development of the game itself was enough to reverse the economic crash of the previous year. The company made billions, the executive director: Mike Cheese would go on to become the president of Brazil and cause a new age of prosperity for him and his people thanks to the sales of the game.\nThe game that changed the entire ecosphere of gaming and more broadly, the world was released almost 11 years ago. My heart can only yearn for a remaster, we have shitty games getting remasters left and right. Bad Rats would blow any of these out of the water. Don't try to quench my thirst with Bad Rats: SHOW (2016), we all know that the reviews on that are slanted due to nostalgia and a need to placate the developers for a potential remaster of the first. I would also like to see the inclusion of non-binary rats in the remaster, for gods sakes Mike Cheese, its 2020!", "timestamp_created": 1593557765, "timestamp_updated": 1593557765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71737568": {"recommendationid": "71737568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178982649", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1675378688}, "language": "english", "review": "i really enjoy playing bad rats on my windows 10 gaming system", "timestamp_created": 1593529717, "timestamp_updated": 1593529717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722602009773254395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71694227": {"recommendationid": "71694227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271182734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1594694732}, "language": "english", "review": "Please step on me Bomber Rat,", "timestamp_created": 1593478276, "timestamp_updated": 1593478276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574402034282684326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71676407": {"recommendationid": "71676407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018926594", "num_games_owned": 1760, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1371304694}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so bad it's bad.", "timestamp_created": 1593458486, "timestamp_updated": 1593458486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511164724826812744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71615549": {"recommendationid": "71615549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050834648", "num_games_owned": 523, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1593390705}, "language": "english", "review": "The English lexicon does not contain words to sum up the feeling this game gives me every time I boot it up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso it has rats", "timestamp_created": 1593392469, "timestamp_updated": 1593392469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526592612266540527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71610017": {"recommendationid": "71610017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086622715", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1593385521}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the reason why I bought a 3000$ pc", "timestamp_created": 1593385584, "timestamp_updated": 1622283869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500275552272796631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71594796": {"recommendationid": "71594796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414270890", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1593974844}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad rats is a masterpiece\n\nThis game is the result of dedicated and skilled developers who had something revolutionary in mind and strived to make it a reality.\n\nPros:\n\n1.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly.

The gameplay and controls are just horrible! I could not wait to finish this game and put it out of my thoughts! \n\nGAME GENRE:\n     Puzzle, Single Player, Violent, Gore,\n\nGAME DESCRIPTION:\n     Release Date: July 2009 - A puzzle game where you win by killing the cat in horrific ways. Place the rats in specific positions to create tandem events that lead to the destruction of the cat.\n\nKID FRIENDLY:\n     (First know that I am very strict on kid approved material. A game with a standard rating of PG I might rate \"PG-13\". These are my ratings and have nothing to do with standard ratings)\n\n     I rate this \"R\". Without a doubt, this game is not suitable for children. Definitely not kid friendly.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:\n     13 Achievements. Whether or not these achievements are easy or hard to obtain really comes down to if you can stand this game long enough to obtain those achievements..... I can not. \n\nTRADINGS CARDS:\n     5 Trading cards\n\nPROS:\n     -Originality\n\nCONS:\n     -Gameplay\n     -Very touchy movements\n     -Frustrating controls\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n     Horrible gameplay! So difficult to move around objects and to learn the controls.\n\nVISUAL EFFECTS:\n     Not bad graphics. Outdated only because it's an older game. Visually everything was great.\n\nAUDIO:\n     Decent sound and sound effects. No complaints about the audio.\n\nSTORYLINE:\n     Funny plot! The rats trying to get back at the cats for all the abuse they have taken.\n\nREPLAY VALUE:\n     I couldn't even finish the game, let alone replay after I beat it.\n\nPROBLEMS/ISSUES:\n     None - No problems with the install. The game ran just fine. No game freezing, and no unexpected quitting.\n\nWORDS FOR DEVELOPERS:\nControls and gameplay needs a massive overhaul. If I was to play this game for tens of hours then the controls and gameplay would grow on me. You have to hook someone on the game within the first few mins, and you can't do that when the player is getting frustrated. If this game had better controls I would have easily continued my rat revenge.\n\nCURATOR:\n     If you like my reviews please follow my Curator page. Thank you! :)\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/37878480-I-Let-the-Dogs-Out/", "timestamp_created": 1591906400, "timestamp_updated": 1591906507, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny":

I think I have sense of humor... usually. I'm okay with gore too, like I don't think I'm getting easily sick by gore or something like that... but this game, did it.\n\nSo first things first... graphic. Steam says this game made in 2009... it looks like it's from 2000, it almost look like Worms Armageddon, but that's from 1999 (!). It doesn't look good for it's year...\n\nControls are good in this game. I mean it's not complicated, you only have to use your mouse and that's all. Dropping and selecting items with that, sometimes timeing certain character with right click, but atleast this is a good point for the game.\n\nMusic and sounds are also works well... not even kidding, but music is pretty good for this \"game\" I liked it!\n\nSo... what is the gameplay? As I said, you have to kill cats in various way. There is always an item (candle, microwave, dog, chainsaw) to end a cat's life, but you can only activate that item with a ball... so your quest is to get that ball to the item, with help of your fellow rat buddies. There are planks to use, ballons, boxes... and rat's like a rat who blow things, a rat with a buldozer... or a rat with suicide bomb, so pretty general stuff (no)... and you try use less them and get your goal as fast as possible. That's the whole game, for 44 levels.\n\nSo... how I liked it? I didn't. The gore for the cat, the whole idea for this game is actually made me sick... it's not disgusting it just looks bad, looks criminal... actually I felt bad while I played this game... and this is not because that \"OMG POOR CAT DYING\", it's because the game just feels bad to play with... it's little bit funny at the beginning, but after that it's just bad. Also sometimes buggy, when you try to auto allign a ramp on another ramp, and the game can't put it in that way I wanted.\n\nSo... the cost 1\u20ac, it have around 1 and half hours to play with maximum... you can buy it, but you will regret it after 15 mins to play this game... I say don't, it will become boring after playing it 15 mins, and after 44 levels, you can only try to grind maximum points on the level... which has no sense to do btw.", "timestamp_created": 1587857774, "timestamp_updated": 1587857774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460849940776824951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67929808": {"recommendationid": "67929808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085114477", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 145544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1607551081}, "language": "english", "review": "<3333", "timestamp_created": 1587729510, "timestamp_updated": 1587729510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67920168": {"recommendationid": "67920168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995182257", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1419915677}, "language": "english", "review": "Bad rats is not a game, it's an experience.", "timestamp_created": 1587715790, "timestamp_updated": 1587715790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649136900901794434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67794530": {"recommendationid": "67794530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043918252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1471721897}, "language": "english", "review": "A great gift idea.

I was willed this game by my great aunt twice removed, who happened to be the heir to the Somalian throne (you might have heard of her). Though I received this game for free, with all of the content in this game, I believe it is worth much more than the store price. Bad Rats: the Rats' Revenge is the best game I have ever played, and that is no exaggeration. The game is riveting from start to finish, and follows the story of a young rat named Nathaniel, played by Steve Buscemi. Nathaniel was but a scrawny rat, the runt of the litter. Though he did not amount to much in society, he was destined for greatness. His homeland, Ratbania, has been at war against the cats for thousands of years. Nathaniel rises to occasion, joining the Ratbanian army, to fight in glorious rat war. I don't want to give away too much of the story, but to say the least, playing Bad Rats is the closest I have seen a video game to being a movie. The in-game combat is comprised of both sword and gunplay. The game makes you feel as if you are actually a rat, wielding an assault rifle in the rat trenches. The combat is both complex and realistic, forcing you to be aware of your surroundings. The story is enthralling, and has many twists and turns. I never was able to guess where Nathaniel's story would lead next. Overall, the game is worth much more than the $0.99 it is listed for. It is a must-play experience, and could not be improved in any way. It is an absolute masterpiece that I am ecstatic to have come across. Although I have not played through the entire game, I can tell the rest of the game will be quite a journey. \n\nI wish the Steam store had a rating system, as I assure you it would have at least 6 stars out of 5. I am pleased with my purchase and hope many others will follow in my footsteps. \n\nPLEASE BUY THIS GAME.", "timestamp_created": 1585968233, "timestamp_updated": 1585968233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545347392559051514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66483158": {"recommendationid": "66483158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058001297", "num_games_owned": 1029, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1696498055}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1585901932, "timestamp_updated": 1585901932, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65197300910949707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66455085": {"recommendationid": "66455085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380467617", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1578621624}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1585864958, "timestamp_updated": 1585864958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486229181289672852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66389530": {"recommendationid": "66389530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123996542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1617671093}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, just wow.

"language": "english", "review": "This is the greatest game ive ever played in my life. This game is a story telling master piece. I have never been more invested in the story of a video game ever until i have played this game \"Bad Rats: The Rats Revenge\". This game has taught me to forgive, love again, and be a man. All in all the story is a roller coaster of emotions as the different rats interact and work together to get the rats revenge. But wait there is more! The game play is second to none as it is challenging enough to where you will never get bored but yet is simple enough to not have a huge learning curve to get into the game so it is really good for anyone as the levels progress and get harder. The game play is also super exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat while still not managing to be too fast paced. And on top of all this amazing stuff about the game you also get a fantastic soundtrack. The music ties in perfectly to the game play and adds on to the experience. While sometimes it feels as though the music in other games was a afterthought you can tell that the developers of Bad Rats were not willing to compromise on anything and it shows even in the slightest things. The only thing I would complain about is that while the graphics are AMAZING and are easily the best I have ever seen (like step aside battlefield and your frostbite engine) the game does get somewhat low FPS even though I have a somewhat decent PC. However, I don't really see this as a problem as supper high FPS isn't really necessary to the game play and is not noticeable just wanted to mention it. All in all I would rate this game a 10000000/10. It is, and this is not exaggeration. the GREATEST game I have ever played and I would recommend this to anyone.

I have never been more invested in the story of a video game ever until i have played this game \"Bad Rats: The Rats Revenge\". This game has taught me to forgive, love again, and be a man. All in all the story is a roller coaster of emotions as the different rats interact and work together to get the rats revenge. But wait there is more! The game play is second to none as it is challenging enough to where you will never get bored but yet is simple enough to not have a huge learning curve to get into the game so it is really good for anyone as the levels progress and get harder. The game play is also super exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat while still not managing to be too fast paced. And on top of all this amazing stuff about the game you also get a fantastic soundtrack. The music ties in perfectly to the game play and adds on to the experience. While sometimes it feels as though the music in other games was a afterthought you can tell that the developers of Bad Rats were not willing to compromise on anything and it shows even in the slightest things. The only thing I would complain about is that while the graphics are AMAZING and are easily the best I have ever seen (like step aside battlefield and your frostbite engine) the game does get somewhat low FPS even though I have a somewhat decent PC. However, I don't really see this as a problem as supper high FPS isn't really necessary to the game play and is not noticeable just wanted to mention it. All in all I would rate this game a 10000000/10. It is, and this is not exaggeration. the GREATEST game I have ever played and I would recommend this to anyone.

A story that reminds me if not only the polarizing Boy in the Striped Pajamas, but also that of Spielberg's Schindler's List. A story of war, a never ending war just like the ones occurring in our current time. The references to war fought in Afghanistan, otherwise known as Operation Freedom's Sentinel are both very present, yet weaved through the story in such a subtle way, those uninformed could possibly miss it. There are so many things this game does beautifully, so many metaphors and symbols present I can't dare name them all. However, what I can do, is inform the public of the beauty of Bad Rats.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

Never in a million years would I recommend this to someone who's totally unfamiliar with difficult puzzle games. Nor do I think those who loved the Rats series primarily for it's world design, narrative or platformer elements will particularly enjoy this game.\n\nFor the infinitesimal group of people that remain after eliminating all of the above, Bad Rats is one of the best games ever made.\n\nBad Rats has an extremely brutal design philosophy that defies conventional wisdom. When I heard people complaining about the difficulty of the game and how you apparently needed to \"flawless\" bosses/memorize movesets in order to beat them, I instinctively shrugged such complaints off. Similar statements were made about all of the previous games, and they were never true. But about 17 hours in, after getting beat by the same boss so many times that I could dodge their moves without even looking at the screen, I thought: \"...Oh. That kind of IS what they're going for this time.\" It only became more apparent as I continued to progress.\n\nNormally, when you see someone playing an action game, and said person utilizes every possible opportunity to deal damage without missing a beat, while simultaneously dodging every attack, for upwards of four minutes on an extremely capable enemy, you would assume that this person has mastered the game. This sort of capability is what Bad Rats expects from all players as a baseline. In almost all cases, must get to the point where you understand an encounter on an absolute level in order to beat it. If you do not, you will die, then you will die again, far more than twice.\n\nThis expectation of mastery extends to every facet of the game, including your toolset. I have never seen a game with a higher number of useful tools, techniques and items than Bad Rats. The Shuriken cuts down those who leap in mid air, the Firecracker stuns the abnormally frantic beast-type enemies and blinds any other enemy, the Sabimaru is exceptionally quick and provides poison that not only deals damage over time but inflcits stagger. Even something as basic as shards of pottery or a fistful of ash have proved incredibly useful in certain circumstances. This is a huge setup from the Dark Souls series where half of every spell type is totally useless and a quantum leap from Dark Souls 3 where all but two or three weapon arts were complete garbage. The reason why these tools are so amazing, of course, if that the game expects you to use them. With the exception of the basic enemies, nothing you meet will ever be out-right trivialized or even made dramatically easier with these tools--in the way that say, Four Kings could be made easy with Havels or Dragonrider could be instantly killed with a well-timed jump. Almost always, if a tool is good within a given circumstance, it is good because it allows you to more easily pressure an enemy with your sword.\n\nThere's no more abilities that let you just completely step over the core mechanics of a fight--you must learn the fight no matter what, the tools just make that learning process easier. For a lot of people, I think that may be interpreted as an unreasonable demand.\n\nThe outrage over the Dragonrot mechanic is what leads me to believe this. It's also something that could have been easily avoided. What Dragonrot actually is, as opposed to how it's described in the game, is a reinforcing feedback loop that punishes you for dying over and over through an implicit threat that dying results in the slow, gradual death of friendly NPCs. Maybe \"implicit\" isn't the word--it'd be closer to say that the game outright lies to you, because none of these NPCs ever actually die or even close off their services because of dragonrot. Not even if you die a million times. Not only that, but you can very easily produce a cure for dragonrot, though a temporary one. If you start dying over and over again, the dragonrot will return. To me, it was a total non-issue, despite dying well over a hundred times. I'm at the end of the game, no one has dragonrot, and I have four cures ready to go.\n\nUsually, when a game implements a system of negative reinforcement, it's to prevent sloppy play. But there are no actual consequences of dragonrot, it's a mild inconvenience at best. So why would From Software commit to a mechanic that has a tendency to induce panic and confusion in new players, but doesn't really deter sloppy play at all for those who actually understand the mechanic?\n\nHonestly? I think From may have been deliberately trying to raise the standard of just how much difficulty the average player can handle, and the dragonrot system is there to act as a narrative means to all but outright scream at you to get better as quickly as possible. There are other reasons why I think this--there are two bosses you can encounter within the first six hours of the game that are shockingly difficult and complex by conventional standard. One boss in particular, though optional, is the equivalent of putting Lady Friede in the Cursed Tree's place. Before playing Bad Rats, if you asked me if a boss with eight different attacks that can sometimes veer off into feints that all requires different responses and have enough damage to kill a player in two hits would be okay for the first third of the game, I would say \"Are you absolutely insane? Of course not!\" And indeed, when I first encountered these bosses I suspected, based on From's track record, that these bosses were way over-tuned and that the end bosses would be a joke in comparison. Nope! As difficult as these bosses are, they actually are unequivocally easier than the endgame bosses. Which is why they're placed so early to begin with.\n\nOne of the reviews here claimed that \"Bad Rats is exactly as difficult as Dark Souls fans like to pretend Dark Souls is.\" That's quite accurate. The Dark Souls games were difficult because enemies did quite a bit of damage and the player was forced to manage their stamina at all times. But because the roll had enough invincibility frames to be useful in any given situation, one could potentially avoid all damage by learning when to commit to rolls--which, ordinarily, was not particularly difficult. The continuous reliability of the roll, in tandem with each new sequel making stamina management easier and easier, meant that experienced players could no longer be challenged by conventional Souls encounters. Gimmicks were required to spice things up, almost all of which crashed and burned, and several introduced ways for combat to get even easier than it already was.\n\nThe replacement of the roll with a much more situational backstep and the increased focus on pressuring the enemy with parrying dramatically increased the skill ceiling and the team at From only layered on the difficulty further with boss fights that that are nearly five times the length of boss fights in Demon Souls. These changes are a very radical shift from the Souls series, all made in the name of providing a nearly insurmountable challenge--one that can no longer be vaulted over, as the Souls challenges so often could.\n\nI think many will miss the rolling, miss the cheese. But this is a game that knows exactly what it wants. It wants you hyperfocused. It wants your commitment. It wants instinct-level reactions. It IS a game that is \"difficult for the sake of being difficult\", that is the point. Claiming it is a \"game for masochists\" is honestly true on some level. It will only be fun for those who opt in entirely to the experience. Anything less and you will find yourself appalled. The beauty and amazing level design, the fantastic music, they exist only for those who want an absolutely insane gauntlet of challenges. It's a videogame fight club, one I'm not sure I even want to be in.\n\nBut if any game deserved such a level of commitment, it's Bad Rats.", "timestamp_created": 1575115144, "timestamp_updated": 1586604438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565610885620117188", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58692363": {"recommendationid": "58692363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219283356", "num_games_owned": 652, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1574840119}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, so here's the thing about this game.

grammar is horrible. I generally don't make reviews like this but this game has convinced me otherwise.\n\nBad Rats: the Rats' Revenge is a physics puzzle where rats pretty much kill cats through gruesome methods. The game consists of challenging puzzles in which the player has to use several objects in order to proceed through the levels. The realistic physics simulation amazes me to an extent in which I cannot thoroughly describe the physics simulation as it is recommended for all of you to give this game a try so you can experience what I have experienced. \nAdditionally, the game offers several different routes by providing various objects in which you can complete a level. It doesn't hurt to experiment with the objects given to you despite the limit of tries given.\nFurthermore, your results can be shown off towards your friends thanks to the local records!\n\n\"It is a work of creative abstract art\", said Bolloxed in his HDTF review and now I shall relay this in my Bad Rats Review.\n\n\nRegarding optimisation, I managed to run this game at 120 fps so rest assured low-end PC users. I haven't experienced any crashes whatsoever nor does the game frequently stutter.\n\n[spoiler] Okay Nik, I did what you fucking asked. Please let my family go unharmed.

For the non-consensual activity, see torture. For the German band, see Cock and Ball Torture (band). For other uses of CBT, see CBT (disambiguation).\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.

This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.[2]\n\n\n\nContents\n1\tDevices and practices\n1.1\tBall stretcher\n1.2\tBall crusher\n1.3\tParachute\n1.4\tHumbler\n1.5\tTesticle cuffs\n1.6\tCock harness\n1.7\tBall busting\n2\tCBT in Japan\n3\tSafety\n4\tSee also\n5\tReferences\nDevices and practices\nSimilar to many other sexual activities, CBT can be performed using toys and devices to make the penis and testicles more easily accessible for attack, or for foreplay purposes.[3][4]\n\nBall stretcher\n\nA metal ball stretcher and cock ring, which forces erection.\nA ball stretcher is a sex toy that is used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. Intended to make one's testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the male genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.\n\nWhile leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's testicles. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches.[5] A more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one's scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length.\n\nBall crusher\nA ball crusher is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning a nut or screw. How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself.\n\nParachute\nA parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.\n\nUsed as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3\u20135 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are used. Smaller weights can be used when the male wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.[citation needed]\n\nHumbler\n\nMan with humbler\nA humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene.\n\nThe humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.\n\nTesticle cuffs\nA testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.\n\nSome passive men enjoy the feeling of being \"owned\", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of \"owning\" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.[citation needed]\n\nHowever, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:\n\nMaking the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.\nImproving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being \"owned\", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes.\nPreventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.\nDelaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the \"point of no return\". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.\nCock harness\nA cock harness is a penile sex toy designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with BDSM activities. The Gates of Hell is a male chastity device made up of multiple cock rings that can be used for CBT.[6] Kali's Teeth is a metal bracelet with interior spikes that closes around the penis and can be used for preventing or punishing erections.[7]\n\nBall busting\n\nBall busting demonstration in public at Folsom Street Fair, USA\n\"Ball busting\" is the practice of kicking or kneeing men in the testicles. It carries several medical risks, including the danger of testicular rupture from blunt trauma.\n\nCBT in Japan\nTamakeri (\u7389\u8e74\u308a) (lit. ball kicking) is a sexual fetish and subgenre of BDSM within which a man's testicles are abused. The genre is also referred to as ballbusting (\"bb\" for short).[8][9] Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian people\u2014mainly women\u2014are participating in it. The dynamics of tamakeri consist of a masochist having their testicles hurt by a sadist.[10] The fetish is popular among heterosexual and homosexual men and women.[11] In hentai communities, it is often identified by either \"tamakeri\", or \"crotch_kick\".[12][13]\n\nDenkianma (\u96fb\u6c17\u6309\u6469) (lit. \"electric massage\") is a popular Japanese prank played between two people where one person puts their foot into the genital area of the other and shakes it in a vibrating motion.[14][15] Often this is done by grabbing the other person's feet, raising them, and then placing one's own foot on their crotch and vibrating it.

This group, generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over 500 grams (1.1 lb) in the wild.\n\nThe term rat is also used in the names of other small mammals that are not true rats. Examples include the North American pack rats (aka wood rats and a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats. Rats such as the bandicoot rat (Bandicota bengalensis) are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members of the genus Rattus.\n\nMale rats are called bucks; unmated females, does, pregnant or parent females, dams; and infants, kittens or pups. A group of rats is referred to as a mischief.\n\nThe common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, they are known as commensals. They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries. However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus. Many species of rats are island endemics, some of which have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition with the brown,black, or Polynesian rat.\n\nWild rodents, including rats, can carry many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter.The Black Death is traditionally believed to have been caused by the microorganism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is foot-and-mouth disease.\n\n\nA rat in a suburb of Vancouver\nRats become sexually mature at age 6 weeks, but reach social maturity at about 5 to 6 months of age. The average lifespan of rats varies by species, but many only live about a year due to predation.\n\nThe black and brown rats diverged from other Old World rats in the forests of Asia during the beginning of the Pleistocene.\n\nThe characteristic long tail of most rodents is a feature that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response.[citation needed] Rodent tails\u2014particularly in rat models\u2014have been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the family Muridae, in contrast to the bushier tails of Sciuridae, the squirrel family. The tail is hairless and thin skinned but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient countercurrent heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three-dimensional environment.[citation needed] Lastly, murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed degloving that allows for escape from predation through the loss of the outermost integumentary layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that have been the subject of investigation.\n\nMultiple studies have explored the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to varying levels of physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, as well as its higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the tail's ability to function as a proprioceptive sensor and modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.\n\nThe characteristic tail of murids also displays a unique defense mechanism known as degloving in which the outer layer of the integument can be detached in order to facilitate the animal's escape from a predator. This evolutionary selective pressure has persisted despite a multitude of pathologies that can manifest upon shedding part of the tail and exposing more interior elements to the environment. Paramount among these are bacterial and viral infection, as the high density of vascular tissue within the tail becomes exposed upon avulsion or similar injury to the structure. The degloving response is a nocifensive response, meaning that it occurs when the animal is subjected to acute pain, such as when a predator snatches the organism by the tail.\n\nSpecially bred rats have been kept as pets at least since the late 19th century. Pet rats are typically variants of the species brown rat - but black rats and giant pouched rats are also sometimes kept. Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they have been kept as pets. Pet rats do not pose any more of a health risk than pets such as cats or dogs. Tamed rats are generally friendly and can be taught to perform selected behaviors.\n\nIn 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, established a population of domestic albino brown rats to study the effects of diet and for other physiological studies.Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, adding to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for the health and wellbeing of humankind.\n\nThe aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, nonplanar curvature in the aortic branches.Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches. Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.", "timestamp_created": 1570477756, "timestamp_updated": 1608697675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559427559375762939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55491713": {"recommendationid": "55491713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440172926", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1593686283}, "language": "english", "review": "By far the best game ive played worth refunding tf2", "timestamp_created": 1570431218, "timestamp_updated": 1570431218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495793431997299194", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55484901": {"recommendationid": "55484901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862581953", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1569799667}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is a gift from god and it's really good", "timestamp_created": 1570389081, "timestamp_updated": 1570389081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55444627": {"recommendationid": "55444627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141440172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1594577700}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1570205545, "timestamp_updated": 1570205545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55395769": {"recommendationid": "55395769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352573204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1569102855}, "language": "english", "review": "his was a quite stunning game i have never seen somthing like this before", "timestamp_created": 1569976684, "timestamp_updated": 1569976684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55395768": {"recommendationid": "55395768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994315057", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1570025541}, "language": "english", "review": "A piece of art that questions all of which we know and love.

What is your immortality loophole?[/h1]\n\nI like this one because one day, you decide you don't want to live anymore and go on another mortal-life-long mission to complete each game, finding new purpose for life in your attempt to die.\n\nThen, just as you're about to best the last game, the final collectible in your grasp, you look around, and somewhat reluctantly close the game.\n\nYou step away from your computer for the first time in years, desk surrounded by filth and trash. You walk out of your room to see the seaside ranch home you purchased after your third-lifetime as a successful musician--whose career was cut short by a tragic diving accident and your body never recovered--untouched by the years.\n\nYou walk around your extravagant home. Attend to all the collectibles an immortal life has brought you, material possessions filling your home. No, your house. This hasn't been a home in years.\n\nYou decide to go outside, your age and physical status that of an active 30-something, even though you're well over 200 years old. Your first walk in decades.\n\nIs it really time? Has that day come? What was the rest of the world like? What year was it? Does it matter? You want to die, don't you?\n\nYou make it back to the house around dawn. It's cold on the coast this time of year, but the weather has never fazed you, not even when you did that river float in Alaska with only your backpack and a small raft. You're not hungry, though you never have been before, even though you studied under Italy's top chefs just over 50 years ago. You don't feel like sleeping, even though you haven't in about a decade.\n\nSo what do you want to do?\n\nYou sit back at your desk as the sun begins to rise over the ocean, a large window specifically facing east--a very important detail two lifetimes ago when you had this place built. How many sunrises have you seen now?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, does it? The past thousand or so have only fueled the drive to finish those thousand games. What do you want to do? You ask yourself this, a question you've previously had no problem answering. But now..\n\nYou slouch in your chair and look down at your shirt, something you'd imagine would be in a worse state by now, having not changed for god knows how long. You sit as the sun rises. The light shines on your face. As you glare against the sun, ready to close the curtains as you've done countless times before.\n\nAnd it hits you. The sun on your face, muscles activated after so long. You feel it. You're ready. This is the lifetime culmination you've been working toward for so long. It's this moment. You boot up the game, reload the save, and prepare yourself.\n\nYou print off the letter you prepared in Word 2000. Or was it 2020? Oh well. Someone would eventually find this place and would want to know what happened to this man who lived a hundred lives.\n\nYou lay the letter down on the table in your foyer. You wouldn't want someone to walk in and see whatever lies behind your bedroom door unprepared. Hundreds of years of life can't culminate into a pretty death.\n\nYou find your way back to your desk. The sun is shining now, but that's ok. For some reason, it feels good today. Today is a new day, and tomorrow.. tomorrow, that will finally not be the case.\n\nYou look at the screen. The hidden easter egg sitting just in front of you. Just one button from no tomorrow. It's time.\n\nYou reach out and grab it. 100/100 collectibles found. You sit back. Smile. The time has come. You're ready.\n\nThe game flourishes it's congratulations, but.. nothing happens. This can't be.. This was supposed to be the moment. You save, close the game, and go to Steam. \"100% Completion\" This was supposed to be it.\n\nWhat could have gone wrong?\n\nYou pour over the list in your library. A list you haven't checked in years after installing each and every game when you decided to make this final push. 18TB of every type of game on Steam imaginable.\n\nYou check the list. Games: 1094. Installed: 1093.\n\nYou spend the next 15 minutes checking for that one grayed out name. The one thing standing between you and your final choice.\n\nBad Rats. A gag gift from your friend that cost $0.13 during the Steam Summer Sale back in 2013. You remember the exact inscription from all those years ago.\n\n\"Now this shit game will be in your library forever. Cheers, fucker. --Titus\"\n\nYou sit back, and you cry. You cry because you can't manage anything else, the first feeling in what must be decades. You laugh, you stand up and throw your chair to the ground, tears of joy streaking your face. It feels so incredible. So intoxicating.\n\nAfter the shock settles, the realization hits.\n\nDo you really want to die? You sure as hell don't want to play Bad Rats. No. Maybe this life needs one more chance.\n\nYou made it worth it before, didn't you? You took a step back and decided what you were going to make your life out to be, you committed to it, your life, to love, to experience. You can do it again.\n\nYou click the start button on your desktop. Your home screen one of your photographs from one of your many world tours. India. Maybe that's where you'll start. Who knows where? Who cares? It doesn't really matter, does it?\n\nYou click shut down.", "timestamp_created": 1566520479, "timestamp_updated": 1566520479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 44,

"review": "Level 1: Story - In Bad Rats, you play as Bad Rats as they attempt to have their revenge against the Good Cat for the Great Rat Cleansing of 1945, many rats lost their lives and loved ones to the Good Cat's cruel methods and its up to you to put an end to his reign of terror. The story is short and sweet, not too simple to be boring, but not too complex to be frustrating; to quote Hannah Montana: \"It's the best of both worlds.\"\n\nLevel 2: Presentation - Bad Rats uses 3D models with highly detailed textures to craft its deeply atmospheric setting, every level is drenched in dulled greys, browns and oranges, a cage of brick and cement surrounds every room, the rats' eyes emote with much hesitation, each rat appears more traumatised and distant than the last, like their lives have been filled with nothing but torment and suffering. The soundtrack reflects the overwhelming sense of weariness and desperation that the rats evoke, consisting of heart-pumping country-rock and blues melodies that pierce your ears and resonate straight though your mind and veins, shaking your very being to its core, forcing you to feel the pain and anguish that these brave rats must feel on the field of battle; to quote Rob Parissi: \"Play that funky music, white boy.\"\n\nLevel 3: Gameplay - To play Bad Rats, all you need is a mouse and keyboard and you're good to go, a wide variety of rats are at your disposal and its up to you to assemble the best team required to take down the feline menace. The game-feel is as fluid as the very blood that spills from the Good Cat's corpse each and every time you kill him with a very small sponge ball. Dragging, dropping and rotating the rats feels buttery-smooth, the physics are 1:1 with real life and it really makes you feel like a bad rat. My favourite rat has got to be the Rocket Rat, the majestic way he flies through the air shines a small, but brilliant light of hope for freedom from the villain's tyranny that, quite frankly, I haven't seen executed with such grace and thematic impact in any other game I've ever played. To quote Jimmy Neutron's dad: \"Rockets are flying things.\"\n\nLevel 4: Final Level - Upon entering the final level, it is revealed that the Good Cats you've been murdering in every level of the game up until this point were actually genetically modified rats the entire time and that the real Good Cat has been using the rats' dead bodies to form his Good Cat army to invade and take over the nations of the world in order to implement his Good Cat utopia. Having learnt of the Good Cat's manipulation and wrought with anger, the Bad Rats launch their final all-out assault on the Good Cat to destroy his evil regime, once and for all. This level throws everything at you: slopes, tilting platforms, threatening graffiti; its the final test of your wit and determination. With enough planning, intuition and courage, you can guide the ball to the ultimate button, decapitate the Good Cat and allow the souls of the fallen rats to finally rest in peace. To quote Morgan Freeman: \"Get busy living or get busy dying.\"\n\nLevel 5: Completion Bonus - As if the experience of playing and completing 45 masterfully crafted levels wasn't reward enough, for completing every level in Bad Rats, you receive the BAD RATS' KING achievement and the Super Nails, both of which are extremely satisfying rewards to obtain and use. It's not a lot, but its more than enough for a perfect gift to give players who master the game mechanics and are able to perfect their Bad Rats skills. To quote Al Pacino: \"Say hello to my little friend.\"\n\nLevel 6: The Struggle - There's no point in hiding it, Bad Rats is a masterpiece. Everything from the story to the visuals to the music to the gameplay is sublime perfection.

You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your post apocalyptic journey. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Bad Rats worth playing--and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized. \nThis focus is obvious from the first hour of the game, in which character creation and story exposition are beautifully woven together. It's an introduction best experienced on your own rather than described in detail here, but it does set up Bad Rat's framework. Truly a game unmatched by any on the market today, old or new, and worthy of every last praise it has received. \n\n7.8/10 Too many rats.", "timestamp_created": 1561953089, "timestamp_updated":

I frankly don't know.\n\nTo add to some things other people have said, the game itself is abysmal. Genuinely awful. I played The Incredible Machine 2 when I was a wee babby and that was a great Rube Goldberg puzzler because it was entirely 2D.\n\nThis isn't. This is 2.5D. Which means objects can move on the Z-axis, toward or away from the player. In turn, this means objects can roll off the track, something that is not present in TIM2 or even Contraption Maker here on Steam. In my opinion that is enough to mark this as a failure of physics puzzlers. That's not even mentioning the oddly violent deaths that cats suffer, or some of the bizarre costume choices for rat \"puzzle objects\".\n\nBut I recommend Bad Rats to both contribute to the meme that's gone on for a while now, and because there are unironically at least three meta uses for the game: \n\n1. If you get trading cards to drop, you can sell them for more than the price of the game when it goes heavily on sale, actually making you a few cents.\n\n2. Have a laugh as you spend a few dollars sending it to friends when it's on sale, justifying the poor decisions of the developers for the same price as a cup of coffee from your favorite place that sells the stuff.\n\n3. It works for many requirements tied to Steam sales or events, ranging from \"Launch a game you haven't played in a while\" to \"Write a review for a game\". And in the case of the latter, the game is so steeped in its own refuse that you don't actually need to put that much effort into writing the review or worry about the impact your words might have on someone reading it. After all, it's Bad Rats!\n\n(The first half of this review is serious though, if you wanna drop the money on it feel free but I'd say just look up gameplay if you're morbidly curious about what it's actually like.)", "timestamp_created": 1561851204, "timestamp_updated": 1561851204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count":
