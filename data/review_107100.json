Controlamos a un personaje denominado simplemente como Kid (chaval) por un narrador que crea e hilvana la historia conforme la cuenta. Al principio simplemente nos levantamos de una cama con el objetivo de ir al Basti\u00f3n que da nombre al t\u00edtulo, donde los supervivientes de El Gran Desastre han acordado reunirse al primer indicio de problemas. Mediante algunos di\u00e1logos, textos y sue\u00f1os se ver\u00e1 que hay mucho m\u00e1s, sobre el protagonista, el mundo que nos rodea y el pasado que lo dej\u00f3 todo sumido en el desconsuelo. Es un planteamiento original y muy interesante.\n\nEl t\u00edtulo es un juego de rol de acci\u00f3n con acceso a varias armas (cuerpo a cuerpo y a distancia) que podremos mejorar, habilidades activas y licores que act\u00faan como habilidades pasivas; todo visto desde una c\u00e1mara con perspectiva isom\u00e9trica sobre la que no tendremos control. El combate es simple debido a la limitada forma de atacar pero cada arma consigue transmitir una sensaci\u00f3n tan distinta que, una vez encontrada la combinaci\u00f3n que nos resulte m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda para cada situaci\u00f3n (podremos usar dos armas a la vez) se siente especialmente bien y en ning\u00fan momento se nos har\u00e1 pesado. El desarrollo est\u00e1 basado en niveles (historia y desaf\u00edos de armas) de simple dise\u00f1o pero muy detallados que los hace sentir plenamente diferenciados. El Basti\u00f3n act\u00faa como base central a la que volveremos al terminar cada nivel y que podremos expandir (con un m\u00e1ximo de seis estructuras) para acomodar a los supervivientes que encontremos durante la aventura. Al avanzar tambi\u00e9n tendremos acceso a [i]Qui\u00e9n Sabe D\u00f3nde[/i], una serie de desaf\u00edos on\u00edricos (podr\u00edamos llamar) basados en oleadas de enemigos donde se expande la historia de los personajes. El juego tiene soporte para mando que, debido a la vista isom\u00e9trica, resulta mucho m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo de controlar.\n\nCon unos gr\u00e1ficos a base de hermosos dibujos hechos a mano en alta resoluci\u00f3n, el juego se asegura que, sin importar el tiempo que pase, siempre se ver\u00e1 bien. B\u00e1sicamente hay una \u00fanica voz (en ingl\u00e9s) en el juego, la del narrador, excelentemente puesta por Logan Cunningham y con textos en castellano. La banda sonora tiene muchos toques del viejo oeste americano, donde los instrumentos de cuerda toman el principal inter\u00e9s y junto con otros ritmos m\u00e1s fuertes ocasionales le dan una identidad propia; sonoramente est\u00e1 a un gran nivel.\n\nEl juego tiene una duraci\u00f3n aproximada de 6-8 horas para la trama principal, si decidimos completar los desaf\u00edos de armas, los sue\u00f1os de Qui\u00e9n Sabe D\u00f3nde y mejorar todo al m\u00e1ximo, podr\u00edamos sumar otras 5 o 6 m\u00e1s. Una vez terminado tendremos acceso a una [i]nueva partida +[/i], un nuevo desaf\u00edo llamado [i]El Sue\u00f1o del Extranjero[/i] bastante m\u00e1s complicado que cualquier cosa que el juego te haya impuesto antes y poder comenzar una nueva partida en dos modos distintos: ataque con puntos y sin sufrimiento; el primero te punt\u00faa por eficacia y el segundo es el modo f\u00e1cil del juego.\n\nCon una forma muy particular de contar una historia, un gran apartado art\u00edstico y sonoro y un combate simple pero satisfactorio debido a las distintas combinaciones de armas, [b]Bastion[/b] es un t\u00edtulo muy recomendado para cualquiera.", "timestamp_created": 1700213594, "timestamp_updated": 1700213594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560925781726837158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150229298": {"recommendationid": "150229298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071112009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 357, "last_played": 1484337407}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1700151044, "timestamp_updated": 1700151044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150206969": {"recommendationid": "150206969", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997314049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 532, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1700112457}, "language": "english", "review": "This game needs a sequel or expansion.

Of course, it's still a wonderful, mournful work of art. And it's still fun if you're not looking for something to sink your teeth into. But after Hades, if you were thinking of coming back for the score attack, it's really rough...\n\nBasically everything in this game points to playing keepaway, kiting enemies, hiding behind cover. Enemies boil down to ones that chase you vs ones that snipe you, with only superficial differences. This means similar things apply to the weapons, which feel like you're simply choosing between different control schemes for skirmishing and sniping, rather than an actually different playstyle. Plus the autoaim behaves in frustrating ways, especially if you're trying to block/parry.\n\nAnd activating any idols only exacerbates it all, and really cuts down on the viable weapons. You have to take the highest power single-hits you can find, and some melee weapons leave you too vulnerable (largely because they have unusably small hitboxes). Finally, most Skills i tried are just too low impact or leave you too vulnerable to matter, and without a training dummy it's not worth the tedium of sitting through loading screens to test the myriad of them out.\n\nIt all rounds out to pretty samey gameplay that, even though I got all the achievements without too much trouble, and I miss some of the weapons, I don't personally like enough to try harder to improve at in score attack. You really get to appreciate why Hades has back-attacks, a dash instead of a block, the bloodstone system for ranged attacks, a revised difficulty system, more complex enemies, and so on.", "timestamp_created": 1699943108, "timestamp_updated": 1699943796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150096438": {"recommendationid": "150096438", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970742779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1099, "last_played": 1675400930}, "language": "english", "review": "The first of supergiant's masterpieces and probably one of my favorite games of all time.

All of the games the independent developer released over time have been hits with critics and players alike: [i]Bastion[/i] (2011, [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/bastion/]MC: 86[/url]), [i]Transistor[/i] (2014, [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/transistor/]MC: 83[/url]), [i]Pyre[/i] (2017, [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pyre/]MC: 85[/url]) and finally [i]Hades[/i] (2020, [url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/hades/]MC: 93[/url]), their most recent game and the first one to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/]receive a sequel[/url].\n\nBased on this alone, it should come at no surprise that even their first game, [i]Bastion[/i], is definitely worth its money \u2013 mostly thanks to its excellent presentation. It features music by the fantastic Darren Korb, offers a superb dynamic narration by the Logan Cunningham and looks great thanks to an excellent art-style and -direction. Even those who might end up not buying/playing the game, should consider giving \u201cZia\u2019s Theme (Build That Wall)\u201d [url=https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/5DutiJxznQmcV5a5a1zfRW?si=6b41b2d6353345b8]a listen[/url] at least \u2013 it\u2019s worth it.\n\nThe gameplay of [i]Bastion[/i] on the other hand consists of basic action role-playing combat. Protagonist \u201cThe Kid\u201d can carry two different (melee & ranged) weapons and use one special attack to get rid of various enemies, more weapons and \u201csecret skills\u201d to equip unlock over the course of the story. Weapons can be upgraded once the required materials are obtained, although you\u2019ll have to choose between two different options per upgrade stage (non-permanently, as choices can be changed later). If you want to delve deeper into the gameplay, there\u2019s not only a score attack mode but also New Game+, various challenges and a totem system, the latter of which allows you to raise the difficulty of the game through various options in exchange for higher rewards. For all you achievement hunters out there: Yes, completing certain challenges while having a certain amount of totems active is required for various achievements. Thankfully, as you can individually choose to (de)activate totems, you can set the difficulty of the game just as you want it, from casual to hardcore.\n\nThe weapons play quite differently, so there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll find one you like \u2013 or one you hate. Unfortunately [i]Bastion[/i] forces you to use certain weapons during some parts of the game and while they can be switched out later on, I would\u2019ve preferred choosing between keeping my old weapon equipped and trying out the new ones. Another small problem concerns ranged weapons: Thanks to the isometric perspective of the game combined with height differences of the maps, you might sometimes find out that your shots won\u2019t hit their intended target but are instead blocked off by the environment.\n\nAs an action role-playing game, [i]Bastion[/i] is mostly about a constant flow of enemies you\u2019re getting rid off while traveling to various levels chosen from a map. Some of the levels are about progressing the story while others are \u201cweapon challenges\u201d, which require you to fulfill certain tasks with a specific weapon (e.g. hitting targets with your bow, the less arrows you need the better the reward) but they can easily be ignored if you\u2019re just going for a story playthrough. The combat itself is just what you expect: There are sixteen different enemy types to fight over the course of the game, using the genre-typical mix of attacks, ultimate attacks (called \u201csecret skills\u201d here), blocking and evading. It took me some time to adjust to the blocking and evading in [i]Bastion[/i] but it\u2019s not a particularly hard game (unless you want it to be).\n\nThe combat works fine, mostly thanks to the different weapon/secret skill combinations you can choose from, even if enemy sometimes get stuck on the environment. It\u2019s not groundbreaking but it\u2019s a well-refined offering of what\u2019s expected from the genre. I do wish that the story levels of [i]Bastion[/i] offered a little more than just constant enemy slaying, however. A little puzzle solving, or small platforming challenge (not just in the last level) would\u2019ve gone a long way to mix things up, even if the game definitely isn\u2019t outstaying it\u2019s welcome if you\u2019re just going for a story playthrough (which can admittedly be done in just about 4-5h). Even exploration is very limited thanks to the linear levels and mostly just a few dead ends that contain either upgrade materials \u2013 or just another health potion.\n\nAll of your actions in the game are accompanied by the previously mentioned dynamic narration by Logan Cunningham. It\u2019s very immersive to hear the narrator react to your actions (e.g. your equipment or which path you\u2019re taking first), although the mostly linear story levels make sure that the narration isn\u2019t too dynamic after all. Speaking of tory: The vast majority of [i]Bastion[/i]\u2019s plot is conveyed through this narration, which might not appeal to everyone. It also isn\u2019t the most exciting or memorable tale, thanks to underdeveloped characters and a plot that\u2019s mostly just there to tell you where to head next. It does offer enough unique worldbuilding and twists to not leave a negative impression however, it\u2019s just not interesting enough to warrant a playthrough on its own if it wasn\u2019t elevated by the excellent presentation.\n\nIf you just want to play through [i]Bastion[/i] once for the story, you\u2019re looking at one afternoon as it should take about 4-5h of playtime to do so. Thanks to the aforementioned various optional content, ranging from weapon challenges to the score attack mode, you can spend a lot more time with the game, however. Additionally, if you play through the story once you\u2019re only able to see one of the [spoiler]two possible[/spoiler] endings, so a New Game+ playthrough might be in order if you want to see it all. \n\nLastly, I\u2019ll need to talk about the technical state of [i]Bastion[/i]. While resolutions of up to 4K are supported, the in-game settings only allow you to choose a 1080p resolution at max. See the [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Bastion#Video]PcGamingWiki[/url] for a workaround. Additionally, the V-Sync option in the game still lead to screen tearing on my end for some reason, which is why I chose to disable it and enable V-Sync through Nvidia instead. I also have to mention that the German translation, while faithful to the English original, was not implemented well, as various loading screen tips were not fit properly and got cut off for example.\n\nStill, even with a few flaws present, [i]Bastion[/i] is still a great game even a decade later. It\u2019s no wonder it managed to start off the Supergiant Games success story and while it\u2019s not my favorite of the bunch (that would be [i]Transistor[/i]), it already showed off just how good the independent studio is at creating games. Combine this with the low asking price and [i]Bastion[/i] is definitely worth a look for anyone searching for a well-executed indie action role-playing game with an excellent presentation.",

I made up my mind to finish the story, and that's exactly what I did tonight.\n\nI was initially concerned about forgetting crucial details, but it all came rushing back to me about an hour into the game.

I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying 'cause I lack multi-tasking, so I missed a lot of details. However, maybe now, on my new game plus playthrough where I can basically one-shot everyone, I'll be able to focus more on the narration.\n\n[b] Update: Regarding the story(telling) my sentiment hasn't changed that much.

It is the place where other games seem to have started and taken inspiration, and from which Hades, the developers behind Bastion, also drew inspiration.\nIt's a linear action game where you get to dodge, use a different variety of weapons, and obtain upgrades to overcome each challenge. Weapons are abundant and vastly different from one another, each with a large array of abilities.\nIdols are also an addition to this game, offering you the ability to gather more spirits, which serve as your currency but also provide a great challenge in combat.\nAdditionally, you'll have challenges for each weapon you use to strengthen your skills and improve your reaction time in combat.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3047089592\n \n[h3] \ud83d\ude04 Fun: [/h3]\n\nIt's a challenging game with peculiar platforming moments, yet it's not a bad one by any means. The story is captivating and interesting, keeping you intrigued for the most part. \n \n[h3] \ud83c\udfde Visuals & Presentation: [/h3]  \n  \nPersonally, I found the art style to be somewhat harsh on the eyes. It's challenging to appreciate what's happening in the world, as everything seems rather randomly generated by these platforms and cubes. I didn't enjoy it much, and it was often quite difficult to see where you were stepping because of it. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3047956925\n \n[h3] \ud83d\udd0a Sound & Voice-Acting: [/h3]  \n \nThe quality of both the music and narration in this game is exceptional. I found great enjoyment in the storytelling as it was presented through the perspective of Rucks. \n  \n[h3] \ud83d\udcd6 Story & Writing: [/h3]  \n\nIn Bastion, the story revolves around the character known as the Kid, who finds himself in a world torn apart by a catastrophic event referred to as the Calamity. As the player progresses through the game, the Kid's primary objective is to collect special shards of rock scattered throughout the world.\nThese rock shards play a crucial role in powering the Bastion, a central structure within the game. The Bastion serves as a place of refuge and hope in the midst of the post-apocalyptic chaos. As the Kid gathers these shards, the Bastion gradually becomes more powerful and begins to rebuild the shattered world.\nThe narrative is rich and engaging, with the player unravelling the mysteries of the Calamity and the history of the world as they collect these crucial shards. The interplay between the Kid's journey and the gradual restoration of the Bastion creates a compelling storyline that keeps players invested in the game's world and characters. Bastion's narrative is an integral part of the gaming experience, immersing players in a unique and captivating post-apocalyptic setting.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3047056636\n \n[h3] \ud83e\uddf5 Length & Difficulty: [/h3]  \n  \nMain story is not too long, but challenging. If you wish to complete the game it will take you a lot of time and you will face many difficulties.\n\nIn order to fully explore the game you\u2019re required to start a new game plus, luckily you keep the upgrades and the spirits points you collected.\n\n[h3] \u2b55\ufe0fVerdict: [/h3]  \nBastion provides a captivating and challenging gaming experience with a unique narrative and a variety of weapons and upgrades. While some may find the art style visually challenging, the exceptional music and narration contribute to an engaging overall experience.\n\nAlthough not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, it offers a good experience and is a worthy candidate to try in your next adventures.", "timestamp_created": 1697312932, "timestamp_updated": 1699719555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656894981861114502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148178923": {"recommendationid": "148178923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099708528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1697259826}, "language": "english", "review": "Well  - that was nice.

The narration is really neat, and the way it reacts to what you do is really cool as well. The game has a really unique premise as well, and the ending is phenomenal.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun as well. The movement and dodging feels smooth and there lots of different weapons and abilities to use and play with. It's not too challenging for the most part, although there's idols you can activate to give you much more of a challenge if you're the kind of person who likes that. The game auto targeting enemies can be a bit frustrating when a new enemy appears and the game switches targets unexpectedly, causing you to miss or get hit, although this does get a bit better once you get used to it. The vast number of different weapons in the game also meant that I sometimes felt like I didn't have much time to use one before another weapon was thrust into my hands. These are both minor gripes though, and I had a fun time with the game overall.\n\nThe game ran very smoothly and I didn't encounter any bugs or performance issues on the Steam Deck, and the game looks great. The music is also fantastic and made the story and the overall experience even better (the end credits song is beautiful).\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] This top-down action game has a very unique and interesting story with fantastic narration, great gameplay, good stability, outstanding visuals and music, and ran perfectly on the Steam Deck.

Developed by Supergiant Games and released in 2011, Bastion stands as a timeless example of how a small indie studio can create a truly remarkable gaming experience.\n\nFrom the moment you start playing Bastion, you're immediately struck by its stunning visual design. The game's hand-painted, vibrant world is a marvel to behold, with each environment meticulously crafted to create a unique and captivating atmosphere. The world literally forms beneath your feet as you move, adding a dynamic element to the already beautiful landscapes.\n\nThe game's soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is a perfect accompaniment to the visuals. The music seamlessly blends with the on-screen action, setting the tone for each moment, whether it's a thrilling battle or a poignant story sequence. The narrator, voiced by Logan Cunningham, is a standout feature, providing dynamic commentary that responds to your actions, making the world feel more alive and immersive.\n\nBastion is an action role-playing game that excels in blending real-time combat with strategic depth. Players take control of \"The Kid,\" the game's protagonist, as he navigates through the shattered remnants of a once-vibrant world. The combat system is responsive and offers a variety of weapons that cater to different playstyles. Experimenting with different loadouts and strategies is a rewarding experience.\n\nThe most innovative aspect of Bastion's gameplay is the dynamic level design. The world literally assembles itself as you explore it, creating a sense of wonder and unpredictability. This unique feature keeps you engaged and adds an element of strategy as you choose which paths to take.\n\nHowever, the game's controls can feel a bit clunky at times, especially when using ranged weapons, and this may take some getting used to. Additionally, while the core gameplay is engaging, the overall challenge level is moderate, and some players may find it lacking in difficulty.\n\nWhat truly sets Bastion apart is its exceptional storytelling. The game's narrative unfolds through a captivating and emotionally charged story, narrated by Logan Cunningham's gravelly voice. The world of Bastion is filled with intriguing characters, each with their own unique background and motivations.\n\nAs you progress, you uncover the history of the world and its people, and your choices impact the outcome of the story. This dynamic storytelling approach makes every playthrough a fresh and personal experience. The narrative is deeply touching, exploring themes of loss, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions.\n\nBastion offers a good amount of replayability, thanks to its New Game Plus mode, which allows you to carry over your weapons and experience into a new playthrough. This feature encourages players to try different strategies and story choices, providing a reason to revisit the game multiple times.\n\nBastion is a masterpiece that combines beautiful visuals, a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, engaging gameplay, and a deep, emotionally resonant narrative. It's a game that transcends its medium, leaving a lasting impression on players. While it may not offer the most challenging gameplay, Bastion's storytelling prowess and artistic excellence make it a must-play for anyone who appreciates the art of video games.", "timestamp_created": 1695496116, "timestamp_updated": 1695496116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146876612": {"recommendationid": "146876612", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997334666", "num_games_owned": 1304, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1695711597}, "language": "english", "review": "12 years late, but yes, I recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1695492118, "timestamp_updated": 1695677925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146874295": {"recommendationid": "146874295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041379926", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1695489636}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game with relatively simple concepts but they're executed well.

I was excited to play it.\n\nFirst of all, I loved the narrator with his voice weaving through the story, intertwining with precise moments and actions, creating an immersive experience that gives life into the game's world. For a seemingly \"simple\" game, the depth of the lore attached to it was a pleasant surprise. The world felt alive and it kept me hooked. Very well complemented by the music, Darren Korb is back at it again with another banger score.\n\nI also loved the idea of the land that rejuvenates itself as you tread through it. The gradual restoration is a nice touch, guiding you along a linear path. It's a smart move, preventing potential monotony that could arise from this kind of linearity. Also, I think it was well-integrated with the lore.\n\nThe mechanics are quite simple, perhaps a bit too simple. The diverse arsenal of weapons offers a nice range of playstyles, but let's be honest, I often found myself just pressing forward and mashing that attack button (in normal mode at least). The ranged weapons are overpowered and kiting back enemies was a breeze, sometimes too much so. Blocking is essential but it sometimes targets the wrong enemy. Moreover, the pace of the game is slow, I think swifter movement would have added more spark.\n\nThe pattern of the story is quite repetitive. Go get a this and that and come back. There are some mild changes but towards the game's end, it began to feel repetitive. The game can be done in around 6 hours or even shorter if you skip weapons challenges or the dreams (although the latter add lore). However, I thought it felt just about right. Longer would have been a stretch, but the game neatly balances its duration.\n\nOverall Verdict: Bastion is indeed a great game. A cool concept, storytelling that hooks you, great music and gameplay that might lean towards simplicity but still manages to be enjoyable. It\u2019s a classic and I\u2019m glad I finally played it.

For a debut title, this is pretty damn good, but as you may expect it is not their best work.\nThe gameplay is the weakest aspect in my opinion. It's a fairly standard beat 'em up with some upgrades for you to peruse and some extra challenge awaiting dedicated in the form of New Game+. Not bad per se, but if you're only planning to do 1 playthrough like I did then it will get a bit bland without that extra challenge.\nDespite my criticism of the gameplay, that is where my negatives end. The story is incredibly well told, and the narrator is such a good addition that I sometimes add a similar concept when drafting up some games with my friends. The plot is good on it's own though; I liked the fact that this world basically brought its own demise amidst all of the fighting, it's super compelling stuff\nI will also commend the art and sound here. The environments are beautifully crafted, and each level has visual flair that feels one of a kind. The soundtrack adds to the desolate atmosphere a lot as well.\nBastion is a great game to kick off the Supergiant Library.

I imagine most people checking this game out in 2023 and beyond will have a similar reason for playing this. You either want to play all the games from this much praised studio, or checked it out after playing their more recent games.\n\nTheir current pedigree might set high expectations, but surprisingly enough, I think Bastion lives up to most of them. To start with the positives, everything that has to do with visuals, audio, and storytelling aged amazingly well. \n\nIt's a very aesthetically pleasing game. None of the individual designs are quite as distinct or inspired as their future games, but it comes together so nicely, especially thanks to the game's gimmick of building the levels as you go through them. The cartoony aestehtic with exaggerated proportions and super-deformed characters also gave the titular Bastion quite a cozy feel once you build it up.\n\nMusic is by far the strongest point. There's a lot of it and it's consistently great. Chances are, you probably heard some of these tracks as background music for random game related videos, it's just so good that works really well both in the game and outside of it.\n\nLastly, the game has an extremely simple plot, but it works rather well by focusing on the characters and not overstaying its welcome, it grabs you more through emotion than any sort of complex storytelling or twists. Back around release it was often praised for the narrator, who didn't just sound good, but also reacted to player's actions in specific situations. I feel like the dynamic part of commentary is way limited and doesn't really amount to much, but it is kind of charming when it works.\n\nNow the gameplay didn't age nearly as well as any of the other elements, and if anything, would probably just as bad when judging it on release.  Bastion is an extremely basic isometric action game. You carry two unique weapons (typically melee + ranged, but you can pick any combination you want), have a dash, and a shile that allows you to either block or parry. That's all there is to it. No fancy combos or complicated abilities. You can augment things, somewhat, by mixing and matching weapon upgrades, ultimate skills, and tonics that serve as perks with unique buffs and debuffs, but most of the combat remains very simple. \n\nThe enemies are just as basic, they often have only one obvious and well telegraphed attack, and outside of minor variations, you fight them all in roughly the same way. The lack of enemies with unique attack patterns makes the combat extremely repetitive, which is only somewhat redeemed by the game showering you with new weapons to try, but despite decent variety, there's rarely a reason to switch things up, especially considering that upgrades make quite a big difference in damage towards the late game.\n\nIf you want more of a challenge, the game offers something similar to Skulls in Halo where you can toggle on unique modifiers that make combat more challenging, but most of it comes down to either frustrating RNG, or just outright buffing enemies in every way. True to most optional difficulties in games, it doesn't feel like it was designed around it, so it leads so some very uneven difficulty and levels of bull.\n\nProbably most obnoxious part of combat for me was the fact that collisions often don't match the visuals, leading to many frustrating moments when your dodge just gets snagged on a rogue pixel, which is often enough to really mess you up if you got aforementioned skull turned on.\n\nWith that said, I strongly recommend playing this game on any of the default difficulty settings just to experience Bastion's unique setting, charming characters, and top notch soundtreck. It's a fairly cheap game, and you can easily go through the whole thing in one evening.", "timestamp_created": 1687607459, "timestamp_updated": 1687607459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651567935943603516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140607971": {"recommendationid": "140607971", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966556731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1318, "last_played": 1687637423}, "language": "english", "review": "Amzing single player game. \nnice Story with a good soundtrack :)", "timestamp_created": 1687603314, "timestamp_updated": 1687603314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140602020": {"recommendationid": "140602020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029370621", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 804, "last_played": 1699736279}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome and made me fall in love for Super Giant Games!\nThis and HADES are some of the best indie games ever made and I do recommend them to everyone who loves video games!", "timestamp_created": 1687593563, "timestamp_updated": 1687593563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140580283": {"recommendationid": "140580283", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967625514", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 880, "last_played": 1470352265}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I enjoyed the dynamic narrator's commentary on my choices and actions, which made me feel very immersed in both my character and the world. Couldn't expect anything less amazing from Supergiant Games.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]:\nBastion isn't a difficult game nor is it a long one. The weapon options, upgrades, and combinations are very broad and interesting to use for specific or all levels. Different distillery options allow me to further customize my enhance, and the shrine allowed me to bump up the difficulty by a notch or two while rewarding me with increased rates of experience and currency drops.\n\nPlayed the game with a controller as I found it a lot easier to control than kb&m. The interface isn't cramped with too much stuff, so navigation isn't difficult either. For one of the challenges I had to use my mouse, as I am awful at aiming with the controller lol\n\nFor those who experience crashing while trying to launch the game, I suggest downloading \"XNA 4.0\" from the official Microsoft website as this was the fix to my problem. The legacy solution exists for the game through Steam's settings, but it affects the visual look of the game.\n \n[b]ACHIEVEMENTS[/b]:\nAlthough the game doesn't have a lot of achievements, they will take a bit of time to acquire.

You attack with two weapons that you can choose from a handful offered to you that you find over the course of the game and can use a dodge roll or a shield to defend against enemy attacks. The game keeps you on a pretty focused path, with minimal deviations for exploration, and those deviations that do exist tend to be small in size so you get right back to that focused path quickly. The game also has a few skill-based challenges for each individual weapon that have you trying to reach certain scores or times, and they're easily the most challenging thing the game offers. \n\nWhile you walk that path, you'll be accompanied by the charming voice of the narrator, who pretty much spells out the story and the events of the game as they happen. While in some cases a constant narrator could be a nuisance, in Bastion it actually works with a nice bit of sass and wit mixed in, plus the fact that the narrator is a character who is actually an unreliable narrator at times. The story is pretty self explanatory thanks to the narrator, but it isn't bad, and does give motivation to the characters in the world. \n\nThe game isn't long, as I was able to beat it in about 5 hours. Despite being short, linear, and simple, this game has one thing that instantly and frequently endeared me to it; it had charm. The visuals were striking, the music was captivating, and the aforementioned Narrator kept my attention throughout the treks through its levels. The simplicity of the combat makes it very easy to pick up the game and get right into it, as there's very little learning curve. And the myriad of weapons gives a bit of replayability to the game, as you can mix things up by trying different weapon combinations for a different experience. \n\nIf I had to find fault in anything in the game, the hitboxes are probably the biggest issue. They can be a little spotty at times, especially for melee, where sometimes the hitboxes don't match up with the animation. But this was more of a minor nuisance at times, rather than being a game-breaking issue. In addition, picking up a new weapon for the first time doesn't let you choose which weapon you replace, which can sometimes lead to sub-optimal setups, but this is only on your first time through a level, and several have armories to let you switch your weapon setups after getting a new weapon. And I cannot overstate how overpowered the shield is; the fact that it has almost no startup lag to bring it up means you can block any attack in the game as long as you're facing it. Sure, you can do last-minute shield blocks for added counter-damage, but even holding up the shield just to block can stun Melee enemies and give you an easy opportunity to retaliate. But none of these issues took away from the experience as a whole, and instead were just minor things I noticed while playing through the game. \n\nOn a side note, it's absolutely fascinating to play this game after Hades, because you can very clearly see that a lot of the groundwork that Bastion laid gave rise to Hades. Several of the weapons in Bastion would later become more polished versions of the same thing in Hades, and it absolutely impresses me to know that Supergiant kept improving their work from their first game to their latest. \n\nBastion may not be a groundbreaking game, but considering it's a 12 year old game and it was Supergiant's first game, it absolutely holds up. If you're looking for a short, charming adventure, Bastion is definitely it, and I highly recommend it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1686770958, "timestamp_updated": 1686770958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140046743": {"recommendationid": "140046743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405922322", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1691234589}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great, combat is fun with lots of different and unique weapons.

A decade older and wiser, I got through my first playthrough in under eight hours and mopped the rest of the achievements in another ten.\n\nTurns out that Bastion is still a nice game.\n\nYou play as The Kid, a silent protagonist who has to smash and fight through a bunch of isometric stages that build around you as you move about the place. The core gameplay loop of Bastion revolves around combat, which is handled using melee and ranged attacks, a shield and special attacks. There is a handful of weapons to choose from, which unlock as you get through the story, and you get a choice of upgrades to further custoize your combat experience.\n\nThe combat itself is not particularly challenging, although you definitely can make things harder for yourself using the Idol system. About the Author, which requires you to defeat 30 waves of enemies in the Stranger's Dream while using all of the hardenings available, definitely gives you a run for your money. Even though I managed to beat it in two attempts, the first attempt failing at the last wave, it was not without its share of panic, screaming and aching arms. But if you don't reach for the Idols, combat's more on the relaxing side of the difficulty spectrum.\n\nOh, and if you decide to go for About the Author: Galleon Mortar and dodge roll, dodge roll, dodge roll.\n\nThere is a fairly short and basic story in the game, although it's not particularly gripping. Most of the interesting stuff in the Bastion universe happened before you even came along, and you're mostly told about it from the narrator. If you were hoping for a story-heavy game, you might be disappointed, but it's still a decent, somber narrative.\n\nBastion's art is highly stylized and gorgeous, although not perfect; due to the isometric perspective and the way the levels are designed, it's hard to tell which parts of the level you can actually access and which you can't. It's also not the easiest to avoid falling entirely off the level, which will snip some off your health bar as a punishment. Still, the overall quality of the art definitely offsets those minor annoyances.\n\nThe sound design in the game is absolutely top notch. I'd like to meet the person who doesn't enjoy Logan Cunningham's voice-over narration, which there is a lot. And Bastion's soundtrack ranks in some of the best video game soundtracks that I know of. It's the kind of stuff that you'll want to listen outside the game as well. I know I definitely have.\n\nFor my 2023 playthrough of Bastion, I did it entirely on my Steam Deck, as my gaming PC was actually out of commission for the entirety of it. And there is good news on that front: Bastion has a native Linux version and works absolutely flawlessly on SteamOS. Since this game is designed for a controller and is not graphically demanding, it makes for a perfect Steam Deck title.\n\nConsidering for how little money you can pick up Bastion these days, and the abundance of good things about it, avoiding it would be foolish if you feel like it would appeal to you in any way.", "timestamp_created": 1685123641, "timestamp_updated": 1685123641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138979240": {"recommendationid": "138979240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378959318", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1683582320}, "language": "english", "review": "YES\n", "timestamp_created": 1685041003, "timestamp_updated": 1685041003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466321229934692383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138940880": {"recommendationid": "138940880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099468670", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1682913484}, "language": "english", "review": "Bastion was an ambitious game. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find such a magnificent debut from a new indie studio as this one. Bastion, the game of a young boy trying to repair his broken world, has a beautiful world, a beautiful narrative, and is told with the beautiful signature Supergiant style that they would come to be known for with games like Hades and Transistor. With all that said, I must admit Bastion is easily my least favorite of all the Supergiant games I\u2019ve played. It\u2019s understandable- this was their first game. This game is a huge accomplishment! But unlike their other titles, I have no urge to return to this game at some later date, and I think it\u2019s mostly because I don\u2019t jive very much with the gameplay.\n\nBefore we get to all that, though, let\u2019s talk about the story and characters. Bastion introduces the magnificent story-telling prowess of Supergiant games with their narrator. Funnily enough, that\u2019s probably why a lot of us had even heard about the game in the first place. I remember, long ago, my brother was excitedly telling me about this game where \u201cthey narrate EVERYTHING\u201d. And I watched and listened to him play for a bit and, yeah, I was instantly intrigued. Despite very few characters and relatively few story beats, I was engrossed by the world, and I wanted to keep playing almost solely to hear what the narrator would have to say next. Otherwise, it\u2019s a nice story with a meaningful choice at the end of the game.\n\nBut while the narrator was pushing me to uncover more of the story, the gameplay consistently held me back. And this might just be a \u201cme\u201d problem, and I might be alone here. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a relatively slow, methodical player, or maybe I just don\u2019t like my games to be too fast? Or, more likely, maybe I just sucked at this game. It\u2019s strange when I found the gameplay in other Supergiant games to be fairly compelling, but there was something off-putting about constantly falling through the floor when I\u2019m trying to dodge attacks, constantly having to hit the heal button, getting spam-looped by heavy attacks that knocked me in the air, or taking constant damage from fifteen enemies on screen; the gameplay constantly had me feeling overwhelmed, and it just didn\u2019t jive with me.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not necessarily the difficulty. I like hard games. Bloodborne is probably my favorite game of all time, and it still manages to kick my ass whenever I boot it back up. Sorry if you\u2019re reading this and this is coming off as too vague, but I\u2019m not sure how else to say it besides \u201cI was feeling annoyed a lot\u201d, and no number of new weapons or tonics ever made that feeling go away for me. What DID help some was doing the side quest to upgrade my weapons, but I had avoided them for most of the game because I was just trying to get it all over with.\n\nBastion has a lovely art style, but I did have one problem with the way they chose to portray the world: I only ever knew what something was supposed to be because of the narrator. The game would describe a section as \u201ca market\u201d, \u201ca swamp\u201d, or \u201ca boat\u201d, and I only ever knew I was looking at those things because the narrator said as much. So, I was never a huge fan of the environment or level design. I also always thought the kid\u2019s character model looked a little wonky. One thing I was a huge fan of, however, was the music. Oh, man! The music boasts some of the wildest, funkiest tracks you\u2019ll hear in an indie title, and it really did wonders to make this whole world feel weird and foreign.\n\nThis game is moderately repayable. It\u2019s got all the usual replayability fixins like new game plus, lots of weapons to try out, and steam achievements. Not to mention the offerings to the gods you can give to increase the difficulty! But again, I had no urge to replay it, so your mileage may vary.\n\nBastion is a wonderful game, but it\u2019s not really a game for me. I\u2019d honestly rather watch someone else play it so I can listen to more of the awesome narrator. Despite my complaints here, I\u2019m very glad I played through the game at least once.

Let's start with the obvious, Bastion looks quite stylish and beautiful, when the game never looses this beautiful art style throughout, remaining consistent no matter the location, effect or monster. Now for the meat of the game, the combat.\n\nBastion comes with a wide arsenal of unique and game changing weapons, you can equip 2 for every mission as a well as one skill. The weapons feel satisfying to use and master, the limit of 2 weapons allows the player to really way the pros and cons of the weapons they are carrying into the mission. With a simple but effective binary option weapon upgrade system, there are many possibilities for satisfying builds. One annoyance of this system is the game forcing the player to use a new weapon ounce it has been introduced, this can, temporary, ruin your build and make your life harder. Enemy attacks are well telegraphed and I never felt like the game cheated a death out of me, with one big exception, auto aim. When you block, a quite useful skill I might add, you are also pressing the button for the lock on, which snaps you to a nearby target, now this could be the completely wrong target and could lead to your death. If the problem is the lock on button, then why didn't I change it, well there are no options for changing the lock on button in the menu. If you're worried about difficulty, don't worry, Bastion comes with an idle system that allows you to change the difficulty by modifying the enemies stats for a reward, when you activate an idle, you get a boost in XP and shards (money).\n\nIn conclusion, if you like action games and have a spare 6 hours, I highly recommend Bastion.\n", "timestamp_created": 1684969937, "timestamp_updated": 1684969937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138928904": {"recommendationid": "138928904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092312889", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1399, "last_played": 1682321220}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever since my days playing on the Sega Genesis, I have always enjoyed isometric games. In my opinion, this particular perspective and its top-down view work nicely by enabling fluid exploration, unobstructed controls and engaging combat. Some of the issues that plague third person titles, such as cumbersome cameras and movement, are not usually found in this subgenre, at least not in my experience. After many years of not paying attention, I finally took the time to try out Bastion. Intrigued by its screenshots and trailers, I thought this would be a pleasant ride. Unfortunately, although competently made, this game has a number of design decisions that made me disappointed, and therefore I cannot recommend it. Here's why.\n\nGraphics-wise, Bastion is pleasing to the eyes, considering its launch date and overall direction. The artists did a nice job creating all these hand drawn objects, creatures and environments. I like seeing colors in games, and this one does not shy away from utilising them in a harmonious and effective manner. Animations are swift and simple, serving the game's cartoonish art-style quite well. Looking at this game's scenarios and effects, I couldn't help but remember my time with Little Big Adventure 1 and 2, which was an endearing feeling. My only gripe in this department is that, sometimes, large clutters of objects made grasping certain levels a bit difficult. Other than this point, there's nothing to complain about here.\n\nFrankly, I don't have the technical credentials and knowledge to analyze in detail the sound effects of any game. I can say, though, that they are reasonably convincing in Bastion, if not a bit repetitive in the case of enemies. I haven't noticed any issues with chopped audio during my playthroughs, as everything works as intended. The only voice actor of the game, who voices the narrator, does a fine job in conveying his lines. Understanding them, however, is an issue depending on the amount of action currently on display. The soundtrack, despite its varied instruments for each level, didn't manage to entice me with any memorable tunes. Some songs became quite grating after a while, actually.\n\nBastion is an isometric action-adventure game with light RPG mechanics. Its gameplay revolves around traversing linear and unconnected levels, defeating multiple enemies in real time combat and collecting key itens used to restore a small village which serves as a hub. To dispatch foes, players have access to a selection of melee and ranged weapons, alongside a shield for blocking and parrying strikes and projectiles. Dodging is possible, but jumping is only allowed in a particular section at the end of the game, serving no higher purpose. To strengthen the protagonist, a number of beneficial traits and abilities can be purchased and allocated to perk slots. These slots are unlocked by leveling up, which is accomplished by killing hostiles. Money can be obtained from combat and the completion of minor side tasks and challenges.\n\nHere's what bothered me. Beating levels in this game is a neverending trudge of walking on floating platforms. Everything is positioned either on small arenas or on connecting platforms that emerge as you approach their edges. Predicting the path ahead is bothersome because you aren't able to see it properly in many sections, despite the game's linear nature. I had this constant feeling of unease while moving since you're always at risk of falling down a precipice due to the narrowness of each floating path, which also made engaging foes a clumsy endeavor. Exploration is nonexistant, save for the occasional dead end with a collectible. Given that levels aren't logically connected between themselves, the world felt uninsteresting and irrational.\n\nCombat is rather simplistic. This isn't necessarily a problem, but you're only allowed to carry two weapons at all times, and there isn't much to them. Players are restricted to performing regular swings or shots, as there is no elaborate combo system. The sole variation here is the possibility of using a single, mana dependent special ability, and most of these require specific weapons. Dodging is hardly useful as something more than a travelling technique -- your character moves around slowly and dodging constantly speeds you up a bit. The shield is effective against single targets, but proves itself unreliable in the presence of groups. Considering that walking space is constantly limited, facing these groups can be a problem, which brings us to the matter of difficulty.\n\nThe difficulty level in Bastion is entirely measured by the amount of shrine idols you apply to your playthrough. These idols can be unlocked as you progress into the main story and act as modifiers, increasing the challenge of combat in some way. Playing with no idols is a cakewalk, but when most or all of them are activated, enemies become gruesomely resistant and deadly, and not always in a reasonable way. Yes, you can upgrade your weapons at the blacksmith and change your loadout of perks, but I quickly found myself outgunned and cornered by these fully upgraded foes. It all feels artificial, as if the difficulty system was an afterthought. As a side note, I also think that the roster of enemies is a tad small. You end up fighting the same guys over and over again.\n\nThe story in this game is, well... I don't know, honestly. I could not follow nor understand it, and I suppose it is meant to be somewhat vague. Another gripe I have is that all actions and events are constantly explained and exposed by the narrator in his monologues. The problem is that most of his lines, as I implied before, are delivered during gameplay, often in combat situations. Perhaps I'm not a good listener, but I coudn't pay attention to them while battling hordes of enemies and trying to find my way around nonsensical floating levels. I just don't think that shoving tons of dialogues during action sequences contributes to an engrossing storytelling direction. The game presents these side characters that seem to be important, but their lack of expression and diminished presence made me indifferent to them.\n\nSo, yes, I don't think Bastion is an unmissable experience. You can tell the developers worked hard to make something worthwhile, and you can definitely indentify some shining aspects, which I respect. However, there are too many nagging flaws here for my personal taste. It might be worth a playthrough if you like isometric games, though. To end my review, I advise completionists to be cautious. Unlocking all achievements requires beating a bunch of special arenas with all idols activated.

I wasn\u2019t quite sure how seriously I was supposed to take the colonialist conflict between the Caelondians and the Ura; it sometimes felt like I needed to fill in some gaps in the game\u2019s story. Nevertheless, I found the choice at the climax of the game poignant.\n\n[i]Bastion[/i] has three outstanding strengths: \n1. its level design and its weapons.

Supergiant is known for its distinctive art style, and it\u2019s a knockout here. It\u2019s vibrant and colorful and doesn\u2019t really look like a Western frontier and yet it evokes a frontier feel beautifully.\n3. the music.

Seriously, his voice could soothe a raging bull.\n\nWho needs a therapist when you can smash everything in sight with a giant hammer? Bastion is the ultimate stress-reliever.\n\nThe world of Bastion is so beautifully hand-painted, you'll feel like you're playing in a living, breathing painting. You might even forget you're in your living room and not a museum.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is so good, it'll make your ears feel like they're on vacation. If you close your eyes, you can almost feel the sea breeze blowing through your hair.\n\nIf you ever wanted to be a superhero, but couldn't be bothered to work out, Bastion is the game for you. You'll be flipping, jumping, and smashing your way through enemies like a pro in no time.\n\nBastion's story is as deep as the ocean and as rich as a chocolate cake. You'll find yourself getting lost in the game's lore for hours.\n\nWho needs friends when you have Bastion's weapons? From flamethrowers to rocket launchers, you'll have more than enough firepower to take on anything that comes your way.\n\nYou'll feel like a master strategist as you plan out your attack on enemy strongholds. It's like playing chess, but with more explosions.\n\nThe game's New Game+ mode will make you feel like a god among mortals. You'll be able to carry over all your upgrades and abilities from your previous playthrough, making you nearly unstoppable.\n\nAnd finally, if you're looking for a game that's both challenging and rewarding, Bastion is the game for you.

Its art style, music, narration & narrative all intertwine, becoming a memorable experience worth having. Supergiant Games made something to remember with this one.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nThe gameplay has you, The Kid, waking up in an unusual place known only as \u201cThe Bastion.\u201d It becomes your task to rebuild it and learn of the place\u2019s history as you do. To accomplish this, you\u2019ll set out on adventures to find and reclaim the components necessary to complete this task. You play from an isometric 3D perspective, hacking & slashing your way through wave of various enemies as the narrator talks of your feats and failures.\n\nThere is a simple upgrade system in place for each weapon in the game, as well as slight augments that can be paired with your weapons to further diversify your approach to each scenario you encounter. Enemies range from small creatures to large, daunting monsters, and every weapon will deal with them in their own unique ways, from being advantageous to outright incompatible.\n\nThe game never becomes particularly complex with its fights or puzzles, but accomplishes what it sets out to with flying colors.\n\n[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]\n\nStory-wise, [i]Bastion[/i] is a very different experience. Very little is explicitly told to you, and you must learn of the world through its few denizens and the companions you meet as you explore. It\u2019s a basic-yet-touching story that\u2019s worth experiencing. I will refrain from saying more, but just know that it\u2019s satisfying, especially the ending.\n\n[h1][b]Performance[/b][/h1]\n\nSimply put, the game looks good and is easy to run. Because it\u2019s rather dated at this point, most, if not all modern machines should have no issue running the title. The only major downside is the absence of any Borderless Fullscreen modes.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\n\nBastion is a short & sweet experience with phenomenal music, narration, art direction and tight gameplay.

The majority of it will be told by a narrator who will comment on some of your load outs, deaths and choices, which are a nice touch. I personally felt like the story was going to be bigger than it eventually was.\n\nGraphics; it is a 2011 game, but the style has aged rather well. I liked seeing the world ''pop up'' as I walked forward, I thought it was a nice touch. The colours tend to be vibrant, which is nice change from the other bleak games I tend to play. \n\nCombat; for a decade+ game, it's held up surprisingly well... Maybe a couple of weapons feel off now, simply because they tend to be slightly clunkier than they would on a more recent game. \nYou got your generic slower weapons with higher dmg, faster weapons with lower dmg, melee and range both. You can mix and match around a dozen weapons to whatever you think best fits your play style. There's also a leveling system, both for your weapons and your character. Everything is handled in a simple and smooth manner with just enough attention to details that you're bound to find a combo you'll fancy. There are also special attacks that will only work with specific weapons. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1673666480, "timestamp_updated": 1681769726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130721800": {"recommendationid": "130721800", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099818188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 606, "last_played": 1673826710}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game that at first seemed to easy...

As a game, it's not long. You can finish it in an afternoon if you're persistent. But in spite of the length of the main game, you'll find a deeply impactful narrative about the nature of power and what it means to wield it.\n\nIt's interesting for me coming to this after having played two of Supergiant Games' later works. I've gone through both 'Transistor' and 'Hades' and it's so easy to see the design progression that starts here. It's not as refined as either of those two later games, but the seeds are here and it's still really solid gameplay-wise despite it being the earliest attempt.\n\nAnd how could I write a review of this without praising the music! Supergiant has an AMAZING track record of creating music that not just fits with the game, but also does its own share of heavy lifting in terms of world building. Listen to the lyrics of \"Build that Wall\" and consider who, in-universe, would have written that and what that person was trying to say. The story and world are so much richer just from this one song.\n\nI don't have a lot to say about this one. Well... I do. I could spend hours breaking this game down and talking about the narrative importance of each of the characters and how they tie into the overall themes of the story. But those are all things that YOU need to go experience for yourself before we talk about it.\n\nTo conclude, I adore this game and wish I'd played it years ago. It's a hugely emotional experience and one that'll affect how I think about video game narratives for years to come. It'll probably be about that long before I can think of the ending without tearing up just a little bit too.", "timestamp_created": 1673475545, "timestamp_updated": 1673483466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130612103": {"recommendationid": "130612103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031790768", "num_games_owned": 717, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2134, "last_played": 1673405114}, "language": "english", "review": "Good action.

This review has been a long time coming.\n\nBastion is a game that I would still recommend to play in 2022 if you haven't yet. It's the breakout hit from Indie darling Supergiant Games and introduced us as to their signature style of storytelling and musical excellence.\nIt's short, my play time double most other people's due to me trying to get every secret, every challenge mission, and every achievement and I feel it's time well spent.\n\nBastion tells the story of a kid waking up to a broken world. Your actions are narrated as you go along and add to the ambience of the setting as you navigate broken sky ways and unlock the mystery of the titular Bastion.\n\nThe gameplay is isometric combat in levels, with a myriad of weapons to use. Several of which, in retrospect, found their way into recent smash hit, HADES. Which leads me to this...\n\nIf you're hoping for more HADES combat, it's not here.\n\nThis is Supergiant's first title and though still polished, it's not going to match up against HADES intensity or fluidity. The Kid does have the option to mix and match weapons to make a setup suited to your playstyle, and you'll find new weapons as you progress and it's always fun to try out a new one. The combat itself shows its age but, really, this game is about the storytelling more than combat.\n\nFinally the music. To this day I have several Bastion tracks I regularly listen to and it's a disservice to yourself to miss out on them. The atmosphere of the game is incredible and only enhanced more by the music in tandem with Rucks' narration.\n\nAt the time of writing (during the Winter Sale) Bastion is $3. I bought it for the full price tag at the time I played and would still do so. For $3 though? If you're on the fence, take that leap.

You can also spice things up with the Idols that you get from the Shrine to make combat harder. \n\nThe art and music are fucking amazing as always from Supergiant, its nice to see it was always that way even at their humble beginnings with Bastion. \n\nOverall I really loved this game even though I am extremely late to playing it, very cool and I'm really excited to see Hades 2 drop later this upcoming year. :D", "timestamp_created": 1672384456, "timestamp_updated": 1672384456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129636263": {"recommendationid": "129636263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034775961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1390505873}, "language": "english", "review": "Great action RPG with amazing narrative and visuals.", "timestamp_created": 1672349053, "timestamp_updated": 1672349053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129628003": {"recommendationid": "129628003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076357821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 930, "last_played": 1672346164}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game when it first came out and it still holds up.

I was hyped for this. According to Steam, it took me 2.3 hours to finish the game, and it was an unenjoyable experience. Simply say, it's incompetent at anything that makes a 2d top down view combat game a good game: movement is bad, attacks don't feel good, ennemies are annoying and repetitve, aiming with the controller is straight up atrocious and it is overall so simple and non innovativce, I can't give any credit for creative mecanics. The game has very few mecanics, and fewer that are well done. The story is there, I guess, nothing creative I suppose, I genuienely didn't care, even tho I am usually a fan of story based game. Tho, I will say, there seems to be a lot of lore for the player to find. The visuals hindered the experience more than it helped Imo, ennemy were hard to see and could hide behind something that is visible from your character point of view, but not from the camera's point of view, meaning you'd get hit but wouldn't know from where. Also the whole gimmick of the ground forming in front of you is, again to me, interesting for about 5 seconds before it just become a way to slow the player down. This was a 1 hour and a half game extended by another hour by annoying mecanics, but it felt even longer by how slow everything is. \n\nNow, not all is bad, the soundtrack is good. \n\nThis was only my opinion, I don't think the game is bad, I am just saying' I personnally didn't enjoy it, and wouldn't recommend it.

Play for a couple of levels and it gets really fun you keep thinking \"ok thats it, probably no more new features\" then you learn or find something new and it makes the game more lively and stuffs. man this review sucks but i just thought id share that its definitely worth more than its current price, its beautiful artwork, fun game and not just to kill time while another game is undergoing maintenance, i think i can play right now until i beat it.

I found the best combination of weapons was thus the shotgun and the pike, which trivialised basically every fight as soon as I got access to them.\n\nI could have increased the difficulty of the game through using the shrines, but I'll be honest, there's so many games out nowadays that going for the highest score or most challenging gameplay on something that had the story as the selling point didn't really make much sense.\n\nSpeaking of the story, there are multiple twists and turns throughout, but I felt the impact of each story beat was muted by the Kid not reacting to it, as the majority of the story is narrated. The small amount of cutscenes made up of animated stills were more impactful, which is definitely helped by the beautiful soundtrack.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game if you wanted to know what an amazing indie game of 2011 looked like, or if you had some time to kill.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n+ Beautiful soundtrack\n+ Visuals still hold up\n+ The story and adventure unfolds in an interesting way\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n- Story didn't feel impactful except for the cutscenes\n- Gameplay can be trivialised unless you decide to use shrine modifiers\n- Leaderboards are ridiculous anyway so not much incentive to try and become the best", "timestamp_created": 1670570722, "timestamp_updated": 1670570722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128182655": {"recommendationid": "128182655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003117833", "num_games_owned": 1158, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1670529984}, "language": "english", "review": "I realised I have 1100+ games in my Steam library and I was going to die before I played them all.\n\nSo thought I'd spend a bit of time on each one, a new one every night, and leave a short initial review.\n\nSo, I am on the fence for this, it wasn't my type of game, I cant say it was bad, just a bit of a cartoony type Diablo button mashing thing, quite pretty but not particularly captivating, and I personally found the voice over vexing whereas most players seem to comment that they really like it.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.\n\nThank you, Bastion", "timestamp_created": 1670228500, "timestamp_updated": 1670228500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358450710773468018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127962342": {"recommendationid": "127962342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067382134", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1670218727}, "language": "english", "review": "Short game with beautiful art design and a deeply moral story.

Every stage was extremely good looking, and it was never confusing where to go. Characters seemed to have enough depth to make them interesting but there was nothing to make you emotionally attached in the slightest.

However... I've played all four games made by Supergiant at this point (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre and Hades), and Bastion is my least favorite entry in the franchise.\n\nIts combat is engaging, but slow and occasionally clunky. Its story is kind of interesting but not fleshed-out and refined enough (like Hades) or mysterious and bizarre enough (like Transistor) to be especially memorable. The visuals are nice, but not strikingly beautiful like Transistor or stunningly sharp like Pyre and Hades. It's obvious from a lot of mechanical and creative aspects of Bastion that Supergiant was still finding their footing with this game and hadn't fully hit upon the formula that makes their later games so amazing.\n\nI still enjoyed Bastion, but it's hard for me to look at this game and not compare it to Supergiant's other titles when their other three games seem better than Bastion in pretty much every aspect. So... if this game caught your eye and you haven't played Supergiant's other games yet (especially Hades or Transistor), pick those up - they're more worth your time.

I ended up spending 15 hours with it - I could end the review right here and that would probably be all you need to know. Go buy it and play it, Lunkhead.\n\nIf you're still reading, I can tell you that you're in for a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing artstyle, amazing, impactful sound design and heart-warming music. My only complaint in the presentation department is that there's no native support for resolutions beyond 1920x1080, so if you're on a 1440p or 4k monitor, it might look a tad blurry (but the game's artstyle makes it imperceptible, so it's not a huge deal). It's also locked at 60 FPS but since this isn't a game that needs hundreds of FPS, it was all fine and dandy.\n\nThis is basically a lite action RPG in isometric view, but the basic combat loop is super satisfying and deep without being obtuse or overly complex. You have a wide variety of weapons that you can upgrade and you can combine two at a time before heading on a mission, which accommodates a lot of different playstyles and I found myself changing weapons a lot because they were all fun to use and balanced out very well. You also have a \"Distillery\" which offers \"Drinks\" that give you passive buffs to customize your character further. The enemies are varied and creative as well. I'm being vague on purpose because I don't want to give too much away, I just really want to hammer home the point that the game is very well made and deserves top marks in the gameplay department.\n\nIt also has a very tight, short and heart-warming story of war, forgiveness and redemption. There's something wholesomely human about it, and I've never played a game back-to-back twice (NG+) just to see both endings (if you ask me, the [spoiler] Evacuation [/spoiler] ending is the better of the two).\n\nI usually try and find at least something that could be improved in every review, but here, I'm left to nitpick and scratch my head. Apart from the minor technical stuff mentioned above, there's nothing really objectively wrong with the game. It's a bit short at its core (it can be finished in 4-5 hours if you rush through it), but it does have achievements, NG plus, an arena mode, upgrades to hunt down, trial maps for all the weapons, it's not like it's short on content, and it's all optional, which in today's day and age of stuffing big, open-world maps with tons of meaningless busywork, feels absolutely refreshing (even though this game is from 2011). If you don't like this type of artstyle, I guess you won't dig the game, but that's 100% subjective, so YMMV.\n\nI'd say it's fairly priced at just under 13\u20ac - you'll get your money's worth if you do the extra stuff; if you're only in it for the story, maybe wait for a sale. In short, Bastion is a superb game to spend a weekend with and it totally deserves your money and time.

You can finish the story in one afternoon. But, Bastion is a little game that packs a big punch; there are 2 endings, new game+, score attack mode and wave-survival challenges. Like Supergiant's last hit Hades, Bastion can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. During the game you build a shrine which lets you evoke up to 10 gods, each one making game more challenging in a certain way. And if you like a challenge just invoke all 10 of them and watch as this fun and cool adventure turns into nail biting, reflex testing experience that would make From Software proud. There are also 10+ upgradable weapons, each requiring different gameplay approach, a bunch of different skills to use and various tonics that buff the player in some way. So, despite its lenght, there is plenty of replayability here.\nHonestly, I can talk forever about how good Bastion is and I cant think of a single negative thing to say about it.

You take control of a survivor dubbed the [b]Kid[/b]. As he makes his way towards the mysterious [b]Bastion[/b] he meets an old man named [b]Rucks[/b]. Together, they must gather a bunch of magical rocks to power up the [b]Bastion[/b] and restore the world to its natural order. Pretty standard setup for a videogame, yet the way this one delivers it is special. The entire story is narrated by [b]Rucks[/b] while you\u2019re exploring the game\u2019s world and fighting various enemies. Not only does the narrator give you lots of background information on things you see, but he will comment on the things you do. Which will instantly immerse you into this strange world. Furthermore, the narrator\u2019s voice is so charismatic, that you\u2019d want to keep playing just to hear more of him. There\u2019re some plot twists that might feel predictable, yet they don\u2019t feel like they were thrown in just for the sake of it. The ending of the game feels really cathartic and leaves you wanting more, just like any good story. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt\u2019s kind of like hack and slash game. You can attack, dodge, guard with shield, use healing potions and perform special moves. The game offers a vast arsenal of weapons. You start off with a bow and a hammer and almost every level in the game introduces a new weapon to your arsenal. You can carry only two weapons at a time, but there\u2019s no limit on which weapons you can select, e.g. you can take two ranged weapons or two melee ones if you\u2019d want. Some weapons can be used in multiple capacities, like machete and spear, which can be thrown to eliminate enemies from a distance. There are lots of different enemy types, which can be more vulnerable to certain weapons, but the balancing is pretty good and there are no best weapons. So, you can select the ones that fit with your preferred playstyle. It also offers some difficulty customization. If you\u2019re starting to feel like the game\u2019s getting too easy, it allows you to activate modifiers that make enemies healthier, stronger and more fierce.  \n\nSince the game\u2019s world was broken to pieces, the levels look like floating islands. So more often than not, you will fall off into the abyss. Thankfully, it\u2019s not instant death like in some games, it just takes away a small chunk of your HP. Although it becomes a bit frustrating at later levels, when the game throws everything at you. Lots of visual effects on the screen makes it very hard to see where you\u2019re dodging. There are is also another rather frustrating moment. Almost every level introduces a new weapon and you can carry only two of them at the same time. So, each time you pick a new one, it will randomly replace one of your chosen weapons. This happens even in the new game plus, where you\u2019ve already unlocked all the weapons. It breaks your loadout, leaving you with one weapon of your choice and a new one. So if your ranged weapon got replaced with a melee one, there are two ways to kill ranged enemies, one is to throw your machete/spear and the second one is counter-attack, and both take a lot of time especially if you use difficulty modifiers. \n\n[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]\nThe game really excels at this. Its visuals are just stunning. Every level is like a painting filled to the brim with details. There are multiple zones in the game, each with its own visual and music theme. Both audio and visuals work in tandem to create an engaging experience. The soundtrack has some memorable tracks that will stick in your head for hours. There\u2019s only one voice actor, who you\u2019ll be listening to for the entirety of the game, so getting wrong was not an option and they got it right. You won\u2019t get tired of listening to the narrator because of his charming voice and a huge amount of charisma.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nSpecs: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB, 32GB RAM.\n\nOn max settings, at 1080p resolution, the game runs at 60 FPS without any issues.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]Bastion[/b] is an action-packed adventure with a charismatic narrator and a very satisfying gameplay. It hasn\u2019t aged a day since its release in 2011. So, if you somehow missed it back then, I strongly urge you to play it now. This is an experience that will surely satisfy most gamers, from casual ones to the more hardcore ones.", "timestamp_created": 1663261122, "timestamp_updated": 1663261122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629932582378387451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122256546": {"recommendationid": "122256546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099826584", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1663436225}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played Transistor before and seeing how much of a hit Hades is I wanted to see how Bastion was in terms of being their foundational title.

But I think it highlights what Supergiant does best as theming. The attention paid to the artistic aspect of these games is fantastic. Bastion has delightfully styled visuals which are easy to understand, the music and narration is so very full of character, and with how tight the combat and core gameplay is it renders an entirely enjoyable and fun experience with actual replay value. Like its not that theres more stapled onto it at the end I genuinely want to keep playing to find everything and its visuals, music, and voluntary approach to difficulty makes that possible. \n\nTL;DR Fun combat, visuals and music is great.

And honestly? With 96 hours in Hades and remembering what games looked like over ten years ago, \"Bastion\" met just about all of my expectations. \n\nThe art is just gorgeous in a very distinct early 2010s way, the music fits the atmosphere just nicely, there's a pretty good assortment of enemies for the length of the game and I was honestly delighted with the sheer number of weapons we have to choose from! The level of difficulty wasn't disappointing either, because in the first run there were moments when I genuinely struggeld to stay alive lol \n\nWhere I feel this game is a bit lacking is the lore. Playing through this game felt a little bit like reading the second part of a series, where all the worldbuilding has been already explained before and I'm left to try to make a whole from the bits and pieces we get via the narration we get throughout the game. But, hey, maybe this was done on purpose and I just didn't catch on.\n\nGenerally speaking, it's a charming title if you're looking for a nostalgic-feeling quick play (it 4 hours exactly to complete the first run), and even after you finish the main plot, you can still spend some time getting all the achievments both within the game and here on Steam. Not the greatest title I've ever played in my life, but definitely one of the best games from the early 2010s! \n\n--- TL;DR ---\n\u2022 GRAPHICS: gorgeous and detailed, with a certain watercolor-y feel to them\n\u2022 GAMEPLAY: pleasant and just the right amount of challenging, the controlls are really really good for an old-ish game\n\u2022 AUDIO: the music is really nice and fits the general \"feel\" of the game\n\u2022 STORY: somewhat lacking--it feels like we're missing the background to fully understand what is happening\n\u2022 AUDIENCE: 12 and up \n\u2022 DIFFICULTY: just the right amount, can be made harder via ingame machanics \n\u2022 PRICE: buy on sale \n\u2022 PERSONAL SCORE: 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1662586264, "timestamp_updated": 1662586439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121884120": {"recommendationid": "121884120", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965195083", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1665686030}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is perfect, 5 stars out of 5 just for the DEMO, the concept is simply perfect for a MMO based RPG single and multiplayer ready (not yet).

I did find the narrator obnoxious and distracting at times when I really needed to focus (it could be turned down, but I never got to that point). It was a little annoying that you were forced to use new weapons - like it was nice that you were encouraged to try  new weapons (and there was usually an Armory or whatever that let you change not long after), but when you have a near upgraded weapon, it was a shock to go to a weaker, non upgraded weapon.\n\nI suppose that didn't matter too much as I found the game on the Easy side (i think I only went down a few times and maybe had 1 full wipe forcing me to restart) though honestly I didn't mind - I like to play long RPGs so something short and easy is a great pallette cleanser.  The end fights especially got pretty easy (I had a near upgraded  Brush Pike and Galleon mortar) which let me kill most in a few hits (and often kill enemies with the mortar outside their range).  That and a lot of health stuff dropped.  It was annoying though to be stuck with a heavy melee weapon for the last few bits - it did 1 hit kills, but it was so slow.\n\nThings were a little clunky at times aiming or trying to walk where I wanted to - I would say most of the few times I got downed was due to this - at one point an enemy (the frog thing) got stuck on me and I was unable to move as other enemies took pot shots at me.\n\nI can't say the story was that impressive (something about the world ended and you were trying to fix it), but I thought the music was good for the most part.", "timestamp_created": 1661566703, "timestamp_updated": 1661566703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121282247": {"recommendationid": "121282247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027070577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1661542277}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good.", "timestamp_created": 1661542357, "timestamp_updated": 1661542357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121217682": {"recommendationid": "121217682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033368929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1348988400}, "language": "english", "review": "7 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1661436689, "timestamp_updated": 1661436689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121170835": {"recommendationid": "121170835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052261233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1631852884}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an interesting game to be sure. The game-play is pretty solid, and the story is very intriguing. \n\nActually real quick about the story, you have a narrator who talks a lot and informs you of what's going on in the world. It's an interesting concept, but for me it also kind of made me wish this game wasn't set in a post apocalyptic world. The game takes place after some huge Calamity that seemed to have wiped out everyone except for a few survivors. But the narrator spends a good portion of the game telling you about what this world used to be like. Honestly that was so interesting to me that I kind of wish we could have had the game set in THAT world. I think if this company ever thinks about doing a follow up to this game they should consider doing a prequel. I'd love to actually explore this world in it's old state when it was still standing and see some of the concepts the narrator talks about fleshed out more. That is honestly very appealing  to me.\n\nMoving on most everything about the game checks out. You have two weapon slots that you can switch between at anytime, and you can upgrade those weapons to be more powerful. I really like the upgrade system for the weapons as you can choose which upgrades to put on a weapon and you can change them if you don't like them back at your home base. Gives you a lot of incentive to try different things. \n\nThe Alcohol upgrades are also a nice touch, and perhaps a subtle hint that things aren't going well....as you level up you can \"equip\" more alcohol to give you different bonuses. There are also challenge levels that have you fighting a large group on enemies in an arena like setting for more exp and money, but they also have their own stories attached to them that let you learn a bit more about the world which is nice.\n\nThe soundtrack is available as DLC so if you like it feel free to pick it up. All in all this is a good game and I had some fun with it. Like I said I'd actually like to see a prequel of this game where you can interact with the world before the calamity.

It has functional combat, but its not particularly interesting. The visuals look alright, but aren't that great. The story has some interesting ideas, but there's not much to it.\n\nThe most interesting thing about Bastion was its narrator. He added a lot of important context and spiced up sections that would otherwise be very bland. The reactiveness to different actions you could take over the course of the game was also good. He was also used very well in the overarching story.\n\nThe game has a lot of different weapons available, however it actually feels like there's too many of them. Bastion is a very short game, and with the amount of weapons available there's no way the majority of them will get a significant amount of use. You also can't preview a level before traveling there, so you won't know what weapon you'd want to use for a level before you go, and although there are occasionally opportunities to change weapons mid-level, they're very rare. Since weapons are also upgradeable, you're even more encouraged to use one set of weapons throughout the game, as you won't have the resources to try anything else.\n\nOne of the game's gimmicks is that the level assembles/disassembles itself around you as you progress through it. This was introduced as a way to easily tell where you're going, but I had the opposite experience. Being unable to see the path ahead of me until I got close to it made it harder to progress, and I would frequently have to resort walking in a circle around whatever island I was currently on to try and see where the next bridge would assemble itself at.\n\nOverall these aren't major flaws, and the game has stuff going for it. The narrator is good, the music is very enjoyable, and while the gameplay isn't great or very impressive, its fine and hard to be bored by.

The visuals nice and timeless in a way that some other games of the era aren't\n- The soundtrack is amazing. Sometimes, lyrical tracks in games come off as cheesy or cringey, but all the music here is fantastic. Western vibes with occasional riffing\n- The narration is also great. I swore I was listening to Sam Elliot until I looked it up\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- I love that the world comes together as the story unfolds. Nice little thematic unity there\n- Other than that, the plot is a little thin. I won't spoil anything, but it wouldn't really matter if I did\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- The controls are excellent. It actually feels \"fair\" when you get hit\n- The weapon diversity and upgrade system are excellent. Because of this, I kinda want to try different builds and maybe do an NG+ someday\n- I didn't get into the challenge idol system, but it's there for people who want the challenge/achievements\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- Overall, the game ran well. Also, it doesn't NEED a 4k update, but I'd be really happy if it did\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n- [b]8.5/10[/b]. For me, the only thing this was missing was a deep enough story.

But with that said, the narration and storytelling seems to be the only highlight, and even that didn't really feel engaging or terribly clever with its writing.  The combat is simplistic.  The music is good but not monumental.  The graphics were decent (Again, giving it some leeway due to its age).  The controls/mechanics were workable, but not the most intuitive; it felt like I was halfway through the game before I figured out what I was doing.  The challenge was basically non-existent; once I actually figured out how the controls worked, I was effectively at full health AND meds all the time (This was on Normal Mode.  I haven't tried the extra difficulties or New Game+).  All in all, I finished the game in 6.4 hours, not very long.  \n\nIn sum, I applaud the developers for their unique approach to storytelling, no pun intended.

I found this to be a somewhat mediocre experience. Why? The normal mode felt too easy. The amount of health potion drops seemed very overly generous. Maybe after TUNIC, UNSIGHTED, and Death's Door, I have been conditioned to find more difficulty in games. That said, I don't think I'm off the mark. When you don't bother using resources to get weapon upgrades and still get through the game without having to restart levels, there is something that feels off. I know there is a hard mode and new game+, but other detractors prevented me from wanting this experience to last longer than necessary. I will say that it is nice that there are ways to tailor your difficulty beyond easy, normal and hard mode through one of the buildings. So, you can tailor your difficulty a fair bit more than normal games.\n\nBeyond the lack difficulty of normal mode, I wasn't really fussy on the art style of this game. The environments were fine and it was interesting how it appeared as you walked towards them, but the character designs kind of irked me. The controls felt more clunky after having played other isometric combat games. At first I was thinking, \"well, this is a really old indie game\" but as my friend pointed out Mario 3 and SMW have great controls and they're much older.\n\nI find it especially weird how this game throws a ton of different weapons, sub-weapons, passive abilities, and upgrades at you. I'm all for variety and this is actually a strength of the game, but it feels weird to have so much variety when the game is so short. I finished it in two sittings and the first sitting wasn't very long. I guess the game figures you'll want to replay it? After the bull shield challenge, I stopped doing all of the weapon challenges. So, I did skip a lot of available content, but I just wasn't really enjoying it that much. That said the weapon challenges are for specific weapons. So, the variety still seems like a lot for a short game.\n\nPositives? Well, as everyone has mentioned, the narrator of the game is great. It's actually nice for a game to throw exposition at you while you're doing stuff in a game, rather than constant cutscenes or having to walk around and talk to people. That was definitely a change of pace. I also thought the music was well done. Not amazing, but it was certainly good. Anyway, I'm sure if you have interest in this game, you've probably already played it by now.

But one day that wall is gonna fall.\"\n- Bastion\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcbb Description:[/h1]\nA small selection of games has impacted the Indie genre immensely in the past few years, as they introduced new renovating ideas and concepts. Those games were the cornerstone of many small gaming studios, which steadily and progressively climbed mountains towards success. Among these small indie giants, Bastion deserves a leading spot. Being the first-ever title developed by Supergiant Games, this nostalgic adventure not only brings the player back to their childhood years but also offers immense satisfaction, from its flawless combination of beautiful artstyle to its engaging storytelling.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcd6 Setting:[/h1]\n[h3]Summary[/h3]\nBastion\u2019s storyline unfolds in a post-apocalyptic world, where the protagonist known as the Kid tries to find any remnants of humanity that survived the aftermath of the Calamity. In hopes of rebuilding the city of Haven for future generations, he embarks on a beautiful adventure with his trusty hammer on his shoulders. Will he be able to find hope in such dark times, only time will tell...\n\n[h3]Narrative[/h3]\nAt the beginning of the game, Bastion creates an illusion, as the storyline\u2019s main concept seems simple, without following any innovative recipe. Then suddenly, a soothing voice narrates the player\u2019s every step, sharing comments and info related to the story and the protagonist\u2019s background. Logan Cunningham, the narrator of this adventure, creates a unique experience, with quotes that change based on the player\u2019s actions and interactions. The simple addition of such a plain feature generates a beautiful atmosphere which, considering the game\u2019s release date, makes Bastion ahead of its time. \n\nThere are four different story modes that affect how the NPCs interact with the protagonist. It is essential to mention that the player has a certain amount of times they can come back to the spot they died. Once all the chances are used up, the level repeats itself from the beginning.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Name[/th]\n[th]Description[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Normal Mode[/td]\n[td]This mode starts a fresh new game.

On top of that, levels are repeatable with a scoring system.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1] \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Gameplay:[/h1]\nLots of detail has been put into the creation of the levels, as well as the combat system. That\u2019s why, gameplay-wise, Bastion is unique. Despite its simplicity, the controls provide a great variety of movements that, combined, generate special skills and different approaches to various situations.\n\n[h3]Level design[/h3]\nThe shining beacon of Bastion is immediately distinguished in its asymmetric design. The terrain is formed while the player traverses the landscape, a neat feature that gives the game a sense of curiosity. On top of that, there are tons of secrets found in the background that can be easily missed, as most of the time, they are overshadowed by the levels\u2019 charming aesthetics.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830367045\n[h3]Combat[/h3]\nThrough the course of the story, the player will get accustomed to many weapons and mechanics that provide lots of synergistic combinations. The protagonist can carry only two guns, as well as a shield that provides cover. He also has the ability to dodge attacks with a barrel roll, which can be used as many times as he likes. Each weapon opens the door to a variety of special attacks, which in turn can be activated through the use of Black Tonics. Last but not least, health potions can replenish health, but I advise caution since there is a limit to how many the Kid can carry.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830369946\n[h3]Progression[/h3]\nThe main objective of the game is to collect cores. Each level is packed full of enemies and challenges that, upon completion, will provide the necessary shards, from which the core is formed. Various challenges can also be encountered to test the player\u2019s kit and weapon mastery. Those are available on the main map and they mostly reward the player with weapon upgrades, points and exp.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830372502\n[b]Collectables[/b]\nThrough the various corners of the asymmetric environments, the protagonist can find potions that unlock buffs upon consumption, or even weapon pieces, which lead to new upgrades. In addition, each action; from killing an enemy to destroying certain pieces of the environment, offers points that eventually can help the protagonist buy upgrades and various unlockable skills.\n\n[b]The Bastion[/b]\nBetween levels, the Kid will be able to prepare his kit in his HQ, the Bastion, as it offers all the necessary merchant shops available. Each shop is unlocked automatically while the player progresses the story; however, which of them will be unlocked first, is determined upon individual choice. They can also be upgraded, but that is more of an ending goal.\n\n[h3]Difficulty[/h3]\nThanks to the introduction of the Shrine, players can invoke the power of the Gods, by increasing the difficulty of the game in a variety of ways. In exchange, each invoked god grants a passive boost to XP gain and Fragment drops; the game\u2019s currency. In case the player does not feel challenged enough, the Bastion also provides \"Who Knows Where\", alternate, dreamlike dimensions, where the Kid can fight off waves of enemies, while the narrator slowly reveals a character's past. \n\n[h1]\ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8 Visuals:[/h1]\nFew things can be said for Bastion\u2019s beautiful hand-drawn animations, as ultimately, they can speak for themselves. Beautiful characters with distinct colours mix well with the vibrant environment of the background, proving why Supergiant Games is the leading player in this department. Jen Zee (art director) made sure to leave her unique touch in this detailed word, a feature worth praise.\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfa7 Audio:[/h1]\nCunningham\u2019s unique acting skills are merging perfectly with the background music, which includes four vocal tunes, as well as many instrumental pieces. Darren Korb (music director) and his crew did a fantastic job in developing a deep emotional connection with all of the characters that personally left me astonished. The sounds are well made, yet at the same time feel lacking, without leaving a strong impact. Nonetheless, I was happy to notice that HD rumble was featured in the game, providing additional immersion. \n\n[h1]\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Side Notes:[/h1]\nDespite its age, Bastion works flawlessly without performance issues. The only nuisance I can think of is in the way the terrain unfolds since it isn\u2019t always clear where its edge is located.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udccb Verdict:[/h1]\nAlmost a decade after the game\u2019s original release, Bastion still retains its unique narration, beautiful artstyle and simple gameplay. Everything mixes well together forming a perfect Indie recipe. It is a game that defined my childhood years and I am glad it still maintains its charm.\n\n[quote]Follow our Curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/] Summit Reviews [/url], to see more high quality reviews regularly.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1650834016, "timestamp_updated": 1670843068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819542765617370605", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114369902": {"recommendationid": "114369902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063804295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1650765364}, "language": "english", "review": "gud gam\n", "timestamp_created": 1650764596, "timestamp_updated": 1650764596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114300579": {"recommendationid": "114300579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165244083", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 613, "last_played": 1650657619}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tremendo juego, muy poco conocido para lo bueno que es, muy buena jugabilidad, variedad de armas (muy creativas), poderes y formas de mejorar al personaje, la historia no esta mal y los graficos son bastante bonitos y al parecer todo esta dibujado a mano.

With a moving story told through solid, simple action gameplay and a host of striking visuals alongside an outstanding soundtrack, this game is an essential PC gaming experience. Lose yourself in this addictive post-apocalyptic landscape as you undertake an unforgettable adventure.\n\nYou play as The Kid, a white-haired young man with a knack for dodge rolls and violence. At the behest of an older man named Rucks, The Kid must travel around a ruined land post-Calamity to salvage materials to power the Bastion, a floating island that serves an unclear purpose. Along the way, fight a wide variety of wildlife and machines, collect scraps and mementos from the past society, arm yourself with nearly a dozen different weapons, and build up the Bastion to customize your experience and reassemble what you can of civilization.\n\nThe first major release from developer Supergiant Games, most known more recently for the hack-'n-slash roguelike [i]Hades[/i], [i]Bastion[/i] is a game of both gorgeous artistry and excellent gameplay. Combat sequences take up most of the player's time; setpieces spawn throughout levels that players can take on armed with a shield and two weapons of their choice. Enemies have distinct weaknesses to certain weapons, giving levels some replayability down the line as players challenge them outfitted with different equipment. [i]Bastion[/i] also has a decent exploration element, with levels chock full of upgrade materials, mementos that reveal lore, and tons of currency to collect. This currency can be spent in a few ways back at the Bastion, allowing the player to tailor their own experience through the game's dozen or so levels.\n\n[i]Bastion[/i] is a pleasure to witness from the sights and sounds it provides. The game features a number of iconic facets of  art design, ranging from floating level terrain that spawns in virtually underfoot to the soothing-yet-wizened narration of Rucks. With a wide color palatte and level backgrounds bordering on the psychedelic, there's always something good to look at with this one. An outstanding soundtrack compliments the visuals, with songs that match the story's emotional beats and even sporting lyrics corresponding to relevant people or places. Gameplay is enough of a smooth affair that even the less seasoned gamers who simply wish to try this for the story or the aesthetics will find this accessible and rewarding.\n\nThough [i]Bastion[/i] is a decently short adventure, with a full run clocking in at a little over four hours, this game offers players a rich experience with plenty to do. Take on custom challenges to bolster your favorite weapons, fight in arena combat for practice or to experience more of the story, fulfill a host of missions to earn rewards, or further increase the game difficulty with a range of modifiers that amp up the intensity and the rewards. Even this length for a single run is deceptive, as a robust New Game Plus mode can easily bring players back in for a second or third time to tackle completionist objectives or to see what consequences different choices in the story yield.\n\n[i]Bastion[/i] is a mark of excellence for indie gaming. It manages to tell a compelling story with gameplay satisfying to newbies or challenge seekers. Tons of content and replay value, an amazing OST and inspiring world design, simple combat that doesn't get old - there are endless reasons for you to embark on this journey, least of which should be the low sale price this game often goes up for. Play this one as soon as possible.

You unlock many different weapons as you progress through the game, and not only do they each handle differently, they also all tend to actually be fun to use in their own way. They become even more fun to use as you upgrade them, allowing you to give them special abilities (like lighting enemies on fire) or buffing their stats (like increased critical hit chance and damage). Combat remains fun and engaging from beginning to end.\n\nIt is worth it to explore the nooks and crannies of the levels, as you can find materials that will allow you to upgrade weapons, as well as currency and experience. While you can't go back to levels you've beaten to find things you missed, in a nice touch whatever items you missed will end up in the \"Lost & Found\" where you can buy them with the currency you've accumulated. This way you can't accidentally lock yourself out of being able to upgrade any particular weapon. You also gain access to a variety of special moves (many linked to specific weapons), as well as optional buffs you can equip to suit your play style. Eventually you even gain the ability to make the game more difficult by buffing the enemies. The more buffs you stack, the greater the money and experience you gain from them (although I would have liked to see greater benefits considering how much more difficult using this system makes the game). There are also \"Proving Grounds\" for each weapon, challenging your prowess with each weapon in exchange for rewards. Some of these were surprisingly easy, while others seemed darn near impossble without first powering up the weapon to its maximum level and selecting specific power-ups.\n\nThe presentation is also great, with one caveat. I love the vibrant and colorful worlds and the way they \"assemble\" from fragments of land that ascend from below to form the terrain as you explore it. The music is also quite good, with a Western influence that gives the game a unique feel. The Western influence extends to one of Bastion's more recognizable gimmicks: One of the in-game characters narrates everything that happens as it's happening, giving you plot details and offering commentary on your actions and discoveries. While this is an ambitious creative choice that often impressed me (I like how you get commentary based on what combination of weapons you've chosen to take into battle), it's also distracting when you're getting an exposition dump at the same time an intense battle is taking place. This is especially egregious in the \"Who Knows Where\" areas, where you're intended to get backstory on some of the game's main characters but for the life of me I just couldn't follow the narration and the combat at the same time.

Playing Bastion, it was easy to see the building blocks for the future masterpiece: The combat style, the array of weapons, and the mountain of thought and care put into the script itself.\n\tWhat Bastion does right is several things. I\u2019d like to start with my favorite aspect of the game: the narration and story. \u201cThe Stranger\u201d follows us the player, \u201cThe Boy\u201d, while giving us a hindsight angle on the happenings, as if telling a story over a campfire or a good drink. You\u2019d think that someone talking over a majority of the game may get old, but every time you hear that voice, you want to hear what he\u2019s going to say, and he never disappoints. The story itself works well with the game\u2019s short playtime, which left me satisfied yet ready for more the game may throw me if I decide to replay with NG+. There were a handful of \u201cwow\u201d moments that will stick with me for a long time, where my choices felt impactful in the best kinds of ways.\n\tMy second favorite aspect of the game is the combat. With the array of weapons and skills to choose from, choosing your favorite 2-weapon plus skill combo is no easy choice. I myself ended up with a short-ranged main weapon along with a long-ranged secondary, and an aoe skill. While I felt like the feel of the combat was there, sometimes it left something to be desired, perhaps spoiled by the perfection Supergiant rose to in Hades. With that said, the formula is still there and resulted in very rewarding gameplay, along with leaving me having several great moments.\n\tBefore I talk about my last minor gripe with the game, I would also like to call out the music of this game. I\u2019ll admit I had listened to some of it prior to playing this game, but boy, in addition to some songs I missed, hearing them in context just made them so much better. I will for sure be visiting them again, and soon.\n\tMy last major gripe with the game is also a boon to it, which may sound oxymoronic but I feel like I cannot review the game accurately without voicing it. I have a gripe with part of the core design of the game \u2013 the \u2018rebuilding\u2019 of the game\u2019s maps. While I agree it adds charm to the game, it honestly felt unnecessary at times. And while I could have missed an explanation, I ended the game with uncertainty if it was actually happening in the game\u2019s canon or simply a design choice. \n\tAt the end of it all, this is still a great game that managed to do a whole lot in its short playtime, which I would recommend any big fan of Hades or of the genre overall to do a playthrough of to further appreciate Supergiant\u2019s growth. 8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1647634382, "timestamp_updated": 1647634382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112415598": {"recommendationid": "112415598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128424760", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1512042181}, "language": "english", "review": ":D", "timestamp_created": 1647617471, "timestamp_updated": 1647617471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112389788": {"recommendationid": "112389788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198853397925", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1647575029}, "language": "english", "review": "it's good", "timestamp_created": 1647575077, "timestamp_updated": 1647575077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112384586": {"recommendationid": "112384586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178161727", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1648906238}, "language": "english", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1647566716, "timestamp_updated": 1647566716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112355576": {"recommendationid": "112355576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192309399", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1647618977}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es bonito y est\u00e1 entretenido para jugar un rato.

The game art in general, is quite nice, cheacters looks very short and cute, almost chibi-style. The game doesn't have any animated cut-scenes, instead they are portrayed through still pictures of scenes. \n\nStory:\nTook me a while to get my head around the story because it takes place in a world rich in lore and your game starts in the middle of it. I personally didn't find the story intriguing but you can tell the game developers spent time curating a believable fantasy world, and I appreciate it.\n\nGameplay:\nTop down, action role-playing. You can choose your mix-match of weapons, powerup tonics, weapon enhancemements and even \"idols\" (which make the game more difficult but in return yield more XP and money). Your character doesn't speak and much of what is said is done through a narrator (of another character you meet early in the game). I like that the world and levels in this game are creatively designed on floating tiles that either fall away or rise up around you as you walk around but this makes falling down a risk, as you don't die but without a certain tonic in place, you'll end up taking damage when you spawn again. I'd describe the game as easy because on a simple play through it's easy to power up your weapons and abilities and end up really overpowered by the end of the story, though the other modes and getting the achievements can be quite brutal...which leads onto...\n\nSteam Achievements: This took me about 50+ tries to get 100% on several levels. Most importantly, you have to complete the game a minimum of about 2 times, and then up to level 2 on Score Attack Mode. The hardest achievement for me was the \"About the Author\" achievement, where even watching it done through a guide and trying myself, I ended up having to redo it 50+ times to get it perfect. But all achievements are attainable with enough patience, practice and time; and thankfully, not as skill dependant as achievements for other games (this is because enemies in Bastion spawn randomly and sometimes, if you're lucky they'll spawn far away from you or in the line of sight of a turret you laid down).\n\nOther:\nThis game has replay value in both the steam achievement hunting and also because there are multiple possible endings. There are plenty of weapon combinations and stuff for you to try out on later run-throughs too! \nI did not like the narration honestly. No offence to the voice actor (who has a splendid voice), but the script had some very corny one-liners in it. It sounded like every sentence had to be cool or quotable but it offered no personality or enhancement to the story. \nThere were a few bugs I encountered, none of them game breaking but pretty much involved restarting the stage all over again.\nI would reccommend people play the game because overall, I enjoyed it on my first run through. It's not the usual type of game I'd buy or play but this one has made me feel like I am missing out on other good games in the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1646809203, "timestamp_updated": 1646809203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111836628": {"recommendationid": "111836628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025679205", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1646517037}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a nice fairly quick game.

I hated the diagonal map design (northeast to Southwest) instead of your normal north to south style map.  I do realize this was done to make it look better but it took away from game-play because of it.  Also I felt that the game-play got monotonous real fast even with the assortment of different weapons and skills.  \n\nArtistically it looked very pretty, especially the Kid's design itself.  And as far as the narrator, although I didn't really like his voice but he did a great job and I felt as though he wanted his narration to sound like something out of the wild west.\n\nSo what I can say about this game is that it's NOT epic but it's good.

First off, it's awesome to see features such as the overall design, music, sound effects and many more being created for Bastion and also being implemented into Hades. The overall art style is really nice, the music (shoutout to Darren Korb & Ashley Barrett) is absolutely incredible, the sound effects are good and the gameplay is enjoyable thanks to the many equippable and upgradable items which make the gameplay less repetitive. The story is pretty good, although I wish everything was explained a bit clearer and more in-depth at the beginning, as for a while I was a tad confused about various things.

Weapon upgrades are standard \"do more damage\" or \"have a chance to crit\", paling in comparison to the Daedelus hammers and weapon aspects in Hades, which can significantly change the weapon and how you use it. In general there's a lack of \"punch\" to the combat; more often than not, killing enemies feels unsatisfying, they just die and it feels like nothing.\n\nThe story and characters:\nYou have a homebase that you can build stuff into, using things called \"cores\" that you find from missions that you fly into from your homebase. That's the \"story\" I guess, because there's barely any characters in this game from what I saw, basically just your player character (whose name I don't know, if he even has one), a stranger in your homebase who's also the narrator apparently, and the enemies, which look much the same, but the narrator sometimes describes as characters of sorts. A far cry from the memorable cast of characters in Hades, essentially.\n\nThe graphics:\nSometimes pretty, sometimes too much clutter on the screen, but generally the best aspect of the game. That said, again, Hades is also better in this aspect, but even if Bastion had better graphics, Hades has the better gameplay, and to me, gameplay and story is more important than pretty graphics. If I can have both, fantastic, if not, don't focus so much on just graphics, just make sure they're consistent and prioritize gameplay being fun.\n\nOverall:\nThe one hour I spent playing the game felt one of the longest hours I've ever spent playing a videogame; the slow-moving character and the clumsy-feeling controls put me off pretty quickly already, but I kept pushing forward in the hopes of finding a good story and maybe growing to like the combat, yet after completing a few missions that felt much the same and had no real story to speak of, I concluded that it's unlikely that the game would suddenly change drastically for the better. In comparison, Hades felt great to play from the very beginning, and there was an actual story with interesting characters.\n\nSure, Bastion is a decade old game at the time of writing this, but even if this was 2011 and we had no Hades to compare to, I would much rather play a game like Diablo 2, which at the time of Bastion's release was also a decade old game, because it did all of the above better than Bastion (minus maybe the graphics in terms of prettiness). Just play Hades instead of this, or find something else if you're bored of Hades.\n\nRating:\n5/10 - technically not a bad game (it functions, didn't seem to have any bugs etc), but why would you play this, when there are far better games out there?", "timestamp_created": 1644322313, "timestamp_updated": 1644322313, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.337688028812408447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109773423": {"recommendationid": "109773423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185179718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1692213133}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good, I promise", "timestamp_created": 1644311590, "timestamp_updated": 1644311590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109765690": {"recommendationid": "109765690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397963603", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1647384422}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful and fun game.

The characters are pretty decent while it could be argued that there isn't really any characterisation or that much voice acting in the game, i think the use of Rucks being the narrator of the game is really well used as he goes into many topic matter such as the actions of the Kid, the history of the different locations that you will venture etc, and it just makes the game that much enjoyable from a narrative standpoint. The story itself is pretty interesting as there are many things revealed to the player and also many mysteries that leaves a lot for the player to come up with their own conclusions. While it may look like a simple restore the world and betrayal type of plot, Bastion has much more intense and thought provoking themes within its structure that players will soak up and enjoy. \nThe setting that this game takes place in is well developed and each level is distinct in its own way from one another. There are areas such as mines, city markets, dense jungles, crystal labyrinths etc that are all presented in the games beautiful design and makes them feel mystical and apocalyptic, giving the game its own image to stand out from the other indie titles out there.\nVisually, its really beautiful and unique. All of the character and enemy designs are really well detailed and the areas that i had mentioned before are very distinct and where completely different from any game that was released in 2011. The art style is done in a fantasy painting esque that is really satisfying to look at. Thankfully, Supergiant games has stuck with this style and have interpreted it to each new game that they have developed. \nThe sound and audio are extremely impressive with the soundtrack being able to go in all directions possible and still being able to pull off each and every style that it attempts, to the audio of enemies, weapons and even the simplest of things like selecting tonics or gods being on point and sounding that they fit perfectly in the world that Supergiant have developed. \nIn terms of gameplay, its really impressive, especially coming from (at the time) a new indie development team. The only nit pick i will say and get out the way immediately is the fact that i think that combat can be a bit too basic, but the game does have means for the player to be given a challenge. You'll have your standard actions such as roll, melee attack, ranged attack, super attack etc, but the game elevates this by giving the player so many options as to approach combat. The array of weapons that are provided in game is really impressive and allows the player to mix and match between them to give them their most preferable play style. These weapons can also be upgraded by using the in came currency and certain items that can be found or bought. Each upgrade that a weapon can get can be switched around to give the player even more versatility in terms of gameplay. There are tonics that are used as perks in the game and just like the weapon upgrade system, each time you level up you can have another slot to add another tonic. This allows for players to mix and match perks in what order suits them. There is a shrine where the player can carry out and complete achievements in return for currency. I mean the list goes on for what this game has to offer such as enemy buffs the player can put on in exchange for xp and reward boosts, items shop, weapon challenges to unlock new special abilities etc. This game has it all and makes itself accessible to anyone who interested in playing. Finally, the game offers many modes as to play the game such as new game plus, a round based mode and so on. \nOverall, Bastion was a brilliant start to Supergiant Games's catalogue and i would 100% recommend this to anyone wanting an amazing RPG/beat em up with and engaging story, beautiful visuals and a breath taking soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1644253500, "timestamp_updated": 1644253500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109692019": {"recommendationid": "109692019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011921356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 853, "last_played": 1692932008}, "language": "english", "review": "fun af", "timestamp_created": 1644203995, "timestamp_updated": 1644203995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109678292": {"recommendationid": "109678292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096851412", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1644185252}, "language": "english", "review": "I Played this for the first time on IOS.

interested in playing this game ever since I finished Hades, as I really enjoyed it and the clips I saw of Bastion looked like it had similar gameplay aspects. Recently played this game since my friend gifted it to me and I was not disappointed at all. If we are comparing this game to Hades, I do feel that Hades is still the better game, but that is kind of a given, considering that Bastion is the first game Supergiant made and Hades was a result of everything they learnt from making this, Transistor and Pyre. If you liked Hades though, I do feel you would like this game as the gameplay is quite similar and it has a nice story. \n\nThe game is very short, as you can finish the game in about 7 hours (I played through new game plus so my time is about twice that length), with the game being comprised of short areas you traverse through to progress the story, so you can just hop on and play at anytime basically. I think this is the part where I gush over the gameplay, as I really liked the gameplay. The combat, while again not as good as Hades, is very fun, as the environment and movement options allow you to use different approaches to various situations. You also get a wide variety of weapons throughout the game, which you can upgrade by collecting the specific material for that weapon or buying it, then buying the upgrade. This allows for a variety of differing playstyles, all of which are fun to just try out. To try them out or grind for money, there are arenas in the bastion where you can fight wave after wave of enemies. These arenas or dreams also give you backstories/a better look at the personalities of the characters in the game which I think is a brilliant way to tell a story.\n\nSpeaking of characters, the characters are very well developed in my opinion considering the amount of screentime they get. Excluding Rucks, who narrates the entire game, there are also Zulf and Zia, who you meet as you progress through the story. These two dont get much screentime as you wont spend too much time in the Bastion with them, but I feel like their characters were actually explored well considering that. \n\nThe OST of this game is also very nice, as some of the tracks really does hit you in the feels and fit with the narratives and characters very well. Overall, very solid game. Dont expect this to be as good as Hades, but you can clearly see the amount of growth Supergiant has gone through over the years.", "timestamp_created": 1643610043, "timestamp_updated": 1643610043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537953794002532959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109150113": {"recommendationid": "109150113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010421755", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1656741440}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Divertido para matar el rato", "timestamp_created": 1643593970, "timestamp_updated": 1643593970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109148474": {"recommendationid": "109148474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283631377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1643591761}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly...amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1643591818, "timestamp_updated": 1643591818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109145167": {"recommendationid": "109145167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169147843", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1643427960}, "language": "english", "review": "Bastion es un juego hermoso, el juego cuenta con escenarios pintados a mano que te asombra en cada momento que lo estas jugando, aunque a veces confunde este mapeado, ya que Bastion el escenario cae del cielo y en un baile hipn\u00f3tico se va formando ante ti, aunque hermoso tambien es lioso, ya que muchas veces confunde tu sentido comun en el camino logico del mapa.\n\nEl combate de Bastion es muy entretenido ya que Bastion cuenta con un arsenal demasiado grande para su duracion, hay armas de todos los tipos y me parecio genial lo diferentes que son cada una de la otra, esto crea muchas formas diferentes de comportarse en cada batalla, haciendolas muy diferentes dependiendo de que decidas llevarte a la batalla, aunque tambien es cierto que a mi me parecio que el ultimo arma que vas desbloqueando es la mas idonea para la zona en la que te encuentras, siendo las ultimas armas las mejores, al menos para mi.\n\nLa historia del juego es entretenida, nada para tirar cohetes pero siempre quise saber que rayos sucedia y cuando termino el juego todo hizo click de una manera muy brillante, ademas de la historia el juego cuenta con un narrador, que al principio me molesto, pero luego viendo que tenia dialogos para tantos escenarios y situaciones le comence a coger cari\u00f1o y a gustarme.\n\nEl juego cuenta con coleccionables, brebajes y materiales de mejora, haciendo estos que de una u otra forma tu personaje vaya mejorando cada vez, dado esto la dificultad del juego no es elevada incluso usando el sistema de altares del juego, que potencian la dificultad del juego agregandole caracteristicas extra a los enemigos.\n\nLa musica es buenisima!, y en la recta final si te sentias en un evento importante, porque la musica te lo pone asi.\n\nBastion es un excelente juego, cortito, disfrutable, muy bonito a la vista, con excelente musica y dificultad moderada, a pesar de los a\u00f1os sigue siendo muy entretenido.", "timestamp_created": 1643587170, "timestamp_updated": 1643587170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109143974": {"recommendationid": "109143974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980150822", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1643585500}, "language": "english", "review": "It's worth it for the story\n\nThe gameplay isn't the selling point, the mechanics aren't earth breaking and the map design can be frustrating at times.

I've completed 100% of its achievements, which requires 2 full playthroughs and 1 NG+ playthrough.\n\nThe story, the ambience, the music, and especially the Narrator, make this game a very unique experience, where you get pulled into the story slowly without realizing it. It shows that it is carefully crafted in every aspect.\n\nThere are several game modes available:\n- Standard will make this game a challenging and fun experience, albeit frustrating at times just like any other challenge.\n- No-sweat mode is great for people who want to experience the story and remove the frustration of restarting a level when dying.\n- New Game Plus starts you off with the upgrades obtained in the previous playthrough, and unlocking several new bonuses. You will feel powerful, be able to try different builds, and challenge yourself in more interesting ways.\n- Score Attack mode is overall a different experience, and I'd say it's a good endgame once you've learnt everything there is about this game.

It kept a lot of things simple, such as resource managment (you only have health potions and charges for your special attack) and whatever weapon you chose, you had a ground layer of mechanics that you always had and always functioned the same, namely the dodge roll and the shield to reflect attacks. Yet the weapons allowed you to adjust whatever playstyle you had, with melees having different ranges and speeds aswell as partially ranged capabilities, and the actual ranged weapons didn't try to be a full upgrade of one another, but rather sidegrades, with each weapon having a pretty unique ability (apart from the repeating ones, those did kinda feel samey).\n\nThe level design is also well-made and you'll most likely enjoy every bit of it, and as you progress, you will notice a tonal shift according to the story, which is also great to experience. There are some secrets hidden here and there, but they are never impossibly well hidden, you just need to explore a little to find them.\n\nThe story itself is also amazingly well done. It starts out slow, but as you progress, the story gets more \"personal\" as what you hear is not only what has happened, but also what you have seen and what you did. It doesn't feel like there are any bad moments in the story, and it's never super shoved in your face, which is also nice.\n\nThe only gripes are these:\n[list]\n[*] once you completed areas, you can't go back. This feels a bit bad, as I often felt I had to explore everything to not miss out on such, causing me to lose health and time.\n[*] while it's easy to hit bigger objects laying on the ground, smaller floating objects were much harder to hit. I never got a good feel as to where I need to aim for, as both the shadow as well as the body itself didn't reliably do the trick.\n[*] sometimes it's hard to tell what is background and what is actual ground, so I did fall on occasion, however I want to stress that this is the rare exception than the norm.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, a great game, and for that price you can't go wrong, especially since it does have a great replayability value.", "timestamp_created": 1641479185, "timestamp_updated": 1641479185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107418905": {"recommendationid": "107418905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045031768", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1554, "last_played": 1642216891}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

Darren kicking ass with this soundtrack, I spent the entire last week singing some songs to myself; Logan's voice acting is as amazing as it is in Hades, what a talented fella; Ashley's singing also caught my heart and the writing of this game, GOD, what a good story!\nThe ending got me in tears (specially the ''carrying'' section), and I love the narration style, it reminds me so much of many books I've read.\nHonestly I thought the gameplay wasn't gonna be very fun, but it didn't take long at all for me to start enjoying the dynamic of 2 weapons, the skills and the roll dive.\nThis game is great and is a must for everyone who likes gaming, BUY IT!", "timestamp_created": 1641061034, "timestamp_updated": 1641061133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107030600": {"recommendationid": "107030600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025016904", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1641010515}, "language": "english", "review": "Starts with an unskippable cut scene.

When the game came out it was coupled with various steam events, including having later the main voice actor of this game as an announcer in Dota 2. It\u2019s one of these games where you can\u2019t really make up your mind on it when you only play it once due to its gameplay systems.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nAs an action-adventure from a top-down perspective it has the usual abilities, small stat increases, and weapon upgrades. Generally, it plays rather bland as the game will give you a new weapon almost every level. These levels usually benefit using these weapons in one way or another but, especially when doing arena fights, it becomes obvious which weapons are good and which are completely useless.  Often in these type of games the combat is the best, here its totally fine but you mostly play it for the story.\n\nThe map design also doesn\u2019t play into the games favour, as I would say that random floating objects in the sky make for a cool concept they aren\u2019t as fun as they seem to be. A lot of the maps become rather bland and due to the more isometric top down camera the whole perspective doesn\u2019t work that well when being forced to walk narrow paths in a really weird perspective. This makes some people even rage quit as you will fall a lot down and get damage. This can be managed.\n\nHitboxes can be weird. You can automatically or manually aim. The first isn\u2019t always optimal as it will always aim at the person closest to you not the one with the lowest hp or any other priority you might need. Another example is the broken blocking system. In order to block you need to lock onto a target as moving with the mouse isn\u2019t a thing. This is awful if you try to block things, but an enemy is directly in front of you the protagonist will make a 360 and just get himself hurt.\n\nThis made the gameplay rather average. Bland. In itself its not something you really get for its gameplay as there are more well thought out games in this genre.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nNow the reason the game stood out was less because its story itself but rather how it is presented. The story is told by a person who basically comments on everything. And due to the writing, it works very well giving the game a depth that it didn\u2019t have before. The storyteller sometimes addressed the player indirectly, especially when talking about the main character as a kid who is a young adult which fits to me as I played the game when I was rather young.\n\nInitially its quite curious what\u2019s going on. The story is told weird, additionally some things are never explained. But in the end, it comes to a good conclusion that didn\u2019t left me disappointed. Its less character driven and more narrative driven, quite literally.\nIt\u2019s a story that cant really be told by books or movies so it sets itself apart and has its own validation for existing.\n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nThe game got an interesting repertoire of tracks. Additionally, it fits into the narrative as well as the game not only has its combat and ambient tracks but also some which feature vocals that the game even addresses at some point giving and playing into the established lore.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nIts quite interestening that they managed to make a game blend three types of graphical artstyles neatly into each other. As in the background the game features still images that picture aren\u2019t really possible to make out that well featuring distant landscapes. Ontop of that you have the regular paths the main character is walking around, which are static drawings but they appear from time to time and also have a 2.5 dimensional perspective so to say. You character on the other hand is completely 3D .\n\n[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]\nI think its not such a great game as people makes it out to be but it is very memorable solely for its presentation, story, narrative and soundtrack. There are reasons you should play this game but its totally understandable if people dislike it because of its gameplay.\n\nAbove average ARPG", "timestamp_created": 1640823974, "timestamp_updated": 1689002780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621585547924041748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106865615": {"recommendationid": "106865615", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990340333", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2995, "last_played": 1642575042}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1640823221, "timestamp_updated": 1640823221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106857091": {"recommendationid": "106857091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122908340", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 479, "last_played": 1640814922}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is top notch, the game gives you plenty of movement controls so as to make even the walking portion fun.

I am not someone who takes apart games by its littlest detail. So I will just review over my impressions of the game and how it over all made me feel. After all, if a game made you feel something and got you really thinking, then the game did its job right? \n\nI tend to be a pretty bad game hopper, so it was only recently that I decided to finally start going down my steam list, one by one. This was the very first game on my list and boy, was it an amazing start to that decision. \n-------\n\nAs a disclaimer: This is not my first SuperGiants game, my very first was HADES, and I can say that I loved HADES (Switch Port) so much, that I just needed to get and play all of the other SuperGiant games. Little did I know that Bastion was their very first game and man, I wish it was longer because it's a wonderful experience. \n\nGameplay/Genre/Combat: It works very similarly to Hades actually, go figure its the same company. However, there are some differences! You have a lot more weapons to choose from, you can wield two weapons (For an example, my main weapon is the hammer and my secondary are the Duel Pistols), and you have a Secret Skill or technique. You can only have one Secret Skill at a time and every time you activate it, it takes away a Black Potion which allows you to use the skill. You have a certain amount of healing potions and black potions but can pick them up as you go. Along with THOSE potions, you are given a different set of potions. Every time you level up, a new slot for a new potion is added to your Distillery. You can apply them to your character as a boost while you play the game. Each one has a certain ability like being able to do +25% Damage when you Counter as an example. You can dodge roll and you can even block with a shield! The game-play itself is a rouge-like action role-play, so it is very quick, its a little slow at the beginning, but once you get used to it you become a speed demon! If you want to give yourself a challenge, you can invoke the gods in the game at the shrine which allows the enemies to be stronger, faster, damage resistant and much more. It's very crafty and clever for their very first game, you can feel the HADES similarities if your first game was HADES. If THIS is your first SuperGiant game, then I can say that its a smooth ride from this game to the next one.\n\nMusic and Art: Stunning, the composer for this game (Darren Korb) is the same man who did HADES and I think he is THE composer for SuperGiant. He is just amazing at bringing the game to life, the music is fantastic and I cant help but groove to it every time. The art is also stunning, (Made by Jen Zee) there is always beauty and intricacy to every small detail, it is all 3D models to a 2D made background and I love the artistic visuals and views that this artist puts into the game. The music and art blend together beautifully, along with the game-play and movement make a very easy, yet a challenging, and fun experience. Very pleasing to the eyes and the ears.\n\nStory: The story is short and sweet but also bitter sweet at the same time. I wont get too far into it, I don't want to spoil anyone. The story is something you put together over time, the narrator is telling a story to you, about The Kid (you), the other people you meet, the world you find yourself in, the weapons you acquire and much more. The more mementos (items in the areas you land in after the world broke into pieces) you find, the more you get to learn about the culture's that used to be there and so on. It is a short but yet sweet story of destruction, loss and desperation, But also hope, growth, and home. \n\nCharacters: They are all wonderful, over time you get used to the narrator speaking over your game as you learn more. Not to spoil too much, my favorite character is the Survivor, as I am a very hopeful person to people like him. They all have their own individual stories that you can go through if you pick up their specific mementos and belongings. You get to learn about how they grew up and how they ended up where they are now. How SuperGiant executes interacting with the characters is wonderful, I just wish you were able to interact with them more than just approaching them with certain items. But they go through their own smaller character arcs.\n\nLeveling: It is slow. But worth the small grind! As you go through the areas again and again you will level up, and when you do, you get to unlock a new potion slot. The potion spot at the Distillery allows you to   have potions that make you stronger and more beefy as you defeat enemies and go through the story, or to help make achievement hunting easier! \n\nOver-all Conclusion: It is amazing, absolutely wonderful, I truly believe so far that SuperGiant games does not miss when it comes to their games. They put a lot of thought and passion into what they make as an indie company and their games should be given more of a chance outside of the ground breaking Hades. Hades is a lot more open ended, no matter how many times you die you will always get new story progression and there is a lot you can do in the game. Bastion is shorter, a little more linear, and focuses on story, but even after 1 full play-through, I still have not maxed everything or tried everything and I hope to! But again I say that SuperGiant games does NOT miss, it only hits!\n\nSo try it out, you may end up falling deeper in love with these guys just like I have!", "timestamp_created": 1640203878, "timestamp_updated": 1640299349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527446269989013672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106294821": {"recommendationid": "106294821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870992865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1644155385}, "language": "english", "review": "The art style, narration, music, story, & gameplay are phenomenal.

However, despite its beauty I found it to not be overly enjoyable. It started with the combat; it's passable but not very fun; you might find otherwise but just could not get into it the way I did with Hades. Rolling off the level, weird quirky enemies, not hitting things when you think you will, and a few crashes didn't enhance my playthrough. Particularly the ranged weapons were underwhelming.

While picking up new weapons, killing new enemies, gives you flavour dialogue everywhere. Even in the upgrades menus, which I found quite bizarre but it was welcoming. I didn't know this until about an hour in, but clicking 'INFO' when hovering over things in the map gives you even more narrator dialogue. Fancy. It's not so much a big component as it is a very nice touch, and just the way most of the plot is delivered. A few small meta jokes but nothing major. Though the fact that most fluff was delivered through voice, in a game of this genre, did make me want to see it all.\n\nThe challenges that earn you certain rewards can also be quite difficult. That's not a bad thing, of course. Though the rest of the game is pretty easy in comparison. Generally, these are best done if you really want/need the bonuses. The Third Prize(, usually an upgrade item,) is practically given to you for each challenge finished. Upgrades tend to make these challenges easier, of course. \nSpeaking of challenges, Who Knows Where was a neat little addition with different backstories, a good few places to grind for the currency used for buying stuff. The only drawback is having to redo all the waves, even if completed before. Beating each Who Knows Where the first time is worth it, but I wouldn't replay them. The game tends to give you enough to get by without repeating them.\n\nAnother little nice thing is the dynamic music. It's very subtle in some cases, obvious in others, but adds a nice touch. I've always loved music with different tracks, that fade in and out depending on what's going on or due to a trigger.\n\nAs for the story (Spoilers, but I'll do my best to avoid them) the final two ending choices kind of threw me off guard a little bit. Don't get me wrong, I was genuinely invested, and when the choice menus popped I seriously had to think about both of them. The backstory through Who Knows Where was something I found myself wanting to explore too. Especially with the little trinkets you find throughout the game, showing them to each character and seeing what they have to say.\n\nThis game, like Transistor, also has a NG+ mode. While I'm not really interested in playing through at the moment, I'll certainly replay it again at some stage. I put this game off for a while, but when I got into it I really enjoyed it.", "timestamp_created": 1637598751, "timestamp_updated": 1637598751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103257964": {"recommendationid": "103257964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034106507", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1402890232}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1637564014, "timestamp_updated": 1637564014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103245611": {"recommendationid": "103245611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102938648", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1638588472}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun adventure with nice skills and upgrades", "timestamp_created": 1637542774, "timestamp_updated": 1637542774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103221537": {"recommendationid": "103221537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396186148", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1637607520}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, good gameplay loop, good story, and good progression. \nNothing stellar, except for the voice acting.

The gameplay was very boring after like 30 minutes and the story is in this case the second motive to play this game but it's just not interesting in the slightest. Now the art style on the other hand is pretty good but for me it isn't worth it to play an entire game purely for the artstyle if it doesn't have anything else. With that said though, I do recommend it because it's worth it when you get it on SALE but not even close to full price. It doesn't take all that long which i thought was a good thing in this case. \n\nNow I do have 8 hours in this game because I finished this game twice. The first time was around 2-3 years ago and I thought I had a quick ending and missed a lot of content until the 'true' ending. After just finishing it for a second time, I now come to realize this wasn't the case and just got a different ending but that doesn't matter since it was a decent enough timekiller.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nA decent game if you get it on sale and even then don't expect too much with it since besides the art-style and maybe the soundtrack there's not much else to behold.\n[h3]Rating[/h3]\n5,7/10", "timestamp_created": 1635800262, "timestamp_updated": 1635800425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481355905532836914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102041552": {"recommendationid": "102041552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035653429", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1635785979}, "language": "english", "review": "Figured I'd give this \"classic\" a try after loving Hades so much.

He comments on almost everything you do, providing almost all of the story information, and delivers a lot of flavor text. The game would be just as enjoyable RPG without it, and the story could have been conveyed through dialogue boxes, but the choice to use narration does A LOT to help with the tone. The narrator speaks through bon mots, and has the voice of a grizzled frontiersman... the way he talks tells you so much about what the culture of Caelondia, the destroyed city you rebuild throughout the course of the game, once was like. It matches perfectly with the swampy-banjoed soundtrack.\n\nBastion is a hack n' slash, and the gameplay helps you achieve a deep understanding of the different weapons you can use. It has special \"proving ground\" challenges that ask you to play with your weapons more and more efficiently. In-game currency is scarce, forcing you to complete \"vigils\", special challenges like shooting 12 bullets in a row without missing, in order to get paid. Levelling is also slow: the game asks you to opt into added difficulty to get more XP and money.\n\nI'm not a huge gamer, so maybe this mechanic isn't as revelatory to people who have played more RPGs than I have, but these are the design elements that make me enjoy Bastion.", "timestamp_created": 1635643869, "timestamp_updated": 1635643869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101911292": {"recommendationid": "101911292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199185377652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1635856548}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a classic homie.", "timestamp_created": 1635624111, "timestamp_updated": 1635624111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101908543": {"recommendationid": "101908543", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961373511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1635621233}, "language": "english", "review": "Some games you know if you like in the first few minutes.

Bastion is the very start of it I'd say and is awesome. But before you buy it a few things to keep in mind:\n\nGeneral:\n* Art is superb\n* Storytelling is amazing\n* Voice acting by Logan Cunningham is out of this world\n* Everything else that I can't detail adds up\n* But then the game is quite short. I did in 5ish hours, but I presume 3 hours should be more than enough for a first experience\n*  Menu UI is weird or unconventional for games I'd say\n* At least on my machine it stutters here and there. Nothing crazy, but since it can handle Monster Hunter World, Quantum Break and Control on ultra specs without even touching the fan this can be annoying\n\nMechanics\n* Simple easy replayable rogue-lite-like\n* Weapon loadout is really vast and you can do builds (but then the game doesn't seem to explore much of this aspect)\n* Story mode poses no challenges, but the challenges are real challenges\n* Part of the map allows you to fall and it doesn't quite follow visually. I've caught myself falling in places I though I'd stand while being able to fluctuate in other places where I should fall. So be careful with the edges\n* Aiming doesn't seem to follow the cursor correctly. With the dart weapon (I forget the name) there is always a catch where to place your cursor.

The sound-track kept me company for years travelling on public transport and will likely end up on every media playing device I own till the day I die.\n\nI can absolutely recommend Bastion. It's one of my long-time, all-time, favourite games. I don't have a lot of hours in it, it doesn't have a ton of replay value unless you're playing a specific, score-based, mode which doesn't really interest me (Hades feels like a stronger contender for that sort of game play), but every now and again I get a hankering for the story and it's always been worth returning to.\n\nFor being over 10 years old now it's a beautifully realized game. The controls are tight, the combat is engaging, the weapons are diverse and each fun and effective in their own right.

The gameplay is open ended as it allows you to mix together the different weapons and skills you find along your journey. This is balanced by only allowing you to manage a few items in total. You can even add different difficulty conditions that give it more of a rouge-like feeling.\n\nWhile exploring, the level's storytelling is intertwined with mostly narration. Character interactions aren't as common so if you're looking for an extremely detailed story this won't satisfy. Normally this approach can be boring or off putting but the writing is competent enough to still flesh out the world to a good degree. This is helped by most of the levels giving enough environmental detail to help you bridge the gap of how this world would feasibly operate outside of when the game takes place.\n\nThe overall run time for the game is on the shorter side with me finishing it in under 10 hours, however there is replay value for those interested in the gameplay loop. I believe the price is fair for what is given! If the time is a turn off Bastion is also hit pretty frequently when there are big site wide sales like the seasonal ones.

The game, released in 2011, showed us the possibilities of 2D action games and not only was it well-received in the gaming world, but it was also ported to platforms such as XBOX 360 and IOS in the future, continuing to exude its luster even today.\n\nThe unique and interesting narrative narration adds a lot of interest to the plot, which is not very impressive in itself. With its unique worldview, melodious music, and relaxing atmosphere, I can understand why this game has gained so much popularity, and the freely selectable battle system provides players with a variety of strategic options.\n\nBastion, being an older game, will inevitably have drawbacks that cannot be avoided due to its age. The unique worldview in the game did not get a good play, and the playability and fun of the game with today's eyes to measure also inevitably slightly inferior. The overall length of the game is not long, and not a lot of playable modes is often difficult to make players produce more weekend play motivation.\n\nBastion as the production team to lay the foundation of the production style of the game has been quite good. But it is after all a game released in 2011, and although it has not faded, players may need to consider whether they can accept its shortcomings.

It mixes together fairly unorthodox styles and ideas in storytelling, visuals and gameplay to an odd effect, but in such a way that you'll want to see where it goes and how it pans out. The protagonist is \"The Kid\", a silent and blank, but necessary and relevant individual who is abruptly spurned into action by the calamity, a disaster that has destroyed most of the known world. He's led by the double time character and narrator Locke to the eponymous Bastion, a special structure that may be some sort of a solution to the currently ailing world. From there, the kid is tasked with finding energy-rich shards to restore the Bastion.\n\nIt's a slightly rushed premise that's perhaps a little too eager, but it's well-realized enough to give a background of sense to the journey and all of the unusual and slightly wacky places visited. These places are wonderfully unique in person: old, classical architecture full of civil-war era stylings, strange toxic swamps and barren, dilapidated factories that all centre around a western theme and imbue the game with a desolate, out-on-the-frontier feeling.\n\nAlthough Bastion has an impressively dense and well-crafted atmosphere, it would be lacking without the exciting action of the combat. It's not finely-tuned and perfectly smooth, with timing and telegraphing being off and controls having a rough feel to them. However, it's flashy, reactive and there's enough variety in enemies and weapons to keep gameplay interesting and eventful.\n\nIf the aspects listed so far captured your attention, then the plot will hold your interest. It's dark and largely mysterious, and involves heavy subject matter. It's not that the existence of these themes and plot points is special, but the overall boldness of the game in this area makes for a tense and immersive experience.\n\nPerhaps the greatest thing about Bastion to me is that it feels like newly-explored territory in gaming, even today. There's no question that nothing specific about it really stands, and some parts are even quite cliche and mainstream, but sum total it's a memorable and original experience. As one of the early indie darlings, it no doubt exemplified the different and zany ideas characteristic of many to come.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1629134019, "timestamp_updated": 1629134019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97677376": {"recommendationid": "97677376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040447724", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 171, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1630729198}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good I personally think it's better than hades.", "timestamp_created": 1629119857, "timestamp_updated": 1629119857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97668948": {"recommendationid": "97668948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034103068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1567360165}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un buen juego, sencillo en todos los aspectos.

Featuring beautiful, hand-painted floating worlds, a sweeping soundtrack and quite possible the greatest narrator ever, Bastion is a gem of a game and deserves to be experienced.\n\nYou begin your quest to rebuild the world, going through various environments and trying to piece things back together. As you progress, you unlock new weapons and special abilities (which in some cases are tied to a particular weapon) - these are tied to world and story progression, with some abilities being linked directly or indirectly towards challenges and are presented as rewards. The other elements which lend a \"lite\" RPG tinge are the potions (which are unlocked by character level and provide various boosts and sometimes drawbacks as well), and the idol system which can be toggled. Some idols speed up the enemies, make them hit harder, enable them to dodge, remove health potion drops, etc. which effectively gives the game a customisable difficulty.\n\nThe most notable part though is the Narrator. Your story is told to you from waking, through the levels and right up to the end, relayed by the Narrator. The mechanic in itself is perhaps nothing remarkable, but the voice acting for this particular role is superb and really gives the game its character - the fact that some of the Narrator's statements are contextual (i.e. one section has the Narrator commenting on how many times you fall, if at all) just heightens the immersion. The constant voice is the most crucial aspect of this game and something it does astonishingly well. The soundtrack (which is also superb!) is the other part of the audio masterpiece that is Bastion, and is worth mention in its own right.\n\nThere is not much replayability here (story wise at least, challenge wise you can vary it almost to your heart's content) - but if this is a genre you enjoy, you should play Bastion at least once.

Thanks to this game, I can now say I LOVE playing video games. I can\u2019t put my finger on what it is exactly that I like so much about it. Maybe it was simply the game I needed at that point in my life? It felt just like you find a book, movie or music album that just resonates.\n\nThe music is perfect, the narration adds a lot to the immersion, the gameplay is sharp and the story is captivating. All of these put together make for one of my favourite games of all time.\n[h2]A Calamity for the ages[/h2]\nBastion is an isometric action platformer where you play the part of the Kid waking up after the Calamity. Wandering around and exploring parts of his beautiful post-apocalyptic world, the Kid seeks survivors as well as answers. What caused everyone to turn to stone? What lies beyond the Wall? Venture forth while slaying all manner of beasts to find out.\n\nI found the story, about hope, the future and how to (re)build it, quite appealing. The world\u2019s lore and history are revealed little by little, with every level and stage, through the narrator\u2019s gritty voice. There\u2019s also \u201cdream-like\u201d levels (called \u201cWho Knows Where\u201d) where the personal story of each of the characters is revealed in greater details - if you can beat enough stages.\n\nThe story is well defined enough that even the various weapons, mementos and spirits have a unique story or description. It has been a while since I played the game for the first time but I remember I was really gripped by the story and wanted to finish the game as quickly as possible to finally have all the answers. Fortunately, every level, every step forward, reveals more of Bastion so you can enjoy the game and learn the story and lore at the same time.\n[h2]A story told[/h2]\nThe music, sound and especially the narration, play a big role in this game. I felt a bit let down by the Kid\u2019s voice and found the sound effects ordinary. They hit all the right notes but don\u2019t pop out any more than that. The narration, though, helps with immersion and reveals the story while never breaking the flow of play. It also helps cement the emotional investment.\n\nAn added benefit of the narration is that there is no need to scroll through walls of text or press buttons to engage in lengthy conversations. The flow of the game and the pace of the story is mostly seamless.\n[h2]An inspiration for many years[/h2]\nBastion came out in 2011, more than 10 years ago! It\u2019s a testament to the quality of game-making skills of the original seven members of Supergiant Games that the game is still so good after all this time.\n\nIf you play Bastion now and you have played other games in the same genre before, you will not find much that is new. At the time though, it contained a lot of novelty. The narration as story development, in particular, was unheard of. The devs really hit the nail on the head with this one.\n\nToday it\u2019s still a fun game with a lot of production value, including a New Game + mode - allowing you to replay the game with all the upgrades you had unlocked in the previous playthrough - if you feel so inclined.\n[h2]Verdict[/h2]\nAs you can probably guess by all the praise written so far, I give the game a glowing recommendation. However it\u2019s not for everybody. You have to enjoy isometric games, you have to like action-RPGs and I think you should play it with a controller. If you like games where music is important, you should also like Bastion.\n[h3]What I liked most about the game[/h3]\nThe narrator! Also, the way every weapon and combination of spirits and weapon revealed its true potential after playing with them for a while.\n[h3]What I liked the least about the game[/h3]\nHow the end felt less fully developed than the start. At the start, the narrator will say random interesting things depending on how you play (\u201cThe Kid just rages for a while\u201d). Towards the end everything is much more streamlined and I missed that special flavour.\n\nAlso, sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell how to move through some of the sprites so you might get stuck during combat.\n[h3]Should I buy this game?[/h3]\nIf you like this type of game, absolutely. Maybe watch a video or two before buying but for $15 I think you get more than your money\u2019s worth. Also, it\u2019s frequently on sale so you might get it for cheaper if you wait a bit.", "timestamp_created": 1628525281, "timestamp_updated": 1631048416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97205343": {"recommendationid": "97205343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120945521", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1640581242}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Banda sonora 100/10.", "timestamp_created": 1628472677, "timestamp_updated": 1628472677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481747806072235107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97199841": {"recommendationid": "97199841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122114812", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1632960266}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent and fun game.

After a while it starts feeling like a chore to read and listen. Sounds and effects doesn't sound that satisfying. Movement and gameplay feels a sluggish, repetitive and boring. Variety in skills and weapons at least makes it a bit more fun. The platform design can be confusing sometimes, which sucks because I like finding secret paths/rooms in games, so most of the time I just fall through the floor lmao. Soundtrack was okay, I guess. Narrator sounds annoying most of the time. \n\nThe whole thing is visually beautiful though. Maybe I'd have enjoyed the game if I got to play it back in 2012.

I played it for the first time in 2021 (years after it's original release) and found that it was still very enjoyable. Sometimes time kills games, but this one still felt fresh and new. The controls felt intuitive and the fighting was perfectly fine. The narration was fun, but at times got a bit tedious. I wished when going back into the memory trials that you could press a button to skip it. My only other grip with this game was I wish you could replay some areas. They built some really interesting maps (if you will) and you only ever get a single shot to view them. I wish I could add more idols and go back and replay some areas to farm currency with tougher enemies. I get that some of them were \"destroyed\" as you traverse them the first time. However, not all of the them, and one could back back to those places. That's more enjoyable to me than farming and the fighting/memory arenas. Overall, I would recommend.

I didn't like it back when it released, and I certainly don't like it almost a decade later when I tried giving it a second (third, fourth?) chance. It's not exactly a *bad* game, per se. It's just very, very boring. Everything it does tastes like the blandest thing you can possibly imagine, and even then I'm being very lenient. What happens then is that it feels like a forgettable mess. And a waste of time.\n\nI guess maybe you could like it more if the narrator thing is more up your alley? But I don't believe that can carry a game on its own, especially a game like this that could indeed play better, have more interesting levels/level design, and show a bit more personality besides the 'narrator' gimmick. The art is nice at least. The soundtrack is alright... It's just an overall shame the game carries those big negatives I listed. I sincerely don't think it is worth the time.\n\nI'm sure the Supergiant of nowadays could do wonders if they revisited Bastion in some way or form and gave it a massive overhaul.

It's the only game that I've played that has done it in this manner, and it does it extremely well. The dialogue is top notch, without any corny or cringey lines. Each line and word contributes to the greater story at hand. The plot itself seems simple at the beginning, until you start to dive into the environment and the world you are playing in. The ending is especially strong, one of the strongest I've seen. \n\n[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b]\nThe setting and art design is phenomenal in this game, with each level feeling extremely distinct and memorable. Each character also has a great design to them, even though they have the same base model. The various structures, colors, and environments that are all used mesh very well to immerse you in this great world. \n\n[b] Soundtrack: [/b]\nThe soundtrack enhances the scene you are in, with there being some pretty good ones. A majority of the tracks though were mostly forgettable. The ones that were memorable are, In Case of Trouble, A Proper Story, Build That Wall (Zia's Theme), Mother I'm Here (Zulf's Theme), and Setting Sail, Coming Home (End Theme). Each of these tracks are done very well, bringing up the emotions that are needed to convey for each character. \n\n[b] Graphics: [/b]\nThe graphics are not great, but that does not really matter. The game looks good and so I don't really dock the game for anything, graphics wise.\n\n[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b]\nThe gameplay is extremely varied, allowing the player to fine tune the weaponry selection, their tonics, and spells to suit each play style. The level design is linear, but it is still fun and offers some paths that are not on the straight line for the player to explore. The enemy design is also very well done, as each enemy is distinct. The game also introduces different enemies at the end of the game, to keep the player on their toes. That was done well. There are also additional side content that you can do to better master your weapons, but are not mandatory. The sound design has some nice sounds to it as well, each your weapons sounding very distinct. Good on that. \n\n[b] Final Notes: [/b]\nThis game, even though it is about 10 years old now, is still an extremely good game that everyone should play. It isn't long, but offers plenty of replayaability for those that enjoy replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1627315719, "timestamp_updated": 1627315719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96408366": {"recommendationid": "96408366", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970361353", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1627310936}, "language": "english", "review": "Takes me back to a simpler time.

As I understand, this was a conscious decision made by the dev, and one that I believe was well-executed. The ubiquitous narration carries the player through and tells the story in impressionistic strokes as the game progresses.\n\nThe art style is colorful and appealing, which combines with an interesting and beautiful musical score to make a very polished presentation.

I'm surprised by how well it holds up. The slowness of the movement took a bit to adjust to but that was the only thing that felt old. I ended up enjoying this playthrough even more than my first playthrough. I think that is due to being more willing to mess around with various weapons. I loved the weapon variety. The game excels at having weapon combos that complement each other. I used the carbine and the fire bellows together a lot. \n\nAbout a 1/3 of the way into the game my enjoyment really ramped up. I think the levels got better and each level had a great back story told through the awesome narration and music.

Which is OK since if I want to feel the tense sensation there are plenty of games to choose from nowadays.\nPlaying this game just feel relax, challenging enough to feel fun, and let the fun time flows.\nTotally more than worth of the $1.5 spent.\n\nThanks the developer for the great game.\nCheers.", "timestamp_created": 1624641099, "timestamp_updated": 1624641099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692849099636077881", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94346438": {"recommendationid": "94346438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126377156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1886, "last_played": 1627579061}, "language": "english", "review": "ending made me cry like a little BASTION. sensational soundtrack (seriously, one of the best and the biggest reason that you'll love the game). great story. everything just blends well together. gameplay's solid as well. overall, it's a feels trip. i'm late to the party but i'm glad i tried this out first before playing Hades. just 10/10. artistic masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1624637300, "timestamp_updated": 1624665524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94304846": {"recommendationid": "94304846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238895982", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 867, "last_played": 1691285818}, "language": "english", "review": "We can't go back no more.

The narrator will narrate (what a surprise) what is happening on screen in addition to the story-line beats. I find the narrator helps set the tone of the world and does a good job of it.\n\nI felt like the game length for each play-through is at the right spot for the amount of content the game offers, although when going for 100% achievements it may feel like it drags to some extent, depending on skill level.
