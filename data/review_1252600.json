I cannot recommend this game more to anyone who enjoys games like Final Fantasy, Octopath Traveler, and the like.\n\nI got into this game from a friend who recommended it to me, and not once have I regretted starting. A great selling point is that this game doesn't punish free-to-play experiences. Not once do you ever need to spend money in this experience, as the game has a fair distribution of its in-game currency, even if you ignore most of the side content. The free characters that don't require the gacha system are also more than enough to get you through a good portion of the game, at least from my own personal experience.\n\nWhile some of the content can be tedious to do, the great part is that it's entirely optional. I haven't ran into any situations where the game explicitly forced me to do content I didn't enjoy. Probably the worst part is the back-and-forth that some story quests have, but even then that's manageable due to the fast travel system. None of the side quests lock significant content behind them (at most it's like, a few characters, some character-exclusive weapons/armour and one mechanic related to its questline), so if you don't like something, then you don't have to worry about avoiding it.\n\nWith the wide roster of characters, party composition is complex yet seamless at the same time. There are nearly endless possibilities for making your party, and there's no one \"correct\" team to have at any given point of the game. The variety of the party members you encounter is honestly something unlike any other game I've played so far. There's healers, attackers, tanks, supporters, debuffers, the list goes on. Even among the free characters (the characters that don't need to be obtained from the gacha system), you have a good selection. Just about every free character can become a 5-star, which is the highest and strongest tier of character, so you're never being punished for not using the gacha characters. At worst, you might have a harder time with some of the endgame content, but again, that's optional.\n\nHowever, I can't really leave a review and ignore any possible downsides the game has. The only notable flaws I've ran into is an occasional crash in some specific circumstances and some texture glitches in cutscenes. The crash can be avoided, however, but the texture glitches cannot be. That may detract from the experience for some people (especially people that are sensitive to flashing imagery), so that is a downside. One nice thing that the game does is that if your game crashes (or is forced to shut down for some reason) during a gacha pull, it saves the results of the pull for when you open the game back up, making it so you don't get your currency wasted.\n\nDespite these issues, I still recommend the game. The story is great, the characters have depth, and it's an all-around amazing experience for RPG fans.", "timestamp_created": 1700602248, "timestamp_updated": 1700602248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150328742": {"recommendationid": "150328742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023630074", "num_games_owned": 927, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1700279420}, "language": "english", "review": "Click to download 12 megabytes\nTakes a year long \nuninstall", "timestamp_created": 1700276454, "timestamp_updated": 1700276454, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150130850": {"recommendationid": "150130850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985526974", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1299, "playtime_at_review": 4228, "last_played": 1700723908}, "language": "english", "review": "By far the greatest gacha game available.

The gameplay is very much like final fantasy turn based.\n2. The story is interesting and one well worth actually reading the dialogue.\nWhere the game is lacking for a gatcha is...\n1. The banners show the hero featured, but don't give any indication of what the skills are of that hero.  I have not found an ingame catalog of all the heroes so i can view what all they do.\n2. Playing on both a phone and computer is an absolute nightmare.  You have to keep transferring your account back and forth and each time you do it, for some reason the client feels the need to redownload about 1GB of data.\n3. Don't expect much in the terms of daily reward mails, gifts, or ingame currency.  Completing the story quests and such will take about 3+ chapters before you have enough for even 1 x10 pull.  The game also offers no pity system.  Most gatcha games give out currency and pulls like crazy, but not this one.  One x10 pull costs around $25.  For a game that offers so many heroes to collect....they really want you to pay for them!\nEverything in the game according to multiple sources can be cleared with the free heroes, so my retort is, why even have the gatcha with the low pull rate, no pity, and high cost?

Story is great and drawing me in, Soundtrack is awesome, 100% no doubt. \n\nI'll list some of the good things i like about this game\n\nBattle system has its own strategic elements and also interesting. total 6 people party, 4 front liners and 2 reserves. No recovering HP/MP using items (even outside battles) but by putting units in reserve it will recover them per turn. a LOT of Status Ailments and Status Conditions tho so you got yourselves a lot to memorize later on if you really want to go indepth to this game lmao\n\nYou can move to places you're already visiting so it's nice. Inns recover your HP/MP to full. There's weapon and armor crafting system by using material obtained from monsters and or chests. A lot of minigames that can reward you with gacha crystals\n\nThe gacha system is not really painful and have forgiving rates for me so far, i got myself a lot of good 5 stars units and honestly you can progress story as long as you keep leveling your 4 stars and above characters and upgrade their equipments. The main character Aldo eventually gets stronger later along with the story progressions so it doesnt hurt to keep his level the same as your other characters. Story characters which Aldo's travelling friends also get stronger later on. You can also get some 5 stars units from a story progression so it's nice. The crystal for doing gacha are farmable thru progressing stories and reaching certain milestones like defeat x amount of x enemies or register x amount of x weapon, reaching chapter x of the main story, etc. \n\nThere is no dupes/duplicates units in this game, instead, dupes pull will be exchanged with other rewards and sometimes increase the star of the same character you're already have if you're lucky. Leveling up characters can be done by usual battle grinds or giving character an exp increasing items.\n\nEach 4 stars and above character have their own side quests so you understand more about the character. The more you progress the story and progress the character levels, the more side quests available. And each side quests rewards you with gacha crystals and unit exp increasing items!\n\nUnlike usual mobile gacha games, this game has no stamina system so you can play this game as long as you like!\n\nThe collaboration quests+dungeon are nice in terms of story which weave in to Another Eden world nicely, and rewarded you with free units and some of their signature weapons, although you have to reach a certain point of main story if you want to do them which is not a bad thing imo. And also collaboration dungeon stays available forever so you don't have to worry about missing them! you'll eventually get to do them as long as you do the main story.\n\nThe artstyle of the game is cute like a picture book-like style, might not for everyone but i personally love it. Fitting for such a tale. The characters illustration style is awesome.\n\ni'm not experiencing the errors and freezes like other reviews so far and i'll update this if i'm actually experience it later.\n\nMy inputs to further improve this game are:\n-include a gamepad/joystick support so you can kickback and relax\n-include an offline version of this game so you don't really need internet to play this game\n-(very personalized opinion) add more non-humanoid playable characters like Cyrus, Lokido, Nopaew, etc for more species/race diversity in the casts :D", "timestamp_created": 1682235986, "timestamp_updated": 1682235986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137154735": {"recommendationid": "137154735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074333477", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1682316859}, "language": "english", "review": "it a good game yes but this pc port kinda..... not it please fix game data loading time", "timestamp_created": 1682229722, "timestamp_updated": 1682229722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136746320": {"recommendationid": "136746320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099911101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3184, "last_played": 1681575178}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun reminds me of when I was a kid.

It did freeze for me when loading but not enough to crash so didn't took away my enjoyment, I'm not playing the game in full screen which mean I see a X button at the top right, I read through the entire story including side quests which mean I don't need a skip button.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it would be nice if those get fix, but it's not enough to take away my enjoyment of the game though, and the single player may be the best single player I have seen in a gacha game and I played alot of gacha games since 2016 including Genshin Impact. Sure it may not have any multiplayer aspect like most gacha games, as in no PvP, no Coop, no macro-transaction except for crystal related things, no raids, not even a events, can't even send a friend request too, but I did heard they release 10 hours worth of quests every 2 to 3 weeks which is more than any other gacha game I know to make up for that, plus because single player is where almost all focus goes to, there's Pets, Battle Pets, Bounty Hunting, Treasure Hunting, World Exploration, Ocean Exploration, Cooking, Fishing, Herb Gathering, Mining, Pet Battle, Village Building, Woodcutting, Reforging, and even a Theater and Time Travel, it's insane how much stuff there is and that's because everything stays in the game forever cause no events. So I put this game a Thumps Up for me, it's the closet gacha game you can get to a traditional turn-based JRPG game and the music is the best one I have seen in a gacha game just for the fact that I enjoyed almost everysingle one, some are better than the others of course but way too many good ones (look it up on YouTube then you'll see what I mean) and for a reason too cause it's the same dev as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, Xenogears, and even Final Fantasy 7. And if you want some recommendation to some music then just let me know in the comment or something but tell me which type of music you prefer, lol XD\n\nThe game is better on Mobile though, so just know whatever review Steam version has, it's better on Mobile. This is a Mobile game which then got ported into PC, sadly it's not fully ported in a sense that there's few crystal related things missing such as ads for free crystals, and not good enough settings either including keyboard, keyboard still works, just can't use keyboard for all commends is all.

Originally a mobile JRPG brought to PC. I used to play the game on mobile and now decided to pick up where I left off 2 years ago but on my PC. Good news! You can still connect the game to my gmail account so I don't need to restart all over again.\n\nThis game is a JRPG with gacha system (which the worst system to me, but hey! it's free). Gacha system in this game is painful for any F2P player. You only get a bunch of crystals at the beginning, but as you progress through the game, the amount of crystals you get is super low that you'll have a hard time pulling for characters. Good news is, you don't need to get dupes as the game doesn't need you to get the same character more than once to be able to fully upgrade your characters. Any upgrades will be grindable inside the game. Also good news again, you can get many 5 stars characters from side story and recruitment via test fights and many of them were actually better than characters you get from gacha.\n\nThe game relies heavily in story telling and is actually one of the best JRPG story I have ever encountered. The side story mostly very good and the main questline really hit hard. The game seriously have a great story telling so I would recommend the game for you story-lover.\n\nMusic is superb. No question asked.\n\nGameplay mechanic is kinda nice and you will play a lot with team composition and strategy. it's old school JRPG mechanic but with some depth on it. Balancing your party is a must or you'll get a hard time defeating bosses, even some normal mobs.\n\nThe problem with the game lies within the game engine itself. Sometimes, the game closes suddenly and it would be annoying when you're grinding inside dungeons. Opening screen sometimes freezes a lot so starting the game could be a pain (this also applies on the mobile counterpart, so i don't think it's PC only problem).", "timestamp_created": 1674619757, "timestamp_updated": 1674619757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131266552": {"recommendationid": "131266552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325264731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1078, "last_played": 1695479807}, "language": "english", "review": "love the game", "timestamp_created": 1674303982, "timestamp_updated": 1674303982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131177951": {"recommendationid": "131177951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073333731", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1676124664}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.. but too many dialog ...game need \"skip dialog\"", "timestamp_created": 1674177242, "timestamp_updated": 1674177242, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443108856678009033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131110040": {"recommendationid": "131110040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354702584", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1674116991}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best mobile rpgs.

Lots of quests, side quests, character quests, and more quests to do. So many characters! The music is really, very nice!

You can even choose which one to follow you around as your companion. \n\nThe battle system is smooth, and I love how you swap in and out with the two in Reserve, and everyone gains XP during battle, even if the Reserves don't participate in the battle. When a Reserve character moves up to the frontlines, they activate a special skill, usually ATK Up, DEF Up, Field Activate (fire, for example), etc. It's really fun trying out so many different skills in battle.\n\nOne thing for sure about this game, it's so easy to get Distracted by all these bonus stories and Symphony stories, and character quests! There's always something to do. And the Auction House and Treasure Hunting! I'm still getting used to the Bidding System but it's interesting, that's for sure. I love the Treasure Hunting aspect.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game, whether you're a fan of turn-based combat or not. It's a free download, lots of characters you get along the way. Game doesn't require any $$ but I tossed them a few bucks anyway, to help support the game.

While I do \"Recommend\" this game, let it be known that Another Eden does have issues that can make it difficult to fully enjoy.\n\n[b]To Newcomers:[/b] The download servers for Another Eden are terrible, regardless of version (Steam vs Mobile). It takes forever to initially download, regardless how powerful your own internet is. This tedious download process can also repeat itself when AE receives updates, so this can definitely put off potential players.\n--  I would suggest waiting it out, as Another Eden is an amazing game with a great soundtrack, story, and characters.\n-- Despite being a \"gacha,\" its far more of a JRPG. I dare say AE may be most of the best gacha games out there since there is no real \"time-limited\" events one has to worry about, which includes its collabs. Just play the game at your own pace and enjoy!\n=== Just know that just like a JRPG, AE can become rather grindy once one begins to reach the end-game. At least one doesn't have to worry about time limitations!\n\n[b]To Steam Users:[/b] Yes, Another Eden is indeed a great game and is worth playing. The ability to move around using WASD and using some hotkeys to open certain menus is great, but for combat I would probably stick to the standard mouse controls.\n-- However, I would recommend the mobile version instead due to the \"free\" Chronos Stones via login and viewing of ads. While the Steam version still as the 20 daily stones, the mobile version has an extra 10 by checking the Chrono Stone and watching an ad with potential extra stones by watching extra ads.\n=== This may not be an issue to those who have spare cash to spend, but for those wanting to remain purely Free-2-Play, it is advised to play the mobile version for extra Chrono Stones.\n=== However, if pure efficiency is not an issue for you, you want to play Another Eden on a larger screen, or you don't have a compatible mobile device, then by all means just play the Steam port.

If this game looks interesting to you, [b] do yourself a favor and try it! [/b]  \n\nAnother Eden is an anti-social mobile RPG that rejects the annoying trappings that plague the genre. For the kind of person who wants these unique games with zero interaction with others, it's perfect.\n\nWith the exception of a few specific roadblock bosses (Tower of Time's boss and the Beast King in the \"early\" game), most fights can be cleared through clever play and good planning. This might not sound like a standout feature, but these are mobile games we're talking about, this isn't really the norm. You can squeak by with terrible equipment and an underlevelled party if you so choose. No damage scaling based on the level of the gear and the level of the enemy, no gear score, none of that garbage. \n\nGrinding for something like levels is a non-issue from the moment you're offered more freedom in the game, but certain pieces of gear and the grind for raising the star rarity of characters from 4 to 5 is rather unforgivable unless you're obsessive about doing dungeon runs every day. Easier on mobile to pull out and play whenever, but far less so on the desktop version of the game. That being said, this version of the game allows you to set keyboard shortcuts for anything and everything, and I highly suggest using them for selecting actions quickly in combat and interacting with objects as you explore.\n\nThe soundtrack is a huge highlight of the game, and I often find myself turning up the volume when I reach bosses just to hear more of it. Quiet port towns feel serene, abandoned ruins feel lonely and ominous, and the many, MANY battle themes get the blood pumping.\n\nThe real star of the show is, however, is the events. From point events to challenge quests, and even the collaborations, every single event the game has ever run is always available. Some are a bit more enjoyable than others, but each and every one feels high effort with original areas, enemies, puzzles, and music. The collaboration characters are also extremely useful. They are more than competitive with many high end characters from the gacha, and fill a wide variety of party roles including being able to set a few of the vital Stance field effects.\n\nThere is no skip cutscene button though, so if you're a returning player restarting from around release like I was or if you've not enjoying an event, an auto clicker goes miles faster than the Auto Scroll text. That being said, the writing is usually well thought out and enjoyable.

Google has a character limit on reviews which doesn't really help get the whole point across.\n\nShould you play this game?\nYes on mobile\nNo for Steam\n\nThis is pretty much a full out JRPG that's free to play. All additional content (ie. Episodes and Collab events) are all free. As a lot of JRPGs there is a lot of extra content, sidequests, hidden items and superbosses.\n\nThis game seems to be heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger with many references (Chrono Cross included). I personally enjoy it and the similarities but there are differences that makes Another Eden it's own.\n\nSince this game has been out for a few years I never thought there being too much content could be a negative and that's only from the angle that there is so much to catch up on - They've also just added new content around July 2022 so this game still has plenty of life. Some of the episodes and collab events have a points system which gives you rewards at milestones - This is a lengthy process for most if you choose to grind it out. Some can be done in specific areas while a few can only be done in the dungeons requiring keys which replenish over time.\n\nThe gatcha element is to roll to get characters. Some characters have different versions which you can switch between. Any duplicate characters will gives you Light or Shadow points - Part of an upgrade system that yields bonuses at certain intervals. For the gatcha you can be F2P the game does give a huge amount at first and as you clear out content it's still generous.\n\nAnother part of the monetization is the keys. These are used for dungeons and you get them replenished over time but of course can buy more with premium currency. This isn't really necessary as it is a little time consuming with the free keys over time.\n\nThere are 2 subscription packages that each give you perks to the gameplay. You definitely get the best from the more expensive package and the lower costing one is okay - It's nothing special in my opinion. I personally will never spend money on the higher costing package - You really won't feel left out especially since this is a single player game. You can subscribe to both free for the first month to see the benefits which is kind of cool (Just remember to cancel the subscriptions which you can do same day as signing up for).\n\nNow there are some areas of this game that I find annoying. Nothing is perfect so there is usually always something to criticize.\n1. Dialogue is LONG. Takes forever and you can't really skip through it (Unless you fail at a boss you can skip the scene to re-engage the boss) but that's it. You can \"Auto\" the dialogue but it's many times slower than just tapping manually to get through it.\n2. The 2 monthly subscriptions are a little confusion to understand at first. They do quite a good job explaining things but I feel on at least mobile the small window size really makes it a bit more difficult to understand the differences.\n3. This point is PC specific. I did just have the game open for 5 minutes to leave this review but it did hijack my audio settings to Steam's Audio which no game I've played has even done this before. Kind of invasive IMO.\n4. The game doesn't automatically link to your account (On mobile at least not to Google Play) which is kind of lame. This means if you don't take the precaution to establish this you could lose your account permanently. I had to contact customer support and they were able to recover my account thankfully.\n5. This point I can't really direct to the devs themselves but it's good to know this. The wikipedias are really weak. The english one has been broken for the last 6 months (Of writing this review in Sep 2022). There are LUA errors on tables so you're missing out on some info. Another wiki is Altema which is Japanese but can be translated to english on a browser. This has poorly translated text which makes searching challenging (ex. Deidre is \"Diadora\") and has symbols to represent attack types (ex. Pierce or Fire) which cannot be translated.\n6. Some storyline quests that I recall had points where there was little direction and had to resort to looking up information online. This kind of ties into point #5 above in that the information is lacking and had to find direction on Youtube videos which are mainly people's \"Let's Plays\" so you're sifting through an already lengthy video.", "timestamp_created": 1662349584, "timestamp_updated": 1662349584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121749839": {"recommendationid": "121749839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042858584", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1700343128}, "language": "english", "review": "The game's download even on the mobile version has always been buggy, as for this PC version it's the same with occasional crashes on the download screen but once that's all done the game runs fine.

It is fully expecting you to empty your dungeon crawling stamina bars doing the same dungeons over and over for exp farming, for weapon mat farming, for ascension mat farming, just farming farming farming, and you gotta conserve your exp scrolls because every time you take a dip into the massive cast of characters when you pull, look what's up next!

In this one though, it's not really pay to win but more like pay to go faster with better warriors.  You can absolutely get through the game totally for free, it will just take you longer than it would if you pay for some of the better stuff.  I actually loved this game, even as a free player IT IS FUN.  It's an RPG with an intriguing story and interesting characters (including several crossovers with other games).  The gatcha element lets you grab more warriors for your team, each chance to grab a new character will cost you 100 gems, or you can spend 1000 to get a 10-pack (it seems the 10-pack has better chance to get more powerful people).  You will get 10 crystals for free each day that you log in, plus more for completing story quests and little in-game achievements.  Then there is an option to PAY REAL MONEY for premium gatcha tickets that can give you \"premium\" characters. \n So yeah it is a pretty good game, one of the best mobile ports that I've seen.  But...\n\nBut it's a 9 GB download and EVERY TIME they make any adjustments to the game (major patch or little hotfix) the game will require a FULL re-download before it lets you play.

I literally spent more time waiting for the game to download than actually playing it.  \n\nI hope the developers find a way to optimize their download packets in the future so you only need to download the changes instead of re-downloading THE ENTIRE GAME every time.  But I'm done.  I quit.  I uninstalled it.  It's a fun game once you start playing and get past chapter 4 in the main story, and the side stories are cool, but I'm not all about wasting my day downloading a game that I've already installed TWICE this week.

The game has close to 3 years of content at this point, but I only played through the parts of the game (up to about Chapter 22) using the free characters and Persona 5 characters, then used Serge, Kid, and Harle to play through the Complex Dream scenario twice (didn't bother with the 'neutral' scenario which can only be done after Chapter 25).\n\nPros:\n- Nice throwbacks and integration with some of the Symphony content (i.e. fully played through Persona and Chrono Cross collabs)\n- The turn-based nature of the battles are more engaging than I was expecting from a mobile game\n- Obviously pulls heavy inspiration from Chrono Trigger with characters like Cyrus in the main story and has references to that game pretty consistently throughout the main storyline.\n\nCons:\n- The writing and translations are a bit off. There were multiple places where I noticed spelling mistakes which kind of ruins the narrative for this trying to be a story-driven RPG (things like using the wrong your/you're, there/their, etc.)\n- No true controller support hurts and the existing keyboard/mouse setup is awkward. If you can use your mouse with your left hand and keyboard with your right then the default controls aren't too bad though.\n- The maps are relatively repetitive likely due to the nature of it originating as a mobile game and there are lots of wasted opportunities for maximizing screen real-estate to keep track of buffs/debuffs and other things.\n- You can't even subscribe to the monthly services in this game through Steam even if you wanted to (although apparently they are pretty terrible value unless you play religiously anyways). The crystal purchases are pretty steep and are about the same as games like Genshin Impact (which is also horribly overpriced), but this is offset by 'Guaranteed 5*' banners that are available using paid currency.", "timestamp_created": 1646032357, "timestamp_updated": 1646032357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57117152214050293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111200395": {"recommendationid": "111200395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003435420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1646885078}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm so glad they ported this to PC.

Another Eden's soundtrack is astounding, I have all of their OST albums downloaded and put in my spotify playlist, they never disappoint!\nI also admire the artstyle of the game. As an artist myself, I enjoy Anaden's character design and color palettes, they always look very pleasing to the eyes. So I love it a lot\n\nThe gacha is pretty unforgiving though, there's no pity system unlike most gacha games these days so you're going for a pure gambling ratio with this games. However, if you are willing to pay, there are subscription services and higher chances to get a high rank unit. Though it's still random who you would get despite rate up banners. So if you are planning to play for one specific character, I suggest not to get desperate. \n\nThere are meta issues too when it comes to damage and units, but this is purely on the problem of high rank bosses and far endgame content. If you're just playing it casually, I can assure you the main story units as well as collaboration characters are enough to breeze you through the game. \n\nI just love the game with all my heart.

I love it. Every Character feels like Bonus Characters with their own story lines and personalities for you to explore and enjoy. There's not a single one that's a Bum in the Lot so far. I came for the Chrono Cross Crossover. The Gameplay is pretty solid in a turn based 'Plan your attacks before you attack' style. The Side Characters are just beautiful and entertaining with their Character Quests, Episodes and Crossover Events with Symphony Events. Persona 5 is fun. Chrono Cross is beautiful and faithful (Not surprising since the guy who Directed Chrono Cross also Directed this game.) and the 'Tales Of' Crossover is entertaining and deeply personalized. (Hope you can understand Japanese though because they don't have English Voices for any of the Tales Of characters. Thank god for Subtitles.) Stayed for the Characters and Gameplay. \n\nIt isn't flawless though, it still has free to play stuff you'd expect. Microtransactions, Subscription Services and the like. The story is Above Average at best and Convoluted at worst as you would expect for most anime games. The Grinding will wear on your nerves the most in terms of getting stuff to upgrade your characters Classes in the form of Tomes. Drop Rates for characters are abysmal so you may end up pulling 5-10 of the same category of pull before you get that ONE character you're gunning for. And certain characters will be locked behind Paid Stones Categories. (No it is NOT P2W don't even dare. You can get by just fine with characters you can get for free. Like my gals Thillelille and Kikyo who wipe the floor with basic enemies usually on just one Move.) Plus, the game would Freeze the screen and I would play the game after the screen freezes. It's not very well optimized with how if you play in Fullscreen, the game occasionally derps itself and blinds you even if you can still play it. (PLEASE PLAY in Windows mode. It will save you SO MANY Headaches. I haven't gotten an error since I started playing in Windows mode.) And you'll sometimes be in areas where the background skyline will just spazz out with black patches blinking in and out of existence.\n\nOverall, definitely would recommend this game.

You will forget that gacha is even involved, until very specific moments where the story characters can't keep up reliably. This isn't an issue though...you will get a few choices prior to that to pick additional team members (get Erina, best Supporter early on, if that's not enough at some point, get Serge which is free via the new Chrono Cross collaboration). The currency, Chronos Stones, to summon new characters, is earned along the way and awarded plenty via different tasks.\n\nMost of the time, the story will be easily manageable with the main characters but there's still the gacha-element...which isn't so bad. Pulling the same characters adds shadow/light points, which briefly increase stats and unlock an additional badge/skill slot - but that's overkill usually and not a necessity. You can upgrade characters for free, but there are bottlenecks ofc. If anything negative can be said... there are paid banners usually featuring powerful, new units, which can only be pulled from if you use paid Chronos Stones. Compared to \"free\" summons, you will have a guaranteed 5 star unit out of those. The downside: Buying Chronos Stones is relatively expensive due to no regional pricing. Prices probably originate from the JP version, and we all know the Japanese got an expensive lifestyle.\n\nStill, even without paying, not a big issue. But be aware you have to farm dungeons quite often, especially for AS characters you might want, but also for the main characters, to upgrade them. Shadow/Light, for the main characters who can not be summoned, can be farmed in Another Dungeons, which is important for the 3-5 reward slots at the end of those dungeons, dropping Badges, Tomes, Materials, Scrolls and Treatises. \n\nTreasure Chant Scripts even more than Chronos Stones and think ahead who you want to upgrade. There are free 5 star units available via collaborations and others have their unique questlines awarding you with most, if not all, upgrade materials. Farming these Chant Scripts is extremely time-consuming and without rng on your side, you can end up with 1, 2 per month, even if you farmed these little suckers the most efficient way possible. Buy red and green keys weekly if you can and keep farming shadow/light points, even if it's a slog initially. In due time, you will be rewarded for your time.\n\nNow, that the gacha and bottleneck mechanics are out of the way...\n\nGraphics are great, if you don't mind the 2.5d style. If you need graphics like, for instance, the newest entries of the Tales series offer, don't play this game. What's there is animated in a cute way and definitely gives you that early-90s vibe you used to feel from starting a new JRPG back in your early days of gaming.\n\nArtworks are extremely detailed and background stories are plenty as well, adding to the immersion. Sub-Quests are a way of earning more Chronos Stones, to summon more units primarily and to add additional world-building to the realm of Aldo and his comrades. Specific Character Quests unlock new, powerful Skills and should be tackled early for Characters you play with. \n\nOld content is always accessible. It's not temporary and can be tackled at basically any point in the game, once the requirements are met. A lot of free Chant Scripts can be gathered there, as well as free, usually quite helpful, 5 star characters. Plus: a few more hidden characters you can unlock, mostly free as well without any upgrade costs.\n\nThe battle system is well thought out, but due to initial limitations on the Supporter/Debuff side, until you get more characters, often boils down to staying alive as long as you can, steamrolling regular mobs with AoE attacks and use AF whenever you tackle a boss or a mini-boss. Honestly though, not many JRPGs have astounding battle systems...but they usually provide you with the option to mix how you see fit. Due to an immense roster of characters available, you have a lot of ways to tackle the game itself.\n\nNow, the Steam version is botched. Before the last small update, it worked without an issue but now it's back to not working mode.\n\nIf you can't deal with that, it's fine. Use Bluestacks or any other Android emulator, or just your phone, to play this gem without any crashes or supposedly shady install files. Probably have like 150 hours on phone on this game, but i'm still not even done with half of the main story since there's things to be farmed and a lot of content you can experience at your leisure. Don't overfarm and enjoy the game. If you want to be OP for whatever reason, you gotta pay. Since there are no leader boards though...not sure why you'd do that except for aiding the developer.\n\nI give this game and its mechanics lots of positive, exciting childhood memories out of a horrible adult lifetime with crippling anxiety, drug abuse and lingering depression around every corner.\n\nThe steam version deserves only the 2nd part. No clue why it's that horrible. Sad.\n\nUpdate: Steam-Version started to work again sometime along the line. It still does not utilize the PC's potential fully and might stutter every now and then, but in general, the PC-experience (provided a new update does not break it) is relatively good.\nRegarding controls on PC: Using mouse and keyboard, or just mouse, is something I find preferable. Only using keyboard feels weird for this game.", "timestamp_created": 1641544609, "timestamp_updated": 1664035951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107505129": {"recommendationid": "107505129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243980762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3074, "last_played": 1696243731}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game, but I fully understand why it isn't for most people.\n\nAt the core of it, it's a mobile JRPG.  The mobile aspects irritate the hell out of me: GATCHA, \"Awakenings\", and so forth.  It's not as obnoxious as most mobile titles are about it, where you have to upgrade every aspect of every character and ability and piece of gear, but it's not bothering me.  \n\nI've heard it called \"grindy.\"  I don't grind.  There's lots of things to do, and while some quests require multiple runs on a map, that's not grinding.  It is, however, dialogue-heavy, with a rather deep story that includes background on all the toons you draw (I think I have 50 now).  There's lots of quests: story quests, sidequests, character quests (for awakenings), and at least a half-dozen other categories that open up as you progress.  After Chapter 13, a bunch of that opens up, and it didn't take that long to get there.\n\nNow, related to the grind, if you manually force your toons into a higher level than is recommended, you're going to be bored.  Combat is not that complex if you use your imagination, but one-shotting every monster in every map is BORING.  If you keep to your level suggestions, then the synergies and... FUN and challenge of it can be represented.  And also, min/maxing a singular party is not what this is for.  You may have two or three different party load-outs that can handle themselves (I do), and when a toon needs to do a character quest, I boost em to the proper level and we go do it.  Getting to know the toons is fun for me.\n\nI like the graphics (mostly).  I love the soundtrack.  I think the dialogue is amusing, although there is a lot of it.  If \"yeah, yeah, yeah, point, click\" is what you want, this isn't the one.  There is a very minimal resource-for-money thing in here, but I've never done that either.  It's not like you can do a 10-draw every day, but --again -- I'm not here for that.\n\nWhile I have a feeling the endgame is going to be a little uncomfortable, I still recommend this.  I hope that helps.\n\nVendalis", "timestamp_created": 1641543029, "timestamp_updated": 1641543029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107488459": {"recommendationid": "107488459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386529796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1641602169}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta padre", "timestamp_created": 1641517688, "timestamp_updated": 1641517688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107377911": {"recommendationid": "107377911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052853273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1641395617}, "language": "english", "review": "good story, satisfying gameplay, and free", "timestamp_created": 1641392270, "timestamp_updated": 1641392270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107190478": {"recommendationid": "107190478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326975130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3469, "last_played": 1649422138}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game - it's fine and dandy. but the optimization of the PC port kills the enjoyment for me.

Nice story lines, fun game play, and interesting characters.  However, I really cannot recommend it.  Why you ask?   Well, the quest guides are nothing but LIES!  Put it this way, whatever the so called (recommended) level is, you had better damn sure be at least TWENTY levels higher then that to have ANY chance of victory against the final boss of a dungeon.  For example, I was doing a quest for a (water sword).  The normal mobs in there are level 30.  Had a party of level 42's, and when I got the water dragon boss, I was destroyed, even after equipping FIRE elements against it.   Could not get past his self healing at all.   Another problem is that it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to get reasonably better gear as you go along because you can't get the materials you need at a reasonable level.  Finally, the BIGGEST problem with the game is that certain characters need something called TOMES to get more vitally needed AP points, which I have found to be IMPOSSIBLE to get!  That includes your MAIN character Also, by the way!  From what I've seen on You tube videos you need at least one level EIGHTY to beat them.   Which means you need to mindlessly grind and grind and grind!  That is something I had my fill of with World of Warcraft.  So to conclude, it is a really fun game, but since you cannot beat it at the levels listed on the big quests, it's just not worth your time.

This game is *fantastic*.  It hits all the marks of the old JRPGS of yore while still feeling modernish.  The story is long and most importantly *full*.  I'm already 60 hours in, and there's so much more to access.\n\nThe format does wonders for the longevity and interest of the game.  With hundreds of characters to collect, and dozens of stories to follow, the game doesn't ever really feel it's just a bunch of fetch quests -- unless, of course, you stop to do all of the highly repetitive fetch quests that don't tie in to the story at all.\n\nThe first 25 chapters will probably take you around 15+ hours to complete and make up the majority of the \"first game,\" if you will.  The credits will roll and the story wraps up nicely... and then the \"sequel\" begins.  Additionally, there are multiple complete side stories that branch off from the main game primarily following newly introduced characters.  These are much shorter, but still relatively complete.  Each feels pretty satisfying as if it's its own little side game or standalone DLC using the same character pool and engine.\n\nMechanically - the game is pretty simple.  It's a gachapon, so if you want good characters, you're going to have to roll for them.  Most of the game is pretty accessible even without rolling staple 5* characters like Cthulhu Nagi that completely change the game.  There are plenty of free rolls, and many of the 4* or 4.5* (4* characters that can be made into 5* ones) characters are still top tier.  There's a little bit of an FF10 sphere grid type thing going on to unlock better stats and more moves.  The attacks themselves work on Pokemon Move Disorder wherein you have to pick your 3 favorites along with basic weapon attacks.  You can change your moves around to any of the previously unlocked ones.  A total of 12 unique attacks per team.\n\nIf you like Old JRPGS, this is a god send.

On the one hand AE is clearly a passion project by Chrono/Xeno series Director Masato Kato. It's got a classic JRPG story, with good characters, excellent music, and a charming art style all it's own. And while the combat system isn't the deepest thing ever I'd argue that its' still engaging. And then you have the collabs and the staggering amount of content as the icing on the cake.\n\nSo what's the problem? I'd say it's mobile game aspects do the game a disservice. Not so much the Gacha because you get plenty of really stellar free characters and plenty of free currency to throw around. It more has to do with the RNG and the limiting of access to certain content. Tying RNG into gear is one thing but when it's tied into character upgrading it has the potential to become a problem late into the story when all your units are capped at 60. The general grind for certain things is also pretty gross. But such is the reality of mobile games. They're designed to be accessible but ultimately the primary goal is to make money.\n\nSo while I can recommend this game it's a wary recommendation. You might love it, you might hate it. With it being free to play what have you got to lose?\n\nUpdate: A minor update to this old review. I really have to give it to WFS. They're trying so hard to make their fanbase happy. Adding QoL features, trying to stream line the process of updating units by offering more opportunities to get upgrade materials, giving away free stuff hand over fist, adding more awesome free characters to the roster so people don't feel compelled to pull, I can't say enough nice things about them. They really do love this game and it's community and it shows. Above all that though I've just really enjoyed my time with the game despite my earlier misgivings above.\n\nThe music, the characters, the stories, the overall sense of adventure is what truly keeps me coming back. I love this world and it makes me sad that it'll all be gone someday so I say enjoy it while you can.

Even a good deal better than some paid ones, though it lacks real depth of gameplay.\n\nSome people call it a spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross, and they're not wrong; much of the team, including Yasunori Mitsuda (hence the wonderful soundtrack), worked on it. There's time travel and alternate dimensions. There's a talking frog warrior (who speaks with a familiar soundbyte). There's a brick-and-iron time/dimension hub with beams of light to travel around and a bucket. As of this review, ACTUAL CHARACTERS FROM CHRONO CROSS ARE IN IT. So, yeah, stuff's there.\n\nPros:\n - THE SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING.\n - You can play through the whole thing without paying a dime.\n - The artwork is (mostly) great.\n\nCons:\n - It's a gacha game; it wants you to spend money on a premium currency to do things like get characters. You will earn some throughout the game, but very slowly (especially later on).\n - Somewhat basic combat system. Besides the basic \"Attack/Run\" options (no in-battle items), there's some sort of \"combo\" system that eventually unlocks, but it's never clearly explained, seems random, and...doesn't seem to help that much.\n - Story is largely derivative of Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross, and it's not subtle.\n - Hundreds of characters, so very few of them get any real development (see also: Chrono Cross, but worse).\n - Tropes on tropes on tropes on tropes. There's nothing new to be found with this game - just novelty.\n - Some animations look wonky on larger screen (the sprites are all \"paper dolls\").\n\nAll-in-all, a really solid free JRPG, but in itself not a \"great game\" - just maybe one of the greatest of its kind (free mobile gacha port).", "timestamp_created": 1639945087, "timestamp_updated": 1639945087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408419698476791382", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106121387": {"recommendationid": "106121387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086802953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1619972219}, "language": "english", "review": "moo!", "timestamp_created": 1639939211, "timestamp_updated": 1639939211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513926327228546143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106079273": {"recommendationid": "106079273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422199704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 414, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1639883891}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, i grabbed this game with a simple reason... cats. That's before i found out the game is directed by the guy (Kato Masato) who helped wrote Chrono Cross, Chrono Trigger and Xenogears. And yeah, was pretty hyped up with that 2nd info since those are the games i loved. But all those excitement ends here...\n\nThis game is literally unplayable unless you lowered your PC's security level to... practically nothing. Yes, for those who can't start the game (game silent crashed as soon as you start the game). It's because it tried to install something to our System32 folder and was blocked by windows default defending system, it then tried to change files and get into our system kennel and that attempt is blocked too... Further check on the internet shows that the devs claimed that is their \"anti-cheat\" driver. But breaking down that driver file shows nothing but malicious behavior. Example, the \"driver\" running outside the game (it starts as soon as you turn on your PC and logged into windows even without the game running), and logging every single of your key press and send it to the developers (which includes the password you type OUTSIDE the game). Really, after a few hours of trying to get this game to work... I ended up with a dilemma to whether \"allow\" it to work or simply \"give up\" on the game. And yeah, the decision is obvious when a game try to install a keylogger and try to get into your system kennel at the same time, they have totally no rights to do so and it's pretty much against privacy laws... Normally one will suggest you to play the game on an android device or emulator instead, but... if a game company is doing all these fishy shady moves, no matter the platform we uses it's still that same company... my advise is to stay away from this game for your own safety unless they came up with a way to \"anti-cheat\" without keylogging and trying to log in our system kennel and starts outside the game even without us playing the game. If you don't mind some malicious \"driver\" that logs itself into your system kennel and start collecting every single key you press on the keyboard, including all sorts of personal info and your passwords... then go ahead and give this game admin permission or disable your security to let it run. imho, it's not worth the risk. \n\nP/S: If it's safe, your anti-virus / security defender will not block it in the 1st place.

Yes, the game is directed by Takashi Tokita (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross), and some of the music is composed by Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross), and the game is thematically similar to certain classic JRPGs (Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross). With all that talent, there might be a significant group of people out there content to play through Another Eden's halfway decent story and then just move on. Believe it or not, this game is merciful enough to let you do that without paying a cent. While the gacha system utilized by this game's cash shop enjoys its share of rightful infamy, I found it to be rather generous in dispensing great characters with the currency I got for free, plus the game passes out free characters every event that are especially useful gapfillers for your party, particularly the characters it gives out during crossover events with other games (like Chrono Cross). Steam players don't have the ability to watch ads for cash shop currency like mobile players do, but I still found myself waiting to run into a premium content wall that never came.\n\nWhile Another Eden offers a broadly appealing JRPG experience for the very reasonable price of free, the real star here is the grind. The entire endgame is about grinding and only grinding. You grind your way to max level, then you grind for materials for better and better weapons. Then you grind materials to unlock new classes and skill trees. Then you grind materials in tougher maps for even better weapons. Then you grind to boost the weapons themselves. You grind your goddamn face off until all that's left of your head is the back wall of your skull and then maybe, JUST MAYBE, you'll be ready to take on your grandpa.\n\nIn summation, Another Eden is a good JRPG, free, and sporting a nonintrusive cash shop. There is a ton of content to play through already, with more always on the way. There's enough story and challenge to please casual fans of the genre and enough endgame material to keep free players zoning out in comfy, grindy bliss for literal years.

New story content for it is still being released on a regular basis, expanding it even more with each new update.\n\n\n[h1]=GAMEPLAY=[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay here is of a classic turn-based jRPG with random encounters and limit breaks (called Another Force here). The biggest difference from the classics is that this game has gacha mechanics for acquiring additional characters, each of which has their own set of story quests. The amount of stones for pulls the game gives its players is pretty generous though, the pulls contain only characters and nothing else, and newer banners always provide a small chance to obtain any of the characters featured in the past. Additional styles or class upgrades for owned characters can be unlocked through farming certain in-game resources instead of pulling for them, and the characters that can be unlocked as rewards for story progression can be quite powerful as well, especially the ones from 'Tales of', 'Persona 5' and 'Chrono Cross' collaborations. Unlike character banners, story and crossover events don't expire (except for the Chrono Cross one, which has a 5-year license, but hopefully they'll be able to extend it).\nOverall, the gacha mechanics here are not as annoying as in other gacha games, though unlucky pulls can still be quite frustrating at times.\n\nAnother gameplay feature that makes this game stand out from other jRPGs is its heavy focus on buffs and debuffs. During its harder boss fights the game becomes akin to chess with strategic moves and countermoves planned for a few turns in advance in the battle of the opposite elements using specifically tailored equipment. This can sometimes bring previously unused characters into battle, as many of them have their own unique set of buffs and debuffs for a specific element that can be essential in particular fights.\n\nDue to the constant stream of more powerful characters emerging through gacha it is pretty hard for the developers to keep the older content's difficulty balanced, but there is content for regular players (such as the main story quest or episodes) as well as optional content that can challenge even the strongest character teams.\n\nThere are various other things to do in the game, like crafting, running \"another dungeons\", fishing, performing in theater etc. Completionists may find some of those side activities to be rather grindy, but the game's variety never fails to impress.\n\n\n[h1]=STORY=[/h1]\n\nThe story feels like a mix of Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, ranging from silly and light-hearted to serious and heavily emotional, and like the rest of the game it is very character-driven. Those who enjoy Kato's works will feel right at home. In addition to the main story that revolves around time travel there's a bunch of side episodes set in various eras. These additional stories often provide a refreshing shift in narrative thanks to Takeru Sakurada's engaging writing that creates a different and unique feel for each of the episodes he writes for.\n\nWhile Another Eden's story already contained some references and allusions to the Chrono series, the collaboration with Chrono Cross (also written by Masato Kato) makes the tie-in official.\n\n\n[h1]=MUSIC AND SOUND=[/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is incredible, one of the best in the genre, and it currently spans across 11 (!) CDs. Various composers that worked on this game created some truly amazing pieces in many different styles. This is my nominee for Best Soundtrack for The Steam Awards 2021.\n\nThe game has occasional voice acting, most of which happens in the form of battle shouts and character introductions (with a few exceptions), but it is possible to switch between English and Japanese voices.\n\n\n[h1]=GRAPHICS=[/h1]\n\nThe game looks surprisingly good for a 2.5D title, with nice animations, beautiful backgrounds and gorgeous character arts. The subtle use of 3D elements here makes everything seem almost purely 2D, but once characters move towards or away from the screen the 3D effect becomes noticeable and it looks quite impressive.\n\n\n[h1]=PC PORT=[/h1]\n\nThis game was originally made for mobile phones and touch screens, and it shows. While it is more convenient to play it on a PC with a big screen, this version still leaves a lot to be desired. Every time the update is released or the account is transferred the game deletes and redownloads 8.5 GB of data on PC (which takes ages), while it's only around 150 MB on my phone taking less than a minute. There are certain crashes here and there. Performance is decent but could've been better, especially in terms of responsiveness. An SSD might help mitigate this to some degree. That being said, developers are actively working on bug and performance fixes, so the state of the port improves at a steady rate.\n\nMobile versions also have daily ads that provide additional stones for pulls while the PC port does not, and the recently introduced paid subscriptions can only be activated through a phone as well. It is possible to transfer account between platforms, however, and subscriptions work fine on PC once activated. Still, it would be much better to keep both platforms synced without having to go through the account transfer process every time.\n\n\n[h1]=CONCLUSION=[/h1]\n\nAnother Eden is undoubtedly a labor of love. It doesn't use any predatory tactics to empty your wallet with its gacha mechanics, nor does it advertise or nag you about any of its paid features, as the main focus here is to provide great gameplay experience. For a free-to-play title everything here is fairly balanced. It's possible to play it like any other jRPG, gathering stones as rewards for story progression and using them to get more characters from pulls.\n\nIt still surprises me how the game of this magnitude and talent is not so well-known still. I recommend anyone who loves classic jRPGs and especially fans of the Chrono series to try this game out. Just keep in mind that currently the PC port may not be the best way to experience it.", "timestamp_created": 1637800245, "timestamp_updated": 1643928926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742455780506134033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103594827": {"recommendationid": "103594827", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971158509", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1617280063}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1637800169, "timestamp_updated": 1637800169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103590904": {"recommendationid": "103590904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967238472", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1100, "last_played": 1649214659}, "language": "english", "review": "Chrono Trigger, but Gacha.

As you progress through the game, you unlock more and more of these mechanics, keeping the experience fresh and new. Another thing that I think differentiates this game from the millions of other gacha JRPGs is its Another Style (and now Extra Style) characters. Essentially, to not end up with the all-too common issue of having an absurd number of characters, the game introduces new, stronger forms for the same characters with just the right number of differences to be unique, but still clearly the same basic character. The game even has a system in place that allows you to upgrade your characters in the case that your luck (or lack thereof) with the gacha pulls just isn't cutting it (although I will mention that it is quite tedious), as well as an easy method of grinding that allows newly-pulled characters to be brought up to speed in very little time.

By the time I wrote this review, I'm already at chapter 82 (the last updated main story is chapter 84). Here's the pros and cons of this game:\n\nPros:\n1. Less RNG, balanced system\nEven though there's no pity in this game and the rate is a bit low, it's easy to farm the chrono stones esp if you love grinding (WFS also by far the most generous gacha company I know as it often gives free 5* campaigns alongside with free chrono stones just by progressing or unlocking new story part or from daily login or even watch ads (not available on steam sadly)). 90% of the characters in this game can be upgraded to 5* (Just need to farm (or for some, just do their stories) the item to upgrade them) and all chara (incl the story charas) r all OP. U dont need certain gacha charas to defeat certain bosses just to be able to progress the main story. This isnt a Pay to Win gacha game, however, to play this game (whether ur Pay to Win or F2P, well, esp F2P, required good strategy building and reading ability (as u need to mix-match charas in ur party and their skills and make a strategy from there) \n\n2. No time limited event\nThis means that every new events, new charas, or new domains/dungeons once released will be permanently in the game and you can enjoy it with your own pace. New characters upon released will have a special banner where their gacha rate r increased but once that's over, the so-called charas will join the standard banner and you're still able to get them again.\n\n3. Great story, art, and soundtracks\nAs the game page said, the story writer is the one who wrote the timeless classic JRPG, Chrono Trigger, so you can expect the story will be epic and worth your time. Although it's not 3D (it's hand-drawn and 2D to keep the classic side), the background art r fabulous and beautiful, very well-made. Soundtracks are also awesome\n\nCons:\n1. No skip, fast forward, or auto-play function\nThis can be a bummer for those who dont really like to read as the dialogue can be pretty long (and a bit dilly-dally). Although in some story events, you can skip the scenes, most of the dialogues in the main story can't be skipped, or fast forward, or auto-play\n\n2. Can't sell unused weapons (cluttered inventory)\nNot sure why but the game doesnt have the system where you can sell your unused weapons or armors to the blacksmith npc. Hence, expect for a cluttered inventory. There's no filters for items too, so if you're looking for specific items, u need to scroll down your inventory and find the so-called item manually\n\nLast thing to be remembered, this game isnt a \"kid\" game that you can just press button and brute force everything (if you did, most likely you can't beat main story bosses and then your review will be \"this game is unplayable\"), it requires strategy and make advantage of the skills that each of your chara have. No matter whether you will be a Pay to Win or F2P, if you're thinking to just press attack, no strategy, believing that you will win, this game isn't for you. \n\nOverall, it may not be following the open-world trend but it's so refreshing to see a modern touch in a timeless classic JRPG like Another Eden that combines traditional hand-drawn arts with beautiful CG effects and amazing soundtracks.", "timestamp_created": 1632418500, "timestamp_updated": 1635226527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715758264064788818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99838149": {"recommendationid": "99838149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053350289", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6718, "last_played": 1632670659}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1632406965, "timestamp_updated": 1632406965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99738622": {"recommendationid": "99738622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014403360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1632180716}, "language": "english", "review": "I can give this game a good review after the emails from support......they updated the game and my save is not usable anymore so now I am supposed to fill out forms to get my save back?

I'd been enjoying it on a mobile emulator for some time before it got a PC port and am enjoying it as a PC port. The game itself is fine, though the writing could use tweeks for maturity and the gameplay could use a little bit more complexity. However, it's a fun enough way to kill time. So... Why am I voting it down? Well... There are a couple of things.\n\nWhen I first installed, to allow the game to even start I had to go through several steps which I'm pretty sure most of you are aware of. The game occassionally crashes randomly without any sort of message on why and says it's not responding at times when it's loading. I blame my heavily outdated PC for the latter but for the former I consider it a technical issue which needs addressing. \n\nUnlike most people, I do not mind the dub for the most part outside of... A couple of exceptions. Mostly Miyu at this point though I wasn't fond of Fienne's VA either. However, even though I'm fine with it, I would have liked the option to switch between Japanese and English VA work. The material is there, the devs just didn't include it into the port for some reason. More of an issue is that the Tales of crossover for some reason hasn't had the VA work for its content included into the port. This part I find... Rather disappointing. It makes playing through it significantly less enjoyable than I recall it being on an emulator.\n\nIn terms of little things, while the port does allow you to do most things using the keyboard, I do feel like there is more work needed. I would like the menu to be accessible and navigable using the keyboard itself. I would also like notices, episode information and dream information to appear in the game itself rather than requiring to open the browser. Lack of the chrono stones you could acquire through advertisements on mobile also bugs me. \n\nSo... Why am I playing the PC port when I prefer the emulated variant because, outside of the navigation part, it has none of these issues? Well, the PC port on its own chews less resources. The emulator itself is an additionally resource intensive object on my already outdated PC. It is easier on my PC and on my sanity to be running the steam port for periods of time than it is to run it on an emulator on my PC. I also have to admit, I cannot imagine enjoying it as much on a mobile phone either. So the PC is still my preferred place to play it.\n\nThe game's core functions still work fine and it's a fun enough game. It just has issues which would improve my experience significantly if fixed.\n\nUpdate: It seems that the issue which was causing the crashes had been fixed with the update as it does not seem to have happened since. That could, of course, be circumstance however it seems unlikely.

It is a turn-based RPG that features a Gacha pull system to gain access to more characters. This might remind you of Genshin Impact, but unlike Genshin, there are no multiplayer aspects at all. The Gacha might turn some away, but you can actually do quite well with the free-to-play characters.\n\nThe game begins with a baby in a forest who is found by Beast, who notices the baby\u2019s internal dormant power. However, before he can really interact with the baby he senses other humans approaching.  An older man spots the child and a younger boy comes out from hiding in the bushes. Some time passes, both children have been taken in by the old man and are now young adults. From here, you go on a quest to create a birthday present for the older man who rescued you.\n\nThis quest, of course, leads to everything going wrong. Your sister is kidnapped, you discover a cat that can travel between different dimensions, and you find a magical sword. Eventually you are even transported into the distant future. Now you are on an epic journey where you and your party travel through different areas doing quests and adventuring.\n\nThe combat of the game is your typical turn-based RPG. You have a party of characters that you can either obtain by natural progression or through the Gacha pulls. These characters have different abilities and focuses that make them unique from each other. As your character\u2019s level increases, you can unlock new abilities and become even stronger.\n\nThere is a lot about the game to enjoy. The story that I experienced so far is really well done. I wish there was some more voice acting than what is included. I guess since it was originally a mobile game there are some limitations there. The music and sound design is solid as well. The Gacha element isn\u2019t super strong, which is nice for a free-to-play game. From what I have experienced so far, and from what I have heard, the game is very free-to-play friendly. \n\nThere have been some rumors and speculations that the game does include an Anti-Cheat software. However, this seems to have some Malware type functionality included. This is definitely a bit concerning, but it passed the checks in place from Steam to be in the store. I would prefer them to charge $15-$30 for the game instead of Gacha in a purely single-player game. This would limit the need for an Anti-Cheat software to be installed on your system all together. It just makes more sense to have Gacha in a game that features some form of multiplayer element.\n\nI was actually pretty surprised at how strong the game is for being a free-to-play mobile game released on PC. There are even a few collaboration events with other games such as Persona and the Tales of series. The combat is straight forward, the design of the characters are nice, and the environments are well done.

I would expect more for so much money.\n\nThat's pure racketeering. \n\nI was about to invest real shekels in this game, but not like this. \nI'll keep it playing for free with the bad or mediocre low-cost characters (pain in the butt to survive in game)", "timestamp_created": 1625527642, "timestamp_updated": 1625818260, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95063605": {"recommendationid": "95063605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355224942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1619432955}, "language": "english", "review": "best mobile game\nfrog achievement\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1625433677, "timestamp_updated": 1644246280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503104448318481445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94988071": {"recommendationid": "94988071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116716195", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1270, "last_played": 1695091225}, "language": "english", "review": "I personally find the game fun the story is awesome and  the little side quests are short and enjoyable the world is pretty big to more addiction then I thought haha.

I am not that great with games so bear with me ^_^;\n\nAnother Eden is a great free JRPG game with lots of quests and interesting story plots (sometimes it will make you rofl and/or make you sad, even in one occassion it reminded me something from irl situation, in a good way always). A fellow steamer mentioned to me that there is a 3 year (we have entered their 4th year of AE) stuff in game for you to do that you will never getting bored and I hope they still introduce some more in the future. The story is written by Masato Kato and music by Yasunori Mitsuda (got the info from wiki). \n\nWhat is missing though (which I don't mind that much but I hope that they will add it later) which it \"turns off\" most players, is the missing of the Japanese characters voices. I am not sure if it has to do with the Global licence and stuff but it is something that I have noticed from steamers that \"turn their backs\" to the game (not all of them). \n\nAE (Another Eden), is also a gatcha game but the developers also provide you either with quests and daily login with some free Chrono Stones (Chrono Stones is the currency to use in characters draw, key cards for dungeons-if you want that is as the game provide you with key cards every few hours, continue in case you get defeated in boss fight) so that you can try for new characters. Also as you play, you will encounter free characters that will be added in your team as you move on.\n\nIn my opinion, I haven't seen any other JRPG game that has everything in it, [spoiler]fishing, mining, harvesting, help build a village with quests, become a master chef[/spoiler] and many more. I am not that much into the game story so I can't provide a lot of info so feel free to ask the rest fellow players in the game's forum. \n\nDon't think though that you will always find easy battles ^_^ you will need to upgrade your characters skills, need to farm for ingrediends to make weapons, equipments, you need to plan your team depending of their abilities so that you can use them during the fight (4 are fighting in front and 2 are in the support line that always you will need them to move in front during battles). \n\nWhat I just mentioned above is very little to describe how amazing this game is with so many things to do. By the way, you don't need to buy Chrono Stones if you don't want to but to tell you the truth, I did purchase some (during special offers) of around \u20ac130+ to support the developers and Team because they deserve what they did and do for their players base in the game.\n\nOh one last thing, the AE (Another Eden) Team Support (thank you Team and devs <3 ) is always happy to help us with any types of problems we may have with the game. I had 2 issues when I first started the game and believe me or not, the Team kindly reply back to my issues (both occassions) in a day or two with fully support and it was fixed.\n\nBy the way, not sure why most fellow steamers don't allow comments in their review of this game O.o!?! I have ticked my review to allow comments so feel free to ask or post your opinion for anything that I mentioned in the review. Just keep it in a polite manner please.\n\nAnd to mention that the game is totaly clean (no viruses, keylogger-or how it is called-and such, I have checked with my Panda Antivirus), not sure why some steamers are post that in their review except if they have something else on their PC from other games which tricker them. Also the developers and Team posted this https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252600/view/3026956428740413353 about \"wfsdrv\" on Steam because some players they where concerned about it (not me though ^_^). \n\nThank you all for taking your time and read a little my review, wishing you all, all the best.", "timestamp_created": 1622611568, "timestamp_updated": 1622620805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506026148796081543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92975129": {"recommendationid": "92975129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155029039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 41515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3718, "playtime_at_review": 11130, "last_played": 1700761230}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually the 2nd time I've started this game. I first played this game on mobile when it first launched on mobile. This was during the launch period when Mariel was considered the best 5star and Toova and Mighty were strong offense. Things have changed a lot since then. I lost my mobile account because they did not have a google link at that time. So I'm literally starting from the beginning. \n\nThe only reason I'm willing to do this is because of this game's permanent content system. All events are retained permanently. For every other gatcha game I've ever played, I never see myself as a returning player. So this is the best thing I want to praise about Another Eden. I really like the permanent content and in my opinion, this makes it far better than all the other gatcha games. Just this point alone. \n\nSecondly, I'm in a minority here but I like the PVE system with no online. I don't want to interact with others when I'm playing a game. I'm an introvert. That means I don't like interacting. If I have to have an online system, that means I will quit the game in a while. So the lack of online is a big plus for me.\n\nSo there are 2 big plus points. \n\nNow for other things I want to comment about :\n\nThe story:\nI have read a lot of players praise the story line but for me it is just ok. As someone who has played a lot of jrpgs and other games, I find the story of this game just average. You can tell that the more recent gatcha characters are more well developed and are better written. That's probably because of the way the industry works. You get better writers once the game is somewhat established. But the main storyline (to chapter 25) was disappointing to me. I was somewhat invested in Aldo's family story. So the twist in Aldo's identity was something I found irritating. This is actually where I stopped a few years ago.\n\nThe grind:\nGrinding another dungeon is probably the worst aspect of the game for me. It was what finally made me quit a few years ago and what will probably make me stop once I play a little bit again this year. While I like the old school play in some aspects, especially the lack of online play, I just can't grind anymore. The developers need to learn that a lot of the kids have grown up and we don't have the time to do this. We can't set aside that much time to play your game. Maybe I can do it for a couple of months. But definitely not permanently. Fortunately this aspect has also improved with the addition of the white keys which give a much needed boost. \n\nBut I will probably return once in a while simply because the permanent content system makes it worth it.\n\nThe PC steam version :\nThis is another reason why I came back. I spend much more time on my PC than on mobile. I honestly prefer gaming on my PC. But the way it is now is very laggy, especially when you go into awards to claim stones for achievements. While I appreciate their need to prevent cheating, they really need to improve their code vastly so that there is no lag. I can tolerate staring at a laggy screen for 2 seconds while the award is loading because I am a old school gamer who has used many old devices. A younger gamer would probably not be able to accept it. \n\nVoices:\nAlso we want japanese voices. Even if we are not Japanese. Put the Japanese voices on the PC steam version. In my opinion, I don't like English voices in Japanese games so I personally think that they can save money by just not hiring any more English VA for characters in the future.

Being a huge fan of that franchise, it was a no brainer but I held off on the mobile launch due to murmurings of a Switch port but, that never happened so I took the dive when the Steam version released.\nI have to say, for a game made for a mobile audience, it feels like it could pass for a more than decent JRPG that was made for handheld. \nThe art is beautiful and full of vibrant colour the pops and the character art is very high quality and pleasing to look at. The music is amazing and was exactly what I was expecting from a Yasunori Mitsuda composed soundtrack.\n\nFirst of all, I love that the game is a complete experience with NO stamina system, NO auto-play.\nThe simplistic methods of travel is expected of a mobile game but it has a decent battle system that includes a speed up option and skills to activate. Instead of just 4 main characters who have the abilities to take on multiple classes or jobs, you have a vast cast of Heroes you can choose from to cushion your perfect party composition. Of course, you begin with the main hero and some heroes will join your immediate group through completing portions of the story but, like most (mobile) games, you to obtain more Heroes through a gacha system. Now, I understand that gacha has a negative stigma and most people stay far and away at the mention of it but, hear me out. I hate gacha as much as the next gamer but, the developers specifically made mention (not to forget the numerous YouTube reviews available) that you can beat the game with any characters barring you have a party that is well balanced enough ie. a DPS, Tank, Support and Healer composition.\nJust playing for the first few hours should net you over 2K Chrono Stones (the premium currency) and each summoning of 10 Heroes uses 1K so chances of you obtaining enough Heroes of varying classes should be quite high (or I was incredibly lucky lol). I've also noticed that you get 1 free summon for a 1 x Hero a day for 10 days as well as an additional free summon on the 10th day on a separate banner as a new player so I feel the devs are giving you a fair chance to succeed without pulling a scum move to force you to open your wallet.\nMoving forward, I really enjoy the main story (so far) and was pleasantly surprised at how interesting the side quests were. I never would've thought that a mobile game took the time to implement actual stories into them (as in Side Quests) but, that's just me.\nThere is a weapons and armours system here too much like any complete JRPG, although, simplified. According to the community, a level of complexity is added to the weapons system in late game but I've yet to see how that works. As for character progression, there is a simple to understand grid where you spend AP to learn and obtain passive stats and skills. How far you go on this grid depends on the rare quality of your Hero ie. 3 star 4 star or 5 star rarities.\nI would end my praises here and fear I may be missing some more features I noticed but forgot to mention  but this game is a breath of fresh air when it comes to mobile games as it seemingly breaks the mold of traditional mobile game tropes and expectations (at least, for me personally).\nThe gacha is nice but ultimately not shoved in your face which ironically, made me want to utilize it more. Also, every Hero you pull has a back story as they briefly introduce themselves after you've finished pulling your 1 or 10 Heroes. It's quite amazing how much detail goes into it and it's not just the unique heroes, the generic cookie cutter pulls also have a backstory as well!\nAnyway, if you're looking for a simple yet engaging phone game that almost passed for a console quality JRPG on Steam, I highly recommend it. It has a legit story, beautiful art and amazing music.

Depens on gacha. Lucky start or solid monetary investment (100\u20ac+)? Little to no grind untill later parts of the game. Quite different otherwise. Very grindy after certain monents - plus daily lockouts.\nGrind - another very big minus. Game offers a number of timegated dungeons to grind for character and equipment upgrades with miniscule drop chances. Example: Main character starts as 3 star, can be upgraded to 4 and the 5 stars (requires story porgress as well as upgrade materials from said dungeons), but to unlock his full potential... 256 light points, with 20% chance to get 1 after \"very hard\" dungeon, which are limited to about 4 tries daily. so... less than 1 daily. more than half a year of daily grind (dungeon allowances are capped at 5 so no skipping here) for ONE character. \nAnd last but not least - gacha. Low chances (und as in many current gacha games getting 5 star is only a beginning, ideally you need to pull 15 copies of character + another style to reach his/her full potential), stupidly high prices (about 45\u20ac for two guaranteed random 5stars) and very little other options. Freebies are there, but few and late game challenges sort more than half of them out. Really MAJOR minus.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1619856612, "timestamp_updated": 1620888649, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481344223022460938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91214564": {"recommendationid": "91214564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128109615", "num_games_owned": 1029, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1619926808}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]\ud83d\ude38\ud83d\udc4d 7.1 out of 10[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b] Classic JRPG Fan-Service, Addictive, and Great Music\n[b]Cons:[/b] Gotcha Mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1619856157, "timestamp_updated": 1644758340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50976032018661499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91200795": {"recommendationid": "91200795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366812502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1672288932}, "language": "english", "review": "the 3 hours were install time lol but yes <3 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1619832376, "timestamp_updated": 1619832376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91122383": {"recommendationid": "91122383", "author": {"steamid": "76561199149819010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1617261219}, "language": "english", "review": "This is Best Rpg Story 2021 and good Combat System.", "timestamp_created": 1619725096, "timestamp_updated": 1619725096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91079455": {"recommendationid": "91079455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089071886", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1617361688}, "language": "english", "review": "Attempts to funnel private information to the developer with shady kernel level malware, no thanks.

XD\n- They got Persona 5 crossover with quests with all the main characters along with getting the charm and gameplay down really well!\n- Somehow they got a crossover with the Tales franchise which includes some of the main characters across a load of their games!\n- The main characters are meaningful and at least try to make them worth while.\n- Decent variety of characters\n- Potentially good skill tree and levelling up system\n- Fair amount of enemies\n- Easy to pick up and play\n- Steam Achievements\n\n[b]Con's[/b]\n\n- Weird install issues makes me wonder why put it on Steam like that?\n- Gambling in Single Player. That's a NO NO\n- It takes a while to really get into the game. Like 2 hours in I can't even change gear! XD It actually took around 3 hours just to get gear...O.o \n- Feels like its taking off other games to the point where it could be defined as unoriginal. But it at least tries to embrace that with actually doing cross overs so give and take here. \n- Level layout can feel strangely samey. If you look at the map it feels like dajavu after a while.\n- Not all side quests are good. They can be so lame that it's like watching a cringey kids show.\n- When you are on a side quest the battle you do are completely without the quest characters despite them literally battling with you! Why did they design it like this?! O.O \n\n\nI'll leave the summary when I'm confident i can define how good this game is...\n\n\nHere's the first 16 minutes of ANOTHER EDEN I hope this helps:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdowPLaVRrA", "timestamp_created": 1618263999, "timestamp_updated": 1619028255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496957659721374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90189280": {"recommendationid": "90189280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123655242", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1620985440}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I have grinded and reached around 16 - 19 chapter I don't remember\nPros:\nPresentation of Game\nSimple Mechanism\nFree Characters \nAnime Style\nGreat Content\n\nCons:\nLevel up mechanism (LEVEL VERY HARD)\nWeapon or Items (Auto sell items is nice but the materials to craft weapons are limited)\nStar Up character( LEVEL 2 ranks higher than VERY HARD) unless you get same character in GACCHA with higher star\nHigher Stats of character doesn't matter you still get hit with lots of damage from low level monsters\n\nMOST DISTURBING PART OF THE GAME It has 30% battle play (i.e RPG) 20% cutscene and 50% conversation (i.e like a visual novel) with not very favourable side quest \n\nIt should have a SKIP button implemented in near future.\n\nOverall this game is playful and you don't know how much time has passed until you put a timer how  much played this game in a day...\n\nI recommend this", "timestamp_created": 1618234784, "timestamp_updated": 1618234784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90181575": {"recommendationid": "90181575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148010474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1618341318}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Llevo jugando la versi\u00f3n m\u00f3vil desde hace bastante tiempo y he de decir que como port no es malo.

Music is great. Gacha is pretty decent (only on mobile version, will get into that later). Rates aren't completely terrible and the banners aren't just out to dick you out of money.  All content as of this writing can and has been done with completely free characters, so the gacha rate doesn't even matter. The battle system is fun and challenging. Nothing is time-limited except for rate-up banners and daily key dungeons, which aren't really super important to keep on top of.\n\nThe bad:\nThe grind is unreal. Takes about an hour to do daily dungeons. But you don't have to do them.\nThe English voices are...not fantastic in many cases. I'm fairly sure ProZD's \"suggestive dialogue\" skit is inspired at least partially by Miyu.\nThe translation ranges from pretty good to absolute gibberish. It's very apparent they have a main translation team for important stuff and an intern that just google translates the side quests.\n\nThe Steamy:\nOn the mobile version you get 20 gacha currency for logging in each day, Then 20 more for viewing an ad, then 10 more for viewing another ad in the chronos stone buy screen, then random rewards for viewing up to 5 more ads. On the steam version you only get the first 20, which cuts your income SEVERELY.\nSteam version only has English voices, mobile version has EN and JP. This is a dealbreaker for some.\nSteam version runs at 60 fps which is cool.\nSteam version, again, uses a kernel-level anti cheat. This is also a dealbreaker for some. But it is ONLY an anti-cheat as far as anyone can tell, and not a particularly intrusive one.\nUnlike Mobius Final Fantasy, the last gacha to hit Steam, you can not crossplay mobile and steam seamlessly. You have to clear and transfer your account to each device using a transfer code. It's fairly jank.\n\n\nAlso that guy with all the awards is lying. He did not debug the wfsdrv driver.

On top of that, it tries (and fails) to bypass User Account Control and also tries (and fails) to bypass Powershell Execution Policy (by default which is RESTRICTED to prevent malicious scripts but they try to set to Bypass and fail).\n\nThis is all done outside of a dedicated 'installer' and thus doesn't properly obtain the relevant admin-level permissions to install anything. It tries to bypass the need to do this via PowerShell terminal commands and it is not only unorthodox but may violate Steam policies as well.\n\nAll of this is done to force a random unknown kernel-level driver and kernel-level Windows service to be installed on the system without providing proper notice to the user or obtaining authorization prior to doing so.\n\nI popped open a debugger of choice and dug around the driver itself. Seems the usual 'grab as much data as possible and funnel it to the developers.

There aren't even proper keybinds for keyboard (M does not open the map)\n- People are reporting that that anti-cheat software is very intrusive\n\nOverall, I wish I could have just bought this as a $20 single player game with no gambling. There is still a market for single player games with no gambling but companies choose instead to be greedy and add slot machines to their games.\n\nIf you've already played every decent JRPG on steam, give this a try but don't spend any money. Instead of paying $20+ for a shot at the slot machines in this game, I recommend these other excellent JRPGs & visual novels: Trails series, Tales series, Valkyria Chronicles series, Yakuza series, Zero Escape series, Danganronpa series, Phoenix Wright series.

While I enjoy the game for what it is others might not like the style or the fact it doesn't really add anything new to the genre. It does have an enjoyable story, fun characters, great writing, and an amazing soundtrack. \n\nAlso just because this has a gacha in it as a way to pay for its continuous updates over the past 3 years it is not required to do in order to play and finish the game. You'll get plenty of story and side quest characters by just playing the game along with the multiple collab characters from the Tales of series and Persona. You can take advantage of the current pc release event to try and reroll a certain character you'd really like to use with the free 20 summons until may 14.\n\nThis game will take you hundreds of hours to see all there is to do, just finishing the first part of the main story alone will probably take you around 30 hours which is from chapters 1-25. As of writing this review I believe there is 74 chapters. and this is not counting all the side quests, side stories, and character stories.\n\nIt's not perfect of course. The game is online only even as a single player game so you'll need an internet connection to play. There is a bit of a grind if you want to power up characters, I assume to keep people playing and have things to do between updates. If you do care about collecting all the characters even the rare ones that show up in the gacha it will be nearly impossible to do without putting some money down and paid summons are not cheap but at the very least it guarantees a 5 star character although there is no way to guarantee it will be the one you want. Does not have controller support so you will need to set up one with a third party program if you really don't want to use keyboard and mouse. I'm not sure what was going on with the English dub, It seems like they weren't given very good directions on how the characters needs to sound making a lot of the deliveries feel very off and honestly pretty bad. \n\ntl;dr\n\nPros:\n-Free\n-Story\n-Characters\n-Music\n-Collabs\n-Lots of Content\n\nCons:\n-Online only\n-Grind?

It gets really bad if it crashes in the middle of a cut scene. If the auto-save place you crash is not before the cut scene, you are stuck crashing in that same cut scene. The only way I got out of it is to transfer to my phone and proceed from there. Reacquiring data at the title screen might help, but no luck for me.\n\nThis is a single player rpg gacha. No PvP or Co-op. I think its a pretty friendly gacha game to play. Offer decent amount of premium currency and free units that are usable. \n\nThey have banners that guarantee a 5 star unit although it's 1-3 time only and needs paid premium currency to roll. It's actually bad because after you use that banner if you didn't get the unit you want, you have to roll  on the normal version of the banner which doesn't guarantee a 5 star unit. You can either do a single pull or a 10 pull, a 10 pull guarantees at least a 4 star unit. A set of 10 roll cost 1000 Chronos Stones which is about $32 USD without any promos, but they do have promos monthly. There is no pity system either. If you just want to hit the focus 5 star unit, single pull might be better for you.\n\nIf you get unlucky and get a unit that is 3 star out of 5 star or a non \"another style\" unit, you can upgrade it through game play. Although, it might take a while since the items you need are dungeon drops that are limited entry.\n\nThe issue I had is that it feels slow probably because it's a PC port from mobile. A lot of cut scene and the dialogue feels slow to proceed through. Stop it with the flashbacks, its a waste of time especially when it happened just 5 minute ago.\nI wish there was a skip text or auto text function because most of the story doesn't interest me. There is a lot of text and spamming space bar gets old.\n\nIt sucks you can't sell your old equipment. It just clutter my inventory space when I go to equip my units. Should of been a QOL change a long time ago.\n\nSince this game been out for a while, I'm so behind in the current content stats and I can't do them. So be warned that you probably won't be able to do thing for awhile. You need time to get the new gears and stuff. Might need to get lucky with rolling for new units as well. Since it's a gacha so of course the new units power creep the old units.\n\nThis game is on the phone as well and you can transfer data between steam and phone. The thing is that saved data can only be on either or, can't be on both. When transferring data you have to redownload a couple of gbs each time. On the phone there is ads to watch that rewards you either 5-20 Chronos stone, a green/red key each time.\n\nIn the end, I still like to play this game because of the play style, dungeon runs, and amount of content it offers.", "timestamp_created": 1617560018, "timestamp_updated": 1629867042, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89709776": {"recommendationid": "89709776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043800809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 773, "last_played": 1622707579}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]EDIT/UPDATE 4/5/21[/b]: WFS has released a statement on the nature of the file, and it's apparently meant to be an anti-cheat kernel driver. Same program should also be removed when the game itself is uninstalled-- however, some players have reported that the wfsdrv.sys file still remains. While an anti-cheat kernel driver in a single-player game seems strange, I can give them the benefit of the doubt that they're doing it to protect their game from being hacked and modded mercilessly. \n\nThough I'm willing to chalk down the problematic actions to inexperience in coding games for PC (since most of their other games are mobile-based), I still can't recommend the PC version yet to Steam players, as you don't gain much compared to what you can get on the mobile version of the game. \n\n\n[b]TL;DR [/b]--- Good free JRPG-lite game, but unknown stuff happens in the background that seems unnecessary to run the game, which makes this PC port kinda sus. Playing game on mobile or emulator recommended until we actually know what\u2019s happening.\n\n\n\nThis negative recommendation is not due to the game itself\u2014 content\u2019s permanent, story\u2019s great, characters are endearing,  gameplay is engaging (though rather grindy and repetitive at times), and the music is sublime. Free collab characters also make the game very easy to run through if you invest in them.\n\nIt\u2019s also not because the gacha element of the game: though the rates are very low, there\u2019s no pity system, and 5* characters are usually the only worthwhile ones in the long run, the pool is limited only to characters (since all weapon and item drops can be acquired through in-game grind). Also, once you have the character, they require less investment of hard-to-find materials to become powerful compared to other gacha games. Characters tend to be revisited and given new Styles every so often.\n\nThe actual reason for not recommending this game on Steam is due to some behind-the-scenes stuff that happens when the game is launched on your computer\u2014 which can be a cause for concern for those that value their privacy. As of this writing, some dedicated players have found that upon launching the game, it tries and fails to install an unknown Windows service, then simply ends up copying a .sys file to a new folder in your Windows system (mine was in C:\\Windows\\wfsdrv). The file is \u201clocked\u201d and cannot be deleted while Another Eden is installed on your computer. Said file cannot be removed without Administrator privileges, and uninstalling the game does not remove this file\u2014 you have to do it manually, for whatever reason. \n\nWhat can cause concern is the fact that Another Eden can be played even when the unknown Windows service fails to install. This just raises questions about what the service even does in the first place, as it seems unnecessary in running the game.\n\nAt this point in time, nobody is sure what exactly is going on, and reactions among those who found the process and files range from calling it shoddy coding to accusing it of being actual malware/spyware. Whatever the case may be, the game seems to be taking additional unnecessary steps with unknown intentions in order to run on a Windows system in the first place. \n\nIf you still want to play the game (which I highly recommend, because it\u2019s a free-to-play JRPG-lite that will probably remind you of the good ol\u2019 days of classic JRPG gameplay, just with that weird gacha flavor), your best bet is to try it out on mobile or through an emulator.  \n\nSource and a bit more info on findings: [url] https://www.reddit.com/r/AnotherEdenGlobal/comments/mjsggk/steam_version_install_wfsdrv_file_in_your/ [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1617549861, "timestamp_updated": 1617635930, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 199, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907923638820648193", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89705763": {"recommendationid": "89705763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015206600", "num_games_owned": 826, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1678653754}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish there was an eaiser way for data to be used between the Mobile & the PC version.", "timestamp_created": 1617545866, "timestamp_updated": 1678499312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89703229": {"recommendationid": "89703229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070282001", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1651200425}, "language": "english", "review": "To people that worry that you need to pay to finish the game : \nNo you do not need to spent a cent to complete the game, there will always be a way albeit harder.", "timestamp_created": 1617543294, "timestamp_updated": 1617543294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89686012": {"recommendationid": "89686012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081633121", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1645166494}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played the mobile game for hours, I've got a bunch of 5* characters and I also have a bunch of chrono stones.

I'm confident they will iron out the performance and downloading issues in a patch soon.\n\n\nHere's some feedback for WFS------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMain Menu:\nDownloading game data percentage goes above 100 when downloading all data instead of standard. Mine went to 300% before I forced closed it.\n\nEverything feels so zoomed in, in the menu, I know that's how mobile is but it looks terrible on pc. Same deal in-game, kind of strains my eyes. \n\nAlt tabbing during downloads and loading screens pauses them.... why? No one wants to stare at a download screen.\n- Issue is even more annoying because you can't use windowed mode to snap it on your screen at the beginning. For some reason that option only appears once you're in the game.\n- Can't mute the music during loading.\n\nClicking animation on the menu feels slow. It's like 30 fps compared to the background it doesn't flow. Meanwhile, clicking animation during the loading screen is at a normal framerate.\n\nScreen went unresponsive first time after clicking continue, as in Windows made the screen white. It got back to normal after a few seconds.\n\n\nIn-game:\nEverything about the menus are unresponsive at times. \n- Clicking on the future/present/past makes it tank frames then it quickly comes back to normal. \n- Clicking quests/map also tanks frames then it comes back up.\n- Clicking menu is fine but for some reason it takes longer to open? Also to get out of the menu you have to click a bit above all the other buttons, more than what's visually shown. Decrease that border size.\n- None of these issues are fixed by cycling through the menu multiple times. \n\nResolution on the game is low, there's not much you can do about that unless you wanna redo every sprite in the game, I understand. Something that you can do however, is make the text a bit higher res. It looks pretty bad and a fix shouldn't take much work.\n\nThere should be hotkeys to access the menu. Esc for Menu, M for map, Q for quests, etc. The only advantage keyboards have is the amount of keys it has compared to controllers, use it.\n\nFights:\nOpen a characters attacks, hold your mouse press on the first attack then drag to the fourth and back. Stuttery as hell.\t\n\nSome characters sounds for attacks are delayed while others are normal. Mona's normal hit for example. Not sure if this is specific to pc or not.\t\n\nThere's no way to exit the game using in game settings that I saw, you have to force close it.\n\n\nQOL Suggestions:\nCan't swap from pc to mobile on the same account without resigning in. Very bothersome. \n\nController support should be implemented. As I said the zoomed in feel makes my eyes strain so the only way I can play this is back on my chair a bit farther from the screen, I can't do that if I'm using keyboard mouse. \n\nAbility to change key bindings.\n\nA keyboard key to interact with what's in front of you instead of having to use the mouse.\n\nMore settings in general. Capping frame rate, vsync, etc.\n\nDownloading all data from the start, before even launching the game.

I love this game, but there are some pretty serious downsides to overcome that people need to know before trying it out that have nothing to do with the game play. \n\nFirst, the data management in this game is the worst I have seen in any game. Why does this game take 25 minutes to download assets? Genshin Impact is faster with way more data that needs to be transfered! In order to transfer your save or start a new game you have to download the assets all over again for some reason. That takes another 25 minutes. I have tried to recommend this game to people and have always failed to convince them because they get stuck on this ridiculous download screen and just quit. \n\nThis PC version is still rough around the edges. I didn't experience any crashes that other people are reporting, but I did see quite a few ugly rendering artifacts when the camera zoomed. I was excited to play this game with my nice monitor, but it looks better on my phone than blown up.\n\nThat said I do still love this game. I played it quite a bit on mobile and the same game here on PC. The writing is great, the music is great, and the battle system while it starts off pretty simple ends up being surprisingly deep. Some of the bosses in this game are my favorites out of any turn based RPG. The gatcha doesn't have pity but has much better rates than other games to make up for it. \n\nAdditionally, there is quite a lot of content that is not gated by daily-stamina mechanics: and playing on the PC makes it much easier to code up ways to skip the boring parts since you can do almost everything with just the keyboard.

This is naturally a port from mobile to PC, but since after my last review, they've fixed the issue with a lot of bug delays so now the game's running smoothly. I don't know if its because of the change of my laptop or they actually did fix the delays.\nHere are the cons since everyone seems to be on edge about stuff like this:\n-It's a gacha game, however, it is thankfully limited to only the characters.\n-There's no skip button for cut scenes and dialogue. You can just rush through but the mere clicks and taps (depending on your game orientation.)\n-It is a grinder. (Someone like me doesn't really mind this part, but I know a lot of people get annoyed with a feature like this.) The game's progress can be stunted by the need to grind for items, upgrades and enhancements. (not to mention the fishing sidequest...)\n-it might come off as a checklist game (I mean is that there are a lot of steps to progress some of the stories ingame)\nNow for the pros:\n-You can win this game as a Free to Play (don't believe me? watch some insane players on youtube)\n-Story-rich game with a good dynamic of character motivations and development. the characters you get for both in-game and gacha have compelling side-stories and are well written. Fans of classic JRPGs will have a tickle of nostalgia in the writing of its world-building and plot twists.\n-You don't have to pay for weapon item upgrades or enhancement (hence the grind)\n-Zero Timed Events. You can play your cross-over side stories at your own leasure\n-Satiates well for the classic JRPG fans out there. You literally have a samurai frog named Cyrus as a call-back to Chrono Trigger \nAs of now, I think it's safe to say this game is good, not perfect, not entirely bad, but good.\n\nNow, for the in-depth review:\nI'm gonna say it. This game holds a special place in my heart since I've first played it on mobile. The mechanics of this game is simple but balanced in terms of combat but boy it can be brutal with its tome drops once you enter the special dungeon mechanic. For what its worth, this is a game made to be played at the player's own pace, but because its story-rich, it demands for more reading through cuts scenes.\nSpeaking of story: this game's storyline can be divided into arcs respectively. Think of the shounen serialisation but in a JRPG format. So far, there are 3 main arcs of the game with 10 episode storylines, 2 side quests 1 ongoing mythos and 4 symphony episodes. And tons of side/character quests. To all you story gamers, this is a treat to play if you're into the JRPG story format.\nThe premise of this game is basically this:\nAfter the kidnapping of his sister Feinne by the beast king, Aldo tries to save his sister back, only to be transported 100s of years into the future by a mysterious blue spiral of light. Not only did he discover that mankind has established civilisation to the skies, the prosperous future he saw was fated to fall into ruin by some mysterious force, with his sister being the crux of this disastrous fate. Upon his discovery, Aldo and friends are now on a quest to travel through time and space to save Feinne and the lost future while uncovering the mysteries behind the world they live in.\n\nI hope this review can do this game justice. I realise that I might sound like I'm overpraising the game or seeing this game on a tinted lens, but honestly, the surprising depth this game has is outstanding to me. So with that in mind, please give this game a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1617328582, "timestamp_updated": 1618244997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489690721035003662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89533986": {"recommendationid": "89533986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829912658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1033, "last_played": 1699495209}, "language": "english", "review": "i love the story lines", "timestamp_created": 1617327393, "timestamp_updated": 1617327393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89531483": {"recommendationid": "89531483", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999052312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1617795985}, "language": "english", "review": "great game! great story!", "timestamp_created": 1617323576, "timestamp_updated": 1617323576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89530940": {"recommendationid": "89530940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104552529", "num_games_owned": 1094, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1672212606}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta muy bueno el juego le falta un espa\u00f1ol", "timestamp_created": 1617322656, "timestamp_updated": 1617322656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89530087": {"recommendationid": "89530087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062243137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1674948827}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself seems to lack some stuff from the mobile version.

Yes. Is this port worth it though? Probably not at this point in time.\n\nMany other reviews have put what they like/dislike about this game so I'll go over some of the main pros/cons.\n\nFirst off, despite this game being a \"gacha\" game, it really doesn't feel too much like one, there's absolutely no \"FOMO.\" All characters are PERMANENT. All events are also permanent. There's no \"Event only\" units that only come out for 2 weeks never to be seen again for months-years. There are time-limited rate ups but all units go into a permanent pool. You don't NEED to get multiple dupes of the same unit over and over like other gacha games. I see people complain about the 5* rates(because they're pretty low) but the thing is, throughout the time I've played this on mobile, there's been a few times where we've gotten free 5* select tickets where we could literally pick any old 5* unit. I've also been able to get 5*s through luck with the crystals I've gotten throughout the gameplay(over time). If you really want a 5* support the devs and pay real $ since you will be guaranteed 5* units for paid gems. Also, you don't NEED the 5* version of a unit, it is possible to get the 4* version and then you grind the upgrade materials to upgrade it into its 5* version. The majority of the content can also be completed with the free units you get throughout the game, there's never a feeling like you have to make a team that's \"meta\" just to be able to complete something.\n\nCons with the port: No ad rewards, you miss out on the few crystals you could get every day. No Japanese VOs.

It has a massive amount of content, and while sometimes grindy, most of the grinding is entirely optional, though I typically choose to do it. As it was originally a mobile game, it does have many of the major mobile game pillars, such as a gatcha system and micro-transactions. I personally think the gatcha system here is done very well - 5 star characters have a higher drop rate than most other gatcha games I have seen, and many 4* characters can be upgraded to their 5* version, though this typically requires some of the aforementioned grinding. Paying gives you guaranteed 5* characters instead, and every once in a while there is a special banner that allows you to select any character you want. And if you choose the free-to-play route, every day gives you 20 \"chronos stones\", the premium currency, 100 of which is a single pull. Of course, you're practically wasting it if you don't save for 1,000 to do a 10 pull that comes with a 4*, and this is where the mobile version is better than the PC port. The mobile version recently got ad support, and by watching 7 ads a day one can get an average of 60 stones a day instead of just 20. So while I recommend Another Eden as a game, I can guarantee a better experience on mobile, as more gatcha draws means more good characters, which means less getting stuck as the endgame slowly suffers from power creep.\n\nThe gatcha system is where most people's complaints seem to lie, so I wanted to talk about that first. Outside of the grinding and the monetization, where Another Eden truly shines is it's story.

I'm going to enjoy it again and if you like old school jrpgs you should enjoy it as well.\n\nThe annoyance.. Changing between Phone and PC is fiddly annoying garbage. You have to connect to your gmail and reconnect your data every time you want to switch between them. Other games have figured out how to stop purchase exploits without this stupid workaround. It doesn't take too long to do it but it shouldn't need to be done and i figure one of these times it will delete stuff on me. Edit: Just made me re-download the entire game to change back from my phone so enjoy doing the dishes while you switch back from playing at work.\n\nThe port....Game looks good at 2560x1440 but not fantastic. The control options are adequate at best and not being able to use keys to swap between enemies is stupid (mouse click only). Movement controls are also adequate. This game could easily support a controller IT IS A JRPG after all.\n\nThe story...It is good. Time travel tomfoolery, some JRPG tropes, some poking fun at JRPG tropes. All in all it was an enjoyable trip going through the game. A lot of the characters you gain also have side stories that are fairy well done as well. \n\nCombat...It is a turn based jrpg and it does it well. Different weapon types for different weaknesses, MP management, super skill charge ups. If you like classic jrpg combat you should like this.\n\nThe Mobile Side of Things....Ya you can spend money. Spending money is like turning on easy mode though. With what you are given and what you can earn playing the story difficulty is very well balanced. You can grind for extra character pulls or get event characters once reach certain chapters of the game. By no means are you gated and honestly unless you want to push into endgame content it is best not to spend money unless you want to tip the developers. \n\nQuests and grinding.....Quests in every new town, mostly fetch quests or go fight this quest. Grinding for in game currency or for xp and items is very basic JRPG--walk left walk right attack whatever pops up. You don't have to overly grind things but the option is there if you want just a little more stuff. There are more powerful optional monsters with good item drops to try and take out to add to that grinding loop incentive.\n\nEnd Game...It seemed like they had some decent stuff set up but i quit after i beat the game so i don't know too much about end game stuff but it seemed like enough content to keep working on your team. I want to say i played the game about 50 hours to beat the story but i'm just guessing.\n\nAll in all this was a great mobile game that i am happy to revisit.

Game with amazing homage to Chrono Trigger, but with gacha elements. \n\nThe Bad\nThis game can make or break you, I took a long break of a year and a half because of how low the rates are, it takes a lot of time to grind crystals and I mean it, there's no way to speed it up aside from achievements which give 50 or more. Right when you are confident with your crystals, the ugly boss starts to rear its head, the gacha rates. For F2P It's abysmally low for a high pool of characters, whats worse is you could land with the 4* of the featured unit which is where your nightmare and grind begins. Chant Scripts are the bread and butter to get a 4* to 5* or 5* to AS, and the game has ABYSSMAL rates for those too, worse than the gacha infact. You could do weeks to 2 months of farming just to accumulate 5 Chant Scripts and the PC version rewards gives you just--1? Are you serious?\n\nThe Good\nThe game's story is amazing, the voice, the substory and everything makes up for the negative aspects of the game, while I would love for everyone to enjoy specific character stories, the only problem is that majority of the character substories are locked behind the gacha element, but if you were to obtain that unit, and experience their subquest story, the feels train can really take you places. There is so much content and you will never run out of things to do, to top it off they have had crossover events with Persona 5 and Tales of Series, not to mention all the characters can be obtained for free along with their main weapon which really completes the experience, not to mention once the event ends, they become permanent and can be played back anytime. So fret not F2P players, these are 5* units and if you don't care too much about meta, you can use these units to rush through the story.\n\nPC Release Specific: As of writing this review, this feels like a low effort emulator which is worse than playing it on an emulator. Download a 7 GB game to open it to download another 700MB update in which the servers to download the game are just as horrendous 4 years down the line, this is the pain the mobile users feel and now PC users can also experience this now!

Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time And Space is a free to play singleplayer JPRG. Yeah, I said free to play because although it's a gacha game, you can finish everything in the game with the free characters and if that doesn't interest you, as I'm writing this review I have 119 units as a free to play player so it's not like you can't get any units if you're not paying. (Also there are some pretty good free units in the game.)\n\nI see that many people already said a lot of things about the game and I wouldn't say those things again, so let me just talk about why I love this game and why I didn't left it although I tried out a looot of other gacha games.\n\n> STORY\nFirst of all, I adore the design of this game.\nThe story starts as any generic JRPG, but then the whole time traveling comes in and everything just changes; the main character, Aldo has to help the people around him and he can't even go back to his own time. I absolutely love that the map has three time layers and you can see how the things and places slowly change under the years (and some quests even revolve around this feature).\nThe main story is pretty good, but it can become a bit confusing especially because (right now) you can't read back about what happened previously. Sometimes it's a bit stupid because right after you save the world you just go around being a \"Time-Traveling Garbage Man\", but I guess it's just a RPG thing :D\nThe side quests are really really good though; you can ask everyone and they will say that they are in love with the IDA series or the Time Mine. They are really well written and you do not just unlock a free unit by playing them, but you can get a lot of rewards from them as well (but it's rather grindy in most cases).\nThere are also world quests, collaborations (right now with Persona 5 Royal and some of the Tales series) and character quests for every unit who's at least a 4* (these can range from 2 to 4 quests per character) and they unlock new skills.\n\n> WORLD\nI think a lot of people look at this game and when they see that the units are chibis they just ignore the game. Not gonna lie, I would die to see a 3D fighting game spin-off, but it's a very awesome game as it is. From the gacha mobile games I've played, this had the most fun combat. It's turn based combat so a lot of people will skip this, but nothing is better than the feeling when you finally beat that big bad monster you tried to beat for day or weeks.\nThe places you visit in the game are really nice and some of them are straight up gorgeous, like the Corinda Plains, Moonlight Forest or [spoiler] Hismena's Dreamworld [/spoiler]. They are not just very appealing visually, but the background music... oh the music.\nThe music is one of the strongest points of the game in my opinion. Last year my most listened song was Cage of Blue Roses, so I guess that says everyhing (also Alphecca slaps).\nI also love how much content is in the game. I don't think there's anyone in the community who finished all of them. There are a lot of grinds, like the side stories, fishing, mining and so many secrets and secret questlines, that I wouldn't be surprised if there were still some hiding out there.\nAnother big point is that no content is time-locked. Every quest, sidequest, collab, unit, you can get everything anytime.\n\n> THE COMMUNITY\nI'm always pleasantly surprised how nice the people are on the Reddit page. This is one of the chillest gaming communities I've ever seen. There is a very well maintained and updated Wiki page, loads of guides and megathreads, and everyone who I talked with was very friendly and helpful. We also have a great relationship with the devs and they post Q&As and stuff like that regularly (just last week we had a meme competition :D ). There are no shipwars, no rushing people, no talking down on other's 'small damage' or team composition (only some small \"waifu wars\", but we all know that [strike] Isuka [/strike] Heena is best girl) like ehemmm another rather popular gacha game.\n\nIt's a comfortable place. It's a comfortable game.\n\nNow about the port.\nSadly the Steam version doesn't seem to be as good as the mobile version. You start up the game and you just know it that it wasn't made for PC. Only the English voices are here what I wouldn't mind, but since all of the collab characters are only voiced in Japanese they are mute here. Sadly you also can't log in the same account on both mobile and PC unless you want to log in and re-download everything everytime, but I guess if you want a fresh start you can do that here.\n\nAll in all, it's a very nice little game and I enjoy playing with it, but do not look at it as a GI or AK, it's not those games. The Reddit and Discord community is welcoming and we also have a small Twitter one, but those are mostly the update notices.\nIt doesn't hurt to give it a go and if you have any questions, we are all happy to help! <3\n\n((now then, where is the merch WFS? give us those nice shirts!!!!))", "timestamp_created": 1617213915, "timestamp_updated": 1617215416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89445708": {"recommendationid": "89445708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047650406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1617194201}, "language": "english", "review": "If you considered to switch to PC version, DON'T (for now at least)\nIt is not stable right now, load time problem, there's delay every time when you try to access a menu, game froze and crashed\nJUST GO BACK TO MOBILE.", "timestamp_created": 1617212118, "timestamp_updated": 1617212118, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89443719": {"recommendationid": "89443719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068599507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1671865204}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is more about the port, and not directly towards the game itself.

So far I have not run into any issues with the steam port but I have not played the steam version as extensively.\n\nLet's get a few things out of the way first:\n1. This is a mobile game port\n2. This game uses a gacha/lootbox system for characters\n3. Only English voices are available here while the mobile version let's you choose between EN and JP VAs\n\nDespite that, it manages to be one of the better f2p mobile games out there. Unlike most other mobile games this one does not have any form of auto combat, PvP, co-op or limited time events. It is purely a solo jrpg experience.\n\nIn terms of story it is quite good provided you can stomach some of the more standard jrpg tropes. Another Eden is sometimes called the spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger (as you may be able to tell from the scenario writer) so it shares many common themes like time travel and FrogDude. All characters above 3*/common rarity have their own character stories too which can range from slice of life/comedy to robot genocide.\nWhile the main story can at times feel predictable, the Episode side quests are where it really shines. Episodes are individually packaged story arcs about specific side characters or organizations. They usually contain new explorable zones, side quests, minigames, free characters and a farmable dungeon. The only downside to Episodes is that grinding the dungeon for all available rewards can take a long time. Also, there are special collaboration Episodes for Persona 5 and the TalesOf series. All the collab characters are free and do not need to be obtained from the gacha system which is a plus.\n\nWhen it comes to combat you're probably not going to be blown away by its complexity or build diversity. There are 5 main elements: Fire, Wind, Water, Earth and Neutral. There are also 3 'sub' elements Shadow, Lightning and Crystal. Characters generally have 1 element and can equip 3~ skills which cost MP to use. In battle, you can bring 6 characters split between 4 frontline and 2 reserve units. Characters on reserve do not take damage and recover a portion of their HP and MP per turn. When a character changes position from reserve to front, they activate a character unique Valor Chant skill that can range from damaging enemies, debuffing their attack, or healing the party. For tough fights, you need to carefully plan out when to change character positions while also maintaining the right amount of mitigation to survive. Unfortunately you won't experience any of the truly difficult fights until endgame as most of the time you can blitz through bosses with the use of Another Force. Another Force/Time Stop is a gauge that is charged each time you attack the enemy and once activated allows you to fire off skills in rapid succession. Damage done in this state is amplified significantly and with the right set of buffs/debuffs you can potentially do millions of damage in a single turn. All in all, there is some mechanical complexity to the combat but early content can be face rolled pretty easily. \n\nEquipment is rather simple with each character only requiring 1 weapon and 1 armor piece. Later on you are given more build options by crafting  'Grasta' (aka Runes) but you won't see this until chapter 50+. Otherwise Manifest Weapons (weapons that buff older characters' skills) require exp grinding which isn't too horrible with the exp dungeons available.\n\nThe music is excellent with every new zone or town having a unique theme. The actual full sound track is probably 140+ songs. Graphics wise it's retro-esque with a 2.5d world and hand drawn chibi style sprites. The character portrait art is very well done and there is a lot of diversity between characters from the past/present/future.\n\nNow, the gacha. Gacha rates range from 3.5%-5% for max rarity 5*/SSR characters. Characters of the max rarity can also be obtained at 4*/SR rarity and later upgraded through farming materials in game. Duplicate characters only increase light/shadow or base stats by a few points. Some characters can also have alternate forms called \"Another Style\" which can change their role in combat drastically. As many other reviewers have noted, the gacha simply sucks as there is no guarantee to obtain characters you want. Hopefully this changes in the future as generally the older a game is the more generous it becomes but for now it can be frustrating if you are particularly unlucky.\n\nTLDR the gacha and somewhat simplified combat system holds back what is surprisingly a well crafted old school jrpg with lots of content to enjoy. If you can refrain from spending and play the game casually there is a lot to like. I recommend just trying it out yourself, it is free after all. Whether the pros outweigh the cons is up to you.

The gameplay features turn based combat with a lot of different combos, buffs/debuffs/status effect mechanics and side scrolling open world exploration in the style of Octopath traveller.

I have played since mid-2019 and experienced the game's highs and lows. Another Eden is a singleplayer gacha JRPG and it feels cheaply produced compared to JRPGs that are more polished and are more ethically monetized.\n\n[h1]The PC Version[/h1]\nThe PC/steam port of this game runs perfectly fine, but lacks customization found in other JRPGS. A lot of menus require dragging your mouse pointer around and the game does not even give you the option to navigate with key presses. The PC version does not allow you to change keybinds period. This is especially annoying when fighting enemies since the same key that selects the unit is also the same key that selects the move they use ('1' is first party member as well as first move). Overall, I think if you wanted to play this game on a PC, you should definitely play on an emulator. Not only can you customize your keybinds to your heart's content, you can set up macros that automatically use AOE attacks for instance.\n\n[h1]Gacha[/h1]\nFor those who do not know, \"gacha\" is basically the anime version of \"loot boxes\" or \"card packs\". You spend some of the premium currency the game gives you for a randomized chance of getting certain characters. You will find that many people argue that it is not necessary for players to use the gacha because the game gives you really good free characters. While this is true, this issue stills lies that a vast majority of new characters being released are much better than the free characters and that they are [b]ONLY[/b] available through the gacha system. Each character summoned through the gacha has a rarity of 3, 4, or 5 stars. The level cap for a character is tied to their current rarity and only a select few of the characters from the pool of 3 or 4 star characters can be promoted to 5-stars. Very irritatingly, this means that a majority of a the characters you summon are negligible since they can not be promoted and as such can not reach the maximum level (80). \n\nThe distribution rates for each rarity in the gacha system are also very miserable. Each summon nets you a a 2% chance for a 5-star, 40% chance for a 4-star and 57.6% chance for a 3-star. I personally dislike gacha monetization and as such have never spent a cent throughout the many gacha games I have played, this one being no exception. This game does alright with giving players the premium currency for free, but only through the use of ads (which are not part of the PC release).\n\nOne more note: to promote a character from 4 stars to 5 stars, it requires 5 \"chant scripts\". The only renewable way to obtain these scripts is through Another Dungeons, which I will cover in the \"grind\" section of my review.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe initial story is well written and produced, as you would expect from Masato Kato who has previously worked on Chrono Trigger. Unfortunately I think that the story past chapter 26 is sub-par compared to what came before. You also rarely get free characters from the main campaign after this point in the story. The side quests are fun ways to get to know the towns you're visiting or the characters in your party, but it's really unfortunate that every single character side quest boils down to the same exact formula. You start the quest -> Dialogue -> Go somewhere else -> Fight a monster -> Go somewhere else -> End\n\nAlso an important QoL feature that is missing is the ability to skip cutscenes. You have to keep clicking in order to progress through dialogue.\n\nPurely looking at this from a design perspective, these quests are utterly monotonous. At least the writing for these quests is usually good. You find out something new about the character and might explain some of their personality or odd behavior.\n\nThere are also various entire \"side stories\" which are entire mini-campaigns that take place in locations separate from the main story. The stories here are typically well-written but are unfortunately plagued by a grind requirement in order to progress through them. For most of these stories, you have to grind a certain amount of their respective key item in order to access the next chapter. And just to nudge you into using the gacha system more, having specific gacha characters will increase the rate at which you collect these key items. \n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nIn regards to party customization, Another Eden does a phenomenal job. You can have 6 members in a party and 4 will fight while 2 stay in the backline. When you switch a frontline unit for someone in the back, they will perform a \"valor chant\", which can be a party/individual buff, an enemy debuff, or even an AOE attack. Another Force is also a cool mechanic but more often than not just boils down to button mashing.\n\nHowever it should be noted that your party customization is tied to how lucky/how much you spend on the gacha system to get new characters. Units obtained through gacha are also often much better than free characters that accomplish similar roles. \n\n[h1]Grind[/h1]\nThe gameplay loop is absolutely horrible. You get 4 green keys and 4 red keys every day (you can only hold up to 9 and 5 respectively). These are used for accessing Another Dungeons which are just mini-dungeons of areas you have already explored. Unfortunately, every single dungeon run is the exact same experience. The same starting locations, the same path to the end, the same enemies, and it becomes tiring really quickly. The real kicker is that you have to make the most of these keys because you need the promotion items as well as materials to craft weapons that the dungeon drops. \n\nThere is also the light and shadow system which is just extra BS that I won't get into. Just know that it only benefits players who summon duplicates of the same hero (usually paying users) or people that grind dungeons every day for months.\n\nI covered the grind from side-stories in my \"story\" section and how it creates a problem for the game to sell you a solution. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack and Voice Acting[/h1]\nThe music is excellent. It's very recognizable and I love listening to it outside of playing the game. You will be hard pressed to find pieces of soundtrack on youtube that aren't enjoyable.\n\nThe voice acting on the other hand is where WFS really skimped out. Very few portions of the game are actually voiced, almost all dialogue in the game just has music playing with the occasional sound effect. The only times you hear voice acting is when you summon a character and once every turn of combat. It's really quite disappointing if you compare it to JRPGs like P5, Tales, and Octopath Traveler.\n\nThey have hired many unproven english voice actors to do the english dub of this game. This is further supported by the fact that they did not get the english voice acting done for the P5 or Tales collaboration characters. That being said, the people who say that the english dub is horrible or garbage are completely exaggerating. The quality is not up to something you would expect from something like Funimation or Crunchyroll, but it is certainly not bad enough that it's \"unplayable\". \n\nAnother thing that these dub haters like to ignore is that there are [b]NO SUBTITLES[/b] for the Japanese voices. So whenever you do hear these JP voices (keep in mind it's literally one line per turn of combat), you won't even know what they are saying. The steam version does lack the JP voice lines, but I assume this was because WFS saw a vast majority of players keeping the English voices turned on and so they didn't bother adding the JP voices. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAnother Eden is a story-rich and incredibly fun JRPG a for the first few hours and features a large cast of characters that make the combat incredibly diverse.

Here's how I feel about it and how I feel about its mobile port after some play time in it.\n\nPros: If you like classic JRPGs like Chrono Trigger or anything similar of a random encounter JRPG, you might like this game. If you like mindlessly grinding for materials to gain rewards, then this is your game. If you like collaborations with Persona 5, Tales series, and other future franchises, then this is your game. If you like gacha games where doing achievements to acquire rainbow gems just to pull and gain nothing but salt pleases you, then this is your game.\n\nCons: If you hate gacha games where using gems to summon and all you get is salt sickens you, then this is not your game. If you don't like English voices, this might not be your game. If you don't like grinding your character's EXP and rather feed EXP to your characters, then this is not your game. If you don't like simple-style 2D sprites, then this is not your game. If you don't like turn based RPGs (this is preferential) then this is not your game.\n\nMy impressions of this PC version are as follows...at this moment in time the PC version feels like it needs to undergo several platform patches before fully feeling like at better platform to play on, as well as adding Borderless Widescreen, adding back the different voice overs that mobile had like Japanese VAs, decreasing lag and stutter, as well as fixing other smaller bugs like not being able launch it one the first attempt whereas it launches on the 2nd attempt. Overall I feel like it is a better idea to play AE on mobile devices or emulators for the optimal experience until the PC platform is fixed, unless you are new to the game and are enjoying the experience on PC just fine or you phone's battery is just awful.\n\nAnd here's some personal words of mine....play it first, form your own opinion, and don't take someone else's before you form a fake opinion and ruin a chance a play a game you might like or don't like.", "timestamp_created": 1617174949, "timestamp_updated": 1617256319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517774343490600586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89415140": {"recommendationid": "89415140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154890201", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1654597457}, "language": "english", "review": "yes this is a mobile game gacha, ive been played it for like 6 months but i stop playing it, until now\n\nlet me give you my honest review\n\n1. the game is so grindy but you can still beat the game or story without being a whale\n2. the story is kinda confusing (7/10) because the plot about time travel so it has a lot of \"hole\" but its still well made so you can enjoy the stories\n3. it is single player gacha game, you can't play with your friends\n4. gacha rate kinda terible but i hear the developer now being kind with some event for free tickets\n5. daily dungeon is boring since you can't auto or skip, you need to do it like 10+ times per day\n6. they have collab with famous game like \"Persona 5\" and \"Tales chronicle\"\n\n\nthis just came out for steam so it has so much need update like JP Voice, daily ads reward, and it takes so long to open the \"award\" tab.", "timestamp_created": 1617174399, "timestamp_updated": 1617174539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537638306617736816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89414490": {"recommendationid": "89414490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099462731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1617176094}, "language": "english", "review": "A gacha game that has made it to Steam?

If i find something bad with PC port that will be edited in later.\nAnd i have used tiny bit money to get star dream encounter banners.\n\nLets start with the elephant in the room.\nIs/Was this a mobile game? YES\nDoes it have gacha? YES\nDoes it update content like GaaS? YES\nCan it be played F2P? Yes\nStamina system? NO, though is limited on how many dungeons per day.\nI will cover all these later on, but i know some people will skip the game just because of this. \n\nGameplay:\nThis is a turn based JRPG mobile, with heavy team building to overcome hard optional stuff. Since it is turned based, being mobile game did not hold that gameplay back in any way.\nGameplay start of pretty simpel at start, make team of 4 frontline unit and 2 backline units. Frontline unit are ones doing the battle, while backline units are there to switch with frontline unit or replace em if they die.\nThen comes Valor chant system, which is system you should not over look, even though it not important at start. Valor chant is attack or effect that happens when switching character in.\nLastly on top we get Another force, which simpelly a bar you fill and then active to get a period where you can spam skill nonstop without boss attacking back\nNow later one there wil come more system like grasta(think of it as extra gear) and zones, though zones can show up very early depeding on your gacha luck, it is not needed for a long time\n\nStory:\nAnother eden is not called spiritual successor to Chrono Trigger for no reason. It is a time traveling story by Masato Kato, and i personally couldn\u00b4t put game down first time i startet to play and always keep coming back for new story content.\nFor story there is a lot, first you got a nice long main story, 1 mythos, 10 sidestory, 3 symphony(this is collab, 2 are persona 5 and 1 is Tales of series), tons of side quest, 3 to 5 personal quest for 5* units and most likely forgot something\n\nMusic:\nFor me Another eden OST is good, while i am no music expert. I simpelly judge this on fact i every now and then go find some songs to play in background when doing other stuff\n\nContent:\nAlready said there is a lot of stories to go through. But that is not only content in another eden \nhere some example;\nFishing\nHard boss battle/Manifastion weapon battle\nLord of Mana VRMMO\n\"cat battle\"\nTheatre\nDungeon runs (you get 1 red key and 1 green key each 6 hours)\nFarming grasta, exp, gear and so on\n\nAn important note here, content in Another eden is permanent, so you will never miss out if you decide to take break from the game\nMost people know one thing that common for gacha games, is stamina system to limited you. Good news is another eden does not have a stamina system, so you can keep playing the stories or go fishing without worrying about being forced to stop. But i Dungeon do have a limit on em, most likely because where you get stuff to upgrade character from 4 to 5*, light/shadow farming and grasta stuff.\n\nMmonetization:\nOk this a big point for a lot of people. Game is a gacha, i have seen better rates and i seen worse, while they never cheap either. No pity system, but all 5* can also drop as 4*(often called 4,5*) which you later can upgrade 5*. So overall you will be getting 5* at some point, new players got a lot chronos stone to earn\nThere is free and paid banner. Only difference is most time paid banner guarantee 5* at end, but for you own sake, always read info the banner before pulling.\nIf you decide to get some paid games, my advice is. Only use it on Paid stones on fateful encounter that 100% drops a 5* at end. But if you only go buy  stones once or twice it is worth saving those paid stones for when either star dream encounter or \"100% chance for this unit\" banners. Because star dream you get 10 pull + \"pick your 5* ticket\" and while other banner will Guarantee what 5* you get, so with these 2 you always know what you get.\nBE CAREFUL, if you forget to pay attention you can waste paid stones on free banner and you will  regret that i suspect. Though if you whale go ahead\n\n\nF2P:\nNow also a big topic for this type of game. Can you play without ever paying? Yes\nFirst of all, you will get some 5* with amount chrono stone you get as new players and you can get 50 stone minimum each day. Even if you are one those insanely unlucky people that never gets a  good pulls, Another eden is filled with character that can be earn and upgrade to 5* from just playing and never touching gacha. \nFast checking i think there is something like 26+ with some of em being top tier units and covering pretty well since you can get fire and slash zone without gacha.\nDifficulty to get that free units varies a lot, but collab units in general are not hard to get and will set you well up for later content.\n\n\nJust something else at end: I WANT MORE CHANT SCRIPTS!!", "timestamp_created": 1617171089, "timestamp_updated": 1617171089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513078212738037109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89412371": {"recommendationid": "89412371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146454419", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1682231612}, "language": "english", "review": "Would i recommend this game.\n\nYES. yes i would.\n\nDoes it need some more PC exclusive features?\n\nYes, yes it does.\n\nMaybe either wait a bit for some more updates\n\nI look forward to playing this game again in a few updates", "timestamp_created": 1617170134, "timestamp_updated": 1619067529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509896337985992432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89412051": {"recommendationid": "89412051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000879653", "num_games_owned": 2623, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1617169177}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]EDIT:[/b] Steam version includes anticheat kernel (kinda reasonable 4 gacha), installs to Windows folder & not removed properly when uninstall (rather less so). Prev edit removed, charlimit. Orig review below.\n\n\nThis is a port of a mobile game. I personally like this game, but I'm leaving this as a negative review because the downsides really are quite steep and I believe negative reviews are more useful overall for finding out why you might not want to spend your money on a game. Out of respect for the reader's time I'll get things out of the way in reverse order from how these are usually listed:\n\n[b]The Ugly[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] This is a gacha game. All the money is made off lootboxes for units, the rates are very, very low, and there's no pity system to guarantee a unit eventually other than the (paid only) banners that have guaranteed 5-stars, only some of which let you pick which one you get. New units or new versions of old units are introduced every couple weeks and they have powercreep to keep players spending. The global version's several months behind the JP version so you generally have some idea what to save up for (however the devs did recently release a unit to global before JP so this isn't a guarantee), you only need one version of a unit at any rarity to be able to unlock their other forms through gameplay, and the game gives you a lot of free rolls through the achievement system, but that's cold comfort to people who save for months or spend hundreds of dollars only to get nothing but robots and Pom. If you're not willing to support a game that uses a predatory monetization model no matter how good the actual game is, you're best off looking elsewhere.\n[*] The PC port is catastrophically unstable, at least for me. My copy crashed right after I finished transferring my save from mobile and unlocked the achievements, then decided I needed to redownload the entire thing from scratch, which I didn't bother doing. The entire rest of this review is based off what I've heard others say about the early access trial, since due to a few reasons that will be detailed below I was going to switch straight back to mobile after becoming eligible to leave a review anyway.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] The game's an 8GB download but when you launch it you're stuck with the same amount of downloading as if you were using the mobile app, which is not an 8GB upfront download. Kind of defeats the point, especially if you get stuck in a downloading >100% progress loop which is known to happen on the mobile version as well.\n[*] The game can be [i]incredibly[/i] grindy if you're trying to get all the rewards. That's not necessarily a bad thing if you're into it, some of the rewards really are more than good enough to make the time investment worth it, and some of the grinds are much less painful than others, but then you get things like fishing which takes over a week if you're doing it optimally, months to years if realistic, and doesn't get you anything but an admittedly large amount of gacha currency and a unit that's long since been power crept into irrelevancy. Thankfully this sort of grind only really happens with optional content, and the rewards from the worst grinds can generally be replaced with far less grindy alternatives.\n[*] Max level is tied to rarity, so once you're past the launch story anything that isn't max rarity is going to be basically worthless. The story units don't unlock their max rarity forms for quite a while (some still haven't) and then need you to grind to actually use them, though these days there are other free units that you get at max rarity much earlier that also skip most of the grind.\n[*] Upgrading gacha units requires Chant Scripts, which have an obscenely low drop rate from the daily dungeons which are this game's main time gate. There are quite a few guaranteed chant drops but they tend to run afoul of the previous point.\n[*] Global's on an accelerated release schedule to catch up with JP. This seems to have been slowing down somewhat recently now that we're only a couple months behind, but it has meant less saved up login rewards for global players compared to JP players. And that's only partially offset by knowing what to save for.\n[*] The Steam version doesn't have the option for Japanese voices. The biggest issue with this is that there are collab characters from Persona 5 and the Tales series, as well as skits from the Tales collab, that are completely unvoiced now. It's not entirely clear why they decided to do this, it's not as though PC has more space limitations than mobile. Maybe it's a licensing thing?\n[*] You can't rebind the controls, so if you don't like the layout you're out of luck. This might get addressed in a patch later.\n[*] This one's closer to neutral since whether it's good or bad depends on the individual, but the Steam version doesn't have ads. The ads in the mobile version are fully optional (though one of them has a prompt you have to close once a day when you log in) and give you currency for gacha rolls.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The Good[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] The launch story is one big homage to Chrono Trigger, and in fact several of the staff of CT are leads for this game. It really shows in the [i]extremely[/i] high quality of the gameplay, music, and writing, barring a couple spots in specific sidestories where the translation is known to have been rushed for a simultaneous JP + global release. Don't worry about the game having no identity of its own, almost everything other than the launch story (AKA part 1 of the main story) and the collabs gives the game its own distinct identity.\n[*] The level of polish and attention to detail is generally extremely high. The game reacts to whether or not you've met a character before and how far you've gotten through party members' sidestories when you do something involving them, and almost always gets it right.\n[*] Unlike virtually every other gacha game in existence, there is no such thing as time limited content in this game (apart from banners and currency campaigns). All characters join the spook pool for every subsequent banner once released. All stories, dungeons, and fights are permanently accessible, to the point where any maps that get closed as part of the story get added to the End of Time homage area to make sure you don't lose out on anything. And this game has a [i]lot[/i] of content for you to dive into.\n[*] The game is 100% beatable with free units, several of which are top tier even in the JP meta. Some particularly insane players have even beaten many of the superbosses with them, and I do mean insane because it can take upwards of an hour of perfect play to do that.\n[*] The devs frequently release new versions of old units or manifest weapons that upgrade the old versions outright. Sometimes they even give max rarity forms to units that didn't have them before. They don't always bring old units back into the meta (poor Shion), but they succeed more often than not, and the effort is appreciated regardless.\n[*] Related to the previous, some old units are near the top of the meta even today. Most relevant to new players at the time of writing, Suzette (with her manifest weapon, which is considered one of the easiest to obtain since it was one of the first to be released) is an extremely strong and useful unit to this day and is presently being given to new accounts for free, albeit at sub-max rarity so you'd still have to spend chants to upgrade her or get lucky with rolls.\n[*] The game's word salad of a title actually makes sense once you have the context for it.\n[*] Myrus is a precious (and piping hot) cinnamon roll.\n[/list]\n\nHopefully I've helped you come to a decision. If you decide to give the game a shot, all you need to know is that rerolling isn't necessary, Bivette is the best pick from the tutorial summon, and you should set up a transfer ID as soon as possible and save it somewhere safe so you won't risk losing your account.", "timestamp_created": 1617169554, "timestamp_updated": 1617665767, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 175, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750027000904083252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89411296": {"recommendationid": "89411296", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995399030", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1692408387}, "language": "english", "review": "Beyond horrendous since 2022+\n\nDownloading 1GB can take over an hour because of their shitty server.\nPlus I cant even log in my account (100h ++) easily) ; it teleport me somewhere with character I dont even have ... it used to be an absolute blast tho.", "timestamp_created": 1617168041, "timestamp_updated": 1677981261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670448660850524902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 588, "total_negative": 269, "total_reviews": 857}, "cursors": {"AoJ4wsCuw/gCcO6J1QI=": "Thu Nov 23 14:41:18 2023"}}
