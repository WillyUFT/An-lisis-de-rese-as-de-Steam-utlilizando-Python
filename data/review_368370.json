At first, I loved the game. I loved the simplicity and the mystery. It reminded me of Firewatch somehow, which is also one of my favourite games. As I progressed in the game, after few searches, I understand what is going on and started watching the videos more carefully. At some point, on that certain video. I said \"Ok, that is the clip I was looking for\". But after that point, things got more and more mixed man. I felt like I am missing a piece. That feeling didn't go away even after I watched all the clips. And the name that guy said in the chat was completely blowed my mind, I went through the clips again, I thought maybe it is the missing piece... but it was not. At the end I felt like I didn't solve anything, no closure. But hey, I decrypted the thing with the hands in both videos without any help from the internet, I count it as a win. \n\nSorry if that review doesn't make sense to you, it might makes sense after you finish the game tho. I personally liked the game, had fun, I recommend it.

It throws you right into the fray, and it is up to you to form your own questions - and come to your own conclusions.

But it's worst than that. After a while of searching, the game becomes an unbearable guessing game where you just type in random words, hoping to find something you haven't watched already. It's not made easier by the fact that many clips are short and contains sometimes words you wouldn't have searched for anyway.\nThat's all for the concept and in all honesty, if this was just this, I would have let it slipped, given it a recommendation and said it's a nice, short experience for anyone willing to give it a try, even though it will probably end up by watching a solution video. No, the real problem with \"Her Story\" is not the concept, it's err... the story actually. I'm not gonna spoil but... it's bad. Like, z movie, trying to be clever but being desperately cliche kind of bad. There's nothing to save it really, the plot is absurd, the twist are weird, it's poorly written, etc. Add up the fact that you can get spoiled VERY early on by typing some words (oops) and it just gives a bad taste in the mouth. Even worst, there is no conclusion. Nothing is ever said or implied about any resolution for any of the characters at any point.\nOh, something else.

The way you actually search through this footage is pretty interesting. You're able to search for a word, and if that word appears in any of the interviews (which are broken up into bite sized chunks for some reason) then you'll be able to watch that portion of the interview. The game starts you off with the search term 'murder', which produces a few clips that drop hints of other things you may want to look into. The way each clip nudges you to search for certain terms is very well done and you'll find yourself organically going down rabbit holes and having memorable moments when you finally put things together. \n\nIt took me around 40-60 minutes to solve the mystery, and about an hour and a half to hit the credits. I think there was more clips left to see, but it didn't seem necessary to hunt them all down. Overall I enjoyed the experience and liked that the game didn't overstay its welcome. One criticism I'd have is that the game just kind of ends. I solved the mystery and nothing happened, so I just kept on poking around until I reached an ending sequence that as far as I could tell was only prompted by how much time you'd spent in the game (or maybe the amount of footage you'd seen). It would be nice if there was a way you could trigger the ending by making it clear you had solved the mystery, maybe through something serving as a 'quiz' of sorts. \n\nIt was fun, I'd suggest picking it up during a sale and enjoying it in a single sitting. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1696951594, "timestamp_updated": 1696951594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147970711": {"recommendationid": "147970711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394593637", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1696937713}, "language": "english", "review": "Its very challenging game TBH. even thought the complexity of the story and the meaning behind make me want to finish the game", "timestamp_created": 1696937793, "timestamp_updated": 1696937793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147962187": {"recommendationid": "147962187", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103692515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1696918375}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1696918190, "timestamp_updated": 1696918190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147899765": {"recommendationid": "147899765", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998561249", "num_games_owned": 615, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1696810401}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not my definition of Video Game.

Perhaps the point of the game is to figure out how to play it right XD\n\nUse tags to mark the location of your video.  Seems obvious now, but in the beginning I was unaware of how messed up some of the organization was going to be, plus there's nothing I can remember that gave you a hint that you could do that.  Use the database checker and tag your videos with something like \"1-7\" (row 1 space 7).  that way, when you're close to the end, you can just search for the videos closer to that empty space to find some hints for what words to search for later.\n\nThe fact that near the end I was sort of fucked didn't really break the game for me.  It's quite a tedious thing but it was done rather well for the most part.  Story is fun to slowly uncover through the process.

For games to be considered art they would need to communicate a message or an experience through the language that defines it's medium and I'm glad to say Her Story succeeds at everything it attempts to do. It is hard to go into reviewing the game without spoiling something but this is a narrative split in hundreds of clips from 7 interviews from the year 1994. The writing in this game is superb and something many top tier TV shows would strive for as far as script. Many things are ambiguous and you will only take out whatever you put in. The acting was appropriate and the diagetic design around the whole experience enhances the feeling the player will have, especially if he or she had a computer from the era. The way the narrative is delivered reminds me of some of the best detective media I've experienced, particularly Memento. The non-sequential/non-linear and disjointed nature is handled very well.  \n\nVideo games as art need to prove that a message can be delivered in a way unique to its format and I'm glad to say this story or experience couldn't be delivered in any other form. In that sense, this is a masterpiece, even if it differs from what our concept of a \"video game\" should be.\n\nI would encourage anyone to try this game, even non-gamers.

You hear the names of people who are relevant to the story and specific details that serve as new \"leads\", and the search limiter guides you to be more indirect to reward cunning deduction.\n\nSetting aside what you paid, or whether other interactive narratives of this style \"did it better\" or \"did it worse\", Her Story is the absolute floor for level of effort for independent mystery games, let alone big name companies.

Your task then is to categorize the information by tagging the clips, in order to reveal all of the clips. Midgame this becomes rather tedious, and you are still kind of grasping at straws.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, there is a lot of speculation about what the true nature of the situation is even once you have revealed all of the tapes. That is not necessarily a weakness, but it is kind of unsatisfying as a detective game. If the game had more than one possible definite and clear ending it would be amazing and interesting for replay. This game lacked some mechanics that would have made it far more engaging and rewarding. The player is merely a listener, ultimately. \n\nAll of that said, the acting was great. I love the idea.

[/h1]\n\n2015 was a different time. The concept of computer nostalgia was totally raw. Windows 10 had just released and it ushered in a new era of technology's dominance in our daily lives. This was all very new, just dawning on us. Sam Barlow hit the note perfectly, when he referred to the game's musical selection: \" [It] highlights the gap between the authentic 'fake computer world', and the fact that you're playing a game \". It's also an FMV game, an untapped niche. All of this added together meant that Sam struck the note very perfectly indeed. The rapid sales and the critic's reviews should display that.\n\nYet, as we evolve from a pupa to a full-grown butterfly in this age of digital dominance, how does it hold up? It feels like a last gasp. Many of the things our main (90s) character finds normal is no longer normal. I was born in 2004, and my generation is now on the center stage. I may hate it, but the fact is we are completely different. It very much has an old-fashioned feel to it (but not nostalgic). I love it, personally. Old-fashion is always the best I say. I appreciate the older, slower style of writing. A bravo for Sam for his success in writing. The dialogue was written extremely well, even with the flaws accounted for. I'd be terrified if I didn't see flaws anyway. I enjoyed the realization of who we are playing as in the end, but it was not played on enough during the actual game. The story left me with questions, none of which were thought-provoking, moral, or philosophical. Perhaps I have been spoiled by Lewis. I do expect a good story to challenge how I view the world or what I believe. Otherwise, it is all fluff, barely more than gossip.\n\nBut personally, I believe it would have been [i] much [/i] better if this was a novel instead. The entire game was supposed to be a novel concept, something new to enthrall reviewers and be \"different\". I am mostly immune to such gimmickry. In all practicality, this does not work out. While I expected all clips to be outside of chronological order, it leads to each clip falling flat. There is very little emotional weight or direction. The experience can quickly move from exposition on the character's sex life, to a short clip on how much sugar the character desires in their tea. It is the movie equivalent of dyslexia, and I find that quite comical. I would be lying if I didn't admit that it was enjoyable. \n\nI assume the \"fun\" in this game was meant to be the note-taking after every clip. That fell flat as well. It may challenge someone who is younger or someone who does not retain information easily. For me, it was equivalent to sitting on a bench at a public park and writing down the skin color of those who pass by. If you don't see the pointlessness of that, then perhaps you should stop reading this review.\n\nIf this game were a novel, I surely would have read it fully. I expect a novel version could have been more fleshed out, in every aspect of writing. It surely would have held more intrigue, and less chance for the story to be spoiled half an hour in. [spoiler] Yes, I saw the confession clip when I searched \"watch\". I was half an hour in. I quickly realized they were twins (the tat gave it away) and what had happened. Yet I had none of the second act to fulfill the storytelling experience. I felt very robbed. [/spoiler]\n\nYet I bought the game, and played it all the way through. How could I not recommend it? Only a fool decides to play a game all the way through just to say it is a bad game. It is a good game. It is a unique, novel idea. It gave me nostalgia, for 2015, when this kind of thing was cool and new. I enjoyed the old-fashion of it.

This is an excellent investigation game and will really make you feel like a detective.\n\nThe story here: you are someone interested in a 20+ year old criminal case for which the original interview footage was lost a long time ago.  All you have to work with is a clunky old database containing dozens of short video clips which can be accessed through searching for keywords in the transcript.\n\nThe gameplay might be best described as exploration-based; except instead of mapping out the floor plan of a dungeon or searching caves for gold coins, you're searching for puzzle pieces across different moments in time.  Each new video clip has a bit more dialogue on it which might or might not give you a new keyword to unlock more avenues of investigation.\n\nThe interface is very simple, but simple does not mean this game is easy.  It's all about your own observational and reasoning skills, your ability to discern what is relevant and what to pursue.\n\nEven after several hours, I finished the game and reached the end credits, but am still compelled to return to the database to find out more of the story.\n\nDepending on how you approach it, you might be able to get to the \"end\" in half an hour while barely scratching the surface, or you might take hours to pick through and learn all there is to know.  I think this would be a good value at $10, but it's worth noting that the game frequently goes on deep sale and can often be found as part of a bundle.

The following will be a spoiler-free review. \n\nI've apparently spent 3.5 hours \"playing\" this game (or \"game\", as some would say), and for all intents and purposes, I've \"solved\" the main question or questions (which were never explicitly posed) and I have, to use the word that other reviewers here have written, \"beaten\" the game after about 2 hours. I'll probably spend a few hours more, just out of fun and curiousity. \n\nThis is by far the least amount of time I have ever spent with a PC game I have liked. If the price tag is too high for this short amount of fun, then by all means pass; quite possibly, if you are stingy enough, you can simply get a Steam Refund after playing 1.9 hours, you'll probably have \"solved\" the game by then as well. But I would recommend it even at full price. \n\nOthers have mentioned how hard it is to put a \"genre\" label on this, and others have even claimed (some of them quite angrily so) that \"this isn't a proper game\". Perhaps not, if by \"game\" you mean a set of rules by which the player wins or loses after performing certain actions. This game is truly open, almost as open as games you used to play as little children -- spend any time with a 2 to 5 year old and you'll know what I mean. If you can no longer have fun doing something like that in an incredibly artsy and intellectually pleasing setting, then this game will certainly not be for you. \n\nOstensibly, you role-play an investigator into an apparent murder. At your disposal is an old computer with some even older renderings of ancient VHS tapes made by police investigators. The lighting, sound and video quality is poor, as to be expected from these ratty recordings. You may search through these old clips and gather what you will: information, if you like, or just interpretation. \n\nUnlike the Obra Dinn, a masterpiece in narrative mystery puzzle solving, Her Story is both much, much shorter and much, much more open: If there even is \"a\" story, it's not clear that you have to learn all its parts. It's not clear when the game is \"over\" -- it's over when you want it to be. There is no goal dictated by the game, it's all up to you. Many players might not like this. I am grateful. \n\nThere is much to say about the quality of the material (despite its poor lighting, graphics, etc.), but not too much without spoilers. Perhaps this is allowed: We are probably used to watching professional actors and actresses perform professional villians in professional studios when we consume the tropes that make up the background for this video game, but this is different: Viva Seifert, the person who portrays the only person we see in the video clips, was a professional gymnast turned musician, not an actress. She is absolutely brilliant, but not in the same way as a Hollywood star would have been. And we are richer for it. Since she is playing a person who is, in some ways, playing a person, and the ambivalences are too juicy to be detailed any further here for fear of spoilers. \n\nWell worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1676406624, "timestamp_updated": 1676406624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731892168521881104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132758865": {"recommendationid": "132758865", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174830316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1676275093}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall interesting game, although I spent more time on arranging the clips than actually watching them.

I 'beat' the game with just over 50% of the clips unlocked.\n\nFor one thing, the game is mostly well written, the dialogue in it's construction develops it's own sense of themes and it's own sense of pacing, especially as you control it but it can only go so far with said narrative in it's style of presentation and it's progression of said themes. The core gameplay loop although innovative is repetitive, and it's major sense of presentation are these ugly static frames of the same woman in an ugly set, and this is the single camera angle of the film for the entire game. Furthermore, I found the lead actress to be annoying more than anything, as she either overacts or underacts every moment for the whole game. \n\nWhat it does accomplish is a rather well-done twist that re-contextualises the experience, and changes the game into a kind of spot-the-difference between the seven interviews. You'll start to investigate the very nature of the character in front of you more intimately to discover the truth. It's intuitive and all done through your own sense of progression, and one of the best parts about the experience. However, when the film's sense of thematic development is listening to a character repeat the word 'fairy tale' and 'princess' ten times in a row, it does get grating, and I hope in Barlow reinvented that gameplay loop in his next two games in a more dynamic and less obvious way.\n\nI understand what it's trying to mimic: a police interrogation, which makes sense and is done to a degree. however, there is no sense of presence for the detectives in the room, as there is not a single piece of spoken dialogue for the detectives, and this doesn't feel any easier when the character directly addresses them. These factors broke my immersion and made the game feel boring, as it does little to vary itself. The actress might change her clothes between interviews, a set of shelves behind her in one interview will vanish in the next. In some clips, props appear, and are sometimes used, but that only goes so far. In one clip, she will become hooked up to a lie detector, but it's used as a cheap gimmick, when the inclusion of a device like that could lead to a different sense of narrative, I wish they kept it for an entire interview.\n\nFurthermore, this tangled web of different subplots isn't hard to really put together. You'll discover the truth easily, and at the same time, I'm kind of glad it's like that, but also wish there was a bit more nuance. Plus that ending where you get a message from 'SB' was a really dumb way to close the narrative, but at the same time I don't know how else you could really write an ending to a game like this. It just feels like, \"Hey, you won, good job,\" as I had found only half of the clips. I might return to the rest and uncover the full narrative but there isn't much to bring me back.\n\nTo me this kind of gameplay loop has a great sense of potential, and works mostly well in it's script and sense of discovery, however its failure to deliver a more dynamic and immersive experience really holds this game back. I'm eager to play Barlow's next two games, Telling Lies and Immortality however, and this is only because the hybrid of film-making and gameplay makes for a very interesting artistic experience. \n\nPlay this if you're truly curious, but just don't go in expecting this brilliant masterpiece the game had been hyped up to be. It's more of an experimental blend of mediums, and I do appreciate it for being that.", "timestamp_created": 1676149877, "timestamp_updated": 1676149877, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132651727": {"recommendationid": "132651727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198936736732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1676146833}, "language": "spanish", "review": "estuvo muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1676146896, "timestamp_updated": 1676146896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132558365": {"recommendationid": "132558365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970705552", "num_games_owned": 2117, "num_reviews": 2038, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1676064673}, "language": "english", "review": "Barlow the polygamist!", "timestamp_created": 1676064755, "timestamp_updated": 1676064755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.361394554376602173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132507756": {"recommendationid": "132507756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067230913", "num_games_owned": 1655, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1675953500}, "language": "english", "review": "i think the police need to update their archival search interface", "timestamp_created": 1676013864, "timestamp_updated": 1676013864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132470749": {"recommendationid": "132470749", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147523386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1675949995}, "language": "english", "review": "Her Story is one of the most unique games out there.

Some of them can be as short as 3-4 seconds and at first viewing seem absolutely redundant. As you delve further into the archives, however, they can take on a whole new meaning. The actress who plays the subject of these interviews deserves huge credit for her work here, her performance only truly reveals its brilliance the further you progress and you begin to notice her intonation, mannerisms and overall demeanour are all absolutely perfect.\n\nIf you're after something truly different, interesting and original then look no further.

From that onwards the process of discovery feels rather natural as you zigzag through the timeline of clips by using the different keywords you pick up (both directly and through association/deduction) from the videos to get a deeper and deeper picture.\n\nNow, one of the game's biggest strengths is also a bit of a weakness: the query system is completely open, only limited by clever scriptwriting to hide some instances past the five clip per query limit. It's mostly satisfying as you mess around with other words which might help narrow down larger queries, but sometimes you accidentally get certain \"revelation\" clips earlier than what you might want to, sometimes even by just messing about (case in point: if you wonder if searching the game's title hides some Easter egg). Not something inherently bad, but the lack of any sort of gating can lead to a flow that's not the intended one.\n\nAnd while you can get a large portion of the clips naturally (even if late game queries can be a bit more haphazard, such as searching for specific profanities), completing the database can be a not particularly fun thing. After \"beating\" the game you get a command which gives you the possibility of finding unseen clips (in order), and while I must admit a few of those contained wors I should have thought of searching earlier, it eventually becomes a slog of microclips with very common words in them (some do give hints for other queries, but they are the minority).\n\nA final minor complaint is that the quote search is not a particularly useful tool. I guess there's a few compound words (or maybe some expected phrases) which can lead better searches with this functionality, but ultimately its specificity clashes with search philosophy of the bulk of the game.\n\nThose are ultimately nitpicks, for the initial experience is ultimately a rather enjoyable one. It's not the best detective game ever nor even the best use of breadcrumb storytelling/worldbuilding, but it sachieves what it seeks out to do: tell a story in a way that \"justifies\" itself as a FMV.

Around two hours into the game, I received an in-game prompt that simply asked me if I understood what was going on. When I replied saying I did (and I did), the credit scroll started. It could also have been due to the fact that I had about half of the clips discovered at that point, according to the database on the in-game desktop. I am not sure if there is a proper ending to the game but to be honest, I am not all that invested into the gameplay or narrative.\n\nThe game does not give much of a tutorial. Immediately after loading into the game, you are presented with a window with pre-entered text and are expected to search that term to begin discovering clips. The window cannot be minimised, only exited, and once exited, the game returns to the main menu. It is not obvious that the icons can be double-clicked on which is where the tutorial is located.\n\nThe settings are found in-game as well rather than the main menu which is all but empty. The settings are also very limited. You are able to disable the shader that adds the retro CRT look - why anyone would want to do that is beyond me - and a button to \"Delete Session Data\". Some other players feel this button is ambiguous due to its lack of description as it deletes all progress and hours of their playtime was wasted. So be forewarned.\n\nThis is a game where note-taking is strongly advised. So much so that user tags are a feature in the game. I would highly recommend using this feature lest you find yourself running in circles for hours.\n\nAs for technical non-issues, I prefer to play games in fullscreen borderless and unfortunately this game does not offer that. It has fullscreen (gross), and windowed (less gross). The issue I had was that the game did not care which monitor I chose for it to open on so I had to manually adjust 3rd party software each time I started the game after moving the window to the correct screen at start-up. It was not difficult, just tedious.\n\nThere is not really a way I can recommend this game. It is not bad, but it is not good either. The gameplay is tedious and boring, and at times confusing and frustrating. The narrative is simple and was easy to predict. My own technical difficulties did not do it any favours either.\n\nFor the sake of being forced to choose between yes and no in terms of my recommendation for this game due to Steam's lack of a neutral option for reviews, I suppose for the right person, [b]whilst on sale[/b], this could be an enjoyable game, but there are other detective games available that are more immersive and interesting.

The interviews are well-acted, the UI sets a good mood, and the 'search' function is delightful to play with.\n\nHowever, I have a few small complaints.\n\nMy chief complaint is that there is no clear indication as to when you have 'beaten' the game. You can only keep pursuing more clips and more of the story as it is presented. Notably, you have a database which indicates how many clips you have and what's missing, but you cannot click to view the entire sequence of clips as you have unlocked them so far, or even quickly navigate to a clip before a missing section to try and give you ideas of what could come after it. This makes finishing the database nearly impossible without the use of a guide, and can provide an unsatisfying conclusion if you were looking for 'finality'.\n\nIf you are going to stream this game, I highly recommend having a copy of a guide handy if you get truly stuck. Without my chat actively coming up with helpful suggestions to jog my memory, I would have really struggled to clear this in a reasonable amount of time (I took about 5 hours, though some of that was idle and engaged in chat with my community).\n\nPersonally, I'll give this game a solid 91/100. I actually appreciated that there was no definitive 'ending', and the unique gameplay is something I want to see more of. I knocked points because the lack of clarity around the absence of a true 'ending sequence' stumped me and was not obvious in the game's information, which would have freed me to enjoy the mystery a lot more. (There are some smart choices being made, and they are choices, not oversights - but that doesn't mean I felt they enriched the experience enough to not be worth noting for future players.)", "timestamp_created": 1663834548, "timestamp_updated": 1663834548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122447718": {"recommendationid": "122447718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815524439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1656530882}, "language": "english", "review": "Sick game, was really cool to play and sometimes even gave a scary vibe, I found it to be sooo creepy when the face on the screen showed up", "timestamp_created": 1663525209, "timestamp_updated": 1663525209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122439994": {"recommendationid": "122439994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821305749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1631738738}, "language": "english", "review": "There is this one bug thats literally breaking the entire game.

I'm very particular about how they're organised. I do that kind of thing. I used to keep my CDs in\n  1)Alphabetical order by artist\n  2)Alphabetical order by album name\n\nback when CDs were a thing. I did the same thing with my DVDs and Blu-Rays back when they were a thing, only by movie name in Library convention - 'the' doesn't count, that sort of thing.\n\nThe damned internet and streaming services mess with my Chi something chronic in that regard. I don't get to sort things, maintain order in my life quite the way I used to. But, then I found Steam. One of the best things Steam ever did for me was allow me to group my games into categories. Sure, it automatically sorts things into alphabetical order, but it at least allows me to define the categories into which games were put in order to sort them within that category. I've been very happy with that model up until now.\n\nIn that regard - Sam Barlow? You suck. You've broken my Chi again.\n\nHer Story - what the hell is this thing?\n\nThe closest I can come up with is interactive fiction, but it's not interactive at all. The only interactive part is how you search the video snippets.\n\nIs it hidden object? Not really, but the mechanics are similar - the main difference is that instead of an object hidden inside a busy picture, you're using text (words) to trawl through a busy video snippet library.\n\nIt's not a typing tutor game, but there are similarities with educational games in that I could imagine making some of my post-grads play this game as an assignment in a data mining course on how to organise information and why text mining is never as simple as tool vendors tell your bosses it is (or perhaps I'm just a sadist).\n\nAnd to top it off you have to tie a full fledged reversi game hidden away to complete all the achievements? Seriously? Does that make this a weird kind of prelude to a board game?\n\nIs this (and stay with me here) even a game at all?\n\nThe best possible categorisation is that this is a movie (similar to The Interview starring Hugo Weaving - look it up; if you love this game, you'll love that movie) which has been broken down into snippets that you have to search for in order to watch the damn thing with any kind of progressive sequence.\n\nBut - 'Text Based Search Driven Interactive Movie Hidden Object Board Game' doesn't really fit in a category header usefully, and even if I do that, it has a population of 1. Perhaps more if I look at Telling Lies or the new one coming out, Immortal.\n\nI could always just categorise this game as 'Sam Barlow' and move on. The man is (if his games are anything to go by) - unique. This is of course assuming that Sam is short for Samuel, and not Samantha. But I'm betting it's a man because;\n\n1) This game is a STEM professional's worst nightmare - meaning only a STEM professional could have possibly designed it; yes I know that's a stereotype but they exist for a reason - get over it.\n\n2) There's just something about the [spoiler]Apple and Snake[/spoiler] tattoo that screams 'written by a man' to me. Sure; there's about as much science behind that last statement as one would expect to see utilised in the judging of a Yuri Geller lookalike contest, but there it is. Call it a gut feeling.\n\nThe thing is, once you get past the way the game / movie / search engine works, the story itself is compelling. The atmospherics that are possible from a simulated Windows 95 screen are simply spectacular. It is a minimalist design that provides a far deeper immersion than should be possible with the simplicity of the interface. The story behind all the video is even more compelling and immersive and the mental health aspects of the dramatis personae is going to keep me from sleeping well for the next several nights to be sure. If my cats start making strange sounds in the middle of the night, it could be weeks. But, I digress.\n\nThis is (in many ways) a challenging narrative, and one of the more original stories I've read / watched / searched in... well, ever if I'm being frank. I bought it on special as a filler to get some extra Steam credit thing, sat on it and finally played it, and feel so strongly about it that I'm compelled to write a review about it. That doesn't happen very often. I will say however that there are some things that I've always known implicitly that have been reinforced by this game (or whatever);\n\n  1) Monogamy is the simplest and most efficient state in life\n  2) Don't EVER give the same present to two different people\n  3) People who look alike NEVER ever ever think alike\n  4) Don't bring children into this world unless you mean to; don't develop a sense of humour on this subject, it's too special, important, and worthy of your complete and total responsibility.\n\nSam - seriously, just keep doing what you're doing. I'd much rather you were making actual movies because what you have to offer on that front is simply amazing, but once you get through the wall of WTF that your creation puts up in front of you, this is a haunting tale that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nIt's just a shame that it lives in uncategorised in my Steam Library.

The keyword search system is clunky and imprecise, and it's often difficult to find the clips that you're looking for. The game also has a lot of filler content, which makes it even more difficult to find the important clips.\n\nThe story in Her Story is also unsatisfying and frankly, uncomfortable. The game is full of twists and turns, but they're all very predictable. The story also deals with some disturbing subject matter, which may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nThe acting in Her Story is alright, but it's not enough to save the game for me.

Follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42611293-Elysian-Reviews/]Curator[/url] for more![/quote]\n \n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\nHer Story is a puzzle game with a very unique journey through a series of police interrogations lasting around three hours, exposing a plot that unravels in twists and turns, about a story shrouded in mystery, tragedy, fairy tales, and humour.\n\n[b]Reasons to Avoid:[/b]\n- Unique style of game isn\u2019t for everyone.\n- No replayability.\n \n[b]Reasons to Buy:[/b]\n- Creative and intriguing story.\n- Very unique gameplay concept.\n- Achievements \u2013 fairly easy to 100%.\n- Great atmosphere.\n- Compelling acting. \n- Strong value against the price you\u2019d pay for a film.\n- Very interesting protagonist.\n \n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\nThe graphics were stylised in this game \u2013 you are looking at an old computer screen from the 1990s and Her Story did a great job of simulating the old, blocky, ugly software of these bygone times along with the curved glass screen and the horrible reflections they used to give off. \n\nIf that is too hard on your eyes, the game offers a setting to remove it so it looks more like a flat screenshot than the intended effect of you looking at the screen, which removes reflection effects and makes colours both clearer and bolder so everything is easier to see. \n\nThe only other graphical option you have is to disable subtitles. Otherwise, this whole game is basically a video, and that video does an amazing job of recreating the effect of a 1990s-era tape recording. \n\nCleverly, the computer screen also reflects the face looking at it sometimes, and lights from the background. This was a detail the game didn\u2019t have to go to, but it really made the image feel immersive, placing me right in the 1990s, trying to crack a crime mystery by surfing a database of interrogation footage late into the night.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nHer Story plays out rather like a Full Motion Video (FMV) \u2013 most of the game is watching footage just like you would with a film. However, you interact with the \u2018game\u2019 to retrieve various clips from a 250-video database in order to watch, and by so doing you have some choice in how you are exposed to the story. You do this by entering search terms into the database search bar, which will retrieve clips containing that word or tag (if you\u2019ve added tags to watched videos). Most of these clips are between 30 seconds and a minute in length and contain snapshots of wider interrogation sessions that leave you hints and clues to piece together in your pursuit to understand [i]Her Story[/i].\n\nIt is not like most FMV games where you are offered choices that affect the outcome of the story in a rather binary fashion, but that you will, depending on which clips you retrieve, perhaps get an impression of a different story altogether \u2013 at least for a while. \n\nHer Story also offers a mini-game within \u2013 one of those old pre-installed games you get on old operating systems called \u2018Mirror Game\u2019. One achievement relates to it but aside from that, I can\u2019t imagine much of a reason to play it. \n\nGameplay is not the strength of this title, though, and not why you\u2019d buy it really. The concept and story are.\n \n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nThis story, unlike most FMVs, is told only through one person. The footage we see is all from the interrogation room, but we are never able to see or hear the officers the protagonist is meant to be talking to. This is an interesting choice on the face of it, but it in no way hampered the telling of the story as the dialogue is well-written enough that if you\u2019re paying attention, there will be context to what\u2019s said in each clip and, as you play on, it becomes clearer exactly what the protagonist is talking about, and what really happened. \n\nThese short insights into the seven interrogations the protagonist endures are brilliantly acted, and the behaviour of the character is an intriguing study across the different interviews. The changes in personality and the way things are said \u2013 with what kind of expression or even word choice - for the discerning eyes, tell the story from beyond just the words that are being spoken, and help to make this game feel so much more real and raw in a way that interrogation footage really is, for those of you who have seen it elsewhere. \n\nThrough the confessions of our protagonist \u2013 and through them alone \u2013 we are introduced to a fairly detailed cast, each often with a distinct role and sense of personality within Her Story that makes the game feel more authentic still. \n\nHer Story, while not \u2018hardcore\u2019 in any sense, also doesn\u2019t hold your hand, and you will have to think to understand the narrative behind the game. Though there are guides if you get stuck, the game offers you no hints, instead throwing you in at the deep end with seemingly no objective in mind aside from watching as much footage as you can and working out what information is important and what isn\u2019t. Perhaps even trying to discern whether something is true, too. \n\nWhat I really loved about this story, aside from how unique it was, is that even when it ends, you can still choose how to interpret it. It can take on a new depth depending on whether you read it at face value, or whether you read between the lines. And in a way, even at the end, it still retains that sense of mystery. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not concluded, or that it\u2019s left wide open \u2013 it isn\u2019t. The story comes to a satisfying and rewarding end. But what it actually means is something you can debate about, even then. I would love to be more specific about this, but it would be major spoilers for those who haven\u2019t played the game yet.\n\n[h1]Audio:[/h1]\nHer Story excellently captured the sounds of an old 90s PC, from the mouse click sounds when you select something, to the tapping of the keyboard when you type, and those subtle electronic noises the running machine makes. \n\nThe game also went the extra mile with a soft, immersive soundtrack that was queued sometimes after a revelation was unlocked in one of the clips \u2013 at least, that\u2019s how it felt. The music stirred feelings of excitement or anticipation, driving me to explore more as the plot was unravelling before me. It was a small thing, but it pushed me on to finish the game in one sitting. \n\nTowards the end, on the cusp of revealing the truth, you will occasionally hear police sirens in the background, too, which only served to further put me on the edge of my seat. \n\nGiven how minimal it was, audio was used amazingly well in this game to strengthen the sense of atmosphere and even to create feelings of excitement and anticipation nearing the end of the game. There is no orchestral score or ground-breaking atmospheric effects here, but despite that, it worked so well \u2013 a sure reminder that sometimes, less is more.\n \n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nThe graphical style and audio effects really set the scene well and fully sold the illusion of being up late in the night on an old police computer, surfing through a database to crack a case.\n\nHer Story offers very little replayability, but fortunately for completionists you can get all the achievements in one playthrough. \n\nI think the story was really good \u2013 conceptually unique and told well through the short clips we are able to retrieve from the police database. It was memorable and throughout its duration managed to be interesting, moving, and humorous. The protagonist was intriguing all by herself, but the surrounding story was even more so. \n\nThere are not many games like Her Story, so for the price, if what I\u2019ve written here sounds interesting, I definitely think it\u2019s worth picking up. \n\n[quote]Thanks for reading!

Using clips ranging from 3 seconds to 1.5 minutes from interrogations conducted over the course of 5 different days, you determine the woman's identity, the crime, and if she's innocent.\n\nYou do so by accessing the bank of videos by search words. At first it's obvious - you go for things like, crime, murder, poison, kill, etc. Then you start to learn the story, and you yourself basically unravel it by search words that you're curious about. Let's learn more about the glazier business. Or, what else happened in the [b]attic[/b]?\n\nThere's a little timeline that you can use to save clips and reorder them if you'd like, which I appreciated when trying to reconstruct entire sessions.\n\nThe underlying story itself is.... incredible. It can be interpreted in a few different ways, depending on if you believe [i]her story[/i] or not, and I love it, as farfetched as it is. It's very much worth digging around and stumbling upon through the videos. You'll end up searching any number of words just to find out more. \n\nThe acting is also pretty decent, if understated. She does speak kind of blandly and plainly most of the time, and I'm not keen on her accent, whatever region she's from. She sounds a bit like a posh snob and it's harder for me to care about what she's saying as far as it relates to her feelings.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this for sure, if you love a good twisty mystery and like interactive fiction like this.

I really enjoyed the non-linear storytelling method this game employed. I was discovering the truth myself and had to properly connect events as I uncovered more. There were some great twists with multiple avenues for discovery, and they felt very rewarding to discover.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that I didn't find there was an adequate way to organise my clips as I continued to play. The single line of clips worked fine up to around 50 clips, but organising clips chronologically was extremely lengthy as I found more clips. By the time I found 50% of the clips I had to give up on organising them properly. Letting us create nesting folders for our clips could have allowed for us to organise better, because I really wanted to watch all the clips in order after completing the game. I did that, but couldn't from within the game itself. Also having clips switch places instead of pushing them aside meant I needed to move clips one at a time to move them where I wanted without destroying the order I made.\n\nI really want to emphasise that the story was very well done and the searching itself was great too. I had to come up with some creative searches to find the majority of the clips. I liked how around a third of the way in I had a google doc with search terms I wanted to input, and with each successful search like 5 more terms would be added to my list. It kept expanding until I got to around 75% through the clips. The last few clips were really difficult to find, but that absolutely makes sense, and I will not explain further.\n\nI think this game is rather niche so I couldn't say I'd recommend it to everyone, but it was absolutely worth the money, and anyone looking to solve a mystery in a game will have a great time with this.\n\nI'd say that overall the game was somewhere between a 4/5  and a  4.5/5\n\nAnd I'm looking forward to your other games", "timestamp_created": 1652815569, "timestamp_updated": 1652815569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115574903": {"recommendationid": "115574903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054018206", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1652754157}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Her Story\" is an interactive story that consists on watching video clips of old police interviews with a woman. You're thrown in with little context into a computer system, there are some text files that give you the bare-bones info you need to control the system. In a nutshell, you'll be watching the spliced parts of several interviews, and you can search up keywords on the computer to fetch other video clips that mention your search on the dialogue.\n\nWith this simple system your aim is to try and piece together the true story behind the interviews. The key is to try and use any words that might be interesting from the testimony, and obtain new pieces until you get the complete picture. Everything will be out of order initially, but as you understand more, things will eventually fall into place.\n\nIt's not an incredibly long thing given how it works. If one were to play all of the video clips sequentially its a little over an hour and a half. Playing through the game can likely be done in just under 3 hours. If the price tag doesn't sound good enough for the experience, I'd wait for a sale, it often goes for 50% off or less. I do believe at that point the experience you get is right for the price.

This might possibly be the most innovative game I've ever played, and its mechanics and fascinating story cement its status as one of the best indie-games\u2014and creatively the greatest\u2014of all time. \n\nIn the first 5 minutes of starting up the game, I was already impressed to find that, after viewing a few clips I found by playing around with the database, a video game\u2014asides from 1995's Phantasmagoria\u2014finally managed to implement live-action elements without complicating the gameplay. It was straightforward, yet challenging all the same. Searching through the aforementioned database was incredibly fun, and in a sense, addicting; it never got repetitive to me. The incredible story lying under a simple premise of \"watching a woman talk to the police\" spurred me on to keep going, and I didn't want to miss even a single detail of it. I won't say much anything it because I don't want to spoil this incredible game for you all, but trust me when I say if I had to make a list of my favorite games based PURELY on story, this would STILL be in the top 3.\n\nOf course, I wouldn't dare leave out the work of Viva Seifert, whose performance as Hannah Smith carries the entire game. It's hard to believe that this is Seifert's first acting role; I was convinced that she was a trained performer of some sort, but it turns out that her profession is in music, and she had never even acted beforehand. I can't even think of another actress I'd rather see in the role, and if this game were adapted into a film or television show that she was brought to reprise her role for, I'm a firm believer that she'd win all the major awards and more.\n\nNonetheless, everything in this game is incredible and skillfully put together. 'Her Story' earns a 10/10 in my books, and I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something new, exciting yet intricate and story-rich.

See, I think the most defining moment of any newcomer to From Soft's brilliant RPG is when they arrive at fire link shrine and do not know where to proceed. The brilliant level design of Dark Souls does cut out a correct path for you not with waypoints or floating arrows, but instead with difficulty; Simply there is only one route when you are starting out that the enemies are manageable, hence this is the way to proceed. \n\n'HER STORY' starts off in the same manner. You are thrown into the midst of archiving all these tapes with a simple instruction of typing in words that will bring up videos, with the search words being completely up to you. Sam Barlow employed some tactics to curve you onto the intended progression of the storyline// information such as the search query being limited to the first five videos that contain the phrase you typed or the intelligent script that has a deliberate use of certain words, but it's very easy to veer off the narrative path! \n\nMy experience with this game was as such. I had a lot of fun during my first stint where I played for about an hour, but in that time I was made aware of the apparent 'twist' of the game about 30 mins into it. And as you can see, I have about 3 hours into the game, although some of that is for completing the achievements so I beat it in around 2.5 hrs. That means within 30 mins I knew the big plot points and for the next two hours, I was just finding tangential and somewhat interesting videos to reach the threshold of getting the 'The End' message. Not fun! \n\nOn a very positive note, the story is written well with a BUNCH of thematic allegories that are a bit on the nose for my liking but add something to the story at least. Maybe it adds a bit of frustration when they are constantly hinting at a twist I am already pretty aware of but nonetheless, I applaud the effort. \n\nAll in all, I think it's a great innovation, and its intended execution is fair but my experience of the narrative was a bit poor.", "timestamp_created": 1651919943, "timestamp_updated": 1651919943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114994780": {"recommendationid": "114994780", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970600660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1651528122}, "language": "english", "review": "It is hard to add meaningfully to the well deserved accolades this game has already received.

The story is mysterious and emotional, the atmosphere is uniquely weird, the direction is good and the acting performance excellent. Most of all, the gameplay concept is creative as the plot is revealed via short videos in an order that depends on the player's actions. On the other hand it doesn't give you a certain purpose to play for so it ends being up a bit passive. It is more of a non linear movie than an actual game.

Although the actual story is linear it is revealed to the player via short videos in random order depending on his decisions and searches. This will trigger different thoughts and feelings to each player, at least until some point of the game. The back and forth in time rather than watching the story in chronological order is very interesting too. Great dynamic storytelling.\n- Excellent acting performance which was a big relief to me and elevated the game to another level. Most fmv games out the have poor performances that make them feel unconvincing and awkward.\n- Interesting story full of mystery and emotions. It's more than the \"find the killer\" crime story you probably initially think.\n- Unique, weird atmosphere. Especially after a big part of the story has revealed there is something sick in the air.\n- Nice, simple design that works perfectly. A pc, its software, the crt screen effect and the room's flickering lights that are reflected on it. Brilliant.\n- Nice direction. This cheap look is what gives it a brutal realism like it was indeed shot by a cheap police camera in front of an office's desk.\n- Well designed software. I appreciated all these small tools that it gives you like marking the watched videos or the ability to save some of them and add tags. It just makes your life easier.\n\nThe bad\n- It doesn't tell who you are or the reason you're playing for, so you never really feel like having a purpose. You're just trying to bring the pieces of a story together without knowing why. It feels passive for a game and ends up being more of an interactive movie.\n- After revealing the story and finishing with the archives search I was expecting something more than what it gives you.

His wife was interviewed seven times by the police. However, the interviews are split into hundreds of short clips. You are given access to a database containing every clip, and have to figure out the right search terms to use to find the clips you need to piece together the story.\n\nThe game is a very interesting concept, though I think the puzzle aspect is a bit clunky. See, to prevent you from just searching a really obvious term and blazing through most of the database, you\u2019re only allowed to see the first five chronological clips of any search result; the trick, therefore, is to figure out how to narrow your search to eliminate the clips you\u2019ve already seen. \u2026But of course, it\u2019s pretty hard to do that when you don\u2019t know the contents of the other clips and therefore what you might accidentally eliminate with a narrower search. The game is set up very well: The clips in the initial search result give you a clear set of keywords that you can follow in any order, and there are a number of clear thematic words and plot threads that you can follow up on pretty intuitively. (The interviewee is also wearing different suits in each interview, which allows you to easily distinguish which one the clip belongs to at a glance; I appreciated that.) But I still feel that it\u2019s not user-friendly enough; once you pass a certain threshold (maybe 60-70% of the total clips), it\u2019s really hard to get further without just guessing randomly. Additionally, the clips aren\u2019t actually complete; they cut out the interviewer\u2019s questions, sometimes making it hard to figure out what the interviewee is answering or talking about \u2014 made worse, of course, by the purposefully maddening use of pronouns and vague language. There were a lot of times when I went, \u201cOkay, but who is \u2018he\u2019? What do you mean, \u2018what we were just talking about\u2019?\u201d It\u2019s a clever puzzle technique, but it did make things a bit too hard to piece together, I thought.\n\n(There are also quite a few cheap shots that are clearly just to pad the clip count and make it harder to get 100%; there are several clips of the woman answering questions for a lie detector test, each of which are one second long and contain only the words \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. How exactly are people supposed to find those naturally?)\n\nI think the game could really have used a feature like automatically slotting viewed clips into a linear timeline \u2014 they\u2019re all timestamped, so it\u2019s not like that\u2019s a mystery. I noted down a few important timestamps, but for the most part I just stopped bothering trying to keep track of what was happening in what order.\n\n(I also think I accidentally got to the big reveal before I was supposed to \u2014 I prioritized searching for characters\u2019 names, and if you do that for one that sounds innocuous early on you end up unraveling pretty much the whole mystery, likely before you see the foreshadowing for it.)\n\nOverall, I think this was an interesting idea, but it needed clearer means of progression and a few more quality-of-life improvements. And unfortunately, after watching the whole thing in order, I actually do think the mystery works better as a linear story; the non-linearity doesn\u2019t really enhance the experience in the end. I think seeing a single narrative in arbitrary chronological order just doesn\u2019t work. What was cool about Virtue\u2019s Last Reward was how you were given complete but separate narratives that each explored a different facet of the overall mystery plus their own self-contained arcs.", "timestamp_created": 1649951712, "timestamp_updated": 1649951712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113844949": {"recommendationid": "113844949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062818913", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1649950421}, "language": "english", "review": "wow.", "timestamp_created": 1649950431, "timestamp_updated": 1649950431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113540936": {"recommendationid": "113540936", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985889300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1649448372}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is \"Ok\" at best, but not very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1649448405, "timestamp_updated": 1649448405, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113540750": {"recommendationid": "113540750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037503811", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1649447961}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic - who thought someone in a room answering questions could be so gripping?

The distinguishing feature of video games is their interactive nature, and not that interactivity is impossible within the context of a series of video clips, it's just that it is ultimately a lesser form of interactivity in my opinion, generally speaking. There is no one-to-one, instantaneous feedback, and this type of game finds itself removed from the essence of what makes this art form interesting and unique in the first place.\n\nNow, I am not opposed to the idea of the possibility of a good FMV-based game.

The idea of unraveling a murder mystery by stitching together a variety of police-interview segments, eventually forming a coherent whole is promising and interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the story to be less than exciting, in part because I wasn't really enjoying the actress in the clips and also despite having an interesting plot, the execution didn't really strike me with any impact. I also wasn't a fan of entering search terms - random words at first, and then words you gather from the interview clips you've watched which clue you in to what's going on, taking you further down the rabbit hole to flesh out the story. I mean, that's all there is to it. Enter a word or phrase, pull up associated clips, and watch them, gradually unveiling the larger picture. \n\nThis was a title that had seemed to garner a pretty positive reception, and I was pleased to score it for cheap on a sale, but in the end, I'm left scratching my head as to what the fuss was about.

A modern '90s FMV title, this game is propelled by an impressive lead performance and an intriguing, if somewhat hackneyed main story. The short game faithfully captures the experience of delving into long-forgotten files to solve a hidden mystery, though the \n\nIn [i]Her Story[/i], the player investigates the disappearance of a man through police interrogation footage of his wife. Of course, this can't be an easy matter: the footage is split into hundreds of seconds-long clips featuring only the wife, and they can only be found through searching for words spoken by the woman. Also, only the first five chronological results with that term will be displayed. Thus, the player must discern which keywords will produce the most relevant material and piece together what happened.\n\nThe two main draws of this game are the performance of the main actress and the intrigue of the mystery. Viva Seifert solidly portrays a woman running through a gamut of emotions amidst family turmoil, and the grainy lo-fi aesthetic helps to sell the authenticity of her role as a suspect in a no-name police precinct. The mystery itself has enough twists and red herrings that it should throw players for a few loops before revealing what's truly at play.\n\nOne's enjoyment of [i]Her Story[/i] relies on not expecting much in the way of gameplay, as the most interactivity offered is typing in search terms and tagging videos. This game feels better to \"play\" than many of the old-school FMV games, though, because it accurately conveys the feeling of sifting through poorly organized records. There's no ludonarrative dissonance in this one. If you're searching for a more traditional detective videogame like an [i]L.A. Noire[/i], however, just be aware that this is far less traditional.\n\nIt should take most players around 90 minutes to solve the core mystery. The most relevant search terms are networked throughout the clips that players can take different paths to still find the necessary videos in rapid time. [i]Her Story[/i] has little replay value once the tricks of its narrative are known, so keep this short playtime in mind when deciding whether to purchase. Outside of the main plot, players can strive to uncover 100% of the clips - but absent a guide, this is an exercise in futility. The limits artificially placed on the search engine, from the limited results displayed to the minimalist design of the search history means completionists will spend their time fumbling about to find three-second clips of just four or five words.\n\n[i]Her Story[/i] is an impressive reimagining of a lost gaming form. With a captivating mystery told by a convincing actress, players joining to view the story as it unfolds should be satisfied. The short runtime, low replay value, and frustrating limits affecting completionist play do hinder the experience, but especially when on sale this title is worth a watch.

Words and phrases shed light onto the walls of the branching cave system that is Her Story. Some tunnels connect and intersect, others leave you feeling totally lost. When a search term leads to a new plethora of information, it can be rather satisfying, but sooner or later, the keywords begin to dry up, and you're left with nothing more than your intuition and blind luck. And it's at this point that the cracks begin to show.\n\nAs a quick test, try to decipher my sentence in the text boxes below.\n\n[spoiler]want[/spoiler][spoiler]you[/spoiler][spoiler]by[/spoiler][spoiler]recommendation[/spoiler][spoiler]If[/spoiler][spoiler]film[/spoiler][spoiler]out[/spoiler][spoiler]Noe[/spoiler][spoiler]a[/spoiler][spoiler]\u201cClimax\u201d[/spoiler][spoiler]check[/spoiler][spoiler]Gaspar[/spoiler] \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, check the box below for the answer.\n\n[spoiler]If you want a film recommendation, check out \u201cClimax\u201d by Gaspar Noe.[/spoiler]\n\nWhat you just did is, in essence the core gameplay of Her Story. You are given information, albeit out of sequence, and are required to string things back together on your own terms. Often times, only a single piece of the information will be the key information (in this example, the name of the film, \u201cClimax\u201d) and the rest of the pieces of information surrounding it act as waymarkers contextualising its meaning. This style of gameplay remains interesting until you hit a dead end, and you\u2019re forced to take shots in the dark. If I had given you the same sentence, but lacking several key words, the solution could only be guessed, perhaps not even guessed at all based upon the missing information.\n\n[b]BEWARE, HERE BE SPOILERS[/b]\n\nThe duration of the game is spent reviewing a database of recordings from the mid 90's of a lady in an interrogation room. The intrigue begins to amp up as she begins to talk about death, murder and her \u2018reflection\u2019. It soon becomes clear that all is not as it seems, and listening for names and keywords allows you to search the database to find more. The thing is, the database only allows you to view the first 5 results at a time, so blanket-term searching is usually ineffectual, and there exists the necessity to be specific.\nIronically, Her Story doesn't entertain the idea of giving you a fully fleshed-out story, and leaves you to fill in the gaps yourself. Though this is narratively cohesive, seeing as the woman [spoiler]women[/spoiler] we're watching is (by and large) actively trying to deceive and throw us off the scent. As we delve deeper, it becomes apparent just how orchestrated her life has been up until this point, and how she revels in the idea of blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.\n\nThe investigation ends up being rather surface level. I thought at one point there were going to be puzzles involving morse code, but the information that was tapped out had no real bearing upon the gameplay or mystery itself. It\u2019s literally just browsing an archive, but with parameters holding you back from attaining all the information at once. It starts off pretty engaging, but only gets more frustrating and laborious as time goes on. What\u2019s more BIG SPOILER HERE:[spoiler]the game doesn\u2019t really have an ending, you\u2019re simply offered the option to leave, and it\u2019s left at that[/spoiler]. It\u2019s irritating that I can\u2019t express a lot of my qualms with this game for fear of ruining the experience for somebody who might have more fun with it than I did.\n\nHer Story is zero fun to play alone. I tried to play through solo twice, but gave up at around an hour in both times. Playing it with a friend is much more satisfying, as one can take notes, and the other can dictate and type into the system. There\u2019s more room for speculation between two people as well, which makes a playthrough more enjoyable. Even still, the experience didn\u2019t end up being particularly satisfying. We managed to find everything in the database, and were still left with a feeling of \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nTo conclude, Her Story is a unique concept that starts as pretty fun and engaging, but begins to drag as time goes on. It\u2019s very light on its puzzle elements, and could have been more if it had encoded more information for players to uncover.\n\n4/10", "timestamp_created": 1646200404, "timestamp_updated": 1646200535, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7015533447265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111175106": {"recommendationid": "111175106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277726318", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1645978360}, "language": "english", "review": "5/10\n\nIt's a rather neutral review but I have to admit that I expected more from the whole story.

So that you don't have to watch the whole thing: \n\nadmin_random gives you a semi-random clip, but most of the time it will be a new one.\nadmin_unlock increases cap to 15 viewable clips.\n[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Spoilers:[/b]\n[spoiler]Its clear that the girl has an imaginary sister, and my guess would be that something came between both of the \"sisters\", and caused Simon to be killed out of jealousy. I don't really know the motive though. I can see all the pieces in place, but the game never really gives you a big enough element to really definitely decide what happened.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nBecause of the vague ending/open-ended nature of the game, its gonna stick in my head for a while. Very unique experience that I would recommend if you wanna try something outside of your comfort zone.\n\n8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1643481069, "timestamp_updated": 1643481230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109035198": {"recommendationid": "109035198", "author": {"steamid": "76561199210345849", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1643432976}, "language": "english", "review": "those fingers are to fast for me! great game.

The player is looking at an old police desktop from the 90's, which has access to a database of FMV clips from the police interviews of a woman talking about her husband's murder. Most of the sounds you hear are diegetic, like mouse clicks, the flickering of the CRT monitor, and the occasional police siren. This combination of visuals and sound so grounded in reality really allow the player to become immersed in their role, trying to put the story together. This is very important, because the driving force behind the gameplay is the player's own curiosity.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around picking up clues and leads from the woman's interview clips to find new search terms, which will give access to more clips, and therefore more clues to help untangle the story. The acting and framing of the woman are very naturalistic, which further enhances the game's grounded \"true crime\" vibe, while the writing only seems naturalistic, hiding tons of subtext, repeated themes, and beautifully poetic moments beneath the surface. This forces the player to use not only their rationality, pattern seeking and information processing capabilities, but also their emotional intelligence, a skill not often put to the test by traditional murder mystery games. Her Story's open ended nature poses an interesting design problem: \"If every clip is accessible from the start of the game, how does the developer control the story's pacing, so that the player doesn't stumble into the mystery's solution immediately?\". The answer lies in the meticulous detail given to the information provided at every clip, with red herrings and dead ends scattered among the useful information, and a clever mechanic, where only the chronologically first 5 clips containing the search term are provided to the player. That way, the major spoilers are less likely to be encountered early, and even if they are, not enough context is provided in each one so that the story fully makes sense.\n\nThe meh:\n\nAs it has been made pretty clear by now, most of your time playing the game will revolve around watching videos of the woman talking. There are no puzzles, no test at the end, and no hint system. Those looking for standard adventure game gameplay will not find it here, and that may be a deal breaker for some. Also, there is no in-game notepad, which may have been useful for many players. Instead, the players can add their own user tags to clips, so they can be found easier. I didn't make use of this feature personally, as it seemed a bit too time consuming, but it may be useful for some. [spoiler] Also, the ending is pretty open ended and there are lingering questions concerning the characters' motives and trustworthiness. I loved that, but I know some will find it frustrating [/spoiler].\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe game also allows the player to save clips on a separate place called \"user session\", providing instant access for later reference. To my knowledge, it is impossible to delete clips from the user session, even when the player has already investigated everything in them. This caused me some frustration, and kept me from saving clips on the user session for most of my playthrough, because I didn't know whether they would be worth the clutter. Other parts of the UX could have been streamlined a bit to help those who want to view all 271 clips. There is no way to play all the clips in chronological order, or even access clips you've already seen without using the search bar. This only becomes an annoyance towards the end of the game, when you might want to find very specific, short clips that contain basically no relevant information, or even that many words at all.

The format evokes a lot of early '90s video games that used videos as their primary source of clues and information. You watch video segments and piece together the clues on your own. If you're not observant and analytical, you may be confused by what really happened, so you have to look carefully since nothing is what it initially seems. It's interesting piecing together the bits. I don't think the story is particularly imaginative (I've played games with similar story lines), but as a writer, I can say that there are only so many plots and what matters is not what you tell but how you tell it that makes the story intriguing. For the most part, I think this fits that, although the ending is a bit anticlimactic. My main complaint would be that due to the title and description, I was expecting a plot with more of a feminist commentary (especially given the feminist use of the term herstory) but it failed in that respect as it pits women against each other over men. However, the characters do have agency, the Rapunzel fairy tale is subverted, and the end kind of makes up for the competition over men. I think the writing could have done more to connect the player to the characters to decrease the distance between the player and the game.

It has twisted plot accompanied by great acting by Viva Seifert, pretty nice soundtrack and quite interesting old-fashioned style of mid 90\u2019s. Like in every detective story you have to uncover the truth step by step, placing together all the pieces of puzzle in order to see the whole picture. Looking through the police database archive we have to put \u201cHer story\u201d together and answer the question \u2013 \u201cWho killed [strike]Laura Palmer[/strike] Mr. Smith and why?\u201d\n\nAs I have already said, the game is very good, but not excellent. Why? As for me, it has two significant shortcomings. The major flaw is the thing that we are not allowed to sort the videos we have already watched (\u201cuser session\u201d block does not count because it\u2019s absolutely inconvenient \u2013 just a mess of fragments we can drag and drop so they will change places, imagine doing that to 200+ fragments when you can only see a few at the moment on your screen). It\u2019s like examining the piece of puzzle thinking \u201chmm, it must be from somewhere top-left\u201d and then putting it back into a pile of other fragments. There must have been special blocks for each interview where you could store clips you\u2019ve found in proper order (manually or automatically doesn\u2019t matter) and with the possibility to look through them again whenever you want. The second thing is the number of rubbish videos consisted of one or two words and making no sense at all. But despite these two flaws I definitely recommend the game for those who value deep plot and like riddles. \n\nP.S.

You're tasked with piecing together a story by searching for video clips on a database - all clips are from multiple interviews with the same actress, who recently had a loved one die under mysterious circumstances. You can only understand what's going on by searching for key words in her testimony - making for a non-linear narrative experience.\n\nSome of the \"gameplay\" elements feel a little arbitrary - you can only watch videos by searching for key words, you can only see a certain number of results whenever you search, you don't know what questions are being asked, a few other things. It makes sense that these techniques would be used in order to provide some mystery to the player - it certainly makes discovering the story much more impactful than just watching the clips sequentially would have. But it can also feel like the \"game\" designation is a little tacked on. Really, this is all about the story (see game title), anything in here is to serve the narrative - regardless of player agency or how a video database would be designed in the real world.\n\nI would like to see this kind of concept fleshed out in another game. One where I can make notes of things, and the game has more in-depth tracking of what I'm understanding about the story. More interactivity. The only thing this really tracks is if you've watched enough clips to understand the twist of the story. That's it. I had a few other \"a-ha\" moments in here that I wish I could have communicated in-game to influence the story. This could be great if it was expanded into a crime series, but instead of a cold-case, you are tasked with watching testimony for ongoing investigations. This concept mixed with a little Phoenix Wright.\n\nStill, a unique experience, which blurs the line between video game and short film in an exciting and mind-bending way.", "timestamp_created": 1640883494, "timestamp_updated": 1640883494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106795534": {"recommendationid": "106795534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983976571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1640749140}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it.

The records are live action footage, with top level acting. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] However, the \u201cgame\u201d doesn\u2019t ever ask you to make a decision regarding the case.

You'll have to search for a keyword that will show lists of videos to watch in order to piece the whole story together.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Keywords and tags make it easy to find videos that you are looking for\n- Piece your own story from the multiple recordings that are presented\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Those who have trouble reading non-linear stories might have a problem understanding it\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to theorize and watch an FMV game about murder, buy this game at a sale.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe visual is split into two: a computer-like interface and a video where the interview took place. The computer looks like the one from the old XP operating system. There is a trash bin, notepad, and software where you can search and watch videos. It works similar to how computers usually work, so it shouldn't take long before you get used to it. The game also has a CRT filter turned on by default to make you feel like you are actually on the other side of the computer.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is told in pieces. A lot of recordings of a woman's interview will be available to watch based on a series of keywords. Your job is to piece the story together to make out what actually happened. However, this can be a daunting task since some videos are useless to begin with. One-liner words about a woman asking for a complaint or spilling her cup will also be recorded and preserved, making it hard to find the ones that matter.\n\nIt's better to watch all videos chronologically. To be honest, I'm not good at reading non-linear stories, especially when I have to piece it together from a lot of non-correlative words. It took me a while to realize that there is a way to watch them chronologically, and once I do it, the game becomes more enjoyable. The one-liner sentences that look odd at first were starting to make sense, and it was easier for me to watch how the story unfolds.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1825285219\n\nThe game has an open ending story. The last few videos will tell you what happened, but whether the woman is telling the truth or not will be left up to you. There might still be some mysteries hidden beneath the woman's story too. Those who like to theorize will find themselves tinkering about what actually happened.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nIf you haven't noticed already, the game is focused on watching video clips. You have to use a keyword to find videos that have that exact word in them, allowing you to find more keywords and clues that you can use. You can only watch the first 5 videos from the search result though, so you must be more specific if you want to look at the others. Taking notes of important keywords will be vital throughout the game as a way to find more videos.\n\nThere is no hint or whatsoever in case you are stuck. You will be forced to guess for keywords if you run out of them, hoping that they will give you something. I found it to be annoying, especially since I didn't know what was going on with the story. A lot of facts were given to me when I wasn't sure whether they are relevant or not. It wasn't until I found out how to watch the videos in chronological order before I enjoyed the game to its fullest.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493984475\n\nThere might be some \"jumpscares\" in the game. At some point, the screen will flicker, showing a reflection of someone's face on the screen. It's not scary, but it was enough for me to stop playing the game at night. Luckily, you can turn the CTR filter off, removing the \"jumpscare\" in the process.\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished the game in 2.6h. The difficult part of the game lies in finding the right keyword to find new videos, although you can bypass it if you know what you are doing. Besides, as I said before, the game was better to be watched in chronological order.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nI couldn't seem to trigger the ending even though I had watched all videos. It seems to be bugged since I found that [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/368370/discussions/0/357287935539036897/#c361798516952387924]some people[/url] were experiencing the same thing. Luckily, the solution that was provided in the same thread worked.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]Her Story[/b] is different from other games. It's a game about murder, but you are not going to catch the murderer - everything related to the murder has already been resolved by the police. There are a lot of video clips to watch, and you only have to find the truth about what happened. How you perceive the story is up to you either. It's clearly not the common type of story to play, so if you are not up for these kinds of games, I suggest you stay out of it. Feel free to buy it at a sale if you are interested in it though - the game can be too short with the original price tag.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1637818475, "timestamp_updated": 1639384723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764773249626159668", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103571770": {"recommendationid": "103571770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060026467", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1641224412}, "language": "english", "review": "great", "timestamp_created": 1637795335, "timestamp_updated": 1637795335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103357314": {"recommendationid": "103357314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409139406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1638065112}, "language": "english", "review": "brilliant", "timestamp_created": 1637707388, "timestamp_updated": 1637707388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103290981": {"recommendationid": "103290981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283318926", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 458, "last_played": 1624799509}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] The Best Game To Play With Guests At Your House [/h1]\n\nI had some friends over at my house and started this game with them.

You're there to piece together what happened.\n\nHer Story was absolutely fabulous. I fell in love with this game - I really did. The game play format was gorgeous (I have a deep love for desktop style games) and if it bothered you, the game gives you an option to turn off the glare which is a lovely, lovely touch.\n\nActing was brilliant - though I'm no critic - but little hints in her behaviour make you clearly see what you know once the game has been finished or secrets have been revealed to you. Not to mention, thoroughly interesting to watch. Hannah even gives you a little song on the guitar, how sweet.\n\nIt was incredibly satisfying to see the chart slowly turn green after you've watched all the clips. I made majority of my time to get them all green - what a life I have. \n\nMy criticisms - Hannah Smith is the only character we see. Quite literally. And as wonderful as the acting is and absorbing the story line was, it can get just a little repetitive and boring when you're sat there doing the same process. Type key word, click, watch clip, close, type new key word and repeat. There wasn't so much of a glimpse of her poor, poor victim and there was just no depth other than that.

If you do have unjustified expectations, you might be in for a disappointment. The actor clearly is acting but she could be acting that she is acting, if you get my drift. The story is full of nuances and intrigues on top of being cleverly written. The responses are so believable that they maintain the illusion of this being a real interrogation. The plot is a bit cheesy and some clues are so much on the nose that it feels like they were meant to be fake.\n\nWhat is a negative is the gameplay. You are to see an interrogation of a wife in a missing-person-case and have to use an old computer with an old program that doesn't show the questions the interrogaters had for the wife. The program more than show its age in that you are under normal circumstances only allowed to see 5 search results given by the search query and sorted by date of creation or however this is called. The answers range from seconds to minutes in length. This also means that you could get the truth spoiled by typing in specific words and/or phrases. This was the case for my girlfriend and me after the first 20 minutes. It is also possible to break the game if you are perceptive of just one minute detail. It is cool that they built in these possibilities, but I for one had rather a better guided experience than a spoiled ending, since it also affected the rest of the playthrough since we were pretty confused by answers the wife gives in other parts of the interrogation.\n\nI study language (lol, yes) and narrative is what fascinates me the most, maybe in general in all media.

Careful interpretation of the dialogue is the only way to uncover the truth hidden within the stories that are told. The setting is grounded but the case is interwoven with the magic of fairytales, so a consideration of the make-believe is important for understanding the reality.\n\nHer Story depends on player immersion more than the average narrative game does. The player has to want to keep searching and to think of increasingly creative search terms; the player has to figure out exactly what they're being told; the player has to piece everything together and decide when it's the end. It is more fitting and realistic for the game to have no real ending but, understandably, some people may be disappointed by the lack of conclusion.

I normally love detective and mystery games but this isn't a game.  You're not being asked to solve a mystery or verify facts and statements.  All you do is type words into a search bar and since the search bar only shows you the first five matching results (conveniently never the video that would end this all) you have to find the right combination of words to narrow down the search and find the right video that explains everything.  This requires zero thought as the key search words are pretty obvious in the video, it's just time consuming.  After 30 minutes I literally stopped the game and went to the wiki to see if I was missing some kind of game play feature or something.  But that's it, that's all there is to this \"game\".\n\nThe story is also WAAAAY over hyped.  If the game didn't essentially break the story into a 217 piece (how many video clips there are) jigsaw puzzle no one would bat an eye to it.  But a jigsaw puzzle is giving the game too much credit, there is literally NO WAY of seeing all of the videos in order unless you carefully note down yourself what order they should go in.  You get one tracker that shows you how many videos in total you have seen and that's it.\n\nIf you're interested in the game's story, watch a let's play or read the wiki for it but don't fall for the hype.

I've always wanted a really comprehensive detective game, but the truth is real detective work is actually tough. So having only interviews is a great design choice. The player can have the opportunity to deal with a lot of information without having too much \"game\" to become confused. Having only interview footage to look over, It's actually quite amazing how the story unravels, given that the player is the one choosing the path. The game manages to \"lead\" you towards the conclusion without ever breaking the illusion. The pacing and editing is great, but it must be mentioned the acting is what really makes the game. It's what you are facing throughout the entire game and I barely \"notice\" it, which is perfect. Be immersed in how normal everything seems and when the details reveal themselves, then you start to see (and hear) what you didn't see before.

In order to locate them, you have to type in search words or terms and see what comes up on the results.  You don't have to watch all the clips or formally link together the videos to make deductions.  How far you progress into the game is entirely up to you.  There is no \"ending\" as such.  Your motivation to continue depends entirely on whether you want to learn more about the story - or not.  It is very unconventional gameplay for a mystery game, but I like the fact that something different is being done.\n\nWhat makes this story very clever for me is the way in which people's view on the story tends to fall into one of two different interpretations of the events.  I must confess that my view falls in what appears to be the minority view out of the two.  To say anything about either interpretation would ruin the enjoyment of the game, so please forgive me for sounding cryptic in this review.  I couldn't even say what film springs to mind when I think of the story, suffice to say there is a very famous one and I'm surprised to find no reference to it in any of the discussion forums.\n\nThe setting for the game is in the 1990s.  And I think that's deliberate so that mobile phones do not have to be included.  Had mobiles have featured in the story, the police (and in turn, the player) would have been able to reach a conclusion to the crime more easily.  The game is carefully crafted so that more than one theory has at least some degree of plausibility, in order to keep you guessing.  And it works - the discussions about the game prove that.  People who have played the game are still reading the views of others and discussing the events long after the game is over and seeing all the video clips.  In most games, the post-play discussion is usually around certain plot points, potential sequels and so on - not the main story itself.\n\nYou never get to hear the questions being asked by the police.  There are also no case notes to guide you.  While you may form your interpretation of events early on, the police who investigated the case might not necessarily have had the same view.  That's a clever move on the part of the developers, in my view.\n\nViva Seifert's excellent performance as the suspect being interviewed by the police is what this game's success largely hinges on.  Credit must be given where it is most certainly due because the role she's playing is a very challenging one to pull off.  And that is true, regardless of which interpretation of the events you believe to be true.  I'm surprised this actress has a very limited filmography.  I would like to see her in more games and in some films too.\n\nI agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the database restriction to five results for a given search term is rather implausible.  But it's a minor flaw, and certainly doesn't harm enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall, what we have here is an unconventional but highly interesting game.  It is very different from the usual detective FMV games such as Contradiction - Spot the Liar and The Shapeshifting Detective, for example.  The nearest comparison is The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker, but without the increasingly confusing stories told by the different characters.  Fans of that game will probably like this one too.", "timestamp_created": 1622640955, "timestamp_updated": 1622641180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92930585": {"recommendationid": "92930585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220627740", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 161, "last_played": 1577856403}, "language": "english", "review": "a visual novel like game with a thriller undertone. satisfying when u get a good grip of the story. will not say much as game is susceptible to spoilers.", "timestamp_created": 1622465331, "timestamp_updated": 1622465331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92881499": {"recommendationid": "92881499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044890984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1622385731}, "language": "english", "review": "Y", "timestamp_created": 1622393696, "timestamp_updated": 1622393696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92821328": {"recommendationid": "92821328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006726591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1622970608}, "language": "english", "review": "very unusual style, interesting story", "timestamp_created": 1622319228, "timestamp_updated": 1622319228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92819440": {"recommendationid": "92819440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079136247", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1620505932}, "language": "english", "review": "Innovative game which made you feel like an investigator.

I thought only one person: Eve was talking the entire time, and Hannah was her sister's name, and every time she would talk about herself as Hannah, she was lying cause Hannah talked less confidently anyways. And I didn't even realized that I had finished the game somehow... I don't even remember what triggered it, but nevertheless it was an unsatisfying ending.[/spoiler]\n\nThe above thoughts were running through my irritated mind after I realized the game ended, but before that I was constantly taking down notes, names, the Morse/tap code. studying the differences between 2 similar videos and transcribing them to find any clue, but at the end I was disappointed nonetheless. Maybe it was my fault... I went into the game with high expectations after watching the video by GMTK about 2015's most innovative game even though I only really bought the game cause I had a few cents left after buying what I needed in the Summer 2020 sale (just like Kingdom: Classic). \n\nI just played the game for 5 hours the night before an exam, finished it, and will probably forget about it soon cause it was no-where close to an everlasting experience.\n\nAfter I got the ending though, I was like: \"meh, might as well get the rest of the trivial achievements too\", so my save file of accessed videos in the database are now sullied, but there were no cloud saves anyways, so I was bound to lose it.

The system for finding these consists of entering in keyword(s) that are spoken in the dialogue of the clips into a database, which will return matching videos; but only display the first five of them to watch. Firstly, I enjoyed this system of puzzle game-like storytelling, as it required some scrutiny of dialogue and knowledge of narrative to find footage given what you have already seen. I also thought the idea of telling a story through police interrogations was great, and the game goes beyond the crime itself to explore the character\u2019s life and background. And since these are told in an inherently nonlinear fashion, it is up to the player to understand what happened. Additionally, after some time watching, it will become clear there is more here to find out than a simple \u201cwhodunnit?\u201d, with Hannah\u2019s life holding a big secret that could explain the crime.\nHowever, having played Return of the Obra Dinn around a year ago, which similarly tasks the player with discovering disjointed evidence and making sense out of it, I was quite disappointed by the game\u2019s conclusion. I thought, for example, that you might need to arrange the evidence in order using cues from the footage, or explain what happened at the crime using the evidence you found to make a case for innocence. But your knowledge of the game\u2019s events is never actually put to the test by the end, nor are you incentivized to actually collect all of the footage past the halfway point save for curiosity\u2019s sake. Instead, the game ends almost immediately once you are done searching for evidence, with only a final twist that has little impact since there is no time given to acknowledge it. Additionally, the search method for finding videos can quickly give way to blind guessing once you have collected the majority of them; the game even acknowledges this hindrance by making you aware of a command to pull up a random clip from the database once you have beaten the game.\nSo while I would certainly strongly recommend this game on the merits of its storytelling methods and presentation, especially considering its low price, I was nonetheless let down by its sudden conclusion and turn to brute-force guessing.", "timestamp_created": 1614073752, "timestamp_updated": 1614073752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87277163": {"recommendationid": "87277163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119186271", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1586851551}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful story", "timestamp_created": 1614069997, "timestamp_updated": 1614069997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87218710": {"recommendationid": "87218710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031975325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1614157340}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't get it.

The game revolves around sifting through a massive pile of videos to figure out who killed the suspect's husband. While seemingly simple, the story quickly expands into a branching and fascinating exploration of the backstory, lies, and truths of this woman's life. Albeit a bit convoluted, the mystery is intriguing and provided me a reason to take actual notes (a thing I haven't done since my playthrough of Deus Ex). Unfortunately, the game is rather short and features no way to go back and watch all the videos in order after you have made your conclusion. Even trying to manually search for them is difficult as there are several videos that are only a few seconds long [spoiler] (i.e. the ones from the lie detector scene with only the words \"yes\" and \"no\") [/spoiler].\nOn the topic of searching, this search system has to be one of the most brilliant in any mystery game ever, although it has a few flaws. It makes you feel like a true detective when you notice something or hear something off and search it in to find a smattering of new clips with even more clues. Putting up a list of leads and crossing them out, taking notes and making connections, it's all in the player's hands and makes me feel more like Sherlock than any actual Sherlock game. The issue is, this system can be easily gamed by just searching nouns and hoping something comes up, in fact, some of the most important clips came up for me just because I searched a vague noun just trying to find out more about a specific moment in the story. All in all, though, I'd recommend this game to any mystery lover or those looking for a visual novel-style experience. Don't go in expecting anything gritty or realistic as this game can get weird, very weird [spoiler] although it's up to you to decide if that weirdness is coming from inside this woman's deranged, split psyche or is rather just a thematic thing come up with by the developer [/spoiler].", "timestamp_created": 1612680005, "timestamp_updated": 1612680005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86069008": {"recommendationid": "86069008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045059880", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1613085596}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an unconventional game in the sense that your goal should not be to \"beat\" it - it's more of an interactive story.

Each video will generally mention something you can search for that will lead you to more unseen clips. You can also piece together a timeline by arranging the videos in your session (I highly recommend starting to sort them as soon as you add them, as trying to arrange them when you have a lot of clips is incredibly time consuming). \n\nIf you enjoy murder mysteries, then this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1610504830, "timestamp_updated": 1610504830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84490071": {"recommendationid": "84490071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089960284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1521023342}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely one of those games that you're supposed to really pay attention and be patient, because otherwise, it will come out as confusing.

A very creative addition to the detective game genre and one I hope has impact on future developers. \n\nThe main shortcoming of detective games is that it's hard to give players the freedom to make their own choices and deductions without giving them the answer. For example, if there are three dialogue choices for an answer, one of them might give the player a deduction that they didn't come to themselves until prompted to the idea by the game. It goes without saying that that is not the best way to design a detective game.\n\nHer Story is a game about a murder mystery where you have to watch interviews to gather evidence to make your deductions. However, they aren't in order. They are put in a database where, if you enter a term that appears in the video, you may find the first five videos with that term. The player makes their own deductions, jots down notes, useful terms, similar motifs, and creates their own idea on the story. Some of these are pointless or red herrings but some of them are supported and appear frequently. \nUltimately, this ends up creating a very personal narrative to the game's story. Sometimes, players are given a straight line of thought to a conclusion and other times they need to make their own inferences.\n\nThere are two very very high points for this game in that regard.\n- The player has to type keywords in the search bar to search for results, which allows the players a lot of creative freedom to make their own deductions on the truth of the story.\n- The player can choose to end the game when they are satisfied with the conclusion of the story. Pretty much, after watching some of the videos, the player receives a call asking them if they are satisfied with the conclusion they've gathered.\n\nLet's talk about the first one. It sounds like a really simple mechanic but it is a great way to give players feedback from their own deductions. From the videos that do show up, the player is given a fair idea on the legitmacy of their conclusion, without the game explicitly stating so.\n\nThe second one doesn't have much to do with the detective game genre specifically but it's a much larger commentary on the way we engage with video games. \nWhen do you \"finish\" or \"beat\" a game? Is it when you beat the final boss? Perhaps, get the true ending? Or maybe, you need to 100% it?\nFor some games, there's a clear answer. You beat \"Super Mario Bros.\" when you kill Bowser in the final castle. However, for a mystery, when do you exactly finish? \nThere is no part of \"Her Story\" where the game explicitly says, \"Congratulations, you've solved the mystery\". You, the player, have to decide when you are satisfied with the conlcusions that you have made and what you've gathered from it and that struck me as really beautiful.\n\nI'm sure you may have heard from Mark Brown but there's this great post on the \"Community\" tab that asks about the length of the game. To which it was replied, it ends when you're satisfied with what you've seen and you have the answers you need. Then the OP replied, \"How will I know when I'm satisfied?\".\nThat really showed me how people rely on traditional structure and defined conclusions of video games for their enjoyment and how creatively limiting the medium can be because of it.", "timestamp_created": 1610287134, "timestamp_updated": 1610287134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84417038": {"recommendationid": "84417038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081025871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1609124631}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it with pen and paper trying to figure what happened and what you are watching.", "timestamp_created": 1610270076, "timestamp_updated": 1610270076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84401126": {"recommendationid": "84401126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019820751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1610246328}, "language": "english", "review": "Fascinating game.

Beyond my logic.\n\nFirstly, I just want to say that I had a hell of a time getting this game to actually run. On Windows it was always crashing. I tried all solutions but to no avail. Somehow got it to work on Linux but videos weren't playing. Then, after a lot of digging around I found out that Unity has a lot of problems with different video settings and drivers and I ended up playing it on Windows, but on the integrated video card. This was a lot of wasted time and I don't think it was worth it.\n\nNow, the whole problem with Her Story is that naming it a game is stretching the definition by a long margin. In all honesty, this work is just a piece of software. A pretty crummy and fundamentally flawed piece of software.\n\nBasically, if this just feels like a random piece of software from past immemorial that you open up and try to do fiddle with it just for fun's sake. Although there aren't any clear indications as to what you are to do (those readme files are useless), it becomes clear that you should try to find pieces of a movie and try to learn of what happened there. From my point of view, the idea would be to arrange the movie in the correct order and see the whole picture. While the basic gist is easy to understand, you will find out that well, that isn't easy a easy feat and the limitations imposed by the game make finding pieces fairly impossible. To add insult to injury, some fragments are 1 to 2 seconds long and contain only one word, a very common word that will be ignored as other clips would also contain it.\n\nI tried to go about the correct way and searched all of the terms that I could come up with and basically unlocked more that 50% of the clips, but it became clear that arranging them and understanding the plot was not going to be possible through normal means (I mean, I ended up with a complex tagging scheme which could work, but it was so cumbersome that I didn't want to spend time with). By this time I've seen so many spoilers that the story was ruined.\n\nThe user session part is a joke. Sorting is a joke. Ended up loosing all of my progress because I thought the shiny button would erase my cache. Well, it did, and my save file to go along with it. And yeah, you cannot take videos out of your session. So, I raise my middle finger to the developer for this intentional odd design choice. \n\nI got fed up with all of these bad design choices and ended up opening the game folder and watching the movies in their indented order. I understood the plot. Interesting story, but the thing that boggled my mind was: \"OK. I've uncovered the story. What now?\". And to my surprise there isn't any next part. You just acknowledge that you understood the plot and that's it. End \"game\".\n\nSo, yeah, spending 4-5 hours on crummy piece of software, I can easily put it on my \"fundamentally flawed\" list of games. The worst of the worst. That's why I wholeheartedly advise you to skip this title altogether.", "timestamp_created": 1609869724, "timestamp_updated": 1614511631, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84046455": {"recommendationid": "84046455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989320900", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1607322113}, "language": "english", "review": "Unique non-linear story that is told with the help of short little video snippets.   \nTrying to piece together all the informations and falling in multiples rabbit holes made this story quite entertaining even if I guessed the plot twist quite early.  \nThe ending felt a bit incomplete and could have been fleshed out a bit more.\nThe acting was great !\nIt's very rare a game successfully makes you feel like you are a detective so I definitely recommend this game while on discount.", "timestamp_created": 1609825234, "timestamp_updated": 1609825234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84039978": {"recommendationid": "84039978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137657929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1609808771}, "language": "english", "review": "Not sure if this is worth full price, the novelty I guess and the attention to detail.\nThe story unfolds in a very interesting way and for me would be comparable to the price of going to a matinee movie.

I was missing at the beginning description of the goal of the game - what do I want to do and why. I was a little bit confused at the beginning because of this.\n\n2. There is not an easy way of ordering videos that you find and watching them in that order. When you find a clip you can add it to a clipboard called \"session\". But unfortunately, the only way to change the order is to swap it with another clip. This can lead to 200 swaps when you add the beginning video to the session after ordering 200 videos. This is the biggest disadvantage of the game, as at some point it changes the way how you play it from revealing the story by watching videos to querying dictionary worlds randomly to find the missing videos. Because of this issue, I lost the fun of playing this game.\n\n3. There is no clear indication from which bigger video you miss the clip. There is a program in a game that shows you which part of the memory is still missing. But it is not easy to translate this to the video level, the only way to do it is to order everything manually and cont by yourself.\n\nAs you can see this is a promising game, that can be very fun when just a few things get fixed.

It's original in it's construction and the gameplay is unique.\nIt manages to grab your attention from the very beginning and your attitude transitions from \" Well, ok, let's try this one out. I bought it on sale, it was cheap, let's give it a shot \" to \" Well, well, well, this is actually pretty good!\" At least in the first hour or two.\nHere you are some kind of a police officer, maybe a detective. You're sitting in from of a CRT monitor, you log in and you're told to take a look at an interview footage, showing a woman undergoing questioning, in regards to her husband's dissapearance. Her being the prime suspect in the case.\nThe game throws you into a deep water right away and it doesn't show you the ropes, nor does it explain, what your role is in all of this. Do you have to solve the mystery? Do you have to point, who's guilty here?\nYou start with 4 short video footages and one word visible in the search browser \" MURDER \". That's your starting package. From now on you're on your own.\nYou progress through the game by watching those clips, making notes, on what's being said and you're then using the search browser, looking for more clips and clues, by using key words. Now this is a neat idea, as long as the GUI is made user friendly enough, to facilitate this.\nSee, the problem is, for any word, you can see a maximum of 5 clips at the same time, so if a certain word brings you 30 results, you're missing the other 25 and you have to find a more detailed phrase, to find the other ones. Now, this is not a terrible idea, but at some stage, you find yourself typing in every possible word from each of the clips and with each finding, the number of video footages increases. \n Ok, you can save each clip for future reference and each of those footages is moved to the tab at the bottom, but the most frustrating part I think, is that there's no efficient way to browse through those clips. There's no way to sort them in chronological order, apart from dragging and dropping from one end of the tab to another. So when you have saved 200 clips, you can't just choose \" interviews from 18,06,1994 sorted from earliest to last \". No, you have to pick each and every one of them manually and you also have to click on every one of them and read the date and time of those and then manually place them side by side, which feels like a massive chore. \nIt basically extends the time it takes to complete the game 3 times. I actually felt, like I was at work, inputting data into excel 8 hours a day. At some stage I couldn't be bothered anymore, because it was taking sooo much time, that it was just not worth it and game breaking at that.\n\nAlso it's very possible, that one of your search words will forward you to the last interview and you will watch a spoiler and you will know, what has actually happened, without even being half way through your investigation. If you know how it ended, will you keep investigating, what lead to this? \nAlso, I quickly realised, I'm just an observer here. I don't take any active part in the investigation. All I'm doing is, I'm trying to find pieces of the puzzle, put them together and just watch, what happened. I'm not a guy trying to figure this out myself and then point a finger at someone, or decide, if she's guilty, or not.\nThis game feels like \" Dear Esther \" told in a more chaotic way.\n\nSo while the game is one of a kind and it did entertain me in the first 2 hours, it ended up frustrating me and the above issues have ultimately put me off in the end. I know how it ended, I know what her problem is, but I didn't feel like trying to sort this all out, to watch it from beginning to the end, nor did the game want me to.\n\nSo it's a hand down and a 6 /10 for me.

One caveat being that you can only access the first 5 clips found.  To get the other clips you will need to refine your searches or find it through a new line of keywords.  That's really all the game is, finding and watching clips and piecing together what is going on.  It probably only takes an hour to hit most of the big story beats and then another 2-3 hours to fill in the little details, get the order correct and put your interpretation on everything.  Keep in mind though that the game never tells you what the truth is.  You need to figure that out on your own, and not all the details are there and they are all from one perspective, so you will need to make your own assumptions.

I have a couple of other smaller qualms, too: for one, there really isn't a way to prevent the player from guessing ahead instead of making smart inferences, which I think could probably be more effectively hidden; for another, some of the story bytes that are required for full linearity, are too short to be reasonably accessed in the specific choice of format, of queries to a database of interrogation responses that are divorced from their prompting questions.\n\nNone of that is to say the acting isn't up to par (it is) or the story is bad (I loved it), but this lack of polish does put a slight damper on what is otherwise a standout video game narrative with the courage to push its medium in little-explored direction. But this is also where the short length of the game proves to be a strength instead of a weakness: it's too short for these issues to become proper nuisances, so the experiment retains its good-natured novelty throughout.", "timestamp_created": 1605161699, "timestamp_updated": 1605161699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79114826": {"recommendationid": "79114826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798605954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1605118421}, "language": "english", "review": "The story and the depth of script is great.

The reason Her Story is such a different game is because it's barely a game at all, as a matter of fact most people described it as an interactive movie, but I feel like that's also an inaccurate description of what this game is. There's about 2 hours of video footage, but it's not a movie that you're watching from the beginning to the end, instead that content is sliced into smaller videos, some only a few seconds long, while others spanning a few minutes. Using a search engine built into the game you can look up words or small phrases and based on subtitles the game will return all videos that contain those words, regardless of length. Because of this each player will uncover videos in a different order, but regardless of what that order is you will still reach that one moment when you figure out what the catch of the story is and depending on which video you watch first that impact may differ, but the plot twist is what you are here for and regardless of the video that clicks for you, the realization of what you're looking at will still be a surprise no matter what.\n\nAs for the premise of the game all you need to know is that you are investigating the murder of Simon Smith by looking at interviews with his wife Hannah starting with the moment after his disappearance all the way to the point when his body was found. As those videos are dated it is up to you to put the events in order and figure out the mystery of what happened based on the footage you're watching and even though some videos are just small talk with the interviewer, some of them provide valuable information about what happened, so paying attention to what Hannah is saying in each scene is important not only to get an idea of what happened to Simon, but also to pick your words carefully for the next search to maximize the results of finding more useful footage. Even though plenty of characters are mentioned, you are only looking at Hannah's interviews, so you must deduce each character's role in the story and the murder based on what she says about each one of them. If you like police or investigation type games, Her Story will most likely satisfy you from a plot perspective as there is one major plot twist somewhere at the middle point depending on when you figure it out and then another big one at the end, which I honestly didn't see coming at all.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nFrom a gameplay perspective the search engine mechanic makes up most of the game, as the whole point is accessing the entire video database by searching for the right words, so you have to listen to anything Hannah says in one video and then take some keywords out of what she said in order to look them up and get more context on that topic, whether it's an event, character name or a more general word like \"murder\". To prevent you from exploiting the system by searching for common words, each search inquiry only returns 5 results even if there are more videos containing that word, but the game is structured in such a way that looking up any specific thing that Hannah mentioned will usually point you to another video that will repeat the cycle. Figuring out which words to search for isn't hard either, as you can quite easily work out what you should be looking for next if you pay attention to the interviews. Once you've seen around 75% of the footage you can choose to either continue or end the game which will reveal the final plot twist, but even if you know what the plot twist is without watching everything, there are some interesting and sometimes even funny conversations hidden inside more hard to find videos, so watching everything is highly encouraged if you want to get the full picture.\n\nEven though you are on a computer at all times, aside from searching for the next set of videos there isn't a lot to do, there are only a few notepads left on the desktop with some basic instructions about the game and a minigame called Mirror Game which you can play for as long as you like, but aside from that the main story is all there is, however considering the type of game this is, it doesn't really require anything else in order to achieve what it sets out to do, as the plot twists in the story do that all by themselves. Her Story isn't much of a game, but it's an amazing and certainly unique experience that you should definitely try out if you like mystery and investigation simply because the conclusion here will probably surprise you no matter what.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nSince the game takes place in 1994, all the video footage was made to look like it came out of that era, so you have CRT display lines that were common in footage from that period and also a low resolution effect to the videos, on top of the fact that you are looking at a CRT monitor at all times, but all of that is done for the sake of immersion and it never bothered me one bit because visuals aren't the main focus of the game here. The PC interface is also made to resemble Windows 95, but despite that the UI theme has a 90s police appeal more than a common UI from 1994.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nOne of the main reasons the story has such a big impact is because of Viva Seifert who plays the role of Hannah and her exceptional acting skills, and even thought I'd like to expand on that phrase more, it would be impossible for me to do so without going into spoiler territory, so you're just gonna have to trust me on this one. There are some tunes integrated into some videos, but it's not the soundtrack of the game that you're hearing, but instead Hannah singing and playing the guitar. On the topic of audio effects all there is to talk about is the PC interface, which is basic, but considering it's made to resemble the early version of Windows, it is justified.\n\n[b]Extras[/b]\nIt takes around 3 hours to complete the entire game and there's only one ending so replayablity is not a feature here; aside from that the only thing that could be counted as an extra is the Mirror Game which gets boring after 3 rounds in the bast case scenario, but considering the main focus on the story and the experience as a whole here, extras aren't really necessary.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nIf you are looking for something unique with a great plot twist and don't mind the almost non-existant gameplay, Her Story might be something for you, especially if mystery and investigation are also topics of interest to you. Since the game is only 3 hours long you can finish this easily in one session, so the next time you're searching for a movie to spend the night with, consider Her Story as a viable option because after all, it is just an out of order movie with a great story and shocking plot twists.\n\n[u]Rating: 7.2[/u]", "timestamp_created": 1600422791, "timestamp_updated": 1603060842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76141187": {"recommendationid": "76141187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115865804", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1449325950}, "language": "english", "review": "A superb game with a simple yet extremely effective mechanic and system.

I will dive into why I believe this game to be a beautiful pile of dung. Spoilers will be in this review but under the ---Plot/Spoiler--- category. \n\n---Worth it?---\nFor the price, I'd give it a solid maybe. I can't recommend it at full price, this goes double when we get into the Plot. But overall It was meh and I believe this could have been a learning point for the Devs\n\n---Gameplay---\nYou play as... I honestly don't know what to call the character. Anyways you are tasked with solving a cold case via video recordings from interviews from a woman involved. It is a neat concept based on the fact that the computer is too dog doo-doo to display anything past the top 5 search results. The game is built around the amount of garbage tech and tags put onto these videos. You'll be listening to Names, Places, Things, and some other stuff found in the void. Once you get far enough you'll have more stuff to search than a man on an XXX site. Overall the gameplay is entertaining, BUT it does put the plot in a locked box. \n\n---Plot/Spoilers---\n[spoiler]The Plot is so stupid and the twist is so unbearable, It's like JK Rowling wrote a murder novel. The Plot can be summed up in a list\n1:Twins are born\n2:One twin \"dies\" but in reality is kidnapped by the maid and kept across the street\n3:One twin meets the man of her dreams(the victim) and gets married\n4:The Other Twin moves in with her sister and her brother in law\n5:One gets pregnant and the other one looses her mind\n6:Both sisters comes out to the husband\n7:The married sister takes a trip away\n8:Husband falls in love and makes moves on the other sister\n9:Husband gets deaded via the sisters as they start breaking stuff as an alibi\n10:They hide the body, one goes to the cops, the other leaves\n11:They are both caught and questioned, Plot twist the interviews were two different people\n12:You were the daughter of one of them\n [/spoiler]\nSo yeah, its kind of madness and horrible. I played this with a friend and as we progressed we were bouncing ideas off each other, to get slapped in the face with an unsatisfying ending. \n\n---Overall--- \nAs I stated in a previous review (Deceit) A good Idea requires good execution. This games gameplay is mediocre at best and the plot is mind numbing and horrible at best.

Se ha cometido un crimen y tendremos que averiguar que ha pasado desentra\u00f1ando la trama a trav\u00e9s de los v\u00eddeos de los interrogatorios que la polic\u00eda hace a una \u00fanica persona, solo hay un actriz en todo el juego, buscando palabras claves en sus declaraciones que nos lleven a otros v\u00eddeos para ir uniendo las piezas. \n\nY as\u00ed de sencillo.\n\nUna actriz, una historia y buscar palabras que nos lleven a las otras partes de los interrogatorios. \n\nDe lo que viene a ser un fragmento de la jugabilidad presente en muchas aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, al fin y al cabo eso de buscar palabras claves en un texto o conversaci\u00f3n no es nada nuevo, se hace un juego completo \u00fanica y exclusivamente con esa premisa .\n\nLa originalidad y la innovaci\u00f3n viene por el formato en el que se ha decidido hacer el juego. Una \u00fanica actriz, bastante buena por cierto, en formato FMV y con una historia rota en mil pedazos que debemos ir construyendo. \n\nUn planteamiento que ciertamente funciona... pero como mera curiosidad, me temo. \n\nEn efecto, una vez pasados los primeros momentos del juego, cuando se evapora la efervescencia, resulta\nm\u00e1s que evidente que estamos ante un juego con una jugabilidad muy sencilla y limitada que a pesar de haberse sabido rodear del artificio necesario y haber sabido venderse bien... es muy poco lo que ofrece y por eso resulta dif\u00edcil ver el juego como algo m\u00e1s que una de las curiosidades que a veces nos trae la esfera indie.\n\nInteresante como curiosidad, simp\u00e1tico como excusa para pasar unas pocas horas jugando a una propuesta diferente... pero escaso y limitado como para que uno se plantee algo m\u00e1s profundo y trascendente. \n\nPara un juego ocasional de corta duraci\u00f3n, pues si. Para juegos m\u00e1s largos o crear un subg\u00e9nero, pues no. \n\nJuego recomendable para los m\u00e1s curiosos y hambrientos de planteamientos diferentes. Tambi\u00e9n para los m\u00e1s completistas y amantes de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas en todas sus vertientes. \n\nAbstenerse aquellos sin inter\u00e9s en explorar la esfera indie o los que no tengan ganas de que le est\u00e9n contando mandangas. \n\n\n6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1597004509, "timestamp_updated": 1600193470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679920971393585205", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74042453": {"recommendationid": "74042453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043434359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1566777536}, "language": "english", "review": "Got through this game in less than 2 hours.

The trick is you can only watch short little clips of the interview by searching words said during the clip. \n\nThe only reason I recommend this game is because it is an utterly unique and creative premise; currently you are unlikely to find anything quite like it. It is so interesting to watch a mystery unfold through these short clips and you stumble on them in such a unique way. There also has clearly been some thought put into how you discover clips, so there are actually some clever twists built in.\n\nStory/mystery is ok. It is compelling, and there some good reveals, but overall be prepared for some melodrama and a story that is a bit over the top (but I think most mystery games tend to be over the top, so while I may not be a fan this may not actually be a point against it). The actress is pretty good, believable enough, but some of her acting quirks begin to show because you spend so much time starring at her.\n\nEDIT: The analysis of the story runs very deep. If you want to get lost in a rabbit hole of analysis and theories, where meaning is wrung out of every word, this may be the game for you. You may finish the game in 4ish hours but you can easily spend dozens of hours going over it. \n\nThe gameplay is unfortunately atrocious. It was an artistic decision to make the game hard to use (the creator has openly responded to requests to change it) and in my opinion that is a real shame. If you save a clip by adding it to your \"user session\" you cannot remove it. Rearranging clips is a nightmare. Everything you searched is just added to a list with no way of navigating it. Adding user tags is more harmful than useful. Worst of all, clicking \"Delete Session Data\" doesn't delete the user session as you might think, it deletes your game. I fell for that like so many others. It is just plain bad design, whether it is intentional or not. This makes it all but impossible to sort the clips in chronological order. Do yourself a favor, ignore \"user session\" and just find as many clips as you can, then when you believe you have found 80 to 90 percent of them, just watch the entire thing chronologically on youtube. It is NOT worth your time to sort it in game.\n\nThere is also no real resolution either. At some point you have an idea of what happened but you'll never get a conclusive answer or ending. Ambiguous endings can be good, but I think it doesn't serve mysteries terribly well. \n\nThe bottom line is, I would LOVE to see another game like this but with better gameplay design.

I got it for a great price after wanting to play it for a while, but now I wish I'd bought it at full price since it deserves it!\n\nSummary --> You are investigating an old case involving a woman giving testimonies about the death of a man she knows really well; I won't say anything more since it would spoil the plot!\n\nGameplay --> this is a detective-style game, but the gameplay is really unique: you have to acquire informations by inserting keywords into a database that - according to the keyword - will provide you with  fragments of testimonies in the form of short video clips. By slowly inserting more keywords and accessing more clips you get a gradually deeper understanding of what  the story is and what is going with this mysterious woman. \n\nMy commentary\n\nWhat impressed me the most: the acting is really superb, it looks realistic and believable, a true \"one woman show\". Also the gameplay mechanincs are innovative and a breath of fresh air for someone that has played a lot of detective games. \n\nFinal observations:  I actually solved the case in about 30 minutes, after looking at about 30% of the total video footage available. But! I don't see this as a flaw of the game itself! I actually came back and carefully looked at all the video clips and after doing so I can safely say this game tells a well crafted and fleshed out story and if you happen to \"get\" the soulution of the case early on, don't close the game but make an effort to view all the clips in chronological order, otherwise you would loose a great gaming experience. \n\nI give \"Her story\" a 8/10!", "timestamp_created": 1594764506, "timestamp_updated": 1594764506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72657454": {"recommendationid": "72657454", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978347215", "num_games_owned": 942, "num_reviews": 145, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1594702186}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay so first thing is first: If you are looking for a game with discernible goals and features where you unlock information with the intent of solving something in a meaningful, on-screen way, this is not what you're looking for.

You can access the top 5 entries in that list. You can watch those clips. You can see a flag on the video thumbnail that says whether you've watched it before. That's it. That's the entire game. You just look up words and watch the clips associated with them.\n\nWith that said, I would 100% recommend buying this if you want a unique experience and a deep, well-thought-out and well-told story. The path you take to the end of the game is somewhat arbitrary, but when you reach it and the full realization dawns on you of what happened prior to the interviews, you will appreciate that you went through it.\n\nI'd recommend the game at $10 or less.

What Her Story actually is, however, is a collection of old tapes regarding a murder case. I asked a friend who played it if there was anything to it other than watching those tapes, if I was working towards something, if I were somehow helping the investigation or what, but nope.\n\nThese tapes are archived footage from what seems to be many years prior to them becoming available in the game's system. You're not even asked to archive them properly, to make the timeline easier to go through. You're just given them and that's the whole plot. What the game wants the meta plot to be is piecing together the story behind the murder for... really, no reason other than understanding it for your own sake.\n\nIt's fine if you just want a good story told in a unique way but as a game, I was expecting a bit more besides the tapes for the sake of it. Having them spread out is also too much of a gimmick imo. It'd be far more interesting to me if we had access to other documents and if the tapes weren't so disjointed, so that the investigative aspect actually feels like an investigation instead of watching the tapes for the sake of it.

Many great works of literature, music and science have certainly touched my heart, but a video game?\n\nAt first glance, [i]Her Story[/i] is an archive of videos of a woman being the suspect in a 90s murder case. But what at first seems to be a usual murder mystery eventually turns out to be a psychograph of that very woman. We get to know her viewpoint and her tale video by video. And she has an exceptional life story, indeed. The (literal) story of her life is beautifully told, working with many memorable motifs. Every piece of knowledge is evidence for the slick detective within you who then begins searching conspicuous terms in the data base. Those terms will lead you either to dead ends or anecdotes and other clues. One might think that could lead 'pranksters' to finding the plot turn in the story very early. However, being able to see only the first 5 videos makes sure that the story unfolds one piece at at a time. Nevertheless you are completely free in whatever term you type in. That is why [i]Her Story[/i] is an individual experience, you experience it [i]your[/i] way. It is very rewarding to feel the nudges and at the same time know that you found the next clue by yourself. With enough pieces of [i]Her Story[/i] you will have many 'aha moments'. I myself had two of those and they left me speechless. I was lead very gently to the point that I could figure out the two most important questions by myself. And the answers came all of a sudden, I was quite surprised ...

There's Plot Reasons behind that which lead to a masterful execution of her final interview that had me re-watching clips for enjoyment later in my investigation. \n\nThe gameplay gimmick is cool, I always love a game that gets me taking physical notes in a fun way. The meta-story that suddenly erupts and then disappears adds some extra spice right around the time I found myself flagging and losing a sense of direction.

The narrative of this game is complex as you learn more about the woman being interviewed and clips being revealed in a random order.

You effectively have only 2 things you can do in the whole game, type words and watch clips. Although this was almost a very effective game control method, the lack of a few simple controls made some things frustrating and slow at times, earning a gameplay score of 14/20. .\n.\nStory: this game is based entirely on story, and the story is truly brilliant. It's full of twists, intense moments, relatability and all told through 1 actress's amazing performance. The final plot twist is shocking and there's still so many theories and possible explanations by the end. The seemingly simple story becomes more and more unclear, yet retains it's brilliance. The story earns 19/20. .\n.\nImmersion: As this game is entirely played through a 90s computer screen, it fits a pc format perfectly. You genuinely feel like you are a detective attempting to solve this case, and you genuinely feel like you aren't playing a game. The immersion on this game isn't particularly ambitious yet remains successful, earning a score of 18/20.\n.\n.\nWorld building: I think what makes this game truly special is that it manages to build complex characters all told through 1 actress. You can relate to some characters while finding others interesting, they all feel alive despite literally being told through 1 actress. Solid 19/20 .\n.\nReplayability: as this game is story based, once the main plot is out, it loses a lot of value and would definitely be boring to replay soon.

A woman telling a story to camera. Or stories. When it comes to the title, the game has more layers than one. \n\nIt\u2019s been called a game and an interactive film, but it\u2019s really neither, because it has no gaming elements or interaction between the player and the movie. I would call it a movie puzzle or a movie. The mechanics are simple, the \u201cplayer\u201d gets 271 videos of a woman questioned about a murder case. The player then has to guess the right words to find the clips from the archive to build the full story.\n\nThe writer and director Sam Barlow uses the same mechanic later in \u201cTelling Lies\u201d. I started with the latter and watched both in almost one after another. What seemed innovative and original to me in the first jigsaw, started to feel repetitive and unnecessary in the second.  In Her story the plot was revealed fairly soon and finding the lost parts after that just wasn\u2019t motivating.\n\nThe problem of the game is there\u2019s not enough game. Shattering the movie to almost three hundred pieces and showing them in almost random order is a way of telling the story, not a game.  Is this even the right method? Does splitting the timeline add to the experience?\n\nI know the comparison is as unfair as unfair goes, but lets take a look at Tarantino\u2019s Pulp fiction. The movie has an unchronological timeline. Just like in Her story, the spectator puts pieces of the story together in his head while watching the movie, or after it, but the order is not random, far from it. Every scene is carefully placed to create exactly the revelations and the twists the director/ writer Tarantino wants them to. The movie is a movie jigsaw in form of a movie. Nobody calls it a game. Even if the clips were shown in random order, the movie would still not be a game. If the clips were shown in correct order, the movie would still be great, but would definitely lose some of it\u2019s appeal. In Pulp fiction breaking the timeline adds to the experience and is an essential part of it.\n\nIn her story splitting the movie into a pool of clips is justified for one reason and it\u2019s not necessarily flattering. The story would not work without this. When stripped down to the bone, the script is somewhat flat. If the clips were stitched to one movie, it would not be great, just a woman talking. It has one major hook that has been seen before and the clips leave very little room for deduction. Making realizations is a holy privilege of the spectator and should never be compromised. The puzzle brings this into the game, but is not enough to carry it through all the clips.\n\nUnfortunately even the core mechanic can turn against itself. The spectator can stumble upon wrong clips and reveal the main twist very early. This will severely damage the experience, almost destroy it completely. It's like the director telling you what will happen before you get to watch the movie. In conclusion, Her story relies too much on an innovative game mechanic to cover up the shortcomings of the script. \n\nI would still recommend Her story. Everyone should try out movie jigsaw at least once. It\u2019s a different experience to games or movies or any other way of telling a story. That is Barlow's true merit. Barlow\u2019s second work Telling Lies is better in many aspects and if you\u2019re planning to see just one, I would skip straight to that.\n\nAs for Barlow and the future, I would recommend him bringing more game into his games. What was innovative is becoming repetitive. He\u2019s shown he has a gift of telling stories and courage to stray from known paths. He can be a groundbreaker.

The interface is a bit clunky, but that is largely due to the 1990s technology that the user must navigate to solve the mystery.  There are some nice twists and turns and if you are patient and clever (or can use google), you can arrange the entire story from beginning to end. There isn't an explanation of who you are or why you are using the terminal at the opening.  The basic instructions via readme.txt files are off to the side, and that's really it, off you go.  \n\nI paid a little over $1 for this game when it was on sale and for that money, it is worth the experience.  I wouldn't recommend paying full price, as the game can be solved in about 2 hours or less and 100% completed after about 4.  I would say the replay value is quite low, but might be higher for those that love solving puzzles from every possible way.\n\nEven though I didn't find the game wholly satisfying, I applaud the creators for the innovation and thought that went into this game and for pushing the boundaries of gaming.

I think it's a decent game, but overall I wouldn't recommend buying it at the current asking price.\n\nThe story is decent, but not really anything special. I've heard more interesting stories about real life murders on true crime podcasts. It's captivating, but only because of the presentation. The gameplay and story are interwoven exceptionally, but that doesn't keep the story from falling short. Viva Seifert's performance is mostly compelling, but some of the dialogue is unnatural. One of my main gripes with the game with the game is the premise itself; I don't understand why you would tell a story like this unless your goal is to create a false sense of uniqueness or choice for the player.\n\nUnearthing the first 60% or so of the database was enjoyable and easy. After that, it got frustrating. This is a problem inherent to the game's construction; it's either too easy or too difficult to progress. The fact that the story is non-linear does not help with this problem. It got frustrating because it turns out all I was missing were little clips that had essentially no bearing on the narrative. Especially frustrating were [spoiler] lie detector videos that are probably the biggest storytelling cop-out I've ever seen in a piece of media. Finding them requires the use of a search method that is otherwise completely unused in the entire game. The worst acting in the entire piece is also present here, which I believe essentially confirms my suspicion that there is no meat at all behind the polygraph interview. [/spoiler] Unfortunately, the game relies on predictable and sometimes laughable twists to stay interesting. The tiny filler clips, over-reliance on plot twists and a dreadful, lazy ending [spoiler] complete with a self-insert from the game's creator [/spoiler] are what ultimately soured the experience for me.\n\n[h1] bottom line [/h1]\n\nI think it's telling that less than half of Her Story's players have \"beaten\" the game. If you do pick it up, be very prepared to willingly suspend your disbelief.

The entire game is basically you finding new keywords to watch clips.  Some are significant, others not so much.  There are 7 interviews over a ~2 month long period back in 1994.

You have to pay attention to not just what she's saying, but what she's wearing, how she looks, how she drinks her coffee / tea to get the full story.  The story is open ended and you could interpret it several ways.  \n\nPersonally, I think the interpretation that holds the most water is : [spoiler] Eve and Hannah are two different people.  Eve was taken, like Rapunzel, to be the child of Florence. She grew up isolated from the world and obsessed with her twin across the street.  When Florence died when Eve was 8, she went to her twin Hannah's home, and Hannah hid her in their attic.  From then on, she and Hannah shared one life.  They would take turns pretending to be Hannah, they would share food, time with friends / family, classes, social life, dates, etc. They kept their days very exacting by writing diaries about exactly what they had said and done all day. All that changed at 17 when Hannah met Simon and fell in love.  Hannah broke the \"rules\" she and Eve had for each other because she 1. wouldn't share Simon with Eve and 2. became pregnant by Simon.  She and Simon got married, left Eve alone in her parent's attic and went to live with Simon's parents, Eleanor and Doug.  This was 1984. Things turned poorly for Hannah quickly - she miscarried at 8 months and became infertile.  Shortly after that, her parents were found dead with flu-like symptoms that were later revealed to be caused by poisoning from death cap mushrooms.  Since her dad was a mushroom expert, he should've known better than to eat them (and so it's hinted that Eve may have killed her bio parents to get Hannah to move home).  Hannah inherits her dead parent's house and moves back in with Simon.  Eve moves out to her own flat and works odd jobs under the table (singing in bars, mostly) to get by. She gets an apple / snake tattoo to commemorate the event.  One night by chance (or perhaps she intended to do this out of jealousy of Hannah's life and romance), Simon sees her at the bar.  He's struck by how identical she is to his wife.  He starts an affair with Eve and even fucks her in his marital bed.  Eve becomes pregnant.  Eve informs Hannah that she's pregnant and Hannah wants to give up their double life and tell Simon that his wife has a sister.  Eve tells her not to, though.  On her birthday, Simon gifts Hannah a unique mirror he hand made for her.  Later in that day, Eve and Hannah have a fight that turns physical since Hannah realizes Eve had an affair with Simon behind her back.  Eve hits Hannah and bruises her face. Eve then gets in the car and drives up to Glasgow to get away for the night, hitting a taxi cab while she's at it (she admits that Hannah is the better driver) and going to the hospital to make sure her baby is ok.  While this is going on, Hannah puts on Eve's blonde wig and pretends to be Eve with Simon. Simon confesses to \"Eve\" that he would rather be with her than Hannah and gives her a birthday gift - the same \"unique\" hand made mirror he had given Hannah earlier that day.  Hannah loses her temper, swings the mirror around, and slashes Simon's throat  (though, this version of events is told by Eve, so it is possible that she's lying and Eve is actually the one who killed Simon).  When Eve returns home the next day, she discovers what happened and she and Hannah decide to work together.  They report Simon as missing (first interview) and within 2 more interviews, they find his body and the case turns into a murder investigation.  You can tell who is giving what interview based on how they behave (Hannah is much more shy / reserved, likes sugar in her tea and coffee, and doesn't have a tattoo). After some of the interviews, Hannah doesn't show up anymore and Eve says she's \"gone\". So it's possible that Eve killed Hannah in between some of the interviews when Hannah realizes that Eve had an affair with Simon and even fucked in her bed. [/spoiler]\n\nThere are several ways you could interpret the story - a lot of information is left out! - but that's the version that makes the most sense to me after completing 100% of the story. It's a really fun way to play detective for a few hours.  Some of the key word searches are a bit tedious - \"Yes\" and \"No\" and such.

This pretty much points to the primary flaw in Her Story, as the actual story being told by the videos is best viewed sequentially, but the interface of the game makes it so that viewing the videos sequentially is extremely unlikely.\n\nHannah is the main character of Her Story, and indeed, the only one who shows up in the videos. The central conceit of the game is that Hannah was a murder suspect in 1994. The protagonist is going through an old police database, wherein the videos are sorted by keywords in their transcripts. This sounds like a clever idea, but in practice, it doesn\u2019t really work very well at all, beyond being very confusing, it suffers from the fact that it is entirely possible to search for the wrong keyword and end up stumbling across the game\u2019s central twist five minutes in.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I did exactly this by simply searching for the most innocuous of the names I had come across first (for the record, it was the name of one of Hannah\u2019s childhood friends). This resulted in me happening across a video which spoiled the game\u2019s central plot twist, and consequently I spent the rest of the game trying to piece together everything else in the hopes of finding another twist, and then failing to find one.\n\nThe result of the search interface is that you are likely to watch lots of garbage scenes, with odd scenes which are really important thrown in between them. Some of the videos are nothing more than Hannah saying \u201cno\u201d, while others are minute-long monologues explaining crucial plot or character details.\n\nWorst of all, if you actually watch the videos in order, they follow the standard variances of a plot. The rise and fall of action as the police officers piece things together before Hannah finally explains exactly what is going on in the final interview. As a movie, it makes sense.\n\nBut as a video game, it makes no sense at all.\n\nIt has other flaws as well \u2013 as a murder mystery game, one would think that little details would be pretty important, but as it turns out, the people who made the videos didn\u2019t actually pay much attention to time constraints. On many occaisions, something happens \u2013 such as a character changing clothing, or taking a ponygraph \u2013 which ignores the necessary setup time, with the videos happening too close together in time. At first, I had assumed that these little mistakes was related to the plot twist, but eventually I realized it was simple laziness on the part of the game creators.\n\nIf the plot was actually viewed in order, it might be passable, though the awkward interface of the game still would make it annoying. And if parts had been locked off until you had figured some stuff out, it might have worked. But as it is, the thing is kind of a mess, and while the central idea wasn\u2019t a bad one, the UI and erratic pacing as a result of it being made into a \u201cgame\u201d (which it really isn\u2019t any more than searching for stuff on YouTube is a \u201cgame\u201d) makes it hard to really get into it properly. It is possible to spoil the entire plot of the game within five minutes, and a lot of the videos end up feeling a lot like filler, especially when viewed out of context.", "timestamp_created": 1582477381, "timestamp_updated": 1582477685, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501669406890869141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63969169": {"recommendationid": "63969169", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961969805", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 179, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1582431225}, "language": "english", "review": "A clever little mystery to figure out.", "timestamp_created": 1582431293, "timestamp_updated": 1582431293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63962805": {"recommendationid": "63962805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379335928", "num_games_owned": 1084, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1610240776}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really interesting video game.

Such unique gameplay will make you spend hours searching and watching those short videos. \n\n[i]Other Reviews:\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/762830/]Telling Lies Review[/url]\n\n[/i]\n\n[quote]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc50\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32399565/]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e'\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc36\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1582279745, "timestamp_updated": 1587212451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825793802738189697", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63852093": {"recommendationid": "63852093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396258704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1582248542}, "language": "english", "review": "This game....

Crammed into a little investigation package that you unravel at your own liking.  You can find the last few video clips right away and still be intrigued by the story.  I usually do a pros/cons, but this game is pretty straight forward.  Type in keywords/phrases to find video clips of an interview to figure out the story.  \n\nThere is some critical thinking involved, as even if a word/phrase has 20 results, you'll only see the first 5 chronologically.  So you have to add additional key words to the search to narrow it down to see the clips you know exist, but can't see.  In fact, I \"beat\" the game, uninstalled, and the next day remembered I wanted to search for another keyword.  So I re-installed, searched it and got a couple more clips unlocked lol.

It doesn't bend the rules, it doesn't cheat: it's just you, the videos, and your ability to navigate through them while piecing the story together on your own terms.\n\nSome will dislike the lack of finality in the game, but I think it's one of its strongest elements. For me, the game didn't end when I'd seen the ~80% of the videos I needed to feel like I had a strong grasp on the story; it didn't end when I'd seen every video either, something the game helps you to do once you've told it you're done. I was up late into the night reading through forum threads and comments pages on reviews piecing together other people's interpretations of the story to see how mine held up by comparison. Essentially translating into real life the experience of the reflected character trawling through the database. That's some life-imitating-art hype.\n\nFrom a writing perspective, this is an incredible feat. Straddling ambiguity and clarity, providing a framework which doesn't over-rely on any one narrative element to work.

This is not a typical game at all; all the gameplay is just searching key words to unlock video clips. I seem to have spent more hours on this game than every other reviewer I'm seeing, but the truth is a big reason for my long playtime stems from dealing with the game's cumbersome interface. I think I spent as much time tediously arranging the video clips on the inexcusably cumbersome video timeline as I did actually watching the videos. I know almost anyone who plays this game is going to try to arrange the clips in order, so there's no excuse for why there was no easier way to do that aside from dragging each individual clip across the length of the entire timeline.\n\nPlaying this game is all about how much you're willing to challenge yourself. You can immerse yourself into the story and search important words that you gather from the videos, or you can mindlessly input common words and phrases into the search and unlock the videos that way. I managed to unlock all the videos except like a dozen of them, before I used a cheater's method to unlock the rest, but personally I'm proud I made it that far.

You the player can search said database for words, one or more, and it will always return the chronological first five matching clips. That\u2019s it. Now go find out what happened.\n\nThese very simple mechanics make this task more of a challenge than you might think. Keep your search terms too common and you only get early clips that don\u2019t explain much. More specific terms might get you snippets out of context, so you have to keep them in mind in order to understand them later. It feels like a mix of detective work, interpreting the woman\u2019s mannerisms and guessing at holes in her story, and hacking, as you try to push the envelope in what the query field can do. It\u2019s very engrossing.\n\nThe story told is fascinating and dark, if a bit soap opera. It leads to a satisfying conclusion, even if it doesn\u2019t answer every question and thus leaves room for a lot of interesting, maybe even disturbing speculations.\n\nI found the performance of Viva Seifert absolutely believable, sympathetic and a joy to watch. The score is sparse, but very effective. The aesthetics, while not wowing anyone, are surprisingly immersive. I found myself hunching over the keyboard as if I really was sitting in some dark basement at an old 386 PC, digging through a relic database.\n\n\u2018Her Story\u2019 also has a great stinger and, to my mind, the best original song since \u2018Still alive\u2019.\n\nThere is one point where your mileage may vary: Because you have complete freedom over your searches, you might hit upon the major plot points both out of sequence and long before you\u2019ve seen the majority of the clips, which leaves the latter half of the game potentially bereft of satisfying payoffs. The game actually knows this and allows you to trigger the credits manually when you\u2019ve found a certain percentage of videos. It didn\u2019t bother me too much, I found Seifert\u2019s presence so magnetic that I was compelled to hunt down every snippet, even though I already had a complete picture. I actually watched all the clips in order on Youtube right after I completed the game, too.\n\nAdditionally the game is rather short. It took me 5 hours to find everything.\n\nIn Summary: This game comes highly recommended to fans of FMV, crime stories and experimental storytelling. Gameplay-focused players should look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1578575610, "timestamp_updated": 1583594601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61552659": {"recommendationid": "61552659", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971592163", "num_games_owned": 7095, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1578532063}, "language": "english", "review": "Her Story started off really slow and the open ended nature of the investigation can be off-putting.

This game is literally listening to a woman, and because of this, you might think this is boring. The story is really not that interesting if you found out what is happening, works with clich\u00e9, but that's not where this game is strongs at.

You're set in front of an old pc with recorded interviews of a suspect in a murder case. The records are dated from 1994, and are split into lots of very short videos which are each her answer to a question she's asked, although you don't have the questions. Thanks to the old and fiddly software the database is running on, you can only select videos to watch by searching for words, and you'll bring up the first five videos in which she says the word you searched for. Watching these videos, you might notice she mentions a name or place or other thing that piques your interest, which you can search for to see if she mentions it in other videos, and watching those you might think of something else to search for...\n\nWhat do you do from there? You can try to solve the murder if you want, make lots of notes and cross-reference all her testimony. Or perhaps you'll find something else you want to explore.\n\nIt's a very short mystery, it took me about an hour to really get to the heart of the story, and I carried on for another hour to fill out more of the database and answer a few lingering questions. What's great about this game is how absolutely fascinating the character you're watching is. She's very well constructed, and as you watch the videos, you'll get to know the way she thinks, the things that provoke her, the little strange quirks in her personality, the things that are important to her, and watch the way she changes each day she's brought in for interviews as the case takes its turns.

The cops bring in a suspect to interrogate about a murder, but apparently they only ask about the petty minutia in her life like how her mother treated her during her childhood, what her sex life was like. In a couple videos she goes on to talk about the fable of Rapunzel and how Rapunzel's tears saved the prince. Wtf is even going on here? Its amazing that so few of the videos in this game that your required to watch have anything of substance, or even anything remotely related to the crime in question.\n\nSure, its character development, I get it. But due to the sporadic nature of the videos, and because they are not in any specific order, it hampers my ability to empathize with a woman I've only seen for 30 seconds when she starts talking about her mommy issues from childhood. They jump into the cliche \"rebel girl\" teenage archetype as she regretfully muses about the men she slept with at age 17, but its UNEARNED. These kinds of reveals into a characters flaws and secrets should always be done AFTER the audience has formed some kind of connection with them. Not right off the bat.\n\nThe acting of the woman in the videos is sufficient. Its not that she's bad, its that the writing falls short in many ways, which reflects on the character. She's getting interrogated by police but we never see or hear the police talking, which is also a big hit to the story. It would have been much more engaging and interesting if there was a detective asking the questions, ANYONE more than the single girl in the videos would have been nice. \n\nThe gameplay is very simplistic, its just a search engine that you type keywords like \"murder\" into, and it spits out a new page of videos ranging from short 7 second clips to solid minute monologues about another mundane and generic aspect of her life. As you wade through the horde of videos, your supposed to be learning about the crime and the suspect. Again, the issue here is that there is a metric crap ton of non-pertinent videos with nothing noteworthy in them. The game conveniently has her say the next keywords at the end of the video when your memory is fresh, but it is very easy to lose focus on the details due to the majority of the content being plain boring.\n\nI was super excited to feel like a detective and review a crime in a seemingly realistic way. But the reality was watching video after video of droning monologues and petty details about the kind of wallet her husband has, and how she thinks its real leather... or maybe its fake leather? No its probably real. Oh, and he puts his wallet in his back pocket instead of his front pocket, I told him not to do that! So its probably maybe damaging his back. You know, because of displaced disks and stuff. Like this example, we have a tiny piece of information about a wallet that needs to get expressed, but its done clumsily and without any finesse. She drones about the wallet and this and that, 95% of it is irrelevant and boring, and it feels intentionally stretched to add \"content\" to the game. This is where it can seem like the actress is just bad at acting, but its what shes working with, a boring script.\n\nThe search engine in the game is very archaic, no doubt an intended artistic choice to get the mood right, but it also means your ONLY means of interacting with the game is clunky and ineffective. There is no way to filter results and no way to exclude videos you've already watched. There is some soothing piano music playing in the background, but the interface itself is rather unsightly. Overall for $1.00 its hard to be too bothered by this disappointment. I'm not going to give the game a pass on mediocrity simply because it cost barely any money. \n\nIts BOOOORING. I'm not some teenager with ADHD, I enjoy slow burn games that parse out tons of lore and details. But Her Story does so in the most bland and monotonous way, my eyes began watering as I steeled myself to withstand the deluge of short clips, each one chipping away at your resolve to push on.

Of course that's neither positive or negative, it's a rather abstract description but I feel that's what fits this experience best.  \n\nThe concept is exciting. It doesn't seem to fit any established genre, it relies too heavily on player input that it can't predict or script to be a traditional 'Interactive Movie' or 'Walking Simulator'. But on the flipside that player input doesn't have the depth or range of a 'Point and Click' game. It's singular in it's execution and is exciting for that reason.\n\nUnfortunately that execution is flawed. There are ways to essentially 'break' the game right from the start without ever intending to. It's possible uncover crucial information at the beginning, rendering continued play meaningless. There is no fail state and even the concept of an end is ambiguous to the player. Basically if you approach it like a traditional game with a system that you should be able to exploit, you will be able to and that doesn't sit right with the concept. To get the full, intended experience you need to put yourself in the shoes of the players character, but as by nature you're not given any incite into the character the natural instinct is to 'play' this like a traditional video game. In doing so you lose the intended impact, essentially robbing yourself of the only reason to play this game.\n\nI've had a fascinating experience with it and I highly recommend it. It is flawed, yes, but it's execution is so new, so interesting and individual that it's worth experiencing if just to open your mind to the potential of this medium to tell a story.\n\nI would recommend that you go into this imagining that the character you are playing as is a junior detective or something similar, something to ground you in the idea, and act, of uncovering a mystery you know nothing about. Then when further into the game i'd recommend that you imagine your character is just 'investigating' this for their own enjoyment per se, there is no reason to, they just saw something or maybe remembered something from the past and finally had access to this system. In that way you will able to choose when to 'finish' the game based on when your own personal satisfaction is reached, not when you've 'won', as there is no real end to it, you choose when this ends. Going into this knowing that and creating that idea will help with the worst aspect of this game which is the fact that by design it has no end.

By latching on to words or phrases, you discover new lines of inquiry and piece together the circumstances behind the murder and interviews.\n\nI was very impressed with how free form the game is - there is nothing stopping you from typing in random words and pulling up twists from an early search, as I did, but the design and writing meant I was just burning to figure out the context and meaning. Each player's path is sure to be unique, as I've found discussing other people's experience with the game, but again the design and writing means that it will always be enjoyable. There is no definite win-state - at a certain point you'll be notified you can leave when you're satisfied, but that's always up to you.\n\nThe game is a brilliant showcase of player freedom and non-traditional game structure, which makes it a definite buy for those interested in game design or detective mysteries.", "timestamp_created": 1576196663, "timestamp_updated": 1576305304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751899361610412598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59705909": {"recommendationid": "59705909", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998851375", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1577012003}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely an interesting mystery game. You search through the archives of some old police interviews of.... some woman named Hannah? Things aren't very clear at first - or ever, really - because you can't just freely view the videos. You have to search for them, by guessing what words Hannah will say. The archive will only cough up the first five videos in a given search criteria, and there's no easy way to put them in order.\n\nSo, you're forced to play connect-the-dots, find key words and search for them to figure out what Hannah's deal is. Definitely cool! It's a good exercise in connected ideas, thinking about what kinds of words are important or significant or likely to get us further results.\n\nUnfortunately, the achievements asking me to try for 100% encouraged me to play long after the fun had worn away. It came to a point where I was just trying every word I could think of, until I finally just gave up and looked up a walkthrough so I could see those last bits. (I still don't know the proper way to get some of the clips, even now) And, at the end of the day, it sure would be nice to be able to view the whole thing in a simple, coherent order, all at once. But then, I suppose that would be counter to the idea in the first place.\n\nIs Her Story a good game? Yes, I think so. I'm glad I played it, but also, I'm glad I only spent $1 on it. It took me under 6 hours to do everything 100%, and I'm not sure the mystery alone is worth $10. I don't know, it's a toss-up at that price. But I love the concept.

So whatever final score you're seeing on the game, just let it be known that this is one of my top recommended games anyway. The gameplay loop revolves around navigating an old police system using a search bar - and finding clip after clip. You search \"murder\" - 5 clips show up. Say you hear \"Glasgow\" said in one of them, you search that -> 5 more show up. This makes for a very engaging treasure hunt for the story. No game has done this before I think, and it gets a +1 for that alone. It takes the concept of what gameplay can be and twists it completely from the waist up. Play it simply for the unique experience. It's a few hours anyway.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Narrative[/td]\n        [td] 10 (Creative ways of storytelling like this is what truly differentiate games from other mediums. A story that I was supposed to unravel and interpret based on my own understanding and pace. The game ends when I want it to end, while there is definitely a point where you can end the game - I'd recommend going through all the clips to know everything. Fucking brilliant.) [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Visuals[/td]\n        [td]7 (The aesthetic is going for a Windows 95 PC vibe or something, examining the clips in a police record with firmware that has clearly not been updated in ages. The game features real-life clips for the most part anyway, so the visuals they're aiming for are definitely reached. There is an option to make it more realistic with the reflection effects where you can literally see your character occasionally. Overall, really good visuals and they reach the visual direction they were going for.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mechanics[/td]\n        [td]-[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Challenge [/td]\n        [td]8 (There is no mechanical challenge in the game at all, and it is one of the very few games I can say that about that I still thoroughly enjoyed and felt challenged by. I usually want there to be a mechanical or mental challenge in any game I play, while the narrative acting as something that enhances the experience. But here, uncovering the narrative WAS the challenge and it surprised me in ways that I wouldn't have thought of before playing the game. Whether it was decoding the tap language by learning it through YouTube tutorials, or follow up clue after clue to reach the truth - this was an extremely unique kind of challenge but a challenge whatsoever.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Variety[/td]\n        [td]8 (There is a lot of flexibility in which sequence you watch the clips - and that can change your journey completely compared to mine - even if we reach the same conclusions. Or maybe we don't? The story leaves just enough ends open so that you know what happened but also are left with some questions all up to interpretation. A +1 for that.)

The voice acting by the actress was very good. She was able to portray [spoiler] characters of both the twins in a very good manner. How they're trying to be similar but are also different is well-acted. You notice that when you are rewatching some of the clips to pick up on things you missed the first time around.[/spoiler])[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Interface[/td]\n        [td]5 (The interface left a lot to be desired. Like the DB manager should allow you to access visited clips directly. There is no reason to stop a player from being able to access a clip they've already watched right? I used to add every clip I watched to the little list below that allowed me to keep track and backtrack to them whenever I wanted. But a better interface could definitely have made a lot of difference and made the player focus on the things that actually matter without having to struggle with slight annoyances.)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Replay Value [/td]\n        [td]6 (This game is surely )[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]SCORE : 7.8/10[/b]\n\n[url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hU-EeIPXVLoEmwcIPggkGa5bfc3ykvTxWwgTty-7Unw/edit#gid=0] Full list of Rated Games.

Maybe it's that I feel like a voyeur peering into someone else's life, or perhaps it's the idea of dealing with real people rather than pixelated sprites, but I'm loving the fact that FMV is making a come back and Her Story is right at the front of the charge. \n\nThis is a game that takes no time to learn, but keeps you wrapped with morbid curiosity for hours as you untangle a web of confusion and possible deception through only one character who changes from one day to the next. \n\nIt's not a spoiler to say that there is more to our witness being interviewed than we might first suspect,  but even that is only the beginning of the puzzle. You will have to figure out how to search for the right keywords, and then piece together the story in true detective fashion to help it make sense, if sense can be made of it. \n\nThere are some barriers to make it more challenging, such as the limit on how many videos you can find at one time, but there is a helpful bar you can use to queue clips of interest. \n\nThe only flaws I felt the game had were that it ends in a clumsy fashion and there is no option to view the entire story from start to finish after you've kind of figured out what happened. I still don't fully understand, but I'm happy not knowing. So much was revealed that made me curious and sometimes it ruins a story to get all the ins and outs of it. \n\nWell done on another FMV beauty. Please make more.

Don't try to brute force yourself to a solution, instead follow the breadcrumbs that the designers have carefully laid out for you. There is no real 'endpoint' to the game; it's finished when you feel your curiosity is quenched. To me, this moment was surprisingly clear: even though I hadn't found 100% of the database, I could tell the story from beginning to end and that did it for me. The 'revelation' at the end confirmed my feelings even more.\n\nThe story is excellent and lends itself very well to the concept of the game. Despite the fact that you (in theory) have access to the entire database right from the start, there is hardly a way to 'spoil' the game for yourself. Each clip by itself is not enough to reveal the full story and even if you manage to stumble upon a crucial clip in the very beginning, you will find yourself wondering even more about the underlying motives and background stories. \n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this game, but please look at it for what it is and don't let your expectations of what a 'game' has to be misguide you.

Initially, I was skeptical of the FMV-style mystery and assumed it would get really boring just watching a person talk to a camera for hours, but I was captivated the whole way through. \n\nThis game mechanic is simple: it allows you to search through video records of several recorded interview by way of keywords. Watch a few videos, jot down words that sound interesting--a street name, a person, a bar--or even ones that don't, like objects or days of the week. If a keyword is mentioned in a video, that video will appear in the search--but you can only get the top 5-6 most relevant videos at a time, so sometimes, you need to be more specific.\n\nThe restriction on only being able to see the top few videos makes it so you can't unlock the story too fast. Generally, that's really effective, but there are definitely some cases where it's darn near impossible to get a video to surface without knowing exactly what you're looking for. But, fortunately, most of those videos aren't essential for unlocking the game's mystery, so you don't need to view everything unless you're a completionist.\n\nI also didn't love that you could save videos in sequence, but that it was nearly impossible to keep them organized. I would have loved if I could have put everything in order from start to finish, then watched it all at the end, but the design of the game made it impossible. However, I [i]did[/i] like that it really feels like you're watching videos on antiquated machines in the basement of some dusty old police station. Between the weird search mechanic, the look of the screen, and the limited functionality of the program, it's definitely immersive. \n\nAs for the story, it's bound to get any curious clicker excited: we have a missing person mystery! And there seems to be one woman at the center of all of it. But how involved is she? Is she guilty? Is there more to the story? \n\nI love that this game tells the kind of story that has you believing early on that you 100% have it figured out, but as you discover more and more, keeps making you realize things may run deeper than they initially seemed.
