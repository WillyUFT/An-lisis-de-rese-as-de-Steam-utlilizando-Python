Please keep that in mind when I say this is a step down from the first game in basically every possible way.\n\n-Assumes you've played the handheld side game, refuses to explain itself.\n-Combat is repetitive and limited, thanks to overly frequent enemy respawns, the inability to run past most fights, and overly aggressive enemies with too many ranged and unblockable attacks forcing you to give up on any sort of long fancy combo and resort to basic attack hit and run tactics.\n-It feels like there are less bosses, and most aren't very good. Toy Maker is the obvious exception, that fight absolutely ruled.\n-In a bizarre reversal, bosses are by far the easiest part of game, mainly because you don't have to deal with hordes of scrubs like you normally do and can actually make full use of the combat system.\n-Stealth isn't just unfun, the STEALTH FEELS WRONG. You're f***ing Dracula, Satan himself hid in a hole for 1000 years cowering at the mere thought of facing you, why are you hiding from Resident Evil enemies?\n-Not only is the Agreus stealth section the worst in the game, it's immediately followed by a boss fight where you kill him, making it completely pointless.\n-The city feels like Arkham Asylum, a bizarre tonal mismatch, except of course when it feels like every generic modern day city you've ever explored in a thousands other games.\n-The claws are useless, the sword isn't much better, their reach is just too short.\n-No overall map in a game trying to be an open world Metroidvania.

A bloody, brutal journey through the mind of Dracula and Castlevania City. A piece of perfect entertainment for me. After watching series on Netflix, it gets even better. I would like Alucard to be my boyfriend someday even though I am a boy myself. In the series he agreed to a threesome with another man and a woman, so maybe he wouldn't mind me. Overall, the appearance of the castle, demons and bosses is impressive. Toy Maker, Inner Dracula and Gorgon's Sister were terrifying and nicely animated. To be honest, I was a bit bothered by how similar the gameplay was to God of War from the older games. I was wondering if it was because of the genre or if there was no idea for it or the gameplay system from the games with Kratos was the most suitable. However, this did not turn out to be so problematic during the game because, as I wrote earlier, the gameplay is addictive and the game is good. The world of Castlevania itself is incredibly interesting and I would like to explore it more often, so I hope that apart from crossovers with other metroidvanias, we will see a game from the original Castlevania again someday.

But u need to play it on controller. U have to be patient to actually find every secret and master every skill oh boi. \nThe whole game got fabulous story about vengeance of Gabriel ala Dracula ! But actually of that vengeance we are trying to save our world of mankind once again.\nBosses fights are awesome with animations even thought they just have a simple attacks that u can easily dodge parry and counter but sometimes u just can't and that's reason why u have your void sword which is capable of getting your life back I mean hitpoints and there is chaos claws which is burning damage to those who have enough armor to easily don't get normal hit that's why u used them and actually they are doing bonus damage like x2 normal so u would love to use em.\nSkills there are a lot of em and I mean to actully master your mastery lvl with enm will give you almost 3 hours in straight grinding combat with spawning some devils. I love some of em are very powerful and U'll be using them with pleasure. \nCutscenes there are a lot of them and Ure not gonna skip any of them only those which they will show u how the map looks to reach your goal so then u'll be skipping them.\nSound/music lovely symphonic calm heart warming and enjoyable. \nMaps are actually pretty bad cuz of that quick travel u can do it in real world to the other half of the map but u cannot do it to dracula world and this happens there too. U will be using some wolf medalion to travel through worlds. But the thing is it is quite hard to remember all those places to go and from where to where. \nThat has been maden to bad I think not quite known to me even after 50+ hours. \n\n The missing part is that there is no arena mod and I mean not those Kleidos challenges cuz they are fcking too hard so fcking maaaan. I mean some kind of waves cleaning maps cuz I felt like playing this 10 hours and there is not much climbing not as much fight. Is I was doing a mastery ma weapons at the end of the game that says to u clearly that there is no much fight. Lots of cutscenes actually are making this game so enjoyable <3 I love the whole story it is so satanic and christian at the same time so lovely.

Everything that Lords of Shadow did poorly, this game improved and everything that Lords of Shadow did well was removed. Gone is the polish and the cinematic storytelling replace with a pretty fun Castlevania game straight out of the PS2 era.\n\nThe combat is arguably stronger than the first game now that you have a free-control camera and Dracula's improved air control. Everything has been rebalanced and tweaked to feel more like a beat 'em up rather than hardcore combat mastery. My life bar on hard mode here, lasted as long as easy mode on the first game and the magic meters were equally generous. \n\nWhere things get trickier is that QTEs were replaced with magic required kills such as armor that can only be broken with chaos magic or killing blows that can only be performed with light magic. These feel far more natural and faster paced than the first game... but introduce a frustrating reliance on magic and identifying which special move the designers expected you to trigger.\n\nNearly all of the bosses have unlimited spawning minions because its the only way to charge your mana, which is required to actually finish the boss. The bosses were absolutely cooler and more varied in this game, but I really never felt the satisfaction I did in the first game. The QTEs were dumb, but I almost preferred them when I ran out of magic.\n\nBy end-game even normal enemies had armor that required chaos magic to kill and maintaining that meter was Tedious.\n\nBut the tedium was just beginning.  \n\nThis game tried to mimic a 3D metroidvania where you could explore a couple wide-open maps looking for upgrades and unlockable art. But the fast travel was absolutely atrocious... and ultimately lead me to give up on exploring. \n\nThe problem is that there is two forms of fast travel and they are spread out all over heck and creation. So to get from A to B I need to:\n - Walk 15 rooms to a \"Map Room\" which only lets me get to Areas D, E and F.\n - From Area D I need to navigate these 9 rooms of deathtraps and wall climbing puzzles to reach wolf medallion that brings me to area C (Since you cant choose the destination of these fast travel points)\n - From Area C I need to walk 12 rooms back to the shop in B. \n\n  Keep in mind, there is 2-3 cutscenes for EACH time you travel. YAY! \n\nBut at the end of the day I really loved the first half of the game and I enjoyed the experience as a whole. I liked the direction they took the lore, I liked the feeling of growth as you unlocked powers, and I liked the combat when I wasn't forced to beg for magic or health.  If this was the first lords of shadow game I played, I'd have been first in line for the sequel.\n\nI'd call this a legit decent Castlevania game, but an absolutely dreadful Lords of Shadow game.

Almost 23 hours for my first playthrough and no regrets.[/b]\n\u2007\n\u2007\n[i](Spoiler free story wise, does describe aspects of the game)[/i]\u2007\nMy experience of this game as you've already read is mixed. If I had to rate this game out of 10 it would be something like 7/10 but that doesn't really express how I feel about the game so this review is gonna be dissected into pros and cons.\n\n[b]Good things that stuck:[/b]\nStrong start right into the action. I had played the beginning of the game way back when I was younger and it felt so great and nostalgic to play it again. The intro is so lovely and I would say one of the best parts of the game.\nThe world building and atmosphere in this game is one of its biggest strengths. It is such a key element that it single-handedly makes the game still relevant to this day. At the same time while the map is very huge and everything connects to each other almost making it an open world it is insanely detailed and full of stuff to find and see.\nA lot of collectables and side content, from trials and bonus areas to collectables, items and upgrades it makes you want to take every step carefully and fully explore the entire game.\nThis also helps immersing you into the game and enjoy its beautiful visuals and locations. The graphics are especially impressive and good looking for its time and can still be enjoyable even today.\nIf you're into Gothic themes, this is a perfect game for you. The solid variety of enemies and enemy designs, paired with great characters, immerses you in a dark and mysterious world that feels truly Gothic in every aspect.\nWhile playing, I made an effort to miss as little stuff as possible resulting in my first playthrough being almost 23 hours, and I still didn't manage to fully complete everything in the game. Maybe one day I'll go back and try to 100% the game.\nIt was relatively fun the whole way through particularly every boss felt exciting and the gameplay overall was satisfying and fun. Mostly because of the main mechanics surrounding the combat and your selection of weapons and powers.\nBut here's where it starts to feel icky, maybe more if you're sensitive to stuff like this and it really bothers you. I myself tolerated a good amount but never really irritated me.\n\n[b]Not so good things that stuck:[/b]\nThe combat is very easy and overall pretty simple. I wouldn't say basic because the gameplay has its depths but definitely god of war level of difficulty.\nThe parry system specifically being the most important mechanic to keep the combat together is very awkward and effortless. The input if I remember correctly is the same input as rolling/dodging but you have be neutral on the joystick. Also the quick get up mechanic after getting hit threw me off and I didn't get used to it through the whole game.\nThe dialogue in general was mostly okay and not very noteworthy. Some parts were a bit average, some parts kinda bad and some handful of parts were absolutely brilliant. It was really boring and underwhelming towards the end.\nNotably the game's climax, the final boss felt unfinished. They wanted to do something special for the ending but it kinda felt underwhelming and drawn-out.\n\nOverall the game felt Inspired and pretty special and I had a lovely time playing it even though it wasn't perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1691028853, "timestamp_updated": 1694994398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143275700": {"recommendationid": "143275700", "author": {"steamid": "76561199227355800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1691298015}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nashe\n", "timestamp_created": 1690999911, "timestamp_updated": 1690999911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143219700": {"recommendationid": "143219700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144916234", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1699163302}, "language": "spanish", "review": "de todos los Castlevania que he jugado este es mi favorito, incluyendo los dos anteriores juegos de esta gran historia, su banda sonora es hermosa, encaja con su gameplay y su historia. <3", "timestamp_created": 1690916724, "timestamp_updated": 1690916724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143002609": {"recommendationid": "143002609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110559103", "num_games_owned": 2086, "num_reviews": 237, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1690692879}, "language": "english", "review": "everything is a million times better than the ps2 LOS 1 horrible game, no wonder this one have more positive reviews, very user friendly, very fun to play as well, no more stupid fixed camera and QTE", "timestamp_created": 1690613511, "timestamp_updated": 1690613682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491812437772750854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142999490": {"recommendationid": "142999490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000131976", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2155, "last_played": 1422681386}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun, versatile (think a lighter version of DMC5) and a tragic story,", "timestamp_created": 1690608317, "timestamp_updated": 1690608317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142993493": {"recommendationid": "142993493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126401407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 715, "last_played": 1690743181}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\"I am the dragon, Dracul!

At its best this game is good, but for the most part of its 20ish-hour runtime it is simply fine. It is easily my least favourite game in the trilogy. \n\n[b]Note[/b] this review is very negative, but I did enjoy myself enough to recommend the game to other people. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nMany years have passed since [i]Mirror of Fate[/i], and Dracula has now woken up in the future, the year is in the late 2050s, and his old friend offers a deal. Stop Satan\u2019s return and be free from immortality. \nThis is the main conflict within the game, Satan versus Dracula, but there is also the struggle between Dracula and Gabriel Belmont. Both of these are fine on their own but prefer one of these over the other, however, the way the two of them are handled together cheapens both of them.\n\nYou will be spending hours in the City on one objective only for the game to abruptly force you into Dracula\u2019s Castle to deal with something else, typically rewarding you with an item you need to progress. This, the constant interruption of cutscenes, and certain gameplay elements removes any sense of urgency, and ruins the pace of the game.   \nI certainly like a number of things that happen, I think a lot of the cutscenes have nice perspectives, there are some cool callbacks to previous games, and I did find myself caring about what happened, despite the corny dialogue. But that does not mean that I think the story was told properly, overall, I am rather disappointed.\n\n[h1] Presentation [/h1] \nOut of all the [i]Lords of Shadow[/i] games this is the one with the best visuals, the textures, the light, the shadow, it all works quiet well together, and this gets accentuated in a lot of cutscenes. At its best it feels like it could have been taken from a movie, if you omit certain things. \nOne of the things I enjoyed the most was a very short, but beautiful section involving a puppet theatre where most aspect of the game seems to come together and give you a glimpse of how good the game could have been.  \n\nOn the other hand, we have the designs, some of it is on the generic side. Take the demons as an example, some of their designs are not distinct enough from each other, and at a glance it can seem that the only thing that separates them is their scale, which is not factual, but it feels true which is the problem.  \nThere are also the futuristic designs, I do not mind them since the game is supposed to take place in the future, and since there were some precedent set by [i]Lords of Shadow 1[/i], but I am also not very fond of them. The only designs I really like belong to bosses. \n\nHowever, there are also issues with some of the sounds in this game, mostly they are fine, some might be stock sound effects (I believe I have heard them in other games), and then there are a few that are grating to the ears. The worst of the worst is the Vampires\u2019 sonic attack, save me please, because it is doing more damage to me than to Dracula. \n\nLuckily the music is good, maybe not as good as previous games, but still, and it is the same returning composer. I would argue that the orchestral music mostly evokes a sense of nostalgia, and longing which is appropriate. But there are also some tracks with a more modern feel, I did not like them too much, but they are certainly a good fit for the City areas. \n\nOn the voice acting, we have some returning talent, such as the two from the post-credit scene in [i]Lords of Shadow 1[/i], and a few others. Personally, I think that the voice acting on the whole is a step back, it felt as though they were less emotive, and some felt like they were just reading from the script. But then there are also scenes that make me think it is as good as the previous instalment at its best, so I guess you can blame the allegedly troubled development. \nOn another note, dear god, these bosses are never quiet. The bosses shout taunt after taunt after taunt, to such an extent that whether not it is well written or acted does not matter, and they only have two or three lines! It gets really annoying, surely the fights make up for it?\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n[i]Lords of Shadow 2[/i] is structured more like a metroidvania than the first instalment, areas are gated behind abilities or story events, but it is still very linear.  If you see an area, you cannot access yet, chances are that it is a mandatory area or that it is a dead-end with a collectible. \nThe game does allow backtracking at basically anytime, but it is not without issues as the plot usually teleports you between the City and the Castle during cutscenes. Sometimes these triggers at your leisure, but in others it is just by entering a room you have to pass through. I only mention this since it is related to another issue. You can only move between the City and the Castle at specific locations, and you can only fast travel to and from specific rooms, these can be far away from one another which adds a layer of tedium to exploration. Another issue is how small each area, and they are all surrounded by loading screens, meaning you will have to pass through quite a while of loading whenever you want to move between areas.  \n\nDid you know that this game has forced stealth sections? Did you know that this game has forced rat sections? Both of these are bad, and they are the first thing you will be doing after the prologue, have fun.\nAnother decision that is perplexing is the implementation of QTEs, these can be disabled, but why does it take two different buttons to spin a cylinder when most bosses are finished off by the press of a single one? Why not give the players the fun QTEs to finish of enemies but leave the one where you turn a crank? \n\n[h2]Combat[/h2]\nIf you are familiar with either of the previous [i]Lords of Shadow[/i] games, you will know what to expect. You have three weapons, two types of basic attacks, you can block or dodge attacks, you have sub-weapons, and you have magic. \nWhile the three weapons share broadly the same combos, they feel vastly different on account of the effects they have, their speed, and their reach. However, a problem arises with the [i]mastery[/i] system. \nIt works like this, you use combos and that increases their proficiency, when you are proficient with enough combos you increase the [i]mastery[/i] which can be done twice for each weapon. As an idea this works fine and is a nice reward for using a weapon a lot, but in praxis it feels a bit tedious. Some people will not be bothered by it, but I am, as I found myself constantly checking my progress to see what combo I needed to use to gain that tiny bit of extra damage. The system would have been better if the [i]mastery[/i] always progressed when you used a weapon but with diminishing returns for proficient combos, but that is not what we have. \n\nAs for how combat actually plays, well it is fine, enemies are typically just tough enough so that they do not take too long to kill, and also do a fair amount of damage on higher difficulties. It is just that the roster feels a bit samey with several foes intruding on each other\u2019s niches, and there being too many ranged enemies. Nevertheless, it is fun, quite satisfying to finish off enemies, or to turn them into gore with magic. \nHowever\u2026 the tedium arrives with all the armour and shields, it feels like I can hardly pass a room without encountering them. Sure, you do not need magic to deal with them, but it is the preferred method, and when there are this many of them it becomes more an annoyance than a consideration for combat. \n", "timestamp_created": 1688398075, "timestamp_updated": 1688398075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60000002384185791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141205625": {"recommendationid": "141205625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347506723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1689510752}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game but please unban Lord of Shadow Ultimate 2010 in south africa i would to buy and play it", "timestamp_created": 1688382120, "timestamp_updated": 1688382120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141170510": {"recommendationid": "141170510", "author": {"steamid": "76561199061169052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 647, "last_played": 1688335588}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hay Dr\u00e1cula, hay buena rese\u00f1a", "timestamp_created": 1688335631, "timestamp_updated": 1688335631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141073667": {"recommendationid": "141073667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054950047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 715, "last_played": 1688238166}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Mucho mejor para m\u00ed que su primera entrega.

There's a floating temple in the City of the Damned map that's so beautiful, it's frame-able. This is offset by how much backtracking one has to do--there's not an easy way to get around the map. Places are meant to be revisited, and the modern/medieval ferrying they do in the game give the player some option to change scenery when one gets boring or frustrating, and there is a map room that allows fast travel (to other map rooms). But you still wind up hoofing it quite a lot (unless I'm just doing it wrong). This is rather tedious and not fun, especially for the inclusion of the following:\n\nAdd to that the respawns that ambush the player all the time that, in many instances, cannot be bypassed, locking you in with them gladiator arena-style. If you try to leave the fight with the jump-climb gimmick that is used extensively to explore, the enemies theatrically shoot you down and force you to fight with them. That's a big \"f- you\" from the game and really irritating when you're just trying to get around.\n\nAdd to that the tedium of the fights themselves. Look--some people like the combo-input, button-mashing style of gameplay, so I can't bash that as a fault, although that isn't my thing. But the huge weapon swipes and long hit stops and lighting effects and explosions and dramatic sounds that accompany all the attacks are completely nullified by the fact that everything takes over a hundred hits to kill. It's really quite emasculating. I don't know why games keep doing it, except that people are just sensory-adapted and need bigger, louder explosions more often to be entertained. There are some combat mechanics that I thought were good ideas and sensible to implement--like enemies guarding, requiring a guard breaker move--but the wind-up for the guard breaker (or any technical move/combo) is so big that enemies usually punish you for attempting them, especially when there are three of them, which there usually are. I just found the fighting to all feel very spammy and annoying. Not too difficult--just annoying. Tedious. It's like chewing on a piece of fat. I wanted to play the game like it seemed it was meant to me, but I never felt like I had the chance, or like there was ever a reason to stray from the safety of light attack/dodge moves available since the beginning of the game.\n\nSome of the music was/is incredibly beautiful, and some of it is just clever and really adds character to the scene (the rat music was great!). The problem is that there aren't a lot of tracks, and they're playing constantly, which de-values their effect and, after a while, makes them grow old. That's sad, because they really are beautiful songs, some of them. This could be easily remedied by only playing music when something is going on--not while wasting time backtracking through a tedious map with few shortcuts and constantly being held captive by tedious fights.\n\nI was worried about the film actor voice overs being distracting, but found they fit in very nicely--except for El Chupacabra. They did a good job with the art and animation of this annoying, comedic relief character; but the voice acting, with all due respect to the actor, is embarrassing to listen to, bad to the point of distraction. Someone in the other room heard me playing the game and commented on how bad it was. A hundred other actors would eagerly have smashed that role, and they shouldn't have settled for how bad the acting was, not with their budget. The game has been out for a while now, and they will probably never replace the voice, like they wisely did in the English voice overs of, say, Blasphemous. \n\nO, and let me give a special shout out to the Agreus maze mission. Insta-death stealth missions are the worst, especially in a game that isn't built out around stealth--they're why I couldn't finish playing The Order. Done right, this mission takes, like, 5 minutes--but it is so infuriating trying to get it right, I almost bailed completely on the game at this mission. That, and the inappropriate use of apostrophe--it should be, \"Agreus's,\" not, \"Agreus'.\" English is hard, I know, but come on. \"Agreus\" isn't plural, and it shouldn't end in an apostrophe. I'd overlook that if I didn't have to see it over and over and over when I had to restart the mission. But there it is, the wrong usage of s-apostrophe, welcoming me back to one of the most infuriating game experiences in gaming history (I mean that, and this is coming from a FromSoft veteran). \n\nThis game was almost great, and a lot of really excellent artists and devs were on the project; but its flaws, its shortcomings, its nuisances, stacked on top of and combining with each other made waste of its virtues.

(I love the City of the Damned for example!)\n+ the cityscapes of Castlevania City can be very gothic and beautiful, with huge, beautiful statues, towering architecture, and little details everywhere, but most of the time their layout makes absolutely no sense\n+ the opening of this game is very very strong, both visually and thematically, and the parts in the past, inside the castle are great\n+ basically, the environments are very nice and epic\n+ the boss and enemy designs are great as always\n+ there's much more to do here, than in the first one, which was basically a very linear game\n+ the fighting is responsive and if you come from the first two games, or any other game of this type (old God of War games, Devil May Cry's, etc.), you'll feel right at home\n+ the relics, powers, and movesets are really cool, and feel familiar, yet a bit refreshed\n+ there's just one chupacabra this time, and instead of being an annoying little **it, he's actually pretty helpful with his little shop (although, makes absolutely no sense... think about it: who's buying anything except Dracula himself?)\n+ the enemies are varied and interesting\n+ I really liked the Toy Maker part\n+ some of the scenes are quite memorable...\n\nTHE BAD:\n- ... but EVERYTHING in this game is sooooo over-the-top, like literally every shot is like a Michael Bay collaboration with Uwe Boll... they're trying to go for epic, and instead achieve cringy\n- even Alucard's design is over-the-top and looks almost nothing like the one from Mirror of Fate - he's got a triple six-pack here for crying out loud xD\n- the fighting mechanics are very similar to the ones in the first LoS, but this time the enemies won't stop spamming unblockable attacks, and attack you like crazy all the time in general, this makes Dracula fly around like a tennis ball being bounced from enemy, to enemy, making him look like an utter fool, not The Prince of Darkness... there's very little window to attack, and I found that the basic moves are better at hitting anything than the special combos you unlock, because, well... you will always be interrupted whenever you try to use a combo... I know that in both LoS and MoF it was also very easy to get hit, but come on! This makes the core mechanic very tedious when you can die to the weakest mobs\n- on the other hand, while the bosses are nicely designed, they are soooo much easier than the regular enemies, to the point of being child's play-level of insulting\n- the story is all over the place with conflicting moods, which break your investment in anything what's happening\n- a lot of the modern-day locations are just boring, not because they're badly designed, but because they're... well... modern...\n- many mechanics sound interesting in theory, but end up being extremely underwhelming, like the mist, bat and rat powers\n- the game felt a lot more like Batman Arkham than Castlevania, I **it you not!\n- the Void Sword and Chaos Claws are here to replace the Light and Dark Magic from the first LoS and MoF, but end up very uncomfortable to use. They just have too short of a range\n- the story of MoF is explained after the prologue, but - aside from Alucard himself - there's little connecting the two games; in fact, it seems like MoF is being ignored altogether, by basically changing the way Alucard feels about Dracula by 180 degrees\n- the ending is very, very underwhelming and out of character, is Dracula good all of a sudden?\n- the final fight is also very underwhelming\n- somehow they managed to make Satan look even more laughable, than in the first LoS \ud83e\udd23\n- there is a DLC, but to me, it feels overpriced, and I'm not gonna shell out money on it, to find out some tacked on stuff about Alucard. I think while the DLC for LoS is mandatory, and playing MoF is really advised, here, I don't even want to buy it\n\nTHE UGLY:\n~ the whole Agreus segment and those weird sneaking segments in general, are just aggravating and nonsensical\n\nOverall, if you liked the Lords of Shadow timeline, and this one is in a deep, deep sale, then give it a spin. It has some nice moments to it (mostly those taking place in the past), but overall I would advise to play Mirror of Fate instead.

I've played all the Castlevania games since the first one came out and may be in the minority on this, but I think these are great successors to the past games.

I even feel, especially Lords of Shadow 2, that the art may be the best of it's generation. I find the story a particularly beautiful tragedy as Gabriel has to give up everything and damn himself to keep a greater evil at bay, and in the 2nd game even has to have his loyal followers, (enemies from past Castlevania games), turn on him while his descendants are trying to destroy him at the same time. Honestly, the stealth isn't as bad as people like to say it is. I found those sections very brief in comparison.  If you're an old school Castlevania fan and appreciate the same things that I've written about, do yourself a favor and get the trilogy of games here, although Mirror of Fate was more of a tech demo for 3ds IMO. Castlevania has always been about pulpy Gothic horror mixed with vampire and monster slaying action and these games do that style justice. If you don't like it, sucks for you.

"playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1682857235}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome to my overly long ramble about the latest game in a series I love that is very super dead at the moment, and I hope it stays that way because I do not want Konami to touch this franchise until they are redeemed. I am familiar with this game despite my short playtime on steam.\n\nTo get the first one out of the way, the story is very mediocore and a very unsatisfying end to the Lords of Shadow series, but it has a few fun parts to it by the very end.\nHaving mentioned that, the game has great cutscene and in game camera direction, the enviroments are impressive and the art direction overall is great.\nThe sound design is very satisfying, hits are loud and gritty, any sound effect that comes from an object is well done and the music does its job, although nothing truly remarkable in my opinion.\n\nAs for the gameplay, many people will make the comparison to old God of War when talking about this game and the entire trilogy of these games. The comparison on a surface level would be accurate. Very cinematic experience full of over the top set pieces, huge epic enviroments, soft character action like combat against mobs of enemies and memorable bossfights (mostly I guess). When it comes to the combat however this one has a few unique quirks.\n\nThis game, just like the previous two, revolve around you using one button for single target oriented attacks called direct attacks, and mostly circular aoe moves called area attacks. There is absolutely no combo system between the two, as each button has its own series of attacks executed during repeated presses, and if you press the other then  you switch to its basic combo instead. What the game does is give you combinations between holding the attack button down to get a different attack, combining it with the guard button for something bigger and 3 unique weapons to switch between, each having slight range and speed differences, the latter not too much. The game however has an interesting twist to it that can give you incentive for creativity, which is that you can cancel any of your attacks into a guard, meaning you can get a bit creative with transitions between your different weapon attacks if you want to be a bit more stylish. However the game doesn't have anything else beyond that to make it into a more interesting experience for fans of character action games like DMC or Bayonetta, and instead focuses on a very simple combat loop that results from the weapon effects, which to specify: The Void Sword has a life steal effect while the Chaos Claws break enemy guard and are effective against shields. Enemy variety revolves around these concepts, and generally speaking the encounters are not too repetitive, but there is barely any truly interesting enemies or mini bosses worth remembering.\n\nOne true downside to the combat however, is the fact that there seems to be barely any (and I'm being generous with that since I think there is actually none) invincibility frames on your dodges or movement tools, making it so that when the enemny does an attack you either turtle it out by timing your guard button to get a slowdown that lets you retaliate, like a flashy parry, or you have to run away very far from them so you don't get clipped by their hitboxes. This mostly affects you if you are trying to play the game more aggressively through frantic movement, but it becomes an actual issue with certain bizarre enemy placements in small areas. Having limited dodging options makes the combat a little more dull for me personally, but I believe that it would make things better for everyone due to certain small details like unblockable moves from enemies having absurd tracking unless you dodge at the last moment allowing no preemptive movements and on the fly stategies and instead making come encounters feel like slugfests, making it so that you never truly feel powerful through skill. Just be patient and you win eventually.\n\nA more general weakness of the game is its 'real world' sections, combined with its stealth setpieces which aren't anything special or offensive, just passable for me. Though some would tear the game apart just for these, and I cannot blame them myself. The dark city enviroments are not very interesting to look at, and due to the game's lore they combine certain aesthetical parts of medieval fantasy through statues and extravagant towers into the areas, making you question where you even are often times. It meshes badly with the main character himself as well, as you are controlling the legendary Dracula himself who for some reason is unable to climb through a fence. When you are in Dracula's castle however the game truly shines with vast and unique areas that showcase the bizarre and complicated anatomy of the castle. The game has a lot of great touches like soldier diaries that are basically POV memories of people who died trying to take down Dracula, and you get to see how they felt and dealt with the same enemies you do in the game, or the various hazards and platforms you come across, giving you more insight into the castle itself and the dangers of the monsters in it. When it comes to the lore in general the game has a ton of thought put into it and tries its best to make the experience more immersive, and for me it succeeds.\n\nIn an nutshell, it is a game that was clearly made with a lot of care, having some truly impressive presentation. Moment to moment gameplay  by platforming and combat that feels satisfying and fun, despite the lack of depth and some rare frustrating elements. The story should not be taken seriously though, unfortunately it is not very compelling despite its potential with the setting. Overall the game got a very bad reputation when it came out, press reviews were not very kind and fans of the Castlevania franchise were mixed on it, but I think the game is actually very good, deserving more praise for what it does well instead of hate for what it misses. Very high highs and very low lows I would say.", "timestamp_created": 1682871239, "timestamp_updated": 1682871239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539408862590789795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137398065": {"recommendationid": "137398065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001116787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 699, "last_played": 1682708013}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Despu\u00e9s de una primera parte SOBRESALIENTE, esta segunda parte se queda, por desgracia, en un notable. Merece la pena jugarlo si te gust\u00f3 el 1, pero ve con las expectativas bajas y con acopio de paciencia. \n\nAhora un an\u00e1lisis un poco m\u00e1s en profundidad con posibles SPOILERS:\n\nEl problema del juego es casi todo lo que tiene que ver con el \"presente\". Si bien me dej\u00f3 flipado en el final del primer juego poder verle en esta \u00e9poca, creo que no lo han resuelto bien. De escenarios y dise\u00f1os espectaculares a una ciudad gris, sucia y aburrida (aunque intentan mantener partes antiguas del estilo g\u00f3tico). Encima intentan abrirla un poco m\u00e1s perdiendo el detallismo que permit\u00edan los \"pasillos\" del primero. \n\nAdem\u00e1s meten la mec\u00e1nica de sigilo, que no me parecer\u00eda mal (por los poderes que se les atribuyen a los vampiros como convertirse en niebla y controlar alima\u00f1as o transformarse en ellas) si no fuese porque a mi parecer est\u00e1 mal resuelta. En lugar de poder usarlo cuando quieras, te obligan a usarlo en determinados momentos, haciendo que estas fases siempre sean iguales. Tendr\u00edan que haber dado la libertad de poder usar el sigilo si estabas mal de vida o intentar ir a saco en cualquier zona. O si no haberlo limitado a los poderes que puedes usar para superar las zonas. \n\nPor otra parte el pasado sigue siendo lo mejor del juego, con esos paisajes y zonas espectaculares, mucho m\u00e1s inspiradas aunque lejos del detallismo del primero por hacer las zonas m\u00e1s grandes. \nAun as\u00ed, se han perdido los puzzles del primero, cosa que me parece lamentable si era para poner las fases de sigilo con lo mal resueltas que han quedado. \n\nOtra cosa que se ha perdido por el camino son los jefes gigantescos. Hay uno, pero est\u00e1 muy por debajo de cualquiera del primero. Con lo cual pierdes una parte de la epicidad del juego. \nAdem\u00e1s se han empe\u00f1ado en no darte recursos antes de casi ning\u00fan combate importante, as\u00ed que los combates finales se vuelven frustrantes como llegues mal de vida. \nY el combate final, regulero. Teniendo en cuanta que era el final de la saga, te deja encima un sabor agridulce.\n\nLa m\u00fasica y el dise\u00f1o art\u00edsticos siguen siendo sobresalientes. Un gustazo ver los men\u00fas, las descripciones de las reliquias, objetos y los personajes con sus ilustraciones. \n\nY luego el DLC es un caramelito que te deja con la la miel en los labios de no haber tenido m\u00e1s de eso en el juego. O un juego a parte as\u00ed. Tambi\u00e9n me hubiera gustado que el Mirror of Fate, que aunque el 3D es muy disfrutable, no lo sacasen igual que el 1 y el 2. \n\nUna l\u00e1stima, porque como digo el juego tiene partes muy buenas por ser una continuaci\u00f3n del 1, y luego partes mediocres que empa\u00f1an el juego. Aun as\u00ed el computo total de la trilog\u00eda queda muy alto, me ha encantado.", "timestamp_created": 1682646165, "timestamp_updated": 1682646165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137345636": {"recommendationid": "137345636", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097716615", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2829, "last_played": 1682574013}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63... \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5b \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude68!\n\n- \ud835\ude3f\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude61, \ud835\ude42\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 14\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude6e", "timestamp_created": 1682551539, "timestamp_updated": 1682574542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762872993946075439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137317189": {"recommendationid": "137317189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404065652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1682885322}, "language": "spanish", "review": "jugon", "timestamp_created": 1682507353, "timestamp_updated": 1682507353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137305853": {"recommendationid": "137305853", "author": {"steamid": "76561199276519906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3679, "last_played": 1681608464}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1682479409, "timestamp_updated": 1682479409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137254270": {"recommendationid": "137254270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801091294", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1288, "last_played": 1662104039}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Continuaci\u00f3n de la primera entrega, buena historia y es mejor gr\u00e1ficamente.

"review": "Not a complete waste of time and has some good things going on but as a whole cannot recommend. Bought the game heavily discounted and was still disappointed. The worst thing is there is a good game in there below all the frustrating things piled on top. I'm 12 hours in and not sure if I'll push through to the end. All the fun aspects come with some source of frustration. \n\nFor example the flow of the combat feels really good for short periods of time but is always disrupted after a few seconds. This is because the enemies have some attacks that are way too fast to block or impossible to dodge due to having super long reach and tracking you. Pair this with the fact that the game rewards not getting hit with a focus meter that depletes completely if you get hit even once. That way you are constantly pushed to play perfectly and not get hit, while making it damn near impossible to do so.\n\nAn other example of good stuff done horribly are the pain boxes. They are a way of getting access to more of 3 types of resource. Every box has a type of crystal in it that you need five of in order to unlock more of that type of resource. Some of the boxes are basically given to you just for progressing and some you need to find by exploring. Now here comes the twist. Finding the hidden boxes was actually fun at first and gave a sense of discovery, BUT needing to find 5 boxes for each resource makes the whole mechanic a chore. For example I ended up finding four of each different type in a row. That makes 12 boxes I had to find for before unlocking anything.

I'm also not going to comment on any lore or worldbuilding aspects since I have no prior experience with the series.\n\nedit: Forgot to mention a couple of straight up bugs like the sprint not working at all and sometimes having the character walk automatically in a random direction while not pushing any buttons.

Enemies still have weird stagger immunity and they can attack at any point. Sometimes they spam unblockable attacks in groups. Unblockable AoE attacks are way too fast. Stealth sections are annoying and in the end it's just dumb that you will never get to fight Golgoth guards proving that they are more powerful than Satan himself. There's unskippable time wasting animations and walking here and there - I would rather had seen a short loading screen (first game loads very fast).

So I can't really say how much this game stands out of usual Caslevania gameplay.\nIf you consider this game not as part of the series - its a great game and good metroidvania. I can compare it to the Darksiders (the first one, with the War). Many abilities that can be combined together  both in platforming and combat sections.\nGood: \n1. The combat - is kinda interesting, there are no fixed combos, but  many tools to use in convinient situation. For example - freezing a special kind of opponents so they cant regenerate and return, several types of launchers for juggling even a group of enemies(!), mist form to escape grab attacks and many more.\n2. The visuals and music - if you like some epic cutscenes/qte's with orchestra music and choir that can be deafening sometimes (but in a good way). Locations are very screenshotable, especially the Dracula castle, but the City has its points for sightseeing too. I had several desktop backgrounds from this game and actively using them.\n3. 2 playable characters (Alucard is available in DLC, its kinda short but his abilities and combat is different and it was a bit refreshing after grinding 110% of the main story)\n4. Saves and difficulty is player-friendly\nBut this game has so flaws as well.\n1.  The biggest and most obnoxious - is the stealth sections. They give feeling of being highly scripted and gave you almost no chance for mistake - if enemies spotted you - its a checkpoint restart. (and this is a good part - game has checkpoints save system with MANY checkpoints on the map, even if you die, you barely lose your progress, that keeps momentum and allows to play more exploratory, experiment in combat and play more aggressively).\n2. Its not the best game for 100% and amount of secrets in the game can be very exhausting (especially lore ones, as their can not be found with special item that helps with secret discovery). \n3. Puzzles in Revelations sometimes require almost perfect execution (those with time manipulation and shields)\n4. Combat progression. Using every combat tech  for a certain amount of times  increases weapon damage so you must balance between using your favorite ones and those you need to use, in order to get damage bonus (and this bonus is decent, 33% for level 2, for example, so for highest difficulties its almost required to be done.  Its controversial saying this is drawback only, but managing techniques usage through all game to fight the boss with biggest possible damage is not that fun.\n5. Balance. There is one special combo that can kill EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME with spamming just 1 button, im not even kidding. For those who have problems with  progression - its [spoiler]Explosive Earthquake[/spoiler]. I would recommend use it as the last resort or a powerfull opener when your chaos magic is overflowed\nAll in all - its really good game, and I recommend it if you like metroidvalias and 3rd person actions", "timestamp_created": 1679186298, "timestamp_updated": 1679186298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134797476": {"recommendationid": "134797476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850738702", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1696573553}, "language": "english", "review": "w", "timestamp_created": 1679037217, "timestamp_updated": 1679037217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510349750518798828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134502116": {"recommendationid": "134502116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024598215", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1678597087}, "language": "english", "review": "despite some gameplay flaws(looking at you stealth) it still a excellent  game", "timestamp_created": 1678576304, "timestamp_updated": 1678576304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574571192264556885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134443843": {"recommendationid": "134443843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060608890", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2564, "last_played": 1639423345}, "language": "english", "review": "You will hate this game if you compare it with the original Castlevania games. \n\nThe game is fun except for the stealth sections.

I enjoyed my play time and if you're a fan of Castlevania this is worth playing just to see what Gabri...uh \"Eu sunt Dracul!\" has been up to.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]  10/10\nGabriel defeated the lords of shadow and saved mankind at the cost of his humanity. Now known as the prince of darkness, he wages an unholy war against the forces he once served as well as ancient enemies and demons. The combat is just as fluid and enjoyable as the first game and although Gabriel's weapon and relics are gone, they certainly aren't missed! Dracula comes with his own adaptation of the Vampire Killer known as the Shadow Whip with access to the Void Sword (life stealing) and the Chaos Claws (heavy hitter). Players also have access to a nice range of dark relics which aid in combat and item location (dodo eggs anyone?). The game play was fun, with action around every corner even if the story did make me scratch my head for a minute.\n\n[b] Multiplayer [/b]  0/10\nSadly no.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]  10/10 \nThe graphics to me are a step up from the original LoS game and I experienced no issues, but your mileage may vary.\n\n[b] Audio [/b]  10/10 \nThe audio and music was superb *chef's kiss*! Between Titanic Struggle and Chaotic Battle, I had a blast beating enemies left and right!

Ive played the first LoS and a lot of the other castlevania games but this as a hack-and-slash sequel is really bad. To start off, I loved the first game to death, unlocked damn near everything, and bought the little DLC continuation, which was super good. Mind you the first game is kinda old and a lil rough but it balances out so good between enemies, bosses, move sets, etc so that even in late game your not overpowered or getting bored. This game basically is not a sequel and just a whole new game in general which isnt the bad part. THE STORY LITERALLY MAKES NO SENSE and This game throws numerous enemy hordes at you that don't flinch and are health sponges (ive tried this on all difficulties and its pretty much the same sponginess).  Weapon abilities dont do much either cuz again the flinch wont allow you to actually do anything cool without getting smacked at weird angles. Now Drac on the other flinches from EVERYTHING. like I know the whole point of the game is like \"Get Drac back to full power blah blah blah\" so you have to level up abilities to be badass but the ABILITIES DONT HELP /WORK lmao. I tried to stomach the game for as long as I could cuz i love Belmont dracula but this game isnt good. Your better off playing bayonetta, Dante's Inferno, or Devil May cry cuz atleast those games know what they are trying to do.

It was part of an especially bad story, but a lot was made over the gameplay and the visuals.\n\nIt does look good, mostly, and the designs are mostly pretty interesting. There are a lot of ambitious elements and creations, but you can see where they drew them from if you're a fan of Castlevania.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't play as well as it looks. It's often stiff and sticky in controls, and it's not very intuitive. In basically any of the 2D Castlevanias, like Symphony of the Night, you have a character whose powers are intuitive to use and tends to have everything they need to handle boss battles. In this, despite controlling basically Dracula, you constantly feel outclassed and overpowered. The problem is mainly because this is from the design philosophy that players should be limited in how they engage with the game and can only resolve situations like boss battles in a very few ways. There are too many QTEs that boss mechanics sometimes depend on, making some of them virtually unbeatable if you can't somehow come up with what the developers want you to, which it does a poor job of conveying.\n\nIt's frustrating, it's not that exciting, and as mentioned, the story is terrible. The visuals are solid, but they're not exceptional, and they really weren't at the time either.\n\nIf they had gone for another especially well done 2D Castlevania instead of this, they could have really added tremendous quality and production value. In large part, though, Konami's insane corporate leadership and Iga's self-obsession made this whole series happen. You'll notice there was not a Lords of Shadow 3.\n\nIt's nice to be reminded of what you were up to last time, and I like that in general in games. It helps you slip back into the game, and that's a nice part. Unfortunately, it doesn't let you easily use multiple savegames, and as mentioned before, it's not that intuitive so it's not easy to slide back into. Unlike other stylish action games like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, this game takes some considerable time to get back in the swing of, and that's a failing of the production.\n\nIt's a mediocre at best experience, unfortunately. I'd recommend even Lament of Innocence as a 3D Castlevania over this one. At least that one isn't heavily reliant on QTEs and a poorly-implemented set of abilities, most of which you'll never use unless you're forced to either by a boss battle or a stage, and even then it always feels forced and never really organic to the design.\n\nUnless you're determined to play every game with the Castlevania title, don't waste your time with this.

This games begins greatly, kicking more or less right from where the first LoS ended, and gives you the false(as I will explain later) impression of a story-driven anti-hero hack n slash action game playing as Dracula/Belmont. What more could you ask for, right? But that only lasts for so long, and after the hour mark the game begins to circle around the same dull set pieced gameplay through a pseudo-open world map. Obviously, I'm not having fun anymore, I'm just going to finish the game for OCD reasons and nothing more. \n\nFirst and foremost, I cannot even comprehend the setting and the story (so far at least) the game evolves in. Who could have thought that you get to play as Dracula the prince of Darkness, and instead roaming inside medieval castle corridors full of traps and hidden doors and dark forests,  you would at times be hiding completely powerless, behind truck cargo trying to get past the most disgusting enemies possible (from artistic pov) in one of the worst and boring stealth segments ever appeared in gaming, while trying to infiltrate a high-tech biolab in search of an antidote for an unknown disease. Wow! What's next? Frankenstein hacking bank networks traversing on roofs doing parkour stunts ? Honestly I'm having the impression that I'm playing as a lunatic dressed up and hallucinating of being Dracula. It's obviously a risk that didn't paid off AT ALL. All in all the 'modern day' segments are horrendous, maybe that idea could work out in an animated series, but not in a Castlevania vg title.\n\nBut of course, there are also the Castle segments accessible sometimes at random, sometimes at will though the wolf medalion areas, and although they are obviously far more interesting than the modern day ones, they too fall short mainly due to the extreme linearity while at the same time the game tries to convince the player that he gets to explore the \"open\" map at will. That doesn't happen almost at all, but I do think there's a fast travel option which I haven't yet explored since I would rather get on with it as fast as possible.\n\nCombat is good in par with the 1st one, I would say almost identical, the move set for each weapon may be looking fancy, but in the end I found myself just mashing buttons randomly since there's too much combinations to remember and eventually stick with the whip which is the main weapon after all and has the shortest moves list from all 3 weapons. One thing that annoys me is that they chose to \"lock\" the use of Sword and Chaos fists only when the two meters is filled with magic and chaos energy accordingly. While being relatively easy to fill these meters, I believe the weapons should be accessible at all times. \n\nExploration feels unrewarding if not plain frustration  since traversal can be extremely annoying at times. There are some segments where Gabriel/Dracula transforms into a rat moving inside vents getting access inside otherwise locked rooms. Sometimes there would be electrified cables moving around inside the vents, and I swear I cannot understand the hit boxes these cables have. It's just crazy. You get shocked having passed behind one, or escaping while running next to the sprites jumping off from the cables edge. It's completely random, and you just pray for the whole rat section to end asap. It's just bad and boring. And that stands for any given moment be it in the Castle or not, the game gets you to sweat for just getting another health/magic/chaos crystal, that in the end you may be choose to ignore them and move on. \n\nI won't be adding anything else since as I said I haven't finished the game yet but being halfway through I believe I have a good grip on what it has to offer. At least the soundtrack is very good, I would surely listen to it more later on.  \n\nPROS\n\n+ If you can forget the setting and the uninteresting vertigo of a plot... still...you're playing as Dracula/Belmont.\n+ Music is great, even epic at times.\n+ Some nice cutscenes so far.\n+ Combat is solid though can be frustrating when facing multiple enemies locking on at enemies randomly. (upgrades give good crowd control movesets though)\n+ Voice acting is great. Carlyle and Steward deliver both amazingly well.\n\nCONS \n\n- Dull, annoying, badly executed stealth segments.\n- Modern day setting feels far off from whole Castlevania/Dracula lore.\n- Unrewarding and limited exploration. Many invisible walls.\n- Tiresome traversal with many back and forths.\n- Story could be great but instead seems like a complete mess.\n\nBottom line. Buy only in a severe price drop and if  - like me - have a knack for Vampires/Dracula etc. Otherwise there are far better action/advs you can get your hands on be it current or past gen.", "timestamp_created": 1671556833, "timestamp_updated": 1671557248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691787421703338623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128698791": {"recommendationid": "128698791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143278810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1680063917}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1671244830, "timestamp_updated": 1671244830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128466138": {"recommendationid": "128466138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960438262", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1258, "last_played": 1670906278}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to not recommend a game you put 20 hours into. This game sucked me in initially with that awesome sequence in the beginning. This felt like a story driven hack n' slash that sort of reminded me of the Arkham series. \n\nBut then it just got dull. The first 3/4 of the game felt like a slog. You spend an awful lot of time alone and exploring. While I appreciate that it's non-linear, it was difficult to really follow where the story wanted you to go at times. The travel system is abysmal and long for no real reason. Exploration didn't feel all that rewarding either. \n\nThen the last 1/4 of the game hits and things ramp up. If the game would've had this level of intensity from the beginning, I honestly think my opinion of it would change. Bosses start coming in closer segments and Gabriel, as a character, starts to feel stronger. But it's just a drag getting to the end. I was glad when it was over. I want to play the DLC as I think Alucard's abilities are more interesting than Gabriel's, but I think I just need a break from the gameplay. \n\nAs far as a recommendation goes, I think if you can pick this up during a sale when it's just a few bucks, its worth it just to have.

The visual architecture alone is worth buying the game. A lot of time, dedication, and speed went into making this game come into fruition and it still received bad reviews by 'some' people. Critics will say it's just a copy of G.O.W. or Devil May Cry. To those critics I say let's see you make something better. Of course this version of Castlevania is no longer accepted as cannon, I am greatly disappointed to not see Mercury Steam give it a true ending it deserved. \n\n*spoiler* All we see after the one true Belmont defeats Satan, he carelessly breaks the mirror of fate (after spending a quarter of the game trying to put it back together again) and walks back into his castle leaving us with a cliffhanging cock-tease that is still felt to this day. Will he finally commit suicide and be with his family in the after life, or does Gabriel still have more work to do on earth? Unfortunately looks like we will never know and that is truly disappointing after all the time put into playing L.O.T.S/M.O.F./L.O.T.S.2. \n\nEven though this game is dead and no follow ups will be made (that we know of) I do recommend picking up this trilogy if/when it's on sale. My super old GTX-950 can play this perfectly at max setting on 2k resolution and it looks absolutely stunning on a 4K TV. The castle parts of the game are something to appreciate if you're a Castlevania fanboy. It's a shame we didn't get as much as we thought we would back when they first advertised for this. If only a few things were different it would have been an absolute masterpiece.\n\nTo those who say it's hard, you're meant to battle, gain EXP, and then level up. Just like every other Castlevania game you spend the entire time battling demons/monsters until you make it to Dracula, so why should it be any different this time?\n\nAre the maps confusing? I must admit at times it can be. Some clean up could have been attempted but I heard the game was rushed so who knows for sure?\n\nEven though it has it's flaws I give it a highly subjective 8/10.\n\nP.S.

\nsome voice acting is meh [it's not of the level of The Legacy Of Kain series or Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines but you can't deny that death, toy maker & satan's daughter will make you crack a smile [especially the toy maker!]], UPDATE; voice acting is still meh for alot, but after playing through afew times i've noticed dracula [was never any doubt to his voice-acting] is quite sarcastic in afew of his lines [when you aren't distracted by collecting, just play throu the game again and pay attention to what he says - i was grinning from ear to ear when i realised he can be a smarmy git XD ]\nsometimes the subtitles don't match on afew scenes- there either quick or slow [seriously they should have had S.daughter's subtitles while she's captive [what you can hear in the cutscene just makes her a sassy joy to listern to!]], \nhaving characters tell you to continuously hurry can get very annoying, \nbattle music blares despite you turning it down @.@ \nthe 'plot/story' isn't very well thought out [and contradicts the previous installments, can be confusing with regards to 'retconning' characters 'fates'] - mainly because it's all in text dumps when the devs should have really put it in the gameplay... [this also applies to enemies/mini bosses/bosses - example; Riot Mech, the text you get at the first encounter gives you hints on how to beat it more easily BUT if you don't read it then the 'cutscene' that plays showing it arming/about to fire it's missiles; then you won't know that that means you've got to arm your projectiles] UPDATE; to enjoy this game just IGNORE the plot, it's badly scripted and makes LOI's story more thoughtout [considering LOI was a pretty basic plot, having LOS/LOS2's compared and found VERY wanting is a BAD thing]\ndrac has small fangs [seriously what is it with giving vampires now small fangs!? o.O] [....watch the flashback cutscene [zobek finds your old arse in the 'church' [LOS secret end]] notice when he goes to bite zobek his fangs extended? yeah i don't know why they couldn't do that ingame either [or take a page from VTM:B's book and just have them long from the start - if a game from 2004 could do it why not modern ones??]\nand weird out of place sudden sneaking when there's no need [maybe drac's afraid of rippling the water in those 'tunnels'?]\ndracula has telekinesis BUT can only be used in mini-puzzles with a mirror... why can't i LOK:Defiance Kain and tk my enemies backsides in a fight!? O.O\nawkward off-centre camera that makes things difficult to see/lineup [also there's a sense of unbalanced about watching drac moving eternally on your left]\n\neventhou this game comes off as just for the spectacle appeal [don't let the graphics fool you, the enviroment designs are very fitting [even if you'll prefer the castle to the boring rinse/repeat of the city UPDATE; the Forbidden Wing in Revelations is very well done [the blood and (even if you can't understand the writing) convays 'madness'/breakdown very well!] ] boss designs are also nice -even if there seems to be a 'fetish' going on with 'rock flesh'] it biggest shine is the sound effects! just listern to the leather sqeek and the metal clink on dracula! how he manages to sneak up on anything without being heard is a hilarious in-developer joke XD [along with 'acme' sacks killing you ^.0]\n\nso it's fun to play as dracula - running around, smacking garbage for drops, being very action-packed unlike other dracula games that exist....BUT\nif there's one HUGH criticism that i make it's the horrendous map! [not the mini map] it would have been alot easier to navigate the game world [and the exasperating backtracking it asks of you] if you could have seen the whole map instead of bits and pieces...\n\ndo this game a favour - we've all taken one look at the LOS series and thought 'that's not castlevania' and true, it's not [it has none of the hallmarks/rhythm of castlevania] BUT it stands on it's own feet when you stop thinking and comparing it to castlevania, \nit has beautiful animations [except the rat and idling], \na gorgeous sound effects [from drac to the enviroment [really it's the sounds that got alot of love from the devs, just listern], \nthe soundtrack fits [even if you won't be able to listern to quite afew pieces standalone if you have the CD - it just doesn't work without the game] \nand alot of interesting artwork [WHY did a VAST assortment of these NOT get included in the Art Of book!!?]\nbeating your enemies while 'bustin a groove' is pleasing ^.^ [UPDATE; Revelation alucard controls more 'smoothly' then the main game [most noticeably the execution of the double-run/speedburst [not dash/dodge] going back to dracula feels 'very slow and awkward' in comparison - essentially the same as playing God of War [original] then playing Devil May Cry [original], feels horribly slow and janky]\n\ni was sceptical of playing the LOS games, but i did eventually try the demo and while i had a hard time with the controls [keyboard and mouse - have since bought a PlayStation-layout controller] i've found that buying the full game - despite the above grips- has made me just enjoy the action of the game \nof just having mindless Kratos-style button-mashing in a very nicely visual gothic feast [you have to admit, the attention to detail is incredible]\nof watching the AI behaviour and hearing the effort put in to the sounds of the game world\n\nso you won't be overjoyed at not-castlevania\nand it's inspiration' from other famous games\nbut don't be so quick to judge it too harshly - it has it's charms; they're just not immediatly apparent\n\nUPDATE\nwould just like to add [after playing through Revelation and afew runs] i've found, to fully enjoy this game, you have to kickout of your head any connection to Castlevania and just think of this as a Dracula game - it's much more enjoyable [and ignore the plot - very important! [the writing is not great and just seems to get bad with every playthrough]] and is nicely action-packed for it; i was actually smiling numerous times and just enjoying it as a vampire game!

Nada m\u00e1s acabar con el tutorial empezar\u00e1 a contarse una gran historia en poco tiempo, la cual es la base del juego que parece mas un DLC: \"Castlevania Lord of Shadows: Mirror of Fate\". Una vez terminada de contarse la historia ya estaremos en contexto para empezar con la partida.\nPara resumirlo brevemente el argumento gira en detener a Satan\u00e1s quien cree que Grabiel, ahora llamado \"El Dragon\" o \"Principe de la oscuridad\", ha muerto. Con ayuda poco confiable de su antiguo compa\u00f1ero Zobek intentar\u00e1n frenar que Satan\u00e1s sea invocado.\nLa historia tiene giros impresionantes como en el anterior juego y tiene momentos \u00e9picos que hacen muy interesante la trama. Sigue siendo genial en ese aspecto.\nGr\u00e1ficamente luce ligeramente mejor que el anterior y sigue teniendo un apartado art\u00edstico incre\u00edble.\nLa m\u00fasica esta bien supongo aunque creo que a veces es algo repetitiva, sin embargo, no es que moleste sinceramente pues es bastante asimilable.\nEl aspecto jugable si hay que remarcar que no todo es genial. \nUna de las partes mas lentas y aburridas son las de \"adoptar la forma de una rata\" para alcanzar lugares imposibles para Dr\u00e1cula en su forma original, la verdad no entiendo porque consideraron que esa idea fuera divertida. Felizmente esa mec\u00e1nica solo esta presente en ocasiones contadas, sin embargo, rompen tremendamente el ritmo de un hack and slash. Los acertijos eran suficientes y pod\u00edan haberlos mejorado, pero decidieron poner esa basura de convertirse en rata.\nOtra de las partes odiosas y lentas es la de evitar ciertos enemigos que en primera instancia el juego te indica que son pr\u00e1cticamente invencibles. Tiene sentido al principio, ya que Dr\u00e1cula esta d\u00e9bil y no tiene suficientes recursos para hacerle frente a esas cosas en los primeros minutos de la aventura. Sin embargo, cuando ya pasaste por casi la mitad del juego adquiriendo mejoras en el camino que recuperar\u00e1n a Dr\u00e1cula esos enemigos siguen siendo invencibles y esto es porque el juego usa a esos enemigos para justificar otra mec\u00e1nica que podr\u00edamos decir que es \"sigilo\". La idea es evitarlos frente a frente, distrayendolos, evadiendolos convertidos en \"rata\" o acercandonos a ellos por la espalda para poseerlos y abrir puertas.\nEstas 2 mec\u00e1nicas realmente pudieron haberse evitado. Usando la forma de niebla para alcanzar lugares en vez de usar la est\u00fapida forma de rata y haciendo posible enfrentar a esos enemigos en vez de hacerlos invencibles para forzar una mec\u00e1nica que solo retarda la acci\u00f3n en un Hack and Slash.\nDejando de lado eso, el hack and slash sigue siendo bueno y podr\u00eda decir que se amplio un poco m\u00e1s. Ahora las magias del vac\u00edo y el caos se identifican con el uso de una arma que las representa. Estas armas tienen sus propias t\u00e9cnicas sin olvidar que tambi\u00e9n tenemos los l\u00e1tigos sombras los cuales remplazan a la arma usada por Gabriel en la anterior aventura.\nEste juego presenta 2 escenarios por as\u00ed decirlo, por un lado la parte del Castillo y por otro lado, la Ciudad.\nCada escenario cuenta con sus propios tipos de enemigos.\nEn la ciudad encontrar\u00e1s ciudadanos pose\u00eddos, demonios de todo tipo (estos son los mas divertidos), fuerzas antidisturb\u00edos y entre otros parecidos. En cambio, en el castillo encontrar\u00e1s sirvientes de Dr\u00e1cula que atacan al mismo Dr\u00e1cula y Soldados de la Hermandad (el sacerdote es el mas interesante).\nExplorar ambos escenarios del juego ya no es sencillo como antes. Ya no hay un libro que te cuenta la historia y donde puedes elegir una pagina para ir directamente al capitulo que quieres ir. Ahora tienes que guiarte tu mismo por la ciudad o por el castillo y las conexiones que haya entre ambos escenarios. Se ha vuelto algo engorroso buscar un lugar espec\u00edfico.\nHay un lugar importante que resaltar que es la tienda del chupacabras, ese personaje molesto de la 1 que te quitabas tus pertenencias y que te obligaba a jugar a las escondidas para que las recuperes.\nEse mismo personaje ahora te vender\u00e1 objetos como llaves, fragmentos de cristales de magia para aumentar tu capacidad o las llamadas \"reliquias\". Objetos que podr\u00e1n recuperar tu salud, darte magia ilimitada por unos segundos, etc.\nHonestamente casi no las use, incluso en la dificultad mas alta: Principe de las tinieblas. Salvo situaciones especificas, por lo general no considero que sean algo necesario siempre que domines el juego.\nSin embargo, donde si considero que ser\u00e1n de gran ayuda es en los \"desaf\u00edos de Kleidos\". Estos desaf\u00edos vienen a reemplazar a los retos del anterior juego. Solo que ahora mas interesantes que antes y algunos que parecen muy dif\u00edciles pero que tienen un truco bastante simple. Realmente me divert\u00ed mucho con los desaf\u00edos, sobretodo en la m\u00e1xima dificultad.\nLos jefes del juego son brutales, solo mencionare a algunos que recuerdo mas por la mejor sensaci\u00f3n que me dejaron: Carmilla, Agreus y La Muerte. Todos en general son buenos.\nPor ultimo, esta el DLC: Revelations. La historia se centra b\u00e1sicamente antes de que empiece el segundo juego. Alucard es el protagonista de ese peque\u00f1o tramo de la historia. Sugiero que solo lo jueguen despu\u00e9s de completar el juego principal, de hecho el juego tambi\u00e9n lo sugiere as\u00ed.\nJugar con Alucard es genial, tiene sus propias habilidades y solo dir\u00e9 que hay un jefe. Ya que lo dem\u00e1s son solo enemigos. El DLC es bastante corto, pero disfrutable. Conecta y despeja dudas de la historia para terminar de cerrar con esta entrega.\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, Lord of Shadows 2 es un buen Hack and Slash que viene ahora ampliado con 2 armas nuevas que representan a los 2 tipos de magia y con mas posibilidades con el uso de reliquias. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n tiene a\u00f1adidos innecesarios que pueden frenar la acci\u00f3n por momentos, pero que por suerte son pocas veces. Si vienes por la historia este juego sigue siendo genial, sin embargo, personalmente creo que desaprovecharon una gran oportunidad con el Mirror Fate, el cual fue incluido aqu\u00ed en un instante aportando con la historia, historia que pudo haber sido plasmada en un juego que deber\u00eda haber sido la segunda parte.\nSi vienes por la acci\u00f3n en este juego ya sea que uses a Dr\u00e1cula o Alucard las posibilidades de como enfrentar a los enemigos son muchas y en eso esta lo divertido.

(There's a sommersault move that lets you jump over an enemy that I found nearly useless because of the tracking & non-existant i-frames).\n- On the exploration side, LoS2 has a lot of slow climbing sections and \"loading-time air locks\" that make getting around kind of a pain. The Science District specifically is waaaaay too huge for its own good, too.\n- Enemies also have ranged attacks with amazing accuracy to keep you from climbing or running away, making you clear rooms before you can move on even on revisits on areas\n- Because of how many cinematic, area-destroying cutscenes & story-based teleports are happening, it can be really hard to make up a mental map of the areas.\n- While you can see how many items are collectible in each area based on your current abilities and one of the consumables pointing out an nearby item to you, you cannot look at any different minimaps aside from the current area you're in.", "timestamp_created": 1666539529, "timestamp_updated": 1666539529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57366478443145752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124181030": {"recommendationid": "124181030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313159791", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1807, "last_played": 1666388446}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Le falta la dificultad del primero y el final abierto la verdad medio flojo.\nMas alla de eso esta bien", "timestamp_created": 1666388594, "timestamp_updated": 1666388594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124166067": {"recommendationid": "124166067", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988609440", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 217, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1438478096}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine being given the reins to one of the most powerful entities of myth and legend, imagine defending your castle with crazy vampire moves and fighting off massive siege engines with your bare hands.\n\nGot it? you have that mental image? good.

You get to play Dracula for an entire game :-) How cool is that!\n\nAre there any things I didn't like? Well, yes. The player is thrown in a boss fight immediately. That was a bit frustrating and it didn't help me like the game from the start. Once you get past that the game becomes a great experience. Another thing is the time span between some boss fights. A bit more exploring in between and some fewer boss fights certainly would have made the experience even better in my opinion.\n\nNevertheless, Lords of Shadow 2 easily made it to my favorite games of all time list.

Mostly, just ragging on the stealth sections. They were reasonably integrated at first (what with Dracula being weak, etc.) but there should have been a point where you become strong enough to kill the guards cause there is some dissonance between having to sneak to live and being able to kill FUCKING SATAN himself. Anyway, this single mechanic doesn't really \"add\" to the experience and you'd probably have a better game without it.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 is better than 1. Plain and simple. It looks better, there's no fixed camera (thank fuck) it takes place in a freaking castle, and has that labyrinthian, back-tracky, secret-laden platforming that Metroidvanias are known for. The writing, I'd say, is on par with 1 - that is to say, its decent. Gabriel's turn to evil was kind of weakly portrayed in the first game and they retroactively explain his actual Dracula transformation in a DLC (that was unplanned mind you). He was kinda forced to kill people, or literally controlled to kill people and through narration it is said (NOT SHOWN) that darkness is growing within him. You don't really buy the transition. And all throughout 2 he never seems out right evil, just kinda jaded, like he's trying to convince himself he's the Prince of Darkness all the time. The ending was kinda anti-climactic. You just beat Satan and walk away, the end. No closure, no death, no nothing - planning a 3rd game? But the journey is fun enough. The game ultimately feels like a relic from a time before live services, day-1 patch, microtransactions. Just a solid single player experience that isn't loaded with \"content\".\n\nThe combat is also better than the first. Much more fluid and kinetic with seamless weapon transitions. That coupled with the relics gives the player a lot of choice in fighting.\n\nI'd give 1 like a 7/10 and this probably an 8/10. It improves on a lot of what the first did and takes better advantage of a 3-D Metroidvania concept.\n", "timestamp_created": 1657778938, "timestamp_updated": 1657778938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118638139": {"recommendationid": "118638139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361746346", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1652, "last_played": 1682214963}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buena historia buen gameplay entretenido \nlos dlc siempre utiles 10d10", "timestamp_created": 1657557833, "timestamp_updated": 1657557833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118624275": {"recommendationid": "118624275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245650442", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1013, "last_played": 1657654967}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the last Castlevania game I needed to play to try them all and it was a huge let down.

god of wars, dmc, or even the first LoS which was enjoyable on PS3. platforming and puzzle solving are great when applied well, but not here. there are lots and lots of the SAME exact sneaking missions, barely differing between one another. become a rat and go into cover, then possess someone. use possessed being to unlock door. that's it. also i don't want to sneak around bosses before fighting them in a game like this. i'm here to raise hell and battle as the all powerful dracula, not crouch and sneak around MY OWN UNDERLINGS, i should be ripping them apart of rmore than half the game. fights feel far and few between with literally no \"mini marathon\" aspect for them. you'll fight one \"elite\" enemy accompanied by a handful of fodder and that's it, one fight and done. \n\nplayer controlled camera means have fun trying to battle enemies while battling the camera. block and dodge being the same button again do not work well... again. levels change quickly meaning you can't absorb and love the area you're in (you're in the city for one fight, oh okay now we're in an underground lab sneaking around for an hour, okay now here's a church for platforming). you'll see plenty of the drab looking labs.  this is all one continuous journey only separated by cutscenes, no results, or rewards screen. the open world travel aspect feels unnecessary, i wish it were a linear game since repeat playthroughs would be a better way to upgrade and find everything; i feel like they want you to go back to areas to grind since upgrade costs are high and numerous (along with mastery levels), but that feels incredibly not fun in a game genre like this. also there's an ultimate screen wiping attack that just sucks in presentation and implementation, not fun at all to use. i noticed a lot of very useful mechanics be implemented only after the player makes a mistake, such as the alarm bell mechanic in the sneaking around Agreus mission. let me know the mechanics first so maybe i can make it really far in a first attempt. \n\nthe tools to have fun are here, and maybe it's just me, but this feels no where near as cohesively thought out, fun, and action packed like the other games mentioned. sorry chupacabra i would come back to shop but i'm not trekking around looking for a travel point when i don't remember where the hell you are and don't even need to buy

However, its pretty long journey and even though you start weak and advance later on, just because you are playing as Dracula himself i think there are a lot of issues with the game. One being you die easily by low level minions which is absurd. Why? because you are bloody Dracula, thats why. If the Devil is king of evil, you are second after him... Surely it would feel more realistic that you should oneshot ALL low level minions in the game. Secondly, I hate it that you cant jump very high or fly to high distances in this game. Surely by controlling the power of chaos from the underworld itself and a soul sword like the one Lich King has, you would be able to at least climb all walls. Not just at specific points and time in the game.\n\nFinally, even though you start pretty weak in the official beginning of the game (not the Castle Dracula siege part), I personally think that Dracula does not advance quick enough to represent the through power of the lord of shadows himself. One more think, I havent reached the final part of the game but I truly hope when you reach the full might of Dracula( at some part of the game when you max out the character) you will be able to use the Void sword and Chaos gloves unlimited number of times, just like during the Castle Dracula siege part when you start the game. This is where Dracula is in his prime with everything unlimited, as it technically should be. In relation to God of War 4, you can die easily from low level minions like the Draugrs when Kratos is maxed out. Thats pretty dumb having in mind that you completely annihilated ALL greek gods from the face of the Earth in God of War 3. You had the power to kill Zeus but you can get 4 shot by a Draugr in God of War 4..... Thats all i got to say.\n\nAlso in one of the scenes in Castlevania LOS 2, you can see Dracula one shotting an entire army with his blood whip.... and in the game if you use your void sword (maxed out) it will need 3,4 swings.

I don't really like the modern setting, but that's half the setting, the other half is the Castle and that, I think was made decently. The game also has some stealth sections that weren't necessary in this, and even some that are really annoying, also despite liking it becoming an open-world, it really is a quasi-open-world, because the map is full of loading rooms, and that can really break some of the rythm.\n\nWith all this said, and despite the flaws, I really liked this game and the other 2 Lords of Shadow too.

But they forgot that in the original book, in the Coppola's movie and in the \"Nosferatu\" (the 1922 adaptation), Dracula transforms himself into rats to be able to hide and escape.

The general difficulty is less difficult than the first part, only the optional Kleidos challenges have some few very mean special tasks that need a big portion of luck beside very good reflexes. For completionists a very hard task and can be get really annoying.\n\nThe strong points:\n* a good fighting tutorial (this was missing in the first part)\n* impressive buildings, city/castle settings and awesome statues\n* normal playthrough is more for casual gamers\n* better overall graphics\n* there is a shop with one of the best sidekick characters ever\n\nThe weak points:\n* a lot of important story things are just told in a rough cutscene. It feels like you missed a Lords of Shadows 1.5\n* a lot of old characters are just mixed into the story just for the sake to let them re-appear\n* some plot holes: one example [spoiler]Zobek reappears after he got burned by Satan himself[/spoiler]\n* some sensless story parts: one example [spoiler]the death of Simon Belmont felt so useless[/spoiler]\n* unhelpful world map. You will get lost easily when you search for specific areas to get some secrets\n* switching from item use mode to ranged attack mode is done very inconvenient\n* some Kleidos challenges are too luck based (especially on Prince of Darkness mode)\n* if you reset a failed Kleidos challenges, only the life bar is resetted. Used items and powers not. So you end up farming them for a new retry, or you are forced to ALT+F4 out of the game and reload it, what resets everything. Not good game design\n\nThough I still liked this game, the sequel is not as good as the first part. This might be a personal taste. But I do like the charm of a timeless fantasy setting of the predecessor way more than this science-fantasy mix.

The story is just a convoluted nonsense where convenient things just happen so the plot can move along. What is frustrating is that the elements for this to be good is there but the direction they took is just abysmal. The art direction is just impeccable and the castle is stunning, especially when they show those beautiful vistas. I love the character designs but when they come to the city they become mediocre.\n\nThe combat is so disappointing, there are too few enemies in the game for what they want to do and then they all fight the same, i.e. all have unblockables, all have projectiles, all can block attacks and all can carry shield. So it's just fighting the same fights over and over again, doing the same shit the same way over & over, except for the harpies as they change it since they fly and you got to attack them in the air or ground them and fights are interesting when they are mixed with other enemies. The enemy count is bad that 2 regular enemies were upscaled and even used as Boss Fights, which just spoils the excitement when you find out.\n \nThere are two areas in the game, the city and the castle. The castle is great, beautiful environments and when you do fight it feels like arena having open space. Meanwhile the city is weird, they are some places that are wide for fight but then there are some that cramped and makes no sense, especially considering the size of some enemies.\n\nStealth is worse part of this game, I really don't know who thought of this and why. It's always annoying, the game just decides Dracula can't do anything and has to sneak. Infuriating, especially against Agreus, which you have to fail before they tell you how it works. \n\nThen the puzzles are bad because they seem like an afterthought and you don't see them until towards the end of the game like they want to slow you down. From my experience playing games, developers first introduces to the puzzle mechanics and slow starts to escalate it. Here they reach deep into their asshole and just pull it out. There is arranging the mirror fragments which just feels totally unnecessary after you've used it for what something significant and now is just padding. The bad puzzles are before you fight the 2nd apostle, after another stupid stealth section and before you get to the 3rd apostles. Stupid puzzles designed to waste the players time.\n\nSo the game is designed in a way that you go back to areas you've played before to collect upgrades, as you unlock abilities, as you make your way there you engage in the combat system only that the combat system sucks because of your enemies and some of the city environments are ugly when compared to the castle environments.

The game opens on a strong note, then drops off immediately after. The game follows this roller coaster structure of fun, followed by the antithesis of fun until you just get sick and get off the ride.\n\n[h1]What Was Fixed[/h1]\n\nThe combat is by far, a million times more satisfying. The main weapon is still a whip and it still functions the same, which is good. But rather than just having red and blue magics, now you have a sword that restores your health, and gauntlets that break armor. Fundamentally, all of the weapons have the same combos, which is slightly disappointing. But they all have different advance moves, different feels, and all of them serve different functions which really helps mix up the combat. \n\nPlatforming is also improved. You can control the camera, and for the most part, movement is streamlined and much more responsive than in the first game. I never really came across any platforming issues in the form of bad camera angles or Dracula not grabbing ledges he was supposed to. Overall, the whole game [i]feels[/i] much, much better to play.\n\n[h1]What Went Wrong[/h1]\n\nThe game still repeats a lot of the same mistakes:\n-Having your ability to recover magic being tied to a combo meter\n-Having 2 magic bars\n-Having to stand still to collect blood orbs rather than passively picking them up\n-Secondary weapons aren't useful\n-You need to use the D-pad to cycle secondary weapons/abiliies\n\nAlone, none of these things are tolerable. Together, they just make the game bad to play. For the most part though, the combat is satisfying enough that these things can be ignored. What can't be ignored is that for some inexplicable reason, MercurySteam thought it would be really cool if stealth sections were sprinkled in throughout the game. And I'm not just talking about the rats.\n\nIf you look at initial reviews of the game, they all complain about Dracula turning into rats to sneak around enemies. MercurySteam has stated that they would do things differently if they could. But here's the thing: It's not just the rats. There are stealth sections that have nothing to do with rats. You have to sneak around Carmilla. You have to sneak around Argeus. Neither of these sections involve turning into rats. \n\nThe problem with stealth in this game, is that it is in the game [i]at all[/i]. This is what I was referring to about the game following a pattern of fun, followed by not fun. Stealth sections are not \"6-7% of the game\" as the developers have said. Stealth sections pop in the middle of fights - Seriously, you go from fighting a monster on a train, to sneaking by big dudes with big guns, back to fighting, back to sneaking - It's nauseating. Mercury Steam was so clearly proud of their ability to craft stealth scenarios, that they saw it fit to pepper the game with them. \n\nLet's say these were actually good, well-designed, well-thought out segments, which they aren't. This isn't a stealth game. Nothing you do will make stealth fun because no one came here for it. This is going to a classical music concert, and then part way through the string section genre jumps into a rap group. Doesn't matter how good the rappers are, it's not what I'm here for. You are undercutting yourself.\n\nDespite not being the main thing that ruined the game for me, exploration was also done poorly. They really tried to open the world up in this one, I suppose to encourage you to explore. Except there really is no motivation to go back anywhere. You will regularly encounter upgrades you can't reach without gaining a new ability, but it's very easy to forget where those upgrades were because all of the environments just kind of blend together. Even if I had wanted to go back to get things I missed, I wouldn't know where to start, and you are only looking for health and magic upgrades, which never feel that necessary - You tend to get enough just following the story and doing some minor exploration. \n\n[h1]The Story is Nonsense[/h1]\n\nI'll save you the hassle - The Castle isn't real. This isn't technically a spoiler, since it's technically open to interpretation, and ultimately doesn't matter. The game is set 1000 years after its predecessor and roughly 500 years after [i]Mirror of Fate[/i]. If you know that Trevor is Alucard, then you don't need to worry about that particular entry. Technically, it picks right after the epilogue of the first game, but I digress. \n\nThe game opens with Dracula decimating an army sent by the Brotherhood of Light. Alucard emerges from the shadows and fade to black - We're in modern times. Zobek, who's alive somehow, despite being burned alive by Satan, informs Dracula that Satan is coming back, and must be stopped. Dracula must regain his strength, kill Satan's children, and Satan, and then Zobek promises to kill Dracula, ending his long, torturous life. \n\nThe game shifts back and forth between the main plot, as described above, and Dracula traveling 500 years back in time to his castle. The denizens of his castle all are afraid he's going to leave again, and so decide killing him is the best way to get him to stay. As mentioned, none of this is really happening - it's all in his mind. This is meant to be the story of Dracula's inner struggle. How he reconciles with being evil.\n\nAdmittedly, this is an interesting concept that could have been performed better if MercurySteam employed actual writers, rather than whoever they had. The main problem is there are 2 narratives: \n-One is about Dracula's fight against himself\n-One is about Dracula's fight against Satan\n\nThese aren't really interwoven at all in a way that makes sense. Dracula just randomly goes back to his Castle to confront his inner demons while the other story goes on pause. Vice versa, too. I found myself caring more about Dracula's inner struggle, and when the game brings you back to the present day, I didn't really care what was happening.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nI want to like this game. I really do. The combat is fun. The music is great. It looks fantastic. But it just gets in its own way too much. Between the random stealth sections crassly shoved in and bad exploration, it's hard to recommend this as a game. The story is also just 2 stories that don't fit together - when one is going on, the other stops. \n\nIt's just such a shame too, considering how much they fixed from the first game to see them stumble and fall harder than they did before.", "timestamp_created": 1639198118, "timestamp_updated": 1639236186, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504700660705566406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105508801": {"recommendationid": "105508801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279602941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1665313299}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1639040004, "timestamp_updated": 1639040004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105460972": {"recommendationid": "105460972", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064772471", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 832, "last_played": 1695202616}, "language": "english", "review": "best game for me i loved", "timestamp_created": 1638967250, "timestamp_updated": 1638967250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513525962829589844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105424887": {"recommendationid": "105424887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025723359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2346, "last_played": 1641496010}, "language": "english", "review": "As a Castlevania fan for 25 years or so, this is remarkably bad part of the series, and deffinetly last castlevania we will see, since the developers and publisher separeted after this release, Konami now tottally shifted to Casino Games and micro games.

And DLC Revelation is short, buggy and boring as hell.  Alucard is Dracula ? And they tought Crisegram will be cool to be Alucards sword, no. Thats we funs overused to do on SATURNs version of SOTN to farm shit out to be OP, its not in the lore and its not cool. Also Dracula castle itself is a nice idea.,. but badly created, bunch of mazes, and corridors you are suppoused to get back after you get powers, but so irritating the way they created castle, you wont care to go back, since its not rewarding enough of your effort, said that its not Vania as it used to make series great.   I could type tons and tons of text more. but in tottal if you really dont know what to play and you are Castlevania fun, wait for this game to be 0.99$ and get it, otherwise its not worthy.

The stealth sections in particular are my least favourite. It doesn't seem right that the almighty Dracula has to turn into a bunch of rats to avoid some enemies when at the beginning of the game you fight titans and godlike creatures.\n\nI believe that's because it follows the Stoker's idea of Dracula. It seems that the developers were inspired mainly from Stoker's book and the Coppola movie.

There's no getting around the fact it is a divisive game. I suggest you play LOS 1 with the dlc (And even Mirror Of Fate) if you want to go into this penultimate sequel knowing what the heck is going on. This was always intended to be an alternate what-if universe split off from Castlevania's mainline canon. Names and locations are similar \"but\" this is not based on the nes classics,Rondo Of Blood,later Igavania iterations,or even the netflix animated series. If you are a \"CV purist\" you need to know this going in.\n\nBeyond that? Personally I had a lot of fun! It certainly gave me the nostalgic \"Castlevania experience\" and with that came some frustrating platforming,difficult bosses, and environmental puzzles that required absolutely perfect timing and perfect navigation. Even on easy this game will make you a repeat cadaver until you recognize the patterns of your enemies and the layout of LOS 2's various breathtaking yet haunted locales. (Respectively split between the castle and the more modern city segments)\n\nIf you are a fan of action platformers and have been there throughout their evolution you will recognize a familiar pattern. Gabriel can level up and unlock a multitude of attacks. He has a variety of weapons. Certain items tucked away in the dark corners can increase his magic or his health. Certain abilities also allow him to more thoroughly explore each area so there is backtracking involved. Combat is fast and fluid yet also has heft and weight to it. Your chaos and void reserves are used to leech life from your foes or more effectively break off their protective armor. LOS 2 is the closest we've come to having a competent 3D Igavania game with modern improvements. \n\n(It's then a crying shame just a few flawed segments drag down an otherwise pitch perfect marvel of a game.)\n\nImagine being Dracula. Prince Of Darkness. The Dragon. The Impaler. You are obviously the most chad vampire ever to have existed! \"Now\" imagine going toe to toe with old pagan forest gods,psychotic police officers in mecha armor,floating life sucking wraiths,wall scaling contortionist ghouls,knights from the Vatican church,a menagerie of screen filling abominations,the grim reaper,and \"finally\" even Satan himself.\n\nRetain all of what I just told you \"then\" come to the laughable realization glorified security guards wearing red Warhammer 40k armor can utterly destroy you with their pew-pews. And do you ever get to fight them on equal footing where you can eventually rip them out of their tin cans then snack on them like the human happy-meals they actually are? Nope! The reason being you only encounter these guys in painfully awkward stealth sections that involve running around as a rat briefly then possessing certain people to open doors. This ridiculous oversight makes these lug-heads the most powerful adversaries in the whole friggin campaign.\n\nTo Mercury Steam's credit these sections are brief and if your willing to soldier through them the rest of the game is a lovingly crafted masterwork. I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs. LOS 2 ran fluidly and concisely with hardly any lag. The visuals remain stunning to this day and the orchestral soundtrack and spiritual hymns fit the overall mood flawlessly.  (Exactly what you would expect from the same studio that recently brought gamers the highly regarded Metroid Dread on the Nintendo Switch!)\n\nI've read mixed opinions about how this epic tale of family,betrayal,revenge,undying love,and redemption unfolds. Personally I enjoyed it and even liked the somewhat divisive ending. (Aka,another aspect that left certain folks satisfied and other folks disappointed.) Regardless you are getting some quality voice work from Robert Carlyle,Patrick Stewart,and the rest of the cast whom are also very talented.  \n \nBy now I hope I painted an accurate enough description with words to help with your final decision. I'd say if you enjoyed the previous LOS games as well as games pertaining to this genre in particular then the game is a steal for the price and is often on sale to boot. It is certainly a good choice for a Halloween play-thru when the veil between the living and dead is thinner and all matter of monsters go bump in the night!  \n\nPros\n\n+Challenging but fair. (If someone like me can beat it then it is certainly not an impossible feat.)\n\n+Combat that is easy to learn but hard to master\n\n+Breathtaking vistas\n\n+Traversing the terrain using vampiric powers is usually enjoyable and rarely tedious\n\n+Not a bad looker of a game even by today's ridiculous standards.\n\n+Good voice acting\n\n+Music meshes perfectly with the atmosphere and mood of the setting\n\n+Mostly forgiving save check points \n\n+Dlc lets you play as Alucard\n\nCons\n\n-Stealth segments were not needed and are an annoyance that offers nothing positive to the overall package. \n\n-Certain puzzles and boss segments require split second timing whilst one tiny misstep can make you fail or restart the whole sequence.\n\n-Castlevania city? Really? Who ran with \"that\"? Why not just call the place a Romanian sounding name like Wallachia?\n\nNeutral\n\n-/+The last boss fight and ending will either rub off on you very right or rub off on you very wrong!", "timestamp_created": 1633936460, "timestamp_updated": 1633938908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650552809238433838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100847270": {"recommendationid": "100847270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980384654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2412, "last_played": 1633750695}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, I'd say it's a 6.5-7/10 for a game.

The fact you are now a vampire does not change much. For example, fairies were replaced by bats, but they work much the same.\n\nThe story makes no sense and is totally boring: In one reality you wake up in 21th century to save the world from Satan. In the other one you are in your castle (despite the fact that the said castle is destroyed centuries ago) brooding over your past. You move back and force through \"wolf portals\", this is never explained.\n\nThe biggest difference from LOS1: there are no missions, just one big world. Enemies respawn if you revisit areas, allowing you to grind. Also you must now repeatedly use each special move to master it, annoying.\n\nThe biggest minus: Endless cutscenes totally ruin the game. Most of them are unskippable, even skippable scenes require 3 button pushes to skip. Every switch, door, elevator etc show the main char SLOWLY operate it EVERY TIME you change areas. For example, take Kleidos challenges. You recharge your energies in the real world, then use wolf amulet (scene), follow the wolf into the castle (very slow unskippable scene), operate the elevator (scene), operate the mirror (scene), choose challenge, scenes, slow walk scene, scene, fight the challenge, fail it.

The game expands heavily on the aspects of the first game that worked and ditched a lot of what made it a slog especially on repeat playthroughs (overlong puzzles, slow platforming as the pace has been dramatically increased, etc.).\n\nI think most notable are the changes in writing (our lead has a lot more to say in this game than he did in his first outing as a playable character, and the world itself has more personality), and the changes to combat (your super meters are now also unique movesets with their own weapons tied to them, your subweapons are now rechargeable instead of limited by how many you can carry, there's even more move variety to experiment with, enemies have more varied movesets, more memorable designs and strategies to fight, and it's less focused on massive hordes and more focused on dealing with enemies that are more keen on putting up a fight individually).\n\nWhile the game is on the shorter side I think this game stands above the previous game just because of the improvements and the ambition to try and make a big, interconnected world with secrets in this one which isn't something that the first game attempted to do, instead opting for a long quest. \n\nAt the time of writing I've yet to play the DLC for this game, nor have I played Mirror of Fate, which only gets minor play in this game.

Acabo de terminarlo y reconozco que lo abandon\u00e9 en varias ocasiones, una vez por problemas t\u00e9cnicos y otras veces por resultare algo tedioso, pero fue algo pasajero. La experiencia en general de jugarlo ha sido bastante grata. \n\nYo me lo compr\u00e9 como muchos lo habr\u00e1n hecho al gustarle (en mi caso, enamorarme) el primer Castlevania LOS (Lords of Shadows) y querer seguir jugando a la conclusi\u00f3n de la historia de la \u00faltima saga de los Castlevania por aquellos a\u00f1os, y,  como suele pasar muchas veces en las continuaciones de juegos, es raro encontrarte la nueva entrega igual que su sucesor cambiando solo la historia, en este caso es algo distinto, arreglando unas cosas y otras quiz\u00e1s no tanto.\n\nRespecto sus [b]ACIERTOS[/b], pues todo lo que estaba genial del primero y lo han incluido en el 2\u00ba porque son los mismos que lo han hecho, como su [b]m\u00fasica, su historia, las voces de los actores, los entornos, las cinem\u00e1ticas, los bosses, el lore o su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico, siendo todo una pasada como el primero[/b]. Y tambi\u00e9n las cosas nuevas que est\u00e1n bien hechas, como al hacerlo [b]totalmente en 3D[/b], poder mover la c\u00e1mara libremente, como un buen Hack and Slash  que se precie, mejorando el disfrute de sus[b] trabajados entornos fant\u00e1sticos g\u00f3ticos y naturales y dise\u00f1o de sus personajes[/b], siendo bastante loables para ser un juego de PS3  portado a  PC de aquellos a\u00f1os. Con una[b] optimizaci\u00f3n estupenda[/b] que corre bien en PCs mas o menos viejos (los i5  primeros con una  tarjetas GT 630 de 4Gb, como por ejemplo mi caso).\n\nEn cuanto a sus [b]DEFECTOS[/b], por lo menos para m\u00ed, un bug que arruinaba toda la buena optimizaci\u00f3n del juego cunado se colgaba al aparecer el el 2\u00ba boss con el ordenador que dije antes, pero si consegu\u00edas jugarlo con otro pc mas potente con tu cuenta de Steam no pasaba y podias guardar la partida en la nube y ya poder jugarlo en el PC  que daba problemas como el m\u00edo otra vez todo el juego sin m\u00e1s bugs.\nTambi\u00e9n el [b]sistema ampliado de mejora de habilidades[/b] me result\u00f3 un poco engorroso, porque ya no solo se mejoraba comprando las habilidades usando tus puntos de experiencia, sino tambi\u00e9n las pod\u00edas supuestamente mejorar cada una de ellas con puntos de maestr\u00eda...algo que yo me parece que apenas us\u00e9, porque no apreci\u00e9 algo nuevo o mejor.\nOtra cosa tambi\u00e9n que me parece que sobra es [b]la tienda[/b]. El juego tambi\u00e9n puedes usar objetos como el 1\u00ba o [b]consumibles[/b] y son la verdad \u00fatiles pero no hab\u00eda necesidad de buscar los lugares de los mapas en donde puedes viajar para ir a la tienda, porque hay de sobra con los que te encuentras rompiendo cosas y matando monstruos.\nOtra cosa que quiz\u00e1s te resulte algo peor que el 1\u00ba es su divisi\u00f3n de [b]habilidades de ataque[/b], con los ataques de fuego, hielo/vida y el del l\u00e1tigo de toda la vida, que esta vez esta hecho con la curiosa sangre de Gabriel, Aka Dr\u00e1cula Aka Dracul Aka principe de las tinieblas, m\u00e1s que nada porque se multiplican los movimientos por 3 en comparaci\u00f3n con el primero, pero es algo que solo se ve molesto en la adquisici\u00f3n de nuevas habilidades, porque  claro, para conseguirlas todas vas a tener que gastar m\u00e1s experiencia que en el primero, pero por lo dem\u00e1s no es dif\u00edcil de acostumbrarse y de jugar. Es algo parecido a los Devil May Cry con cada arma que usa. La [b]jugablilidad[/b] del juego creo que es c\u00f3moda, te puede resultar algo cansina, pero es por la cantidad de enemigos que hay, pero esta vez puedes evadirlos siguiendo adelante por el mapa si ya no es la primera vez que pasas por all\u00ed.\n\nEn [b]RESUMEN[/b], es una buena superproducci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 a la altura de lo que se esperaba para la conclusi\u00f3n de esta saga....quiz\u00e1s se echa de menos m\u00e1s bosses gigantescos tipo Shadow of the Colossus y que fuera tan sencillo como el primero, pero sus fallos son leves y los pros que tiene merecen sin duda jugarlo.", "timestamp_created": 1633180253, "timestamp_updated": 1653826130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100321447": {"recommendationid": "100321447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847140360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1633102224}, "language": "english", "review": "the game does not save progress", "timestamp_created": 1633116462, "timestamp_updated": 1633116462, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478526175022125244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100256896": {"recommendationid": "100256896", "author": {"steamid": "76561199192993566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1633489551}, "language": "english", "review": "Very gud", "timestamp_created": 1633035864, "timestamp_updated": 1633035864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100195796": {"recommendationid": "100195796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220161807", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1689103635}, "language": "english", "review": "Great castlvania game, i like the 3rd person real time action, it goes far from what most other castlvania games are designed to play like and it was done so well in this game!", "timestamp_created": 1632965085, "timestamp_updated": 1632965085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100143492": {"recommendationid": "100143492", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974211291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1633488294}, "language": "english", "review": "underrated.", "timestamp_created": 1632902379, "timestamp_updated": 1632902379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455833941698074341", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100106957": {"recommendationid": "100106957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986886000", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1686891673}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta piola, me re ceban este tipo de juegos hack-and-slash", "timestamp_created": 1632852193, "timestamp_updated": 1632852193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100099826": {"recommendationid": "100099826", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970412313", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1632934112}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a maybe. It's better than LoS 1 but that's not saying much. LoS2 has some good qualities but it is staggering how there are barely any elements of game design LoS2 doesn't squander in some way.\n\nI suppose you can say that it remains a good game to look at and listen to. The graphics are very PS3/360 era but are far from ugly. Levels and monster design are quite distinct and striking, they've managed to nail the Japanese gothic style very well. The music is ok, it fits and isn't overbearing but not very memorable.\n\nThe camera is much better in LoS2 in that you actually control it most of the time.\n\nThe voice acting is good, particularly Robert Carlyle. Shame it's LoS writing. You see in LoS they seemed to write themselves into a corner as the climax heavily plays on redemption and self forgiveness which then made it all the more mysterious how the final scene came to be. The DLC forgot or ignored the point of the climax and presented a non sequitur regarding Gabriel's growth for itself, Mirror of Fate and the start of LoS2. \n\nLoS2's writing is muddied, lazy and one of the worst examples of cutscene logic I've yet witnessed. It's still a mystery to me how Gabriel/Dracula is exploring these memories of him, Trevor and Marie while we know that's not how it played out due to Mirror of Fate.\n\nControls aren't very responsive, sometimes takes multiple attempts to register input. This lack of responsiveness always sucks all the more in games where timed inputs are required for parries. The combat has a miserable attempt at auto facing which can have you attack in the opposite direction you tell it to. \n\nIt has the worst stealth section I think I've ever played in a game. In general they make little sense as your character can easily overpower any foe you're hiding from, especially the section where you Dracula, Prince of Darkness hide from a boss from LoS1 that you beat as a human. But the section in the greenhouse is a masterclass in bad design. The floor makes noise in certain sections so you mist form over it, except the mist form is slower than a crawl and the hunter is homing in on you. Supposedly you distract it with bells however there aren't any in the longest section so GG. And then you just fight the hunter anyway, having gained no extra tool in the meantime making the stealth section pointless...\n\nFast travel is laughable, there are map rooms that take you to different districts of the city and the castle. However each district has multiple map rooms and you can't move between them, you just get a map room. Which one, lucky dip I guess!\n\nThere's a map but in terms of being useful beyond your immediate environment your SOL. You get a couple of rooms around you and no idea of where they link to the next sequence of rooms in order to plan a route. Though I will give credit and say at least the world map tells you how many secrets remain for you to find in the districts.\n\nSpeaking of secrets, there are a number of devices around the world that require keys to access new areas and upgrades. These keys are only obtainable in the castle afaik and you can only carry so many of them so you're going to have to find the nearest portal to the castle, go to the shop or kill the enemy that drops them, get your fill then clumsily renavigate the world (because again, fast travel is an obtuse ballache) unlock what you can then go back for more. FUN!\n\nFor traversal in platforming there are various hot points you can move/jump from/to. The start of a sequence is highlighted with a mini cluster of bats, once you're in a sequence you can press L2/LT to highlight available points to move to. Some platforming however needs you to jump ahead to the middle of a sequence and you just have to hope your man snags that point.\n\nThis is one of those games where the obvious stuff is always highlighted too much \"Here you need to do this thing. This glowy thing here. Let's look at the thing together for a minute. Maybe 2.\" and you can't skip it. If you restart a checkpoint, it'll show you again in case you forgot. Also, collectibles aren't saved so you'll need to grab those again.\n\nSpeaking of skipping, it'll always replay cutscenes. Boss intros, using the map room etc. I get it, I got it the first time. You can skip some but why replay them at all? Again I will give credit and say at least LoS2 has the option to skip QTEs.\n\nThere are other things but you get the bloody point.

Perdo despues de haber ganado el anterior juego de este no pude resistir la tentacion de volver a jugarlo. Y la pase fenomenal ya que ahora que lo jugue en pc tiene texturas en HD y corre a 60 fps.\n\nY todo un orgullo ya que en este juego gabriel hecho vampiro despierta de su largo sue\u00f1o en el mundo moderno, y Zobek lo necesita nuevamente para detener el resurgimiento de Satan. Y para eso Gabriel ahora llamado Dracula debe enfrentarse a ordas interminables de enemigos, tanto de los que moran su castillo como los demonios. Amo los demonios en cualquier tipo de ficcion. Y en este caso tambien en los videojuegos.\n\nHa sido todo un deleite masacrar y destripar de todas las formas y tama\u00f1os de los seres del averno.

No solo por la historia principal sino tambien por todos los escritos que vas encontrando a lo largo del juego, como si se tratase de una bilioteca antigua para conocer la historia de la ciudad, en donde alguna vez estuvo el castillo de Casttlevania. Ademas de los espectaculares dise\u00f1os de escenarios, y la sobresaliente banda sonora que en los momentos mas calmos es una dulzura para los oidos, y los momentos de mas accion es una sinfonia epica.\n\nJugar a esta clase de juegos te hace replantear el termino \"jueguito\"\n\nJugar a esta clase de juegos me pone muy contento porque me hizo olvidar por completo de no poder volver a jugar a dantes inferno y splatterhouse de 2010. Ya que son y siempre seran exclusivos de la ya difunta xbox 360. \n\nLa verdad he jugado montones de juegos de estudios espa\u00f1oles en estos ultimos a\u00f1os, y definitivamente me quedo con esta epoca de jericho y casttlevania lords of shadow 1 y 2, porque los de ahora son extremadamente dificiles. Tales como sogn of horror, fear the dark unknown y blasphemous. Lo cual es una verdadera lastima porque los juegos de aquella epoca ya no se venderian tan bien como ahora.

Unlocked through the ingame currency, which is mainly obtained from killing enemies.\n- HP and mana gauges. Only upgraded through finding hidden collectables.\n- Movement skills. Unlocked over time during story progression.\n\nCon:\n- The frequent stealth segments are barebones and mostly irrelevant. Only a single one stood out for me. Similar thing with the platforming, it is mostly just \"hold forward and jump\". In general, the game throws a lot of random mechanics together that it uses a few times in very basic ways and then disregards them.\n- Lots of backtracking through already cleared areas for upgrades and story progression. \n- Searching for upgrade collectables is a chore sometimes.\n- Story is kinda whack, as typical for hack and slash games for some reason. Lots of bland stereotypes.\n- It takes a very long time to unlock new things. Even the item shop is only unlocked about halfway through the game. This also means you are stuck with only a handful of short combos for the initial ~4 hours.\n- Consumables are overpowered.\n- Lots of long animations that interrupt the game flow, like when transforming for stealth, picking up a collectable, etc.\n- Annoying voice line loops, like bosses saying the same thing 20 times in a row. \n- Similarly annoying are all the different popups reminding you every 20 seconds that you have collected enough things to upgrade something.\n\nPro:\n- Good english voice acting.\n- Graphics are still okay by 2021.\n- While the story didn't strike me as amazing, it does do a few interesting things.\n- Once having unlocked a variety of different skills, the combat is pretty good. Especially the resource management aspect is fun. I imagine NG+ on harder difficulty is a lot more fun than the first playthrough on normal. \n- Interconnected levels, lots of hidden routes and secrets. Makes for decent exploration. Level design is generally good.\n- Large enemy variety.\n- Decent difficulty curve. \n\nSome further notes:\n- I only ran into a single bug, which was that the game didn't let me exit the item shop once, so I had to reload a checkpoint.\n- If it weren't for the upgrade system being tied to the hidden collectables, exploration would be a lot more fun. This is because it then wouldn't feel like you \"have\" to find everything.\n\nVerdict:\nThe core gameplay of Castlevania LoS2 is good, but there are a lot of hiccups along the way.

No I'm serious actually...and bats as well. Just like a bat out of hell Dracula has furry friends in both low and high places. Awaken from an extremely long eternal night and find some nice necks to chomp on. Whip your blood back and forth (Whip it real good). Explore Dracula's back to the future adventure. Talk about a miserable pile of secrets. You are the prince of darkness! The dragon Dracul! What a terrible night to have a curse.\n\n\nThis is the direct sequel to Lords of Shadow 1, which was one of my favorite Castlevania games. It feels like you are playing a medieval version of God of War. If you liked the GBA/DS SoTN style Metroidvania ones you might not enjoy this one.\n\nHonestly this was nothing like I expected it would be after Lords of Shadow 1. The first LoS felt a lot more like a classic Castlevania game with faeries and werewolves, wargs and spiders. Dracula wasn't the endgame boss though so it wasn't exactly a normal Castlevania. It was more like Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword in that it was an origin story of sorts. Lords of Shadow 2 was pretty different. It felt much more like Legacy of Kain Blood Omen 2 or Defiance or Soul Reaver than it did Castlevania or Lords of Shadow 1. It plays like Lords of Shadow but the story and atmosphere feel very much like a Legacy of Kain game (I love Legacy of Kain so I don't mind it at all).\n\nYou awaken as Dracula after many centuries of a dirt nap in your coffin. If you like me were hoping for an explanation as to what happened between the end of LoS1 and the start of LoS2 you will unfortunately be disappointed as very little in the way of explanations given. They do briefly touch upon it but it's a very brief description of what happened in the centuries between the last game and this one. Barely any info at all is given as to how Dracula became what he now is. The only real explanation we have is from the DLC that was in LoS1 Reverie, and a minute or two here and there as flashbacks in this one. Actually Mirror of Fate HD helps bridge the gap a lot more than LoS2 does but you are kind of left to piece it all together by yourself. Seems he went off the deep end after the end of LoS1 and hid himself away in his castle for eternity. In doing so he slowly lost all of his humanity and hope and out of hatred and spite and misery became Dracula.\n\nIt is an open world game that takes place in a huge city built on the foundations of Dracula's ancient castle. The city is split into 3 or 4 big areas that you explore throughout the course of the story and you can free roam and explore them as you wish, there are many secrets that have been scattered around the map. Much like Lords of Shadow 1 you find gems that upgrade your health and magic powers. There are items that restore health, give you temporary unlimited magic, slow down your enemies, there is even a pendant that instantly kills all enemies on screen. There are sacrificial fountains that grant Kleidos gems which unlock hidden challenges accessible from the chupacabra shop.  There are scrolls as well like the previous game that add history and lore to the series and help fill in the gaps between the prologue and when Dracula later awakens. There is a handy item called the Dodo Egg which will help you locate hidden items which was really helpful in finding the hidden items. \n\nAs for weapons and abilities, most of the things you had in LoS1 make a comeback, but you sort of have the \"dark\" version of them you could say. The vampire killer has been replaced by a whip made of pure blood, and there is the void sword which replaces the \"light\" power that has ice powers and heals upon hit. On the \"fury/dark\" power you still have the fists of fury that do massive damage and break enemy shields. While you initially buy the skills and powers for each weapon with points you have to use the skills in order to gain XP for them and level up the weapon. As far as I can tell the additional levels don't unlock any new abilities but the level 3 does look pretty sweet.\n\nThe epic boss fights make a return and you also get to explore Dracula's castle and find out more about his past and learn a little more about his son Trevor (who also makes an appearance he has white hair you probably know who it is, he is in the Castlevania anime too). Basically it's a fun open world romp where you get to be Dracula and rain down death and destruction on...pretty much everything.\n", "timestamp_created": 1626326887, "timestamp_updated": 1626326928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61454308032989502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95723947": {"recommendationid": "95723947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996339422", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1629921023}, "language": "english", "review": "hey GAME ( do you know how many boss fights i went in with minimum health and weapon obs noo it was such a sweat, it was got awful at least , give me a sighn or something that there will be a boss fight come on ).\ni really love the game , it gets challanging sometimes but keep pushing . i became familiar with the castlevania series when the show was up on netflix , GOD i loved it so much , now im loving this game", "timestamp_created": 1626269262, "timestamp_updated": 1626609518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554257094860076904", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95605380": {"recommendationid": "95605380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169548072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1048, "last_played": 1677522529}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Totalmente recomendado, mec\u00e1nicas buenas, lucha espectacular, luce estupendo, un mapa inter-conectado con casi todo, tiene sus lados sin sentido; Eso si no seria algo muy extenso y al otro lado estaria lo que nos ocupa todo el tiempo son las peleas, y la asombrosa est\u00e9tica del castillo", "timestamp_created": 1626100736, "timestamp_updated": 1626100736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95587926": {"recommendationid": "95587926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157894229", "num_games_owned": 1064, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1013, "last_played": 1628431316}, "language": "english", "review": "Castlevania: Dracul's wholesum reddit moment", "timestamp_created": 1626077560, "timestamp_updated": 1626077560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95578360": {"recommendationid": "95578360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019545450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1626142507}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a steaming pile of garbage.

Most of the stealth sections take place here as well. It\u2019s a meme to complain about the stealth sections at this point, and they do make up a tiny part of the game, but they really are shallow and putrid and it\u2019s not clear why they\u2019re in the game at all. In addition, the city\u2019s scaling is kind of screwed up, Gabula is tiny compared to everything else, if you put him next to mundane objects like lampposts or cars he looks like the prince of manlets.\n\nThe castle sections are a bit better, one part even reminded me a bit of Psychonauts in a good way. But with how you get teleported in and how little these sections relate to the city to its hard not to feel like it\u2019s just a bunch of random junk made in a vacuum and then smashed into the game haphazardly. The castle also contains the worst stealth section in the game, in its defense it does introduce stealth mechanics beyond line of sight, unfortunately they\u2019re borked. You can ring bells to distract the guy, but when I rang the bell he just ran immediately to me (nowhere near him, projectile not in line of sight) and instant-failed me. Despite his own-zone attack you fight him immediately after the stealth section with no real change to him or you and he goes down like a chump, which makes you wonder what the point of it even was.\n\nSpoilers follow, because these sections are just too insane to leave out.\nWithin the first 30 minutes Gabula vomits a stream of blood into the power source of a giant steampunk Christian robot, killing it instantly.\nA big titty mind vampire in Gabula\u2019s mind-castle seduces Gabula into drinking her hypno-blood, and then once you get past her stealth section and counteract her hypno-blood with Gabula\u2019s mind-wife\u2019s blood, she encases herself in an electrical sphere and tries to bowl you over.\nA man drops a magic rock in the middle of a boss fight and then grows 5 times his size, you stop him by smashing the rocks surrounding the arena for 30 seconds and hes so slow I don\u2019t think he got an attack off on me. The next phase of the boss fight is a QTE.\nThe same man kills himself minutes later for you, minutes after meeting you, for nebulous gain on Gabula\u2019s behalf and without considering any alternatives.\nYou spend like half the game and multiple castle visits trying to get an antidote for a mutant plague for a mutant for nebulous reasons. Once you get the antidote Patrick Stewart opens a portal for you to teleport you back to the start, why didn\u2019t he let you teleport there from the start, grab the antidote and go back into the portal? Would take too long and they\u2019d notice the portal, stupid! Anyway then you find out the mutant is Bad Guy 1 and she tries to kill you by blowing up the building you\u2019re in. Why did she merely pretend to be an idiot and pointlessly spend several hours chained to some rock? Good question! I dunno maybe she liked it.\nYou spend a long time trying to kill Bad Guy 1, much less time trying to kill Bad Guy 2, and then Bad Guy 3 and the endgame take like an hour put together. The game\u2019s clearly not done.\n\nIf this review feels patchwork and disjointed, that\u2019s just what playing the game is like. I spent most of LoS1 annoyed and most of MoF bored. I spent most of LoS2 just befuddled. This might be the worst LoS game as far as grading media with a beginning middle and end goes, but I think I enjoyed it the most out all of them. LoS2 is so bizarre and nonsensical I got a lot of value out of staring at the freakshow unfolding before my eyes. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend buying or playing it unless you\u2019re insane though.", "timestamp_created": 1624672678, "timestamp_updated": 1625162150, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539766013622283936", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94190723": {"recommendationid": "94190723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178912998", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1628466076}, "language": "english", "review": "Very different to the first game in terms of environments, enemies and general story, similar gameplay with the combat but generally really good. :D", "timestamp_created": 1624403169, "timestamp_updated": 1624403169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94180753": {"recommendationid": "94180753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115162063", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2510, "last_played": 1627672886}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, play Lords of Shadow 1 first, then this one.

Unfortunately Lords of Shadow 2 just barely scrapes across the line for me of being able to recommend it.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 is an attempt at an open modern 3d world however it is no where near as fleshed out as it should be. This game is WAY to short and I don't say that about a lot of games. Many characters as well as important plot points are brief and lack the amount of depth you would expect going into this title after playing the first one. The forced stealth sequences are awful. Poorly developed mechanics that should of been looked into more.\n\nNow what are things to like about Lords of Shadow 2 and why do I ultimately recommend it? The primary thing Lords of shadow 2 does right is presentation. The cutscenes are dramatic, gory, and overall intense. The boss fights in the 2nd and 3rd act of the game are great (exactly the way the good bosses were in the original). The change from light and dark magic to the blade and claws is interesting as both change the range of your attack along with having their own control and combos.\n\nOverall I was satisfied with my playthrough of the final big castlevania title.

I didn't play the first LoS chapter so my review is limited to this game per se.\n\nThe main character is fantastic, I love all the remands to Bram Stoker, this is the real Dracula, and his story and genesis has a lot in common with the Bram Stoker's story too. Playing this game actually feels like being Dracul.\nThe plot itself may not be the most astonishing one but it's something I appreciated a lot (I read the plot of the first LoS after beating LoS2 and it added a lot of info but the game per se has no holes, also thanks to the animted intro which is long but not boring).\n\nThere are also probelms, of course. The main problem, the one which really makes me hate the combat sometimes, is due to the excessively large hit boxes of enemies: you often get hit while you're behind the enemy or 5 meters high from ground so when you have to face many enemies filling the combo meter is nearly impossible (as well as staying alive, at higher dificultes). Another problem, again in combat, is that you often make a strategy but it gets broken by cinematics which happen suddently in the middle of the fight, making you waste time, losing collectibles, move you somwhere else breaking the combo and so on.\nAll those problems make the optional challenges a real pain, I gave up on them.\nStealth action is not much fun, not for me at all, but there's only one time when it really becomes frustrating, a really brief part.\nA hybrid pre-boss/stealth part was, in my opinion, poorly designed to the point to be really frustrating.\n\nOverall this is one of the most fun games I've played and probably the best Dracul ever (in games).", "timestamp_created": 1615383026, "timestamp_updated": 1615383569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87974078": {"recommendationid": "87974078", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985969658", "num_games_owned": 962, "num_reviews": 653, "playtime_forever": 1725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1725, "last_played": 1615057749}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the definition of a game that gets a \"meh\" or thumbs sideways.

The wolf portals all take you to the exact same spot of one world, and the map rooms do the same, so theyre not very helpful, and for collecting stuff you have to do a ton of backtracking, which is normal in this game, but because its a 3d world with no map or direction and 2 different worlds with 2 convoluted fast travel systems at only singular points that take you to 1 singular point of each world, its pretty horribly done. \n\nThen theres the combat. One horrible mechanic that some games do and for what reason they think its good i cant fathom, you only \"intermittently stun lock enemies\". This means certain enemies cant be stun locked, while others can be but only randomly. Some hits will stun the guys, others won't, and sometimes in the middle of being stun locked they suddenly wont and can attack you. But you, this super powerful guy, are stun locked by every hit and have no way of breaking it, where as minor weak enemies the rules don't apply. Its lazy design to make a game harder with inconsistent rules which is the cardinal sin of a 3rd person action game. The actual action isn't bad, as theres different weapons and dodging/blocking and combos but once again theres a lot of problems in the delivery. To level up weapons you have to unlock a ton of different attacks and then use those attacks repeatedly to master them which you then add to your mastery and when youve done it 4x with 4 different attacks you level up once and thats the only way to increase damage of the weapon. But the problem is most of the special attacks are useless and clunky to use. This is because its like 3 button presses simultaneously with a held button in there, etc. And because youre being attacked by 3-4 enemies at once that suddenly can choose not to be stun locked and attack you, you never have time to do all these unncesseary button presses or you jsut get hit, so you stick to more basic combos. This means you will never master your weapons and you never level up whcih is dumb, as it should just use currency or some actually useful mechanic. The dodging is supper finnicky and sometimes you want to dodge back and it makes you go sideways, the air dodge only has you dodge down to the ground and you cant move linearly in the air which makes no sense. The block is useless and doesn't work 1/2 the time and the synchronized block is even more useless. Half the time because youre fighting 3 enemies and theres no lock on for some reason when you try to block youre facing the wrong way and just get hurt. \n\nAnother problem is the \"other weapons\". Each has its own mana for some reason and in order to absorb it from enemies you have to stop moving and press l3/r3, which is made worse by absorb range only reaching 2 feet. Then theres the mana itself. Enemies sometimes drop it and sometimes don't, and even if they do its usually only a tiny bit and only if you dont do the quicktime kill. The game wants you to fill uip this 20 hit unbroken hit streak which then allows you to attack people for more mana drops. But as said before, due to fighting many enemies at once that can suddenly not be stun locked its hard to get that. Then when you have to fight guys that require only a special weapon to hurt but you have no mana but theres no way to hurt them so you cant build combos to hurt them so you cant get mana its just a stupid cycle the devs created. Why make enemies that can only be damage from a limited resource that you also barely give out. Theres other problems like using consumables making you stand there for 4 seconds using it leading to you being hurt or interrupted. Theres just so many things that are counter intuitive and seem like they didn't test it. Theres also the problem with stupid ideas like requiring 5 collectibles pieces of anything to thgen get a boost, meaning you needs \"hundreds\" of heart/mana pieces before you see a big boost. Other problems like double jump coming too late and only being used for backtracking which takes way too long because of the horrible designed fast travel and level layout. The boss fights are decent and not too many are gimmicky, the graphics and animations and voice acting are good. Theres just too many problems to recommend, but its not horrible. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1615059294, "timestamp_updated": 1615059294, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496732026338577271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87946871": {"recommendationid": "87946871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100803664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 815, "last_played": 1615003318}, "language": "english", "review": "So.. I enjoyed this game. I completely understand the mixed reviews. The stealth sections are questionable and the modern day setting is probably not for everyone.\n\nDespite all that I find this game a worthy sequel. MercurySteam tried to address criticisms from the first game with a camera that can be controlled and IMO more responsive combat. Like the first game the artwork is excellent and the music is, for me, the highlight. Some boss fights are pretty fun and there are lots of neat scenes throughout the game like the Toy Maker battle.\n\nI like the story though if you have not played Mirror of Fate there as a huge gap this game pretty much summarizes for you at the start. The modern day setting can be a little bizzare, but its more 50/50 with the other half of the game taking place in Dracula's castle in the past.\n\nCombat is great, same as first game but more fluid/smooth. Voice work is great with same actors from Lords of Shadow. I will say the beginning tutorial of this game is incredible. It really goes all out and gives a strong first impression.

This left fans to wonder how the sequel would continue the story, either as Dracula or fighting against the protagonist from the original game.  Four years later, Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 answered the question, but it\u2019s a question that probably was more interesting to think about than how Konami approached it. \n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 chooses to continue with the same protagonist of Gabriel Belmont, now called Dracula, and picks up the story after a second game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate, though it quickly glosses over those stories, even when they play a pivotal point in the development of a few characters.\n\nWith the player now in charge of one of the most fearsome vampires, one who the franchise has used multiple times since the beginning, it would be a chance to deliver an interesting look at both the character and mythos at the core of the Castlevania franchise.  Instead, Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 feels like it tries to stay true to the formula the series has embraced with the main character fighting some great evil with numerous minions.\n\nThe biggest problem with Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 and one we will return to multiple times is that this isn\u2019t a generic Castlevania game, in which you usually fight against the forces of Dracula.  Instead in Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2, you\u2019re playing as Dracula, and yet the game fails to make that feel like anything other than an inconvenience to the story that the game wants to tell.\n\nIn Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2, Dracula is fighting against a greater evil in the form of Satan and now must battle his forces of evil.  While Zobek from the original game returns as a guide for Dracula, this feels strange considering how Zobek was used in Castlevania: Lords of Shadows\u2019 plot.   Besides, much of Dracula\u2019s personal forces turn evil adding new fights, and ultimately Zobek has Dracula hunt down various forces of Satan.  All three of these stories happen simultaneously in Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 and if they sound confusing, that\u2019s because they are. \n\nCastlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 also suffers from an excess of cutscenes that are either unnecessary, or longer than they should be, and this makes the player less engaged with the story, and experience because sitting through a 2-minute cutscene to see a hint on how to beat the next room doesn\u2019t feel that much different than sitting around to hear two characters the player isn\u2019t interested in talking among themselves.\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 isn\u2019t a game that has a clear narrative to tell, but rather talks about bits and pieces from numerous storylines and acts as if it's a story that needs to be told, and should be told.  Instead, it\u2019s mostly just a jumbled mess of scenes that happen.  \n\nA similar thing happens with the level design of Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2.  The game constantly moves Dracula around to different locations, as well as teleporting him to spots and leading him to the next objective.  But in general, the map feels strange and misshaped.  The buildings and levels that Dracula finds himself in don\u2019t feel particularly interesting.  \n\nEven the few times you revisit an area you notice how similar it is to every other area and city street you\u2019ll come upon.  There\u2019s not a memorable map or interesting location in Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 and that really hurts the experience of exploring these locations.\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 also tries to add a bit of open-world exploration but contains a completely linear story and progression so the major benefit of the open-world format is lost, and it just becomes a way to explore for unnecessary benefits as the game itself is rather easy.  Having to backtrack to just find the upgrades with new abilities doesn\u2019t help this process either.\n\nI mentioned that the biggest problem with Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 is Dracula, and it\u2019s in the gameplay that I find it to be the most egregious.  The player never feels like Dracula, Dracula is a blood-sucking vampire who is known for his absolute brutality and violence.  He\u2019s been the antagonist or final boss in so many Castlevania\u2019s that one might wonder what it would be like to control him and possibly terrorize the Belmonts, or the civilians he might find.  Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 starts with Dracula attacking a woman in a cutscene to draw her blood into him to regain his strength.  This is the first and last civilian the player even sees in Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2.  \n\nInstead Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 focuses only on combat with the forces of Satan, and while Dracula can suck the blood of his enemies, they\u2019re the same type of villains any game could have.  Even the \u201csucking blood\u201d type of gameplay could be done in numerous ways, such as the Glory Kills in the newest Doom releases.   \n\nThis is Dracula, and yet, everything the player is told to do is \u201cfight the bigger evil.\u201d  If the character was switched out for any human Belmont, the gameplay could operate the same, even the summoning of a health regenerating blade, and stronger attacking gauntlets don\u2019t feel like part of Dracula\u2019s normal weaponry.\n\nThen there are the stealth gameplay sections, that really feel out of place when talking about Dracula, repetitive enemies who seem to be able to take huge chunks of the player\u2019s life force away, and Quick Time Events which are always a mistake, but feel like a major one with when the game kills your character and then repeats the same segment over again.  Players can disable QTEs in the options menu, but having better cutscenes that didn\u2019t require QTEs would flow better in both formats. \n\nNot everything in Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 is bad.  The enemy designs and the bosses look particularly good.  In fact, every boss is both very interesting and unique, it makes the issues with the level design stand out more with so many locations feeling so uninspired.  Quite a few bosses are exceptional fights, and that\u2019s when Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 earns a lot of the credit.\n\nBut ultimately the boss fights are the only thing I really enjoyed with Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2.  Otherwise, the entire experience was uninteresting and boring, and when you\u2019re playing as Dracula in a Castlevania game, that sounds wrong.  \n\nA few changes and I might have enjoyed the core of Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2.  Better level design, a few gameplay additions which feel more like playing a major vampire such as attacking innocents, or using them to restore your health, or just interesting levels to explore could have helped.  \n\nAs it is, Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 is quite uninteresting, and feels like a game that I can\u2019t recommend, nor is it one that makes me feel bad about this fact.  It\u2019s also the last entry into the Castlevania franchise and now that I\u2019ve completed it, I don\u2019t feel like I should mourn Konami moving away from video games.  I instead mourn that Konami couldn\u2019t continue producing interesting video games that I wanted to play. \n\nI ultimately give Castlevania: Lords of the Shadows 2 an arbitrary \n\n4/10 \n\nIt might be higher if this was a random game but coming after so many games in a famous franchise, not being able to find an interesting game here feels particularly insulting. \n\nIf you enjoyed this review

If I have any advice, it's that don't ever, EVER listen to reviewers. If you want to know if a game is good, play it. Many game reviewers get into the business because they have attempted before to \"make it\" in the gaming industry, yet fail, and end up reviewing games instead of making them. So they become reviewers. And as such of failure, they usually don't know what they're talking about.\n\nThe \"Stealth\" parts are very few, and are less Stealthy and more just puzzles, which were always fun in the first game and still are. I've never been caught once in the stealth, and this far into the game there were two stealth sections, maybe two minutes the first time, 10 the second. The rats are mainly used to access secret areas and explore the developer's very well-thought out level design.\n\nThe story is neat. Seeing Zobek again is cool, and seeing some of the Belmonts come back, including Alucard, is awesome for fans of the earlier games (These are not spoilers).\n\nAnother complain is environmental design. And while I have to somewhat agree with people on the London missions, they are fairly short. I found that you spend way more time inside Dracula's Castle in his manifested version of it, fighting interesting enemies and meeting up with familiar faces from not only the previous game, but from general folklore. The Manifested Castle portions of the game seem like a \"Metroidvania\" setting. The game is no longer completely linear in this regard. You are free to explore the castle and as you unlock more abilities, you can go into areas you could not previously reach, a true staple of \"Metroidvaia\".", "timestamp_created": 1605874130, "timestamp_updated": 1605874130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79490444": {"recommendationid": "79490444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336163630", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1759, "last_played": 1606788190}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice story loved it", "timestamp_created": 1605756648, "timestamp_updated": 1605756648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79445911": {"recommendationid": "79445911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126990846", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1698810687}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1605677063, "timestamp_updated": 1605677063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79336569": {"recommendationid": "79336569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796410096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1688959829}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego para pasar el rato sin duda konami en RPG de castlevania no me ha decepcionado :D", "timestamp_created": 1605490212, "timestamp_updated": 1605490212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79253618": {"recommendationid": "79253618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271737797", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1220, "last_played": 1605363599}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love the castlevania series then you like this entry as well.

Decided to just bite the bullet and purchased the first LoS, played it, and absolutely loved it! \n\nThen, coming to this game I was very apprehensive due to all the negativity surrounding this game. Well I was an idiot once again. I'm about 3/4 of my way through the main storyline as of writing this, and LoS2 is now my second favourite Castlevania of all time (right behind SotN). \n\nI'll address the negativity this game receives:\n\n1. Stealth sections\n-These aren't bad like every man and his dog raves on about, and the majority (from what I have experience) happen when Dracula has just returned without his powers so they make sense from a story perspective\n\n2. KB&M Support\n- Don't know, don't care about this as I play most Action and RPG games with a controller like a normal person\n\n3. Camera control\n- The camera works fine for me, and I absolutely hated the fixed camera in the first LoS game as you would be travelling along, camera would change, and bam, you are moving in a random direction because of the camera change\n\n\nSo in summary, I love this game. It has the Castlevania gothic vibe, Castlevania 3D fighting, excellent Castlevania story that continues on from the previous LoS entries and you play as freakin' Dracula for crying out loud (Konami or whoever picks up Castlevania in the future, make this a more common occurrence please!)\n\nDon't fall in to the negativity cesspit like I did.

Big time. It sucks as an action game because its pacing is all over the place, it has terrible stealth sections and an easily exploitable power-up system that quickly makes you overpowered. It sucks as an adventure game because the exploration is nonexistent, the plot is bad and the characters are shoehorned so badly that you're gonna think you're watching some kind of parody. Finally, it doesn't just suck at being a Castlevania but it takes a massive dump over it, putting the final nail on the coffin of another series that Konami did all it was in their power to completely destroy. I swear that these guys must seriously hate every single one of their historical franchises with passion, because they ruined all of them. No survivors.\n\nThe first Lords of Shadow was still a disappointment in being a Castlevania, but at least it managed to be decent as an action game and kept a minimum of respect towards the original source material (DLC excluded, that was awful). This sequel showed no mercy in completely destroying the original lore, turning Dracula into some kind of powerless wretch who is constantly manipulated by Satan and the one who's supposed to be his most faitfhul servant - Zobek, aka Death - thus being unable to do nearly anything on his own. Characters from the original series, from Simon Belmont to Alucard, are randomly thrown in without a real logic and their backstories completely messed up, just for the sake of saying \"see? This is Castlevania, the good guys are there\". It's insulting, and the ending makes no sense either since it was a blatant attempt to leave room for sequels and make more cashgrab. Luckily it was a huge flop, as it should've been, and we never heard of it again. Thanks goodness.\n\nA couple of ideas weren't even so bad, like exploring the mind of the man behind Dracula and his torments and manifesting the castle as a part of his own psyche, but they were executed so poorly that any good intention behind this trainwreck went pining for the fjords. A complete disaster. I have no idea how anyone could honestly recommend this game, since it sucked to me even when I knew very little of the Castlevania franchise.

Combat is mediocre, with most enemies being boring to fight, or worse, annoying to fight. The whole \"armored\" enemy concept should be redone from the ground up, and there are way too many untelegraphed ranged attacks that can't be blocked or routinely avoided to have the combo system this game does. There's way, way too much backtracking and not nearly enough portals to go around, and in some areas you're going through load screen after load screen after load screen. \n\nAnd to top it all off, they thought this game needed stealth sections. Really, really bad stealth sections, some of which are instant kills, and while the quick time events are easier in this one, there are other long sections where you have to do things *exactly* the way the devs wanted it to go or you're instantly dead. \n\nWhen the combat is good, it's really good. But the trash mob fights are rarely good, they respawn way too frequently, and the bosses are pretty easy.\n\nIn short, if you liked the first one, maybe just play that again.

The combat mechanics are a copy of the first except you acquire moves in a different way.\n2. It is reasonably long and somewhat varied.\n3. There are some nice story bits and fun but few an far between.\n\nCONS:\n\nI will put this specially at the top as it is extremely INFURIATING:\nThe game wants you to go back to collect secrets, HOWEVER the enemies that spawn can't be SKIPPED all the time as once you try to climb away (which almost all areas require), enemies get a special animated throw attack that makes you fall down. YOU can avoid it in places/sometimes BUT it's SO BAD as I don't want spend my time grinding this useless fights.\n\n1. Combat has at least one terrible design flaw. It is the fact that some enemies now have guns... and just shoot you from 10 miles away. Also, there's a bloody unit that can chain shoot you from a distance and you can't do anything once you get shot once and get stuck in that animation - it's ABYSMAL. Lots of that makes the combat absolutely terrible and you can't sequence a good amount of moves.\n2. The actual levels are quite dull for the most part and even though they've tried to create an open world of sorts, it hasn't worked that well. \n3. IF you buy it - make sure to acquire all powers before you go start going back and collecting items as it gets very repetitive (wings are the last thing). \n4. The story is borderline acceptable. It's very hacked up and honestly quite uninventive. I did not really enjoy it.\n5. No replaybility at all. I wouldn't want to touch EVER again.\n\nAll that said, if you can buy it for the price of an ice-cream and want to just go through the story, it's OK. But I wouldn't recommend trying to get the secrets or anything else - it's all worthless.\n", "timestamp_created": 1594491774, "timestamp_updated": 1594491774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552412331104278564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72409931": {"recommendationid": "72409931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844296503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 8123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2383, "last_played": 1687499043}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Debo decir que realmente es un juego extraordinario, en todos los aspectos, una historia que hace un cierre magnifico a esta saga, que tiene un trasfondo mas profundo que solo ir venciendo enemigos por ahi, sistema de combate mejor que primero, muy entretenido la verdad, no es dificil de aprender ademas que puedes utilizar las combinaciones de ataques que mas te gusten o te sean mas facil de ejecutar, tiene una cantidad idonea de puzzles que no rompen con el ritmo de la historia, los enemigos son muy variables por lo que pudes optar por distintas estretagias (las que tu quieras inventarte) para vencerlos, puedes movilizarte por la ciudad o el castillo a tu antojo para volver por objetos o mejoras sin que tengas que rehacer una mision en concreto, simplemente vas y ya como lo en los castlevanias de toda la vida. Igual en el apartado grafico esta muy bien tomando en cuenta cuando salio al mercado y sobre todo los escenarios, hechos de manera hermosa y artistica, vale la pena detener un momento tu avanza para simplemente contemplar lo que te rodea. La musica es increible realmente una obra de arte. Y pues al concluir el juego puedes seguir explorando, iniciar de nuevo en una dificultad mas alta o simplemente jugar los retos, que ponen a prueba la paciencia y tu capacidad para generar estrategias.

It goes full force into the premise hinted at during the ending of the original LoS, putting the player in the shoes of Dracula in the modern day (or really, near future) fighting against Satan trying to take over the world. It's an amazing concept, and I honestly wish this was in the mainstream Castlevania continuity so that this could have been the \"Year 2000 Event\" that was spoken about in the DS games. \n\nBy putting you in the shoes of the series long antagonist, Dracula, LoS is able to explore some interesting territory that no other Castlevania game has before or since (especially since Konami committed sudoku and jumped into only making Pachinko machines shortly after this was published). Like the fact that Castlevania itself is a living magical entity that draws you into itself so it can resurrect and drive Dracula into malevolence by dwelling on his pain. Or that, from Dracula's perspective, the Belmont line is a constant nuisance that gets in the way of his real enemy (Satan, again). \n\nNeat ideas. Also neat is that this game takes a stronger approach toward Metroidvania design in having interconnected worlds rather than just levels like the original LoS did. As you progress and get new abilities you unlock more pathways around these worlds and it's satisfying to open them up. Especially since both of them (the castle and the modern gothic city built on the castle's ruins) are gorgeous to look at. \n\nOh, and like in the first LoS, the voice-acting is top-notch as they have some fantastic actors  putting in solid work here.\n\nSo what's the problem? \n\nMostly it's that the combat, while still fundamentally good, gets pretty repetitive pretty quickly. Lots of enemies have built in defenses that can only be circumvented using the same tactic or move over and over, and these enemies respawn whenever you come back to an area after enough loading zones away so you'll be repeating lots of fights again and again as you traipse back and forth across the two worlds. \n\nAt the same time, only a few of the boss fights in this game are any good, most of them early on in the adventure. The latter half of the game mostly doesn't have many good fights, which, since that's the focus of the LoS games, is a really big problem. On top of this, there's an incredibly underdeveloped and very punishing but not actually hard stealth system that makes sense at the start of the game when you're weak but none whatsoever by the end when you're stronger. It just gets annoying and tedious when you run into these segments later on, and it's not a good mix-up from the brawls.\n\nWorse, the story gets dumber and more predictable as you progress, and end on sequel bait that we know will never get fulfilled at this point. It also feels really rushed in the latter half too, with a few major contrivances that pop up just to get everything to its conclusion that leave the impression that the devs ran out of time so had to tie a few threads together to finish the game by deadline. \n\nLoS 2 isn't afraid to get really weird and really dark at times. And in those moments it does, I can appreciate the boldness it takes in doing so. But it's also disjointed and tedious and I don't think the moments of delightful bizarreness it has will be enough for more than a few hardcore Castlevania fans to want to purchase it outright. \n\nIf a really pretty, really gonzo Castlevania game sounds good to you, get this when it's on a steep sale one day.

A Champion of Light. But I fell. Fell into darkness, and now... I am feared as The Prince of Darkness. Ironic, don't you think?\"[/i][/h1]\n[i]Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2[/i] is a third-person action-adventure game and the final entry in the [i]Lords of Shadow[/i] series. You control Gabriel Belmont, who is now known as Dracula, and your main weapon is the Shadow Whip, which is very similar to the Combat Cross from past games. To fully understand Gabriel\u2019s story and how he turned into Dracula, I highly recommend playing the first game before this one, and that you will be seeing familiar characters.\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n\u2714\ufe0f Very good story with interesting side characters and well-made cutscenes.\n\u2714\ufe0f Gabriel, the main protagonist, is interesting and likable.\n\u2714\ufe0f Improved combat with more weapons and abilities to choose from.\n\u2714\ufe0f Free-moving camera.\n\u2714\ufe0f Challenging enemies and excellent boss fights.\n\u2714\ufe0f The graphics look absolutely stunning.\n\u2714\ufe0f Character models and facial expressions are improved and look great.\n\u2714\ufe0f The game is well optimized.\n\u2714\ufe0f Great soundtrack. \n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n\u274c Tedious stealth sections.\n\u274c Some pointless puzzles.\n\u274c Kill animations take too long and get repetitive.\n\u274c Some areas feel linear and claustrophobic.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nLike in the first game, you control Gabriel - now known as Dracula, the Prince of Darkness -  and you wake up from a deep sleep, centuries later in your cathedral, which is located in present day Metropolis. You found out that Satan is returning to Earth and it is up to you, with the help of your former enemy Zobek (voiced by Sir Patrick Stewart), to stop and destroy him once and for all. \n\nIt starts off with an excellent tutorial sequence and a very well-made intro that explains the events of the previous two games. The cutscenes are well directed and just fun to watch (with few awkward scenes here and there), and I enjoyed the banter between Gabriel and other characters. \n\nIn the previous game, all the characters are interesting, mysterious and intriguing, and you will meet familiar ones from past games. Gabriel is more fleshed out and is very likable, as the story focuses more on him and his family. Overall, the story is far better in the previous games, with well-made cutscenes and very good plot twists that I didn\u2019t see coming, and it kept me invested until the end. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[u]Combat[/u]\nBeing Dracula now, your main weapon is the [b]Shadow Whip[/b], and it is pretty much the same as the Combat Cross so I felt right at home. The combat is more fast-paced and feels a lot smoother, you can now dash and leap during fights with more ease and greater accuracy, and you can drain the blood of your enemies to heal. Kill animations are back and they are varied from one enemy to another, but some take too long to finish and can get repetitive after a while. \n\nInstead of the medallions from the first game, two new weapons are added to your arsenal; the Void Sword that replenishes your health when attacking enemies and can freeze them for a short period of time, and Chaos Claws that inflict more damage and can break certain armors and shields. Both weapons have their own combos and abilities that you can unlock using points that you earn from killing enemies.\n \n[u]Stealth[/u]\nProbably the worst feature in the game. You will be doing some tedious stealth missions throughout the story, and hiding from certain security guards. Those stealth sections feel so out of place, since you, the almighty \"Prince of Darkness\", aren't able to kill those security guards even in the late game, but they can easily kill you with one or two hits.\n\n[u]Enemies & Bosses[/u]\nThe enemies are diverse and challenging, even on normal difficulty, and you can sometimes see them fight each other in some parts of the world. Bosses aren't as frequent as in the first game, but they are epic and feel more cinematic, a huge step up from the previous games.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129747647\n\n[u]Puzzles[/u]\nThe puzzles are easy and less frequent, since the main focus is on combat and exploration. However, most of them, especially the stealth puzzles, feel unnecessary and a chore to go through; It is baffling to see Dracula defeating monsters twice his size, but struggling with locked doors or not able to go to the next floor of a building without doing certain puzzles.\n\n[u]Difficulty[/u]\nI played on the [b]Lords of Shadow[/b] (Hard) difficulty; the enemies and bosses are tougher and deal more damage but remain fair and balanced, as you will be using your abilities, weapons and combos that you learn to slay them and progress through the game.\n\n[u]Other Changes[/u]\n\ud83c\udf1f [b]Free-moving camera[/b] is used instead of the fixed camera like in the previous games, and it is a great change, since it enhances the exploration and combat.\n\ud83c\udf1f [b]Platforming[/b] is better and faster-paced, as Gabriel moves much faster now.\n\ud83c\udf1f [b]QTEs[/b] are back, but you can disable them in the game's settings and continue playing the game without them.\n\ud83c\udf1f [b]Soldier\u2019s scrolls[/b] are back but are called diaries and memorials instead. They only offer more lore of the world and the Belmonts instead of hints to solve certain puzzles.\n\ud83c\udf1f The game constantly gives you hints (sometimes not even related to the gameplay, such as how to view artwork), so I recommend turning it off in the menu immediately.\n\ud83c\udf1f There\u2019s [b]New Game+[/b], and you can still keep playing the game even after defeating the final boss to improve and fully upgrade your abilities, if you want.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Level Design[/h1]\nThe game looks beautiful; the character models and their facial expressions look more alive and detailed. The lighting is great, and some of the areas nailed it with the game's gothic atmosphere. However, the world is less vibrant and some areas feel narrow and claustrophobic, as you are almost always surrounded by buildings and walls. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2146572129\n\nContrary to the previous game, this one has no chapters or levels anymore; it is just one big non-linear open world with no loading screens during gameplay.

The composer, Oscar Araujo, did a fantastic job with the game\u2019s soundtrack, while sticking with the style and tone of the previous two games.\n\n[h2]Additional Details[/h2]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Total playtime[/td]\n[td]12 hours (without DLC)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Recommended difficulty[/td]\n[td]Lords of Shadow (Hard)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]M&K or Controller[/td]\n[td]Both work but a controller is preferable[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Offline mode[/td]\n[td]Yes[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Achievements[/td]\n[td]Yes, and they can be tough[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Trading cards[/td]\n[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Games Saving[/td]\n[td]Automatically[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nI enjoyed playing [i]Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2[/i] and had a lot of fun slaying enemies, but the new stealth sections, pointless puzzles and some dull locations held the game back for me.

In any case, I expected to play Lords of Shadow 2 for an hour or two at most, quit, then write a review expounding upon how I hate it as much or more than the original. Much to my surprise, I could hardly put Lords of Shadow 2 down and regularly found myself staying up way later than I intended. A few things are the same as before, but others differ greatly.\n\nYou play as the same character as in the original game, though obviously he has some significant differences, considering the original game's ending. Although yes, my love of vampires made me interested in him this time around, I will say that the writing of the game fell flat on its face in one big aspect of the game. The protagonist seems to have a moderate bit of effort put into giving him a redemption arc. However, as a massive fan of redemption arcs in games, movies, and television, this one absolutely did not work for me. This is a very, very minor spoiler. Right after you start to play in modern times, you are given what appear to be a husband, a wife, and a female child to drink their blood until they're dead and you're rejuvenated. The husband hits you with a stick trying to protect his family, and you're about to die if you don't feed. I can fully understand the decision to kill the husband. However...your protagonist doesn't drink his blood. He just cuts the man's throat, lets him fall to the floor, and ignores his blood as it pours from his neck. Your character should be practically incapable of resisting drinking from him in this starved and desperate state. The woman and child are terrified, and your character proceeds to drink the woman dry, then he laughs in a sinister manner as he looks to attack the child. Cut to black and you do not see the child dying. Later, you see the family's corpses laid together in the small room.\n\nSince we're playing as Dracula, that's fine to do something super evil...so long as they either don't try to redeem him - which doesn't work because they try to redeem him - or it's fine if they redeem him and the audience is given a scene where he laments the horrors he's committed and wishes to change. Needlessly killing more people than he needed to in that family and showing no remorse for it at any point throughout the entire game just does not work. He only shows any sympathy toward his family. Even the worst people in the world might be kind to their family members. In any case, they should've not bothered with a redemption arc, or drastically changed things concerning killing that family near the beginning if they wanted this to work right.\n\nThat flub aside, the game itself differs most from the original in that it is a Metroidvania. The first Lords of Shadow was a series of maps that acted as \"levels\" or \"stages\" more in line with the older Castlevania games than the newer stuff like Symphony of the Night. Although some folks may have liked the nostalgia aspect of it, and you could certainly select an old \"mission\" to go back through it again, I didn't enjoy that arrangement at all. Lords of Shadow 2 has intricate, interconnected city and castle areas with oodles of upgrades strewn about which you use your abilities to gain access to. I quite liked how this functioned and thanks to teleportation spots between areas, getting around was made a bit easier. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to remember which area connected to a different area, resulting in getting quite lost if I didn't have the map direct me to the nearest teleporter, resulting in me starting out in the same part of different areas each time almost exclusively.\n\nOh, and on the topic of upgrades you find throughout the game, there are a TON of them! If you keep your eyes peeled, you'll likely get enough upgrades that the game isn't very tough. By the end, I was stomping most enemies. I did go back and collect all of the ones I missed, though. One of my favorite features in Lords of Shadow 2 are Dodo Eggs, which you can buy in a shop and hatch, sending a Dodo to mark on your map where an upgrade is for a few minutes, along with an arrow on your map directing you in the direction to go to get it. Without it, I never would have found quite a few upgrades. There is a large amount of backtracking if you want to get all of the upgrades, but like I said, based my experience of the game from start to finish, completing the game at the normal difficulty isn't bad at all with a moderate amount of the upgrades. You get multiple full-heal items which you can pay to restock or find more of in broken objects, so the game is extremely fair when it comes to combat.\n\nThe story in general, other than the redemption arc, isn't anything amazing, but it works well enough. I think the lore you collect around the city in which this alternate history world is described where vampires are *known* by mankind to have existed and people do not doubt it, was really cool. I enjoyed reading through the various scrolls strewn about the place and the made the game world a much more interesting place to be in.\n\nIf you liked the original game and like Metroidvanias, I would think there's a good chance you would enjoy Lords of Shadow 2. If you're like me and hated the original game, you might *still* enjoy Lords of Shadow 2. I found it quite addicting exploring the castle and the city, and it's just interesting enough to keep me motivated from the gameplay and the lore.", "timestamp_created": 1593287798, "timestamp_updated": 1593287798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576212048530578613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71487589": {"recommendationid": "71487589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026230495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1593262097}, "language": "english", "review": "Reading about this game years ago conditioned me to hate this game but it's actually really good????\n\nI'm actually really surprised just how much this game fixes all of the annoying pacing issues the first game had.

Its lore is rich, the history deep. It's a mouthfull so to speak- even for those that has followed the game since its origins. I've finished [i] Lord of shadows [/i] 1 & its middleman [i] Mirror of fate [/i] which I feel is essential to have played to understand and to give a more proper description of the game as it's the very bone & flesh of Lord of shadows 2. \n\n[h1] So what do you actually do in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2? [/h1]\n\nYou're in the shoes of Dracula himself as he appears in a weakened state. With alot of cinematics and questions- your mission is to regain your lost powers & abilities. The beginning of the game is quite comfy as the tutorials makes very well sure that you're ready to stand on your own before being released to mainstage.  \n\nIt has this nice touch to the game as you progress very... progessively? As you mindlessly rumble your way through waves of creatures you'll receive currency which is used to once again discover your lost combat arts. By the time youve learned your basic combat mechanics you'll receive new ones to learn so theres a consistent learning curve without necessary forgetting old mechanics or feeling that you're overencumbered with abilities.\n\nAs with any other games with (perhaps) too many combat abilities we usually end up spamming basic attacks or that one overpowerd ability (I sure am guilty). However, Lords of shadow 2 Though about this and added a Mastery rank to your weapon(s). To level up your mastery you'll have to practise every ability. This is a great feature to motivate you to have variety in your strategy.\n\n[h1] Pros & Cons [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] As we mentioned earlier; Its a lore rich game! If you havent played earlier Castlevania games esp. (Lords of Shadow 1) &\n(Mirror of Fate) You will not understand much if anything at all which really takes alot from the game. Its like watching Marvel Endgame without watching the previous movies.\n\n    [*] I really loved going through parts of the game which had resemblance from earlier games. Seeing how things had changed and the results of previous actions had given such results ect.\n\n    [*] The game offers a new game+ with the new difficulty. This can be a huge pluss as it offers replay value- giving you more hours from your dollars. With the amount of secrets in the game its a great oppertunity to see if you caught them all and ofcourse challenge yourself.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Conclusion. Should you buy Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2? [/h1]\n\nRush through the game ~10hours. Explore the game ~15 hours. completionist +20 hours. \n\nFrom personal experience I found 1 playthrough enough. It doesnt temp me to achieve completionist nor ng+. Because of this it doesn't hit \"1 dollar an hour \" which is another factor if you should invest or not. Havent followed the series much niether.\n\nI would highly recommend you playing through previous games before deciding to buy Lord of shadows 2. If you already have, then it's a game worth a honorable spot on your wishlist.\n\nThank you for reading my review of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.", "timestamp_created": 1590188104, "timestamp_updated": 1590188171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69513845": {"recommendationid": "69513845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074405207", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1590018510}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]The stealth sections manage to ruin an otherwise great sequel. I loved the improvements they made in this sequel which is why it pains me to give this game a negative rating.[/b]\n\nThe combat has more variety with the different combos for the two magic types at your disposal - instead of the simple blue or red flame applied to your only weapon - and the new items you can use during combat; The user interface is improved in small aspects like the arrangement of the combo upgrades in a skill tree format - instead of a huge list you had to scroll through every time a new move was available for purchase; Larger areas with more freedom of movement - now areas are connected to each other by hub areas and loading screen doors which makes the progression to a new area when you get a new power feel more organic and similar to the metroidvania genre, in my opinion; You can control the camera now as well, instead of having it fixed in predetermined angles like the first game; Graphics also received a huge improvement and this game looks gorgeous.\n\nDespite all of these improvements I couldn't bring myself to finish the game because of the boring and tiresome stealth sections. One minute you're killing Satan's daughter without even acquiring Dracula's full power, and the next you're sneaking around in a poorly thought-out stealth section with a game over if you get spotted. It's terrible design in my opinion and really ruins the flow of the game.\n\nIf you can bring yourself to play these sections on your own and then look up a guide online because you're tired of retrying every time you get spotted [i]in a hack and slash game[/i], then you might be strong enough to endure the rest of the game.

Enemy variety boils down to humanoid with armor, humanoid with stick, humanoid with gun, humanoid that flies, or a combination of those. The combat has mediocre highs and very low lows.\n\nFresh off the heels of playing through LoS1, this game feels like a complete downgrade outside of the aesthetic. The world and models look amazing for their time and still hold up very well. (I've been playing on the Lord of Shadows difficulty, and played through LoS1 on Knight difficulty as the hardest was locked off.)\n\nDracula's Castle was probably the better part of the world in both looks and gameplay. \n\nThe upgrade system from LoS got watered down immensely from a simple 'unlock combo, get a small upgrade' to a 'unlock combo, upgrade combo, master combo, transfer your mastery of combo into your weapon, your weapon is now the way it should be. Now rinse and repeat for your other two weapons.'\n\nCombat got downgraded as well. While it and feels more fluid at first, the mask comes undone once you start fighting multiple enemies or multiple big enemies, and sometimes even bosses. Getting knocked down doesn't give you iframes like in LoS1, you're also susceptible to being hit while being knocked. This can lead to chained attacks killing you as you're locked into a spiral of being knocked around. Even your 'recovery' animation isn't safe as you can also be hit during that.\n\nParrying was well rewarded in the first LoS as you'd get some i-frames and knockback nearby enemies making is safe for you to follow up with your attacks. In LoS2 parrying can lead you into getting hit more often than not when in a situation where you're surrounded as none of these mechanics have followed over into the sequel. Enemies are more aggressive, as such when you being attacking an enemy, you'll have another monster attack you, you could parry that monster and the one you were attacking first will have recovered and made a swing at you, forcing you to dodge out of your supposed 'window of opportunity', or just take the hit.\n\nThere's so much wasted potential here, and the influence, or the lack thereof from Kojima can be seen and felt in LoS2's direction and design.\n\nI cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone outside of finishing this game just for the story on the lower settings as the higher settings will set you up for nothing but hair pulling frustrations in later segments. LoS2 also has slower load times when you fail, so yay for more waiting.\n\n4/10, would not playthrough for a challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1589307601, "timestamp_updated": 1589307601, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486512184143066406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69014346": {"recommendationid": "69014346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112019762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1590087644}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't make many reviews on games, but I'd make an exception for this one.\nIt was so worth the money and I absolutely loved it from start to finish!!!\n\n1.

the castlevania series but I do enjoy a good game, especially if it's an action game akin to DMC or the classic god of war games and, while it lacks a few quality of life and fundamental things those games have, like moves/combos that combine both light and heavy attacks to pull off/initiate, as well as a lunging attack to close the gap on projectile using opponents, it is a really good action game and I feel those're really lacking in the industry right now.\n\nIt does have some of those goofy, randomly ultra-violent action scenes, much like a god of war scene, but those are enjoyable on an ironic level, and the bad QTE's can now be toggled off, which was really the defining point for me as to whether or not I'd end up buying it.\n\nThough, with the bad sections like the constant stealth sections that you're forced to do because \"you're not strong enough\" to take down a couple guards that your blood completely vaporises minutes later quite constantly, despite you being fucking immortal (the pivotal detail to the plot, that motivates your player character) so I can understand why others wouldn't want to touch this game.\nAs well as the bad/awkward platforming, which, for the majority of the game, takes away your double jump, and leaves you very confused as where to go next, with time travel connected to the progression of the non-linear design of levels.\n\nThe platforming with the swinging of the chandeliers, with you slowly and carefully walking back and forth on is sorta that \"evil dead\" funny, however awkward it is, though.\nThough, it also makes your jumps shorter when on chandeliers so the depth perception issues of playing 3D platformers is more present than ever in sections like these, as well as what you can and can't grab onto, since nothing's colour coded and not all wooden structures can be climbed, only most of them", "timestamp_created": 1589021050, "timestamp_updated": 1589021050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

The story takes place on Earth somewhere in the future. The universe is fictional with ties to folklore, mythology, and works of literature. The story is a continuation of the events that transpired in Transylvania, surrounding that stories' protagonist; Gabriel Belmont, but thousand years later.\nAfter that ancient history, Gabriel's tale took an abominable turn. He lost his humanity after his victory over the vampire, and now reigns over them as the monster Dracula. Gabriel now exists as a vampire; immortal, and neither alive or dead. He retains his youth by drinking the blood of the living, and is now a supernatural creature, and behaves in an equally uncanny way.\nWhile Earth's society developed towards a more modern age, Gabriel has remained detached from it. Gabriel's seclusion from society is soon discovered, as the vampire's master; Satan, is being summoned to Earth. Satan's homecoming is to be accompanied by an Armageddon.\nStrengthened by his heritage, Gabriel must prevent the fallen angel's return, after a millennium.\n\nThe protagonist is displayed from a distance. It is possible to rotate this viewing-angle in all directions, while the protagonist remains at the centre. A map shows the general direction he has to follow, and visual hints point out the way forward.\nThe worlds show an environment, which is composed out of rooms and pathways, and in between more open areas. Some of these locations have multiple entrances and exits, and together they form a thematically connected world. These areas may be revisited, and artworks and background stories may be discovered by searching. The world is also interactable, and has destructible objects.\nThe protagonist runs, jumps, and climbs with superhuman agility through most environments, and between events, there are animated videos.\nOn occasion, groups of adversaries must be overcome through combat or stealth. Combat consists out of blocking, dodging, or attacking with a sword, whip, or claw. This requires timing. Each attack has defensive and offensive benefits, and there are consumables that may also help the protagonist survive these encounters. Larger, and more dangerous adversaries arise when the story unfolds. The protagonist's combat techniques increase during play, and may be customized.\n\nAt certain locations the protagonist may travel to his ancient castle. Which has a distinctive environment. There is a contrast between the modern environment, and the old castle. Floors, ceilings, and walls are often fashionable decorated and designed. The world use detailed textures and models, distinctive art-design, imposing architecture, and towering statues. This intertwining between old and new is enhanced by classical and modern music.\nThe story uses themes, such as the divine conflict between good and evil, and bonds between family, and by using these themes, the work forms content of both sensitive and insensitive nature, and levitates between being heart warming to downright gruesome.\n\n\nThis dynamic image displays motion blur while Gabriel runs away from a projectile, that renders a lens flare effect:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2058892220 \nThis video shows Gabriel (he is identified as Dracula, by the champion) using all three weapons:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056400396", "timestamp_created": 1587086457, "timestamp_updated": 1631220350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67460767": {"recommendationid": "67460767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089188128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 735, "last_played": 1587147018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego para la cuarentena, con buena jugabilidad e historia.

Story is well rounded you definitely benefit more if you have knowledge of Characters in the Castlevania lore. Solid ending, no cliffhangers.

I'm not doing it for another time so here goes something short and to the point. Lords of Shadow 2 is probably the best in its own series. Combat is excellent, graphics and sound beautiful even for 2020, the world feels big and spacious. The negative aspects are the puzzles which are a downgrade to the original, the exploration which feels stiff and scripted, the stealth sequences which are horribly executed and don't offer anything except for one and that is part of a boss fight. The story is incoherent, although if you take it at face value and just try to go through with it, it's fine, nothing horrible. The bosses are another outstanding feature. If you like LoS 1 DMC or Bayonetta, get this one. I haven't played the DLC, but it's more of the same so it can't hurt for 4eur right?

It's quite refreshing to play for Dracula for once, rather than a vampireslayers (Simon, Trevor and others are cool but yea). \nGraphics- Looking nice.\nAudio- Fantastic as usual.\nCombat -Very enjoyable. Now some people complain it's basically God of War reskin. It's true, but is that a bad thing? Depends on personal taste, i suppose.\nBad:\nStealth- it's horrible. If the first game had problems, which made you frustrated, it was puzzles (which were improved here, fortunatelly). I have absolutly no idea why The Prince of Darkness can be beated by some power armored goons so easily. Also shapeshifts to a rat.... a filthy rat...*facepalm* i thought we're playing for a vampire, THE vampire, so why not change to a bat for further stealth action?  \nEndgame- without spoilers, the last boss is dumb easy. Unlike previous game the final showdown ain't legendary clash at all and i found myself expecting second phase (which never came, what a shame). Needless to say the game ends with quasy cliffhanger, like Konami/ Mercurysteam planned to make Lords of Shadow 3, or atleast i had that feeling.

Defeat is the result of immature knowledge of the moveset, or maybe a bad camera angle, when Dracul gets ritually stun-locked and stomped.  It is so damn cool to go all out button mashing to start the attack and then finish off as you seem fit, feeling out what the next move in the combo should be to exploit the enemy's weakness, its never too easy and many encounters require the use of the new weapons in which there are a total of three. Even the harpies are a nuisance near the climax and we meet their kind early on.....It is tough and demanding of one's concentration and full of blood and gore. \n\nYet there is the story and exploration that rages you on forward like a man possessed.\nI cannot realize the amount of hate this game gets as it is seemingly what the fans cried for, a SoTN type adventure in 3D and it is here minus the massive amounts of equippable gear and enemies, it turns out to be much like  Devil May Cry 4, but here instead of [spoiler]going in reverse[/spoiler] it is more like cleaning up puke, no just kidding, areas are large and branch out  into multiple directions so that finding the extras and secrets are that much more demanding. \nDid I mention this all takes place in the past and the present? \n\nDracula does not provide all the angst and voracity alone, a supporting cast plays their role in tune to the setting, but I noticed a hint of shallowness within him and that is keeping in mind his evil nature and impervious to anything attitude, it just  feels like he is still hungover from his centuries long slumber, a weakness?...maybe\n\nGone are the clever puzzles of the first game, I think they are relegated to the DLC with Alucard. Exploration and opening shortcuts is the name of this game, excellent level design and as a whole it is gratifying to have a working, controllable camera.\n\nThe symphonic/electronica music is superb and dynamic instead of continuous and that  part of the sound design is absolutely horrific, titanic and beyond reproach. The sound effects are awe inspiring, come together so covalently with the sound of the shadow whip and some  monster sounds are truly unreal in the state of being actually annoying to the ears. The acting is not as good or as present as in the first game but all the players return and make it a tour de force anyways. The lore is back and so is the writing, plus memorials to collect and read pertaining to the history of the city ironically glorified in propaganda-Does Dracul care? hell no, everything is deliberately designed to divert our well honed instincts and love for the series.

The combat is good, the mastery lets you practice and get better, the way the map is connected is good. But is also here where my problems begin. I get they are trying to keep with the traverse, like the old games. Here is at moments not fun, have to wait 'till the end to get some items, there is only one location for the stores.

Just my opinion.\n\nProbably the best (along with the other 2 games) skill-oriented action games (and series) of all time. The game rewards you for reacting properly to attacks. Block, dodge, jump, unleash powerful attack at just the proper time and NOT doing it at the proper time makes a huge difference. My point is u can't just button mash through this game.\n\nI have a top of the line PC and with settings topped out the game runs 35-50 fps. The last 3rd of the game I was getting a solid 60 fps.

For MANY reasons.\n\nBut first, let's start with the nice things\n- aesthetic : Great. The differents places you encounter are filled with details and stuff, with gorgeous environnements.\n- story telling is nice (but don't expect to understand anything it you haven't played the first episode the week before) EDIT : now that I finished the game, don't expect too much of it... story telling is nice, but the story is bad. Narration in the first game was way more immersive\n\nThe \"Meh\" points\n- music and sound effects are great... But when I close my eyes, I feel like I'm playing Batman Arkham Asylum... No kidding : the bats sounds, the general music... It's from Batman !\n\nThe bad points\n- navigation is bad... Corridors everywhere, it's difficult to backtrack from where you just left... Too often a cutscene will teleport you elsewhere without letting you any possibility\n- infiltration : not fun in this game, not fun the way it's implemented... Bats => possession => done... Until you meet Pan that will just stalk you and kill you over and over until you figure the ONLY path to take in order to evade him\n- Some portions of the game reminds me of Dragon's lair : you don't know what to do, but if you don't do exactly what you are expected to, you will fail (the train ?)\n- Combat : all ennemies will block your attacks. Those who don't will be able to hit you while you are hitting them...\n- No combo... At all... Making combos or trying to add variation to the way you attack changes nothing.\n- Boss fights : you fight huge monsters (nice) moving at plane speed around an arena, knocking you back, while you move at crawling speed with only short melee attacks... NOT FUN...\n- Every ennemy is a damn HP bag\n- Items are worthless\n- The \"puzzles\" are a pain, push a lever and you got 30 seconds to cross a gate before it closes...\n- Fuckton of items to gather to get more HP/magic(not that helpfull)\n- Get too far from an ennemy with ranged attack, they will spam instant distant attacks that stun/knockback you... And they hit even if you try do dodge. Good luck reaching them\n- Camera sometimes get stuck on your shoulder... A nice touch to make fights even more difficult\n- I didn't see a final boss... :/ I was expecting for something huge... It was all disappointment\n\nLoS1 was way better...\n\nEdit :\nJust finished it...

Constantly switching between the castle and modern day made for some of the worst story telling I have ever seen. As others have said the stealth sections are pathetic. If you make one mistake and alert a guard, forget about it. Just wait till he kills you because he will chain rocket launcher you to death and you wont even have the ability to get up half the time. The heavy reliance on awkward jumping puzzles really grates after 10 hours. I think the developers of the two main games in this series should have listened to the phrase \"Less is More\" The two main games are way too long and try to do way too much. They could have cut half the abilities/pickups/levels and if they had made a better story with that time, these games could have been great.

I have no experience at all with the series and only bought the game for it's modern day setting. \n\nThat said, Lords of Shadow 2 is awesome. It has a nice fighting mechanic, good looking enviorenments, great boss battles and the plot was fine to follow, even if you don't have any Castlevania knowledge. \n\nNow, as the game description says, Lords of Shadow 2 is a hack and slash game, where you take control of Dracula and after finishing a really well done tutorial mission, you awake in modern day Castlevania City. Stripped off your powers, you explore the city in a midst of a demon invasion to return to your former glory and to find a way to end Dracula's eternal life.\n\nThe game itself plays like most hack and slay games do. You have three weapons, your default whip, a Void sword which refills Dracula's health and firey Chaos gloves, which deal more damage and are the only way to break through shields and armor. All of them offer normal and crowd control attacks with the usually combos you expect from such a game, like throwing your enemy into the air, holding the attack botton for extra damage and to break your enemies blocking manouvers or to use spells, like creating a protective shield around you.\n\nUnlike in Devil May Cry or Bayonetta though, the Sword and Gloves aren't always available, but require magic to wield. This can be aquired by either absorbing them from special statues or by performing combos. And here is the main difference to DMC or Bayonetta. Unlike in those games, the combo system isn't only there to look fancy or to gain a high score, but also allows you to refill your magic. With each hit you land, you fill up Dracula's focus, which, when fully filled, allows him to create blood spheres with each following hit. These spheres can then be absorbed to fill either your Void (The sowrd) or Chaos (The gloves) magic and a single hit from the enemy will break that focus.\n\nWhich is a good bridge to talk about the enemies themselves. The game has quite a good variety of them and range from easily killable knights, over demons of various sizes, skelletons, steam punk like riot police units and magic using priests. All of them with varying abilities to deflect your damage, block your attacks with shields or to simply dodge you. Now, with this game taking place in modern times, you won't only fight close quarter battles, although those are the majority, but also engage in ranged combat, like with the mentioned police force. \n\nLike with the melee enmies, you will encounter a good amount of different weapons here, including 60's styled assault rifles, shotguns and grenade launcher, while later in the game you will also face enemies throwing magical projectiles at you or wielding powerful single shot weapons in combination with rocket launchers and morters. These can be pretty annoying, because dodging bullets can be tricky, especially if multiple enemies are firering at you, and are an easy way for you to lose your focus.\n\nAn other annoying thing is, that the enemies shake your attacks off like they are nothing. They barely get staggered and can attack you back, even if you are in the middle of your own combo. This often makes it hard to see, if you are about to get hit. And while I like that the enemy's attacks are barely telegraphed, it makes the combat rather challenging and I got my butt handed to me pretty often, even by the default enemies. And although this sounds like a criticism now, it isn't and I actually liked the way how Lords of Shadow 2 handles it's combat.\n\nAside from your weapons, Dracula also has some other abilities, like turning into a rat or fiering ice, respectively explosive projectiles, as well as some charms to increase your combat performance. I just mention them, because they can be a bit finicky to control. I played with a gamepad, so all of those abilties were assigned to the D-pad and after selecting them, you also have to press he RT/R2 button to activate them. While this is mostly a case of getting used to it, it often happened in the middle of combat, that I forgot to change my ability before pressing the Use button, which sometimes resulted in wasted magic. Nothing big, but it can be annyoing.\n\nNow, let's talk about Castlevania City a bit. I often read that the modern day parts of the game are grey in grey and optically quite boring, which is all true. But this didn't bother me and while I personally don't like the gothic architecture the developers went with, it still is an interesting place. If you have played any of the Batman Arkham games, be it City, Origins oder Knight, you know what to expect here. Much like Gotham, Castlevania City is a place, which looks like it got stuck in time at some point, with cobblestone sidewalks, interiours and cars that look more like they came from the 60's or 70's, narrow alleys and huge buildings, which are more resembling castle towers than modern skyscrapers.\n\nIt's dark, it's depressing, it makes me wonder why anyone would voluntarily live there, but it definitvely has a certain charme to it, which made me admire the city. I'm also a huge fan of supernatural stuff appearing in a modern day scenario and seeing some demons walking along some wrecked cars, while an advertising screen can be seen in the background, always puts a smile on my face.\n\nAside from the city, you also get to explore Dracula's castel and while you need to go there to progress the plot, you can freely switch between both places at certain points in the map. Which is partially required, because there are certain locks in the city, which can only be opened by keys aquirable in the castle. And unlike Castlevania City, the castle itself is more diversive, with the usual stone hallways, underground caves with lava or a snow area. It's also where most of the boss fights take place and all in all, it just has more going for it than the city.\n\nFor the final part of my review, I want to mention the stealth sections. Now, most of them are fine and it's not that hard to see, what the game wants you to do. But good grieve, the last two ones are very, very annoying, because you have no margin for error and in both cases, you take a pretty good hit on your health when getting spotted.\n\nSo, to end this: Castlevania Lords of Shadows 2 is a pretty good game and if you are a fan of games like Devil may Cry or Bayonetta, I would say give it a shot. It has nice combat, nice locations and the one or other special puzzle to offer a change of pace.

Graphics are superb and can easily be played on highest settings no issues with framerate either. \n\nPresentation is great for the most part when it comes to characters and enemies but stylistically the modern setting just looks bad and its a shame as there are castlevania-esq location but they are downplayed most of the time in favor of the bigger story and plot points taking place in modern city locations.\n\nPacing is also a problem you will get stuck and will be unsure of where to go or what to do next. Backtracking is ok but here its confusing as the areas don't gel well like I mentioned before you'll be in the city thinking you'll continue forward but the game actually wants you to backtrack to the castle in the past, mind you the game won't tell you this. A clear objective on the start screen would of helped this issue alas they rather leave in the dark to pad out the game.\n\nLOS2 is definitely a good game but as a fan of the first game it is rather disappointing.

slasher)\n\n============\n\nReview:\n\nCastlevania Lords of Shadow 2 is a 3rd-person action game that is very similar to Devil May Cry series.\n\nGraphically it looks pretty good for a few years old game, at least when the high-resolution textures are on. It also runs smoothly even on older hardware. The music and sound effects are up to modern standards, they're good enough but nothing mind-blowing.\n\nStory-wise its fine too, I really like the evil vs evil setting of the game. \n\nYou play as Dracula, which is referred as the Prince of Darkness in the game. He's a very vengeful vampire that hates god and mankind - that itself creates a different kind of atmosphere for the game, as you're not some knight in shiny armor that saves the world.\n\nThough, even as a bad-guy, you're supposed to kill Satan at the end of the game.. haha.\n\n============\n\nThe game starts off bad, like really bad. It feels like a design flaw to me. You put a new player into a hellish jumping sequence right from the start, and it might be so frustrating that some new players will quit the game right there.\n\nThis negative feeling is further amplified by the fact that you'll be forced to do a stealth scene soon after that. Yes, it's short and will be over fairly soon, but the stealth stuff just isn't for everybody.\n\nHowever, the game gets progressively better and better, if you can endure the crappy start.\n\nThere will be more annoying jumping, but you'll get used to it. It's not that much of a problem later, I just think it's brutal\nthat they put one of the most difficult jumping scenes right at the beginning of the game, when new players don't know how to jump properly.\n\n============\n\nOverall, I think the game is good. It's fun to play through once, and if you feel like it, you can go for the New Game Plus and collect achievements.\n\nBut honestly, I didn't want to play the game more after I finished the story. I really didn't want to plow through the same areas and try to find every secret.\n\nSo, is it worth buying? \n\nI think so. It's a good game, but it's nothing mind-blowing - so you probably should wait for a sale and get it cheap.\n\n============\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Good \ud83d\udc4d\n+ Still pretty good looking (with HD textures enabled)\n+ Well optimized\n+ Interesting story\n+ You play as Dracula!\n\nThe Bad \ud83d\udc4e\n- Very poorly designed beginning\n- Stealth parts feel rather forced", "timestamp_created": 1556124064, "timestamp_updated": 1593954557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599956154823303223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50179250": {"recommendationid": "50179250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027974976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1464, "last_played": 1555530447}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game with a grim humor.", "timestamp_created": 1555530599, "timestamp_updated": 1555530599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50115723": {"recommendationid": "50115723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089165346", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 2446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2446, "last_played": 1555173937}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally finish the game so this is my review.\n\nLong Answer:\u00a0\nStory: Excellent story, it kept me captivated at times... specially when some female spirit appear :3\nDesign and graphics: Great level design and beautiful graphics.\nGameplay: Very polished and addictive ...

Super Mario\u2019s bros is a good example of changing from a side scrolling series to 3D open world that ticks all the boxes and works really well. Other times ideas that look great on paper fail to wow in reality. Castlevania 2: Lords of Shadow is one of those games. You have a great story and lore to start from, excellent move list, good pacing, plenty of secrets and collectibles in a nod to the past games, along with good sound effects, big boss battles great voice acting and very decent platforming design. It should be a recipe for success, but it just doesn\u2019t seem to come together as well as it should.\n\nCastlevania 2 continues directly from Castlevania: The Mirror of Fate. You can play the game without playing the previous 2 games, but you would be doing yourself a massive disservice by doing so. If you haven\u2019t played them and are thinking of playing this, stop and at least play the first Lord of Shadows game. After all these years, we finally get to play as Dracula. In a substantial plot twist from the previous games (I\u2019ll get to that later) Gabriel has embraced his inner darkness (or is at least constantly at war with it) and in a climactic battle vs the brotherhood of light destroys their army to the last man, as well as his castle. 500 years later you awaken, weak and under assault by Satan\u2019s minions who are trying to resurrect their lord since you are presumed dead. Having being the one who was ultimately responsible for all your grief in the previous two games it\u2019s up to you to regain your powers and prepare to put him down for good this time if you can\u2019t stop the resurrection. As gods chosen warrior.\n\nGameplay is the same as the previous game, with a lot of new twists. It is still a game of slowly unlocking abilities and powers, which in turn open up different areas in the world and your castle to explore. There are tons of collectables to find and some to purchase, with the crystals giving you holy/light and dark powers for every batch if five you collect. Light infused attacks still heal, while dark empowered attacks deal bonus damage, with your blood whip building a gauge to refill the power meters in combat. Combat is much the same with you using your unlocked abilities to kill enemies, with different attacks being required for different enemies. New to the series is the ability to fire your light and dark magic to freeze or set enemies on fire, opening up more combat opportunities. Attacks also generate mastery, which is used to empower your primary attack methods (whip, sword or gauntlets). There isn\u2019t anything stopping you from using the same attacks, but you are now at least rewarded for using different attacks. Also new to the series are the dreaded stealth sections. Being a disempowered monster Dracula is required to transform into a pack of rats to bypass certain sections that are guarded by enemies that instantly kill you. They make sense story wise, but weren\u2019t really fun to play, fortunately they are very infrequent and are only in certain parts of each map. I would have loved to be able to return to these areas post game and destroy these enemies, but that is denied to the player. It\u2019s a missed opportunity to reward the player for continuing to play the post-game content. Some of these sections are also placed right before boss fights, [spoiler]and while the Camilla section isn\u2019t so bad, I think the maze [/spoiler] happens to be one of the most infuriating sections of any game I have played.\n\nThe other major change is instead of set stages the game is a giant open world map, split into the present city, and your castle, which is incorporeal and based off your desire. The stage design really shines in the castle, it totally invokes flashbacks to the previous games. Quite a few familiar faces reappear, with a few known bosses returning. [spoiler] Being based on Gabriel\u2019s desire it\u2019s good to see him being able to interact with a young Trevor and his deceased wife to solve puzzles. [/spoiler] On the other side, the city you traverse looks ok, but misses the varied detail that the castle provides. There are plenty of varied environments, however the castle areas win out in my opinion. Both areas have hidden areas that require upgrades received effectively at the end of the game, so true to its nature there is a lot of back tracking in hunting down collectables. Smashing objects rewards you in either dropped items, experience point or artwork (which is cool to look through). I miss the front stage selection as it advised what secrets were left to collect in what area (and the item you get to help with this isn\u2019t very good). You would bow need to play with a guide or have a photographic memory to find all the secrets. I highly recommend using a controller to play, while it is an option to play without one, it has been designed to play with one.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, with Dracula being the stand out. Patrick Stewart is back as Death, and I miss his opening speech to every stage. What small parts he does talk in don\u2019t see to have that wow factor that they did in the first game. The enemy sound effects are good, though most of them are some form if grunt or screech (most if the enemies are possessed or animals). The background music was good, though nothing really stands out unless you are fighting the bosses, where it ramps up. The game looks great in 4K, and didn\u2019t stress my computer that much.\n\nThe boss battles were pretty epic, with the first battle being a one of those fight where you have to work your way up the giant boss to kill it, before the second phase of the fight starts. The weakest boss fight would be the toy maker, who is a straight up brawl (and doesn\u2019t actually pose much of threat). On easier difficulties the boss battles are very easy and forgiving, but require a degree if skill and memorization of their attack patterns. A fair few of them have a gimmick to you have to work out before you can beat them.\n\nNow for my gripes- at least early on a lot if the story really glosses over the events of Mirror of Fate. I thought this was a major disservice to the trilogy, as Mirror of Fate had changed the events and understanding of characters significantly. Camilla\u2019s portrayal is nothing like her previous incarnation. The plot overall is still serviceable, and it\u2019s good to see Gabriel fighting the darkness in his blood (even if he forced to kill those who are corrupted by it). Another gripe is the item collection- in previous games you at least knew what stage it was in, but with the open world format this has been removed (even an icon when switching between area\u2019s would have been handy). There\u2019s nothing that allows you to mark secrets to revisit or anything that advises you what you have already collected, so there is a lot of un-necessary backtracking. Starting a new game + removes all your mastery and unlocks (you get the experience back to buy new skills), which is annoying as you have to farm enemies for the mastery levels again.\n\nA lot if the DLC are costume changes for Dracula, which are nice but don\u2019t really offer anything for the price that you get charged for them. One item allows you to switch excess items for others, which is highly recommended. \n\nThe last DLC is for Alucard and sets up the events of the main game, but should only be played after finishing the main game otherwise it will ruin the twist at the end.

With collecting hidden items and farming enemies for mastery levels there is a fair amount to do and takes a fair amount of time depending on your skill level and how much you collected the first time around.\n\nFor more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/", "timestamp_created": 1555164084, "timestamp_updated": 1569852913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54314720630645752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50049285": {"recommendationid": "50049285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037554531", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1550, "last_played": 1554825922}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazingly fun game, the final boss fight and the extremely open-ended ending was a bit of a letdown though.

I give it two thumbs up. I wish there'd be another one, but it seems like that won't happen. Two great feature-length games and one just okay handheld title -- not too shabby.\n\nThings I loved: \n* Story and lore both continue to be engrossing\n* Voice acting, memorable performances all-around\n* Visuals (despite the purportedly boring city setting)\n* Not too easy, not too difficult (for ME, big asterisk on that one since admittedly I am decidedly average skill-wise compared to most hardcore gamers)\n* Amazing opening chapter\n* Lots of secrets to find\n* Art direction (for the extras and the lore entries, and overall) is to die for\n* Takes inspiration from real life without being too heavy-handed and preaching to you, which is super rare these days and something I greatly appreciate\n\nThings I liked:\n* Combat is fun and easy to pick up on\n* Lots of abilities to unlock\n* Just long enough length-wise\n* Reserved but well-done take on \"open world\" structure\n* Mostly ran perfectly, except for a couple times when I crashed apropos of nothing\n\nThings I didn't like: \n* No lock-on during combat,; even if you don't really NEED it, it'd be nice to have\n* A few moments where the camera hinders you in combat; one sequence near the end nearly got me killed because I just couldn't see the enemies off-screen\n* The reason behind some things that happen in the moment-to-moment plot could be a little clearer, or alternatively a little less convenient. Question: \"Why did that happen?\" Answer: \"I dunno, roll with it.\"\n* Ran out of consumables that I very much needed near the end, but whether that's a good thing or bad is up to you ultimately\n* A pointless death in the story that seemed like it could have been avoided somehow, but hey, what do I know\n* I didn't use all the consumables, and furthermore, skills, that were available to me. Maybe that's a fault of my own and thus you can ignore me here, but there were some elements of the combat that went unused for a majority of the game.\n\nInteresting observations:\n* The stealth sections aren't as bad as I'd been led to believe. What I'd heard made it sound like it overwhelmed the entire game, kinda like how I'd also heard the city setting also brought the game down, but neither of those things were true for me. There's actually only ONE stealth section that really got my goat, and even though it was blissfully short, it still pissed me off because of how hard it was. So overall, not that bad, if you ask me. One or a couple frustrating sequences does not a bad game make.\n* When some people called this game an 'open-world' game, I expected something a little different. But I like what this game offers in terms of world structure, even if the world structure doesn't always make sense (ex: you can't jump over this barrier that anyone could easily get over). It's an open-world in a very structured way. It's an interesting variation on exploration in games, I'll give it that. In a way, it fits right in with the Metroidvania genre; I would love to see more games made in this format, not every game needs to be a LOTR-sized adventure.\n* The Transmutation Rune (available in the DLC) is something I'd like to see more of in games.

Y digo justicia porque creo que la cr\u00edtica y el p\u00fablico han sido muy injustos con este t\u00edtulo, hasta el punto de que ahora mismo creo que se tuvo que tratar de alguna especie de campa\u00f1a de desprestigio (no es la primera vez que a Mercury Steam le ocurre, ya pas\u00f3 con Blade), y es que recuerdo que se habl\u00f3 de que el juego estaba roto, que era un desastre e incluso de que Enric \u00c1lvarez se hab\u00eda convertido en una especie de megal\u00f3mano cuyas ideas hab\u00edan arruinado el juego. Aut\u00e9nticas barbaridades a tenor de lo que luego te encuentras mientras juegas. Y lo que te encuentras mientras juegas es un t\u00edtulo muy notable en todos los aspectos.\n\nEl primer Lords of Shadow fue encumbrado por la cr\u00edtica, con raz\u00f3n, pero \u00bfentonces qu\u00e9 ha pasado con esta segunda parte? Ambos juegos cambian radicalmente su ambientaci\u00f3n y su tono, por exigencias de gui\u00f3n, uno es colorido y variado en paisajes, el otro es oscuro y centrado en un \u00fanico lugar (dos si tenemos en cuenta que podremos recorrerlo en dos \u00e9pocas distintas). El primero es un t\u00edtulo lineal y con c\u00e1mara fija, el segundo tiene un desarrollo metroidvania, con backtracking y con c\u00e1mara libre. El combate de la primera parte es muy notable y divertido, el del segundo es igual pero a\u00f1adiendo m\u00e1s profundidad con los distintos tipos de armas, tanto la espada, que servir\u00e1 para recuperar vida y las garras, imprescindibles para romper armaduras. La m\u00fasica es igual de excelsa, pero la de este t\u00edtulo es m\u00e1s oscura, acorde al tono general. Y la historia es entretenida y con muchos claroscuros en las emociones de Dr\u00e1cula, con su lucha interna entre su maldad y sus sentimientos hacia su familia, con momentos igual de \u00e9picos que la primera parte. Ya podr\u00e9is intuir que los cambios no son precisamente a peor, sino en general, a mejor. Por eso no se entiende por qu\u00e9 el primero fue tan ensalzado, y este tan vapuleado.\n\nLos tan pol\u00e9micos a\u00f1adidos en forma de fases de sigilo son aceptables y lo \u00fanico que le a\u00f1aden al juego son m\u00e1s mec\u00e1nicas. Te pueden gustar m\u00e1s o menos, pero ni est\u00e1n rotas ni funcionan mal. Y hay que tener en cuenta que estamos hablando de un Dr\u00e1cula debilitado en sus poderes, por lo que est\u00e1n justificados estos momentos en los que tiene que renunciar al enfrentamiento directo. No son muy abundantes y eso, a\u00f1aden variedad, algo imprescindible en una buena aventura.\n\nMenci\u00f3n especial merece el arte del juego. Castlevania es una franquicia japonesa, pero su ambientaci\u00f3n y su contexto est\u00e1n m\u00e1s inmersos en la historia y la iconograf\u00eda europeas. Si a eso le a\u00f1ades todo el componente religioso, concretamente con imaginer\u00eda cat\u00f3lica, creo que se hace obvio que un estudio europeo y espa\u00f1ol, tiene mucho m\u00e1s que aportar que uno japon\u00e9s. Y aqu\u00ed Mercury Steam se desata con un nivel art\u00edstico inconmensurable. Me he tenido que detener m\u00faltiples veces a admirar cada estatua, cada textura de las paredes y del suelo, y es que el detallismo es impresionante. \n\nEn fin, un gran juego y un gran representante del hack and slash, como lo fue el primero y que te hace apenarte por el trato que recibi\u00f3 y que llev\u00f3 a Mercury Steam donde est\u00e1 ahora. La \u00faltima frase del juego  \"\u00bfQui\u00e9n sabe lo que nos deparar\u00e1 el futuro?\" es prof\u00e9tica. Ojal\u00e1 alguien vuelva a confiar un gran proyecto a este estudio que deber\u00eda estar mucho m\u00e1s reconocido.

Stealth moments in game:\nYou are the most powerful being in this universe and you have to keep turning yourself into a rat and hiding, or else a single enemy BLOWS you up in 1 or 2 attacks. You HAVE to be stealth because this \"common\" enemy is 10000x stronger than Dracula.... Why make other \"20 meters high\" monsters into bosses if you have these guys??? They are stronger than Satan, Lords of Shadows and Dracula all together \n\n2. Dracula fighting enemies with shotguns, missile lauchers, mechs.... (i know, thats personal)\n\n3. There are ALMOST 5 types of enemies, being 1 minion and 1 armored of each type .... THATS IT... no more enemies.... you keep killing the same things aaaaall the time....urgh\n\n4. When you finish parts of the game the enemie type changes everywhere.... so you keep killing the same 1 type all the time until you finish another part... than it changes to another 1 type....\n\n5. Graphics seems worse than LoS1....\n\n6. You have to remember to press a button.... to.... GET UP..... 1 single hit, no matter who hits you, will make you fall... and Dracula starts to get up like a 7 year old who just woke up to go to school... HE JUST DOESNT WANT TO GET UP\n\n7.Entering Kleidos challenges:\n- Cutscene\n- Menu\n- Curscene\n- Loading screen while you walk\n- Cutscene\nLeaving Challenge:\n- Cutscene\n- Loading screen while you walk\n- Cutscene\nEvery...single...TIME... \n\n8.\"Open world\" with linear walktrough.... when you have to backtrack its a PAIN...... SOOOOOOO LONG to get to places......\n\n9. \"Teleports\" are very far apart and takes 3 cutcenes to do it (Cutting your hand + Maps coming up + teleporting and resurging)....Jesus!\n\n10. SOOOOOO MAAAANY loading screen disguised as:\n- Cleaning rooms\n- Eletric outlet\n- Lava tunnels with pathways tha appear in front of you as you are forced SLOOOOOWLY walk\n- Call a dog + Go reach the god damn dog + Forced SLOW walking into portals WITH THE DOG + Forced SLOW walking through portal BEHIND THE DOG + Reaching the other side and having to wait for the god damn colors of the game to come back.\n- Elevators\n\n11. Too many upgrades to go find... you wont use HALF of your attack types, i promise...\n\n12. Cant replay parts of the game like the first one. Killed a boss? Want to kill it again? Replay the hole game!\n(At least there is a New Game+)\n\n13. History is... a monster wants to take control of the world... you have to stop it........... SUPER\n\n14. There is almost no point of having a \"Light\" and \"Heavy\" attacks..... Heavy attacks can be blocked by ANY enemy, no matter how weak it is.\n\n15. Dracula at full power seems A LOT weaker than \"Gabriel\".\n\n16. When you get double jump, you think you will move faster to other places... you are SOOOO WRONG hahahahaha\nYou will keep clibing the same things over and over again...\n\n17. Dracula, the most powerful UNDEAD creature CANT SPRINT for more than 2 seconds..... O_O\n___\n\nNow, the good things! \n\n1. Bosses are nice to fight\n\n1/2. Story is not THAT terrible... just RIDICULOUSLY simple\n___\nSorry for any bad english :P", "timestamp_created": 1552626967, "timestamp_updated": 1553472087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542708516120910645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49470741": {"recommendationid": "49470741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828790860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8038, "last_played": 1696263827}, "language": "english", "review": "IF YOU LIKE CASTLEVANIA GAMES THEN THIS IS YOUR FUCKEN BEST DREAM FUCKING EVER", "timestamp_created": 1552182849, "timestamp_updated": 1552182849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49336477": {"recommendationid": "49336477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113744308", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 558, "last_played": 1700728928}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego esperando sacar el platino, ya lo hab\u00eda jugado en consolas ahora en pc gracias lercury steam", "timestamp_created": 1551620541, "timestamp_updated": 1551620541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49309972": {"recommendationid": "49309972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135036904", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2668, "last_played": 1568152815}, "language": "english", "review": "I came into this game series knowing that the first Lords of Shadow was critically acclaimed and that this installment was critically panned.

Not up to par with DMC 4, but still great nonetheless. Also dont forget theres an option to remove Quick Time Events (QTE), if they werent so poorly implemented there wouldnt be an option to remove them\n\nPros:\n- Great Visual\n- Great Combat\n- Great Story? Its interesting but not a tear jerker\n\n\nCons:\n-Feels Outdated\n\n\nCombat:\n-Its the Classic action combat DMC clone game, this time you have a long range whip as your main weapon, a sword and some gauntlets. Theres some strategy as the gauntlets destroy armor, the sword steals life, and your whip is cool..... yeah, also by unlocking those weapons you unlock some powers and projectiles to unlock paths and areas of the map.\n\nLater on you will probably try to avoid combat with random npcs and just try to do the boss battles\n\nMovement is not really interesting. Its the basic type even with a dodge. Later on you get more movement options like a double jump. But until then its too late to backtrack all the levels for some extra power. In the end it just becomes a wasted effort. Their game has great  Bosses, wish there was more of them. The ending battle is great although somewhat frustating. You face the boos while he is riding a giant flying fish monster, but you end up never actually facing them. The other bosses are great combat experiences.\n\nTheres a single enemy that uses guns that you never get to face, and even still in the end he will be too powerful for you. Thats the weirdest thing so far in the game.\n\nAs I said before, theres an option to remove QTEs. Do that. They do help making you feel powerful, but they are somewhat finnecky and annoying. if you disable them you will get some cool cinematics from the QTEs automated\n\n\nNarrative:\nYou are dracula. You wake up from sleep and are very week. Although you are not really dracula but Gabriel Belmont. You are in London. Before that they show you in your prime power to give you a taste, then they rip your powers, its an example of narrative well merged with gameplay, IT HAS PROPER MEANING. All the characters dialogues are great, their voice overs are really well done and their animations are great, weighty and in good taste.\n\nThis is to me the greatest accomplishment. How well the narrative is merged with gameplay. Besides that all i can say is that the ending is frustating.\n\n\nLevel Design:\nIt somewhat feels small and repetitive in the ending. Theres two maps, the castle and london. Both are great in the beggining but they start becoming an annoyance. The spam of some scaling mechanics becomes repetitive, the lack of wall riding or some more fluid traversal is bad. It slows down the game and becomes repetitive.\n\n\nVisuals:\nA greatly realized rendition of Draculas Castlevania. Also some other places that arent that interesting, but the whole world looks great. Draculas Castle looks great, some areas of london are gorgeous, and some are not so great. The enemies lack visual variations and sometimes dont feel greatly designed. It feels gorgeous, but some places feel generic and bland, but its supposed to feel like that to enphasize how great the castle is, but the castle per se is not the greatest i have ever seen.\n\n\n\n7/10 - This is a good game, worth playing. Its not a great game but its still a lot of fun. The more i play it, the more interesting it becomes and the more fun i find, exploring the castle is also great. I just wish it wasnt too much in ruins and so small. and that the ending werent so frustating.\n\nIt makes me wish they remade Symphony of the Night for 4k", "timestamp_created": 1550863467, "timestamp_updated": 1551625907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520398378372192383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49078231": {"recommendationid": "49078231", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963491995", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1445, "last_played": 1550959041}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than the LoS 1 but still is nowhere near the quality of the 3D Castlevania titles Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness for PS2.

I didn't find them as terrible as other commenters made them appear to be but I would have preferred a game without them. \n3) Enemies overuse un-blockable attacks instead of utilizing more creative attack sets.\n4) Weapon mastery requires usage of specific move sets to increase the level. Some players will not like being forced into using specific attacks just to complete the upgrade requirements.\n5) Platforming sections are mostly just moving between pre-scripted hold points which doesn't really give the player a feeling that they are actually controlling the character. Very little timing or player skill required.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nAfter completing the base game (no DLC) I am left with no desire to ever replay or continue to explore this title. I'm glad I stuck it out and finished it but overall the entire experience was just run of the mill average.

There have been some reviews from players complaining about stealth elements in the game though I think this is due to lack of knowledge or skill when it comes to this type of video game. In this story Dracula has awoken from death to return to a world that is much different from the one he left. he finds that the devil and his army have pretty much taken over. Dracula in his weakened state is the only one to put an end to hell's armies. However, in order to do so he must regain his power. This is where the stealth comes in Dracula is weak and trying to restore his power meaning he needs to use stealthg and cunning to bypass certain enemies until he is strong enough to take them on head to head. The stealth adds to that bit of the game that makes you feel like you are weak and needing to progress in order to face these foes. \n\nOverall the game is fantastic filled with lots to do, between puzzles, and hidden objects. the game play feels fluid though it lacks a lock on feature. Characters are well developed and the lore within the game is well done. The enemy combat in this game is good as well as groups of human enemies tend to assist each other in combat. My only problem with this game is the constantly returning to the same point to travel farther into the city. This can be a tad annoying though they did make it slightly interesting as every time you venture into that same spot you tend to be greated by different enemies each time.\n\nI strongly recommend this title to anyone who loves castlevania or Devil may cry or any games of that nature as this games offers a lot and a very good story.

Why Dracula has to hide from people when he's one of the most ungodly-powerful beings in existence, doesn't make much sense, especially as you become more powerful throughout the game.\n\nBut the combat is pretty damn fun, has great bosses, some great environments and satisying progression. The game also runs beautifully and is a really solid port in general. On my GTX970 I played it at 1440p 144Hz and I didn't have a single hiccup or crash. The story also has it's moments too, admittedly they're pretty few and far between, but Patrick Stewart and Robbert Carlyle do a great job. As does everyone else actually.\n\nUnlike LOS1 the map is semi-open world, it can get a bit convoluted but fast travel rooms can be found later in the game and revisiting old areas with new abilities feels great.\n\nMy main criticism is the challenges are [i]pointless[/i], usually requiring you to take care of enemies in the most tedious and inefficiant ways possible. Some of them involve you literally waiting around for the AI to complete them for you. Thjey require collectibles to be unlocked in the first place and for your time you get absolutely nothing. Some enemies are horribly unfun to play against - any of them with guns, basically (yes, I'm still talking about a Castlevania game).

Monsters and the player seem to follow different rules - sometimes monsters don't get staggered when they're hit, sometimes monsters use multiple unblockable attacks in a row. Game depends on unblockable attacks for difficulty, rather than unique monster mechanics. Playing above Normal difficulty is dumb; the game scales difficulty by scaling monster HP and damage. Some bosses use the same animation for different attacks. The story is a step down from LoS1, as it lacks organization at points. UI is worse than LoS1 - annoying game menu, relies on minimap arrows to guide the player through areas. Clunky controls at times, unskippable cutscenes. \n\nWhy do I recommend it?

For every good thing, there is a bad thing and a lot of average stuff sprinkled inbetween.\n\nThe game is set a long time after the first game; Gabriel is now Dracula, Satan threatens to return, so we gotta beat up his Acolytes. The story is both straightforward and needlessly convoluted in places, which sometimes makes it hard to follow. The general thread of chasing Satan and his acolytes is always visible though, so it never devolves into utter confusion.\n\nTo bring Satan to his knees, you'll go on an ~20 hour adventure with good, bad and average parts. Best to list them seperately:\n\n[b] Good [/b]\n\n- The game looks nice and runs very well. It's not a graphical masterpiece, but it works and runs fast and fluid with no slowdowns.\n\n- The music is great; it's set in the background in a way that doesn't make it annoying, but it steps forward in just the right moments.\n\n- Great voice acting, cool included collectible artwork and amazing designs. Everything just looks cool, from Dracula himself to the mobs and boss enemies.\n\n[b] Average [/b]\n\n- The active battle system is serviceable, but really nothing special. You have 3 weapons, each with very few distinctive skills. The rest of the skills are essentially the same for all the weapons (they all have an air attack, AOE attack etc.) which can make combat monotonous.\n\n- The collectibles are scattered everywhere and are somewhat frustrating to get to. Due to the world being split into two parts you can only travel between at certain spots, as well as some collectibles only being accessible with dungeon keys you can carry a maximum of 3 of, you'll do a lot of backtracking and pointless walking whenever you need to refill keys or obtain a new ability. They aren't quite optional either since they increase your maximum life or weapon energy.\n\n- While the bosses have great designs, most of the fights are nothing special and too easy even on the hardest difficulty. The annoyance of enemies stems more from the unreliable dodge of Dracula, rather than their strength or difficulty.\n\n[b] Bad [/b]\n\n- The game has a few stealth sections that range from okay to utterly frustrating. The mechanics are half baked, you often get spotted for no reason and sometimes it's not clear how to proceed. Especially as you near the end and are really strong, one questions the need of stealth sections at that point...yet there's still one or two short before the end of the game.\n\n- The game has a number of optional unlockable challenge battles. Those range from fun to very frustrating, and some are borderline impossible to complete with all emblems. Emblems only unlock when you fulfill a specific condition in that battle - like, defeat enemies without breaking their shields. Some of those emblems are extremely frustrating to get and require you to do some very strange \"gameplay acrobatics\", almost breaking the game in unintended ways. Also, they serve absolutely no purpose - there isn't even an achievement for getting all of them.\n\n- The world is bland. All game, you are either in dark city, or dark castle. The first game had forests, snow landscapes and generally varying enviroments. That's all gone here and it's a sad sin. There are only three areas that stand out, but all of those are very short and don't even take up 10 % of the total game area.\n\n- The open world structure of the game isn't thought out very well. Fast travel is only useable at a few certain points, there is no bigger map; that means you essentially have to memorize all the paths and shortcuts, or else you won't know how to get to a specific landmark or area. Generally, the map feature in this game is pretty useless.\n\n\nAs you can see, this game is very average. Great designs, music and characters meet okay gameplay and some questionable design choices. It's definitely not an awful game, and I wouldn't quite call it bad; but the first one was definitely a step above.

LoS2 is really not a Castlevania game, but it is a decent gothic adventure game- it's bigger and more polished than I expected- it can be really a gorgeous game at times with a fantastic art style, and the controls feel good. And I like Robert Carlyle's performance as Gabriel. \n\nWhat really lets it down are some bad gameplay choices, particularly the stealth sections- they have no place in this game, and are easily the most tedious, frustrating parts...I absolutely hated the encounter with Agreus for example, and almost considered giving up on the game at that point. Some of the puzzles and platforming are very questionable as well.\n\nAnother big issue is the extremely poor map system- it makes trying to figure out how to get somewhere such a pain that I didn't bother going back for many of the upgrades I could have gotten...the 2D Castlevanias always had great, clear maps that made the world feel connected- the map system in this game makes things feel disjointed and confusing, and really discourages exploration. I used to like backtracking in the older games because I knew where everything was by looking at the map- this game forces you to try to remember where something is in a lot of same-y environments, and that is not fun...it's a frustrating waste of my time. The save system is problematic as well...I always had to hope when I quit I wouldn't have to replay very much of what I just did...I just can't understand why so many modern games lack a manual save, or save and quit option.\n\nNot a plus or minus really, but the game is very dark- it takes place entirely at night, in a sunless, completely man made world...there are no organic, natural environments to speak of (with the exception of one very small area), which I find unfortunate. The game is set entirely within Dracula's castle complex, in both modern and ancient times, for good or bad- many of the \"modern\" areas look like generic backgrounds from a thousands other games, but the when you shift back in time, it is far more interesting- the gothic architecture and art are stunning. I can't say I care much for any of the music in the Lords of Shadow games...I find most of it to be boring and generic, and a poor showing for a series known for such iconic music.\n\nMercury Steam's Castlevanias are not true Castlevania games in my opinion, and I would have liked them more if they were their own original games without the Castlevania name attached at all. People have expectations when you put Castlevania in the title, and while not bad games (the first LoS game was quite good, but was more God of War than Castlevania), the Lords of Shadow games just don't live up to the name or legacy.

I still remember how I felt when I started playing it, though, so here are the major disappointments you'd be better to be prepared to.\n\n1- The PC port still bears the mark of the title's console origin: all keys in the game are expressed in terms of X, Y, LT, RT, and whatnot. It's very lazy and it sucks. A lot. \n\nIt sucks because the menus are almost incomprehensible at first, and you'll need to check the internet to find out what keys you need to press to move from one submenu to the other.\n\nIt sucks big time because all events during the quicktime events are also shown in terms of B, A etc, and you'll better be very very quick to learn their meaning by heart.\n\nIt uber-sucks because all moves are also explained with those terms: no problem at the start, when it's \"X, X, X and then X\", but when the moves become more powerful and complicated, you'll stop caring and just use the ones you know, because you can't understand/remember the explanation.\n\n2- there are annoying stealth parts. They don't fit the game *at all* and the developer had to pull some very awkward moves to justify their existence (e.g. you have a very powerful medallion that essentially \"clears the room\" but when you try to use it against the monster you try to avoid Dracula says \"now it's not the time\". What?!).

Los modelos de los personajes si que se ven claramente mejores que los de la primera entrega, pero lo dem\u00e1s pasa bastante desapercibido.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de niveles es regulero y es una l\u00e1stima que se haya cambiado el dise\u00f1o por cap\u00edtulos por el intento de \"sandbox\" por as\u00ed decirlo, que es esta nueva entrega. El hecho de tener que volver a visitar escenarios para desbloqueables ser\u00eda un aliciente para el nuevo juego +, pero al no contar con las habilidades necesarias, que se pierden al empezar de nuevo, pierde cualquier incentivo. \n\nLas habilidades no son nada del otro mundo, y una de las que m\u00e1s se echa en falta es el doble salto, que se consigue hacia el final de la aventura lo que es un desperdicio. La niebla fundamentalmente sirve para revisitar escenarios y algo para el sigilo.\n\nEl sigilo es una novedad jugable en esta entrega y es totalmente innecesaria dado que en un hack n slash el sigilo suena a chiste (m\u00e1s siendo el personaje todopoderoso que es en teor\u00eda Dracula). El sigilo es muy mon\u00f3tono y aburrido y cada fase con este estilo fracasa, particularmente el sigilo en el castillo es bastante m\u00e1s llevadero que en el mundo \"actual\".\n\nEl juego se divide en dos escenarios, castillo y ciudad, el primero es m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sico y realmente funciona bastante mejor que el segundo, no necesariamente porque pegue m\u00e1s o menos, quiz\u00e1s mejor llevado podr\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s entretenido, pero la ciudad realmente es peor que las fases en el castillo.\n\nEl combate tiene poco que destacar y aun para el genero el juego es bastante escaso, teniendo tan solo tres armas, una que recupera vida, otra que rompe defensas, y la est\u00e1ndar. Otros juegos introducen demasiadas armas que al final no acabas usando pero en Lords of Shadow 2 pasa al otro extremo d\u00e1ndote lo justo. El juego cuenta adem\u00e1s con una mec\u00e1nica de bloqueo que en la dificultad normal por lo menos puedes pasar completamente de ella sin ning\u00fan problema, tampoco es que se recompense demasiado al jugador por bloquear ya sea dicho...\n\nLa historia no est\u00e1 mal aunque el giro argumental m\u00e1s o menos te lo esperes y el hecho de llevar a Dr\u00e1cula es un buen incentivo para estar interesado, aunque la impresi\u00f3n final es la de haber desaprovechado la ocasi\u00f3n, tanto la de controlar a Dr\u00e1cula como la de la ambientaci\u00f3n moderna. Por otro lado el desenlace del juego es soso siendo muy generesos. Ni cierra la historia ni es la mitad de \u00e9pico que el primer juego.\n\nEs una pena que toda la trama intermedia entre el primer Lords of Shadow y este se perdiera en Mirror of Fate, pudiendo haberse aprovechado y explotado mucho m\u00e1s en una entrega \"principal\". Sin duda la primera entrega por s\u00ed sola es un mejor producto en cuanto a nivel de argumento y narraci\u00f3n. Aunque tambi\u00e9n se fallaba al no contar con escenas cinem\u00e1ticas y optar por est\u00e9tica c\u00f3mic para terminar la historia que por otro lado era fant\u00e1stica y la pega la ten\u00eda en como se mostraba.\n\nLos jefes finales, tanto en el juego principal como en el DLC, vuelven a caer en el pico de dificultad absurdo y son batallas ciertamente malogradas, poco variadas y decepcionantes. Sin embargo el juego no es un desastre respecto a este apartado y hay alg\u00fan que otro jefe que si que realmente merece la pena aunque no tienen el toque que tenian los jefes del primer juego, tanto en trasfondo como en variedad de mec\u00e1nicas etc. Una verdadera pena que el jefe final no est\u00e9 a la altura de lo que tendr\u00eda que ser el desenlace de la aventura. A pesa de todo el jefe se acaba despachando con un poco de paciencia, no por lo que tarda sino por lo aburrido que es, ataques inbloqueables todo el rato, aprovechas el hueco y atacas (dos veces como mucho) y venga otra vez. Menci\u00f3n especial al destrozo que le hacen a Sat\u00e1n en cuanto al dise\u00f1o, aunque el primero no era un dise\u00f1o espectacular, el segundo Sat\u00e1n es ciertamente m\u00e1s feo que el primero y queda extravagante. \n\nEsta extravagancia se repite en los enemigos normales que abundan por la ciudad que son una especie de mutados raros. Ciertamente el juego cuenta con poca variedad de enemigos pero tampoco es dr\u00e1matico, simplemente lo hace m\u00e1s m\u00f3notono. Su dise\u00f1o tampoco es llamativo y en la segunda mitad del juego aumenta algo la variedad (en general el \u00faltimo tercio del juego es bastante mejor y m\u00e1s entretenido).\n\nEl juego en general carece de dificultad si cuentas con las reliquias y si mueres alguna vez ser\u00e1 por un despiste puntual de querer ahorrar reliquias (aunque ni haga falta y sea m\u00e1s por costumbre de otros juegos). El tema de las reliquias y que se puedan adem\u00e1s transmutar es un fallo de dise\u00f1o y deber\u00eda haberse equilibrado para evitarlo.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n es aceptable e incluso un poco menos no hubiera estado mal, recortando las fases de sigilo el juego hubiera sido m\u00e1s redondo. El DLC lleva mejor este aspecto siendo m\u00e1s entretenido y \u00e1gil, un acierto lo del teletransporte mediante murci\u00e9lagos en ciertas posiciones. Tiene puzzles un solo jefe eso s\u00ed (dos quiz\u00e1 pero realmente el jefe es el final) y una dosis de plataformas mejor llevadas que en la historia principal, quiz\u00e1s el fallo aqu\u00ed es el personaje que es m\u00e1s soso que Dr\u00e1cula pero en general el DLC es un buen producto, aunque corto.\n\nEl doblaje por otro lado es decente y la voz de Dr\u00e1cula la pone Robert Carlyle que lo hace francamente bien y le da el tono adecuado al personaje.\n\nEn l\u00edneas generales se podr\u00eda decir que Lords of Shadow 2 es peor que su predecesor, innovando de manera equivocada y con pocas mejoras, pero todo esto no lo hace un mal juego. En general el juego es entretenido aunque tenga sus momentos m\u00e1s aburridos y el combate sin ser satisfactorio no es injugable, solo en ciertos momentos la c\u00e1mara no act\u00faa correctamente, pero por lo dem\u00e1s es de suficiente. Y es que el juego no llega al notable por poco pero de manera clara, es peor que el anterior, innova de mala manera y el final encima no da el cierre que se merece. Lamentablemente si te gusta la saga probablemente te decepcione pero como videojuego es un producto de suficiente alto que podr\u00eda haber llegado al notable poni\u00e9ndole m\u00e1s esfuerzo.", "timestamp_created": 1536711098, "timestamp_updated": 1536711098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44635763": {"recommendationid": "44635763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113505025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 3120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2836, "last_played": 1428212134}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the much darker vibe this game has compared to the first Lords of Shadow.

You have Dracula, Alucard, dark, gothic castles accompanied by the moonlit sky. GREAT!\nThis game's combat is more refined than the last & more if it's own identity\nthan that of God of War or Shadow of the Colossus.\nIt doesn't feature levels with the game telling you what you're missing to backtrack right after finishing the mission, but allows you to fast travel between cities or ultimately free roam to look for what was missing. The game also allows players to freely move the camera about, making platforming & jumping overall much easier/better than the last game.\nIt truely is a gem & one of the most underrated games imo.\nRegardless of the flack it got by game critics, don't listen to them.\nYes there are a few stealth parts in the game, and it's discouraging from seeing the immortal Dracula, to a rat scurrying in the shadows.

I still haven't played the first one but after playing LOS 2 2 times with DLC i don't really understand why it has so poor scores on metacritic. C'mon 58 out of 100 is not even funny. Maybe it's me but this game has so much pros that totally overweights it's cons. But i think we all can agree that stealth missons were garbage.) And some game mechanics too. I am playing as a goddamn Dracula. Even though he is weakened a shotgun to the face was one of the scariest things in the game (especially on Prince of Darkness difficulty). That pissed me off quite a lot. And some kleidos challenges were a little bit too as_s (thanks Steam) rap_ing. \nBut overall LOS 2 was pretty solid game. It has [list]\n[*] Good storyline. It has only few cringey moments though (such as [spoiler]Schwarzenegger Satan[/spoiler]. \n[*] Voice acting. Patric Stewart. I guess it's enough.)\n[*] Combat system. I really liked counterattack and how it looks. It shows raw power behind the move. Leveling system that makes you use all of the abilites not only 2-3 combos. Various weapons (though devs were a little bit lazy and made the same animation for some moves)\n[*]Wery well made cutscenes on game's engine.\n[*]Lore of the game that was well written in tons of in-game texts\n[*]Music. That was one of the best things in the game. And music was perfectly fitted for moments where it was. I greatly enjoyed the game's ost. Didn't really expect it to be so gothic and majestic at the same time \n[*]Graphics and optimization. Even though my system is not really good LOS 2 was running pretty well at high settings. I think for 2014 and not really big AAA game it looked pretty well. Though not the graphics itself but design attracted me most. That Dracula's waving red cloak. Majestic look of two vampires showing how attractive such ''unlife'' can be. Enemy's design. Huge titan and agile pan. Terrifying creatures of Hell and blessed fighters of the humanity etc.\n[/list]\nSo for me the only bad things were stealth missions and some plot holes. Too hated and overlooked game.

The game starts with knights attacking Dracula's castle. He swiftly dispatches all of them before being confronted by the revived Alucard\n\n  A thousand years have passed and Dracula awakens in a cathedral in modern times, weak from starvation and with no memory of the circumstances that led him there. He is warned by his former enemy, Zobek , of the return of Satan, who until then was deterred from doing so by Dracula himself. Zobek offers him his old weapon, the Vampire Killer, the only relic capable of ending his cursed existence, in exchange for him vanquishing the people trying to bring Satan back, his acolytes. The key to him regaining his power lies in his castle, which the cursed blood that kept it alive for centuries attempts to deter Dracula of his quest. Throughout his journey, Dracula is aided by various allies, including Zobek's bodyguard and specters of his deceased wife Marie  and a younger Trevor.\n\nAfter all that suffer Gabriel took,Will he save the world once more or let the mankind fall down?\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n  As in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world.During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Shadow Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.Lords of Shadow 2 features a movable camera, something that was not available in its predecessor.\n\nHere why I'm suggest the game;\n-Unique voice cast starring with Robert Carlyle&Richard Madden(That's right, the guy in the GoT show)\n-Gergeous songs\n-Last and the best one is they fixed the GOD DAMN CAMERA!!!\nExtra:Still you're killing enemies with erotic whip which makes you feel good.", "timestamp_created": 1531942619, "timestamp_updated": 1531998298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641451001167297363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43594765": {"recommendationid": "43594765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060721962", "num_games_owned": 1758, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1836, "last_played": 1531870099}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely worth the 1 euro I paid.", "timestamp_created": 1531870228, "timestamp_updated": 1531870228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490266770124435425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43588201": {"recommendationid": "43588201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068050492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 184, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1605719758}, "language": "english", "review": "controls looks like xbox and i don't have a controller", "timestamp_created": 1531845436, "timestamp_updated": 1531845436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.313801884651184082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43553372": {"recommendationid": "43553372", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995285223", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1142, "last_played": 1531682011}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game.

My critique on that area would maybe be that the modern urban design felt slightly uninspired, the castle itself is gorgeously done-no complaints there. The character and enemy visual designs were also well done. \n\nGameplay wise however, the game falls a little flat. Combat had a lot of potential, with a good amount of movesets and combo chaining opportunity-which is one of the reason it is often compared to Devil May Cry. However it fell short of what it could have been-unless playing on easy mode, filling up the power bars to utilize these moveset abilities other than the bloodwhip can be a pain.  Enemies feel repetive and more an impediment than an enjoyment to smash through.\n\nBoss fights in this game can be described as uninspired, which is a shame-as I mentioned, they are well designed visually. Most of these consist of using an ability to get past the boss's mechanic and beating on the boss, then repeating the same-sometimes with a God Of War like QTE type prompt to execute a move. \n\nLevel design aside from visuals, often just has you running from one zone to another and climbing around in mechanics inspired by assassins creed to reach your goal. This is often accompanied by  having to turn on a switch which turns on power to get to the objective-which would be fine, if it wasn't beaten to death as a mechanic on EVERY zone on the city area. \nAside from the climbing and turning on power-level design suffers from poor telegraphing, with most of the poorly executed \"stealth\" sections giving little to no indication of how to solve them. one egregious example is one where Dracula must use his mistform ability to pass thru an enemy-a mechanic that is never used or introduced before this part. I was confused for a good while on this part as an elevator door kept opening when I did a certain action which wasn't my goal or part of the area's mechanics toward objective. \n\nthe best part of the game for me was the Toy Maker boss, both in design and his story, it was the only one that really shone out in the game tbh.\n\nExtras-doing a completionist run on this game is a time consumption and generally not worth while for the reward. With most of the collectibles (power pool upgrades and XP boosts-oh as well as unlocks for challenge [arena] mode) being in clear view and tauntingly just out of reach-they only become obtainable once you unlock an ability to reach them. This requires a lot of backtracking, which becomes a pain because that means hitting those switches again and zoneing from one to another, thru the wolf doors that take you between the castle/city traversing through zones again and then having to clear the respawned enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1530842042, "timestamp_updated": 1530842042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593370676040649414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43326486": {"recommendationid": "43326486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174424737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1660786768}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems like a god of war ripoff.", "timestamp_created": 1530802369, "timestamp_updated": 1530802369, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.318064779043197632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43313721": {"recommendationid": "43313721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212969225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1949, "last_played": 1475652329}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nada del otro mundo, mas aburrido que el primero y tedioso.\n\nno lo recomiendo a ningun fan de la saga.", "timestamp_created": 1530763939, "timestamp_updated": 1530763939, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43274050": {"recommendationid": "43274050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986967075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2161, "last_played": 1530472122}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than the first, but with a lot of the same problems.\n\nHardly a castelvania game.

Ten hours into the game with all of your weapons and relics, it makes no sense to sneak around a boss you fight five minutes later. In the lore you defeat (something like) 5,000 soldiers of the brotherhood of light. Why am I sneaking around anybody then?

It is a sequel to the series reboot Castlevania:Lords of Shadow from 2010.\n\nStory takes place few days after post-credits scene in Lords of Shadow and few centuries after Mirror of Fate, Gabriel Belmont known now as Dracula hides from world in his isolation, resulting in his lack of power. Tired of his immortality he decides to help his former enemy Zobek to stop Satan from returning to human world. To do so first he must regain his powers, then eliminate all the Acolytes hiding in Castlevania City. Through the journey our protagonist also must survive his inner battle to preserve his human emotions. Overally the story is darker than in first game, not really better but definetely not terrible either.\nGameplay has been much improved since Lords of Shadow 1, we still proceed through locations by walking, climbing and acquiring skills to backtrack and get previously unavailable upgrades, BUT now the camera is not locked, which was the biggest issue of the first game. The new issue however are stealth sections that were executed really poorely. Fighting has been divided to 3 styles, default is focused on Shadow Whip and is preety similar to what we saw in original LoS, switching to Void Sword and Chaos Claws changes the fighting completely, both cannot be held forever cause they are limited by amount of magic in Void and Chaos gauges that can be replenished by dealing damage to enemies flawlessly (using Whip only). Sword heals you while damaging opponents, but Claws increase the damage and allow to break shields. Every style might be upgraded by spending earned money in menu, there is also skill mastery level that increase while using those skills. I have got to admit that combat here is real fun (Take that haters).\nThrough ths game we will encounter 2 types of locations, mostly you will spend time in modern places, that (let us be honest about this) suck, too simple similar places filled with same boring climate.

Poruqe lo peor sin lugar a dudas de \u00e9ste castlevania es su historia. \n\nDesde siempre, esta saga a estado unida a la lucha entre los Belmont y su archienemigo, Dr\u00e1cula. En este caso, Dr\u00e1cula es el protaginista de esta historia, entonces, qui\u00e9n es el enemigo a batir? Lo m\u00e1s l\u00f3gico hubiera sido que los Belmont, convertir al personaje en un antih\u00e9roe y hacer un giro de 180 grados a la historia..pero no, el se\u00f1or Enric penso que lo m\u00e1s l\u00f3gico era enfrentar a Dr\u00e1cula con...SATAN. Si, como suena, tan r\u00eddiculo como suena, y no solo eso, sino mezclando mitolog\u00eda cristiana con griega, conviertiendo a Dr\u00e1cula en el chico bueno, algo que no pega ni con cola en aras de un mal mayor.  Lo que empezo muy bien en lords of shadow  y continuo genial en mirror of fate, aqui se lo cepillan de manera irrevocable, Una pena.\n\nPero no todo es malo, ya que como juego de Castlevania, si que ofrece lo que debe ofrecer, y es un metroidvania en tres dimensiones, con dos mapeados gigantes y muy enrevesados llenos de secretos a descubrir seg\u00fan aumentemos la habilidad del personaje, y una mec\u00e1nica estilo hack and slash en los combates como ya conociamos de entregas anteriores.

Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a vast improvement from its predecessor, and while it tries a few new things that don't quite work out, the majority of the experience is truly worth at least one playthrough.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]-Breathtaking graphics combined with breathtaking art direction make this one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. Every different place you go and enemy you meet is just a pleasure to look at.\n    [*]-Combat is improved from the first game, being tighter and bringing more variety both to weapons and moveset. It still leaves some to be desired, especially when compared to the likes of Devil May Cry, but it's a fun combat nonetheless and it gets the job done without major concerns.\n    [*]-Plot is very nice. Very dark and personal. It's interesting in the beggining and throughout the game, and the twists and turns are really some masterful plays.\n    [*]-Probably the most interesting depiction of Dracula, ever.\n    [*]-Voice acting is very nice. Also improved from the first game. Dracula's performance in particular stands out.\n    [*]-Chupacabras are no longer the rage inducing insects they once were in the first game.\n    [*]-Characters look amazing. Playing with Dracula is that much more fun because he looks awesome.\n    [*]-Varied environments, each one hand crafted to perfection. Everything is fun to walk around and explore.\n    [*]-Platforming is improved from the first game and it feels very tight and responsive. Visual cues are key for this in this game, and they are used very cleverly when it comes to platforming here.\n    [*]-Seamless journey through the environments makes this feel like a really tight and nicely packaged experience. Gone are the days of level selecting. The game is not exactly open-world, but everything is well connected and you are free to come and go as you please.\n    [*]-THE best vampire scene in any game ever made. Not only that, but vampires are brought back to what they once were in this game: the terrifying blood-sucking beasts of our nightmares.\n    [*]-Option to play without quicktime events.\n    [*]-Nicely optimized.\n    [*]-Very small download and install size (around ~5gb).\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] Neutral [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]-This game could have some really nice Steam backgrounds and badges, but it doesn't have cards, unfortunately.\n    [*]-Music is ok. Nothing memorable, but it gets the job done.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]-Every button prompt in the game appears as Xbox buttons, even if you have no controller plugged in. This is a real shame bacause, other than that, the port is excellent.\n    [*]-Stealth sections. Yes, Dracula needs to resort to stealth a couple of times in this game. As you'd expect, they suck.\n    [*]-Armored robot enemies are ridiculous to fight against. They also keep shooting at you with machine guns, making the fight even more dreadful.\n    [*]-Sprint mechanic remains from the first game. However, the game doesn't even teach you about sprinting, and every time you sprint you only do it for three steps. There's no bonus to be gained from it whatsoever, like longer jump or anything like that (contrary to the first game where sprinting was a key mechanic). It really feels like they forgot to remove it.\n    [*]-Somewhat lackluster final boss fight.\n    [*]-Trasversing through environments can be a chore, because a lot of times you are forced to do things such as pulling levers and then waiting for the door to open, or cross a bridge where the character forcefully starts to walk instead of running, this type of thing. It could use a little more polish to make everything run more smoothly. This is especially a problem when you're backtracking, even more so because the game puts a lot of its collectibles in unreachable parts of the world, making you come back later when you have the required ability if you want to collect everything.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1524346128, "timestamp_updated": 1526586102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705502927303314209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41569148": {"recommendationid": "41569148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336608168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 1613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1564, "last_played": 1550581295}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En el episodio de hoy de Manqueando... \"Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2\"\n\nNo me voy a extender mucho, que no me apetece.

La otra, la que me pareci\u00f3 m\u00e1s interesante de largo, es la del pasado, que adem\u00e1s de ser m\u00e1s acorde con la saga, es la que mueve todo el meollo de Gabriel y su lucha interna y dem\u00e1s. Ah\u00ed est\u00e1 la chicha de la historia. El presente... meh. no est\u00e1 mal.\n\nEl control es muy bueno, y la m\u00fasica no est\u00e1 mal, pero diria que me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s la del anterior.

Or right after it since you can explore as long as you want before starting new game+ from the menu)\n- Good soundtrack, never got bored of it.             \n- The bundle DLC skins are good, a little annoying that they don't use the same location to chose both (one in the additional content like a DLC, the other instead is in the ingame option) and that you have to select it again every time you launch the game.\n\nCons:           \n- The stealth parts (especially the one in advanced point of the story) are damn boring and are easily the worst part in the game period.       \n- The story feels quite weak and after the prologue it doesn't feel like using Dracula but simply Gabriel Belmont with vampiric powers (it really lack the villain feeling that being Dracula should provide).                    \n- The boss are way too easy to defeat; for someone playing on hard they never felt a challenge or a problem, kinda let down of their boss status (and having an healing consumable lower even more their difficulty... ).              \n- 1 consumable is straight useless (the weapon mastery one), the unlimited magic is needed only to close some challenges on Prince of Darkness without going mad.          \n\nRelevation DLC: Good DLC, worth the price. Using Alucard is definitely fun and the powers are well diversified from Dracula, it truly feels like a different character while having the same combat system.

The absorbing energy system distracts you and is slow to consume. The camera widescreen range is not big enough for combat areas and according to the story you should gain powers but that doesn't happen every time and surprisingly there are some logic flaws in the story \n\nBut overall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a good continuation to a great reboot to such a great classic!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n\n[b] REVIEW SOURCES: [/b]\n[list]\n[*] None", "timestamp_created": 1520076075, "timestamp_updated": 1520076147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47918584942817688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40465924": {"recommendationid": "40465924", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991020304", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1519836971}, "language": "english", "review": "Really just didn't care for this game.

When the game finally released, I was awe struck as before with the beautiful and engulfing graphics right from the start to the very end, even when I revisited this game in 2018 to finally complete the single player story mode.    The moves and controls are similar to the first LoS so it didn't take very long for me to get aquainted with them.  The game flowed very smoothly with the frame rates no matter how the graphic settings were for me.  \n\nNow, you're probably wondering why it took me 4 years to complete a game that I loved so much right?  The answer is CONTROLS.  Unfortunately, the developers listened to the nit wits that complained so much about the first one not having any controllable camera, so the devs made LoS2 ONLY have a player controlled camera option.  This was annoying to say the least in always working the camera and also concentrating on battles and puzzles.  Since the camera options did not help at all, the controls suffered immensely.  There were many times where you had to do 2 or 3 things at one time and working that camera stick was far beyond annoying.  This ultimately made me quit on this game for years!  Then recently I made it a goal to complete the story mode since I was at the end part anyways (right before fighting Death).  The storyline is god aweful as well, set in a timeline of the future in Castlevania city?  With a mix of modern civilization and accursed monsters.  It was more like a steampunk kind of environment, but not really.  Also the fact you are suppose to be the all powerful Dracula, but appear to be much weaker and malevolent than even the minions in this game nevertheless the bosses.  \n\nApart from that, I do want to mention the extravegant extras!  The artwork was plenty and magnificent to see.  The 2 extra costumes were very fun to play with, the boss fights had great music and were exciting to be in.  The DLC so far has many puzzles, but you get to play as Alucard and that alone makes it totally awesome.  But even with all of this, and even though I love the LoS series so much, I can not recommend this game.  I am not saying that it is a bad game at all, but only saying that it is in my opinion the worst game of the 3 game LoS series.  Others may not mind the controls or the direction the series went.  It actually breaks my heart that I had to switch my recommendation in the middle of this review.\n\n[h1]Rating: 7/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1519390289, "timestamp_updated": 1530787802, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461367994546890259", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40316909": {"recommendationid": "40316909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327986821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2650, "last_played": 1520841404}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego la verdad est\u00e1 muy bueno, se que le faltaron algunos detalles, yo lo calificar\u00eda con 8.5/10.

It tries to be story-oriented game and open-worldish RPG-Metroidvania, but it doesn't mix well. \n\nThe pacing is a mess. Story goes like this: you are awoken after hundreds of years since the last game and have to stop Satan's acolytes before they summoned their lord. The plot implies that you have limited time and have to act fast, but the gameplay dissolves all the tension the story creates. There's a lot of backtracking and climbing which will get annoying very fast. There is a fast-travel system, but there aren't that many points you can travel to and it requires watching painfully slow animations every time you use it. I guess they tried to hide loading screen with this, but somehow I feel more comfortable with regular loading screens than with these pointless cutscenes.\n\nGameplay is much better than the previous two games, there are more combos and upgrades. As in the previous Castlevania games you can buy combos with experience points you earn from killing your enemies or searching for secrets. This game introduces new aspect to this system - weapon mastery level. When you use your combos in battle you become more skilled and deadly. The combo can only generate fixed amount of these mastery points, so the game forces you to use different combos to upgrade your weapons. Another new addition to combat system is artifacts, those are items you can use in combat to make your enemies slower, to refill your health and magic meters, etc. Magic system also endured some changes, now each magic associated with its weapon, blue magic - sword, red magic - burning gloves. These weapons fill quite different than standard whip and have its own combos. \n\nEven though the game takes place in modern times, you'll still visit ancient castles and dungeons. The world is beautifully crafted, this time not only artistically, technical side is far superior than that of the predecessors. As a result game plays much smoother than previous one and has more cinematic look. Voice acting is fine, Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle return to reprise their roles as Zobek and Dracula respectively. But without narration by Stewart it doesn't feel quite as good as in first one. Soundtrack is ok, its there but you probably won't notice it for the most time.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]: \n- Well-designed combat system\n- Epic boss battles\n- Engaging story\n- Good level-design \n- Great voice acting\n\n[b]Cons[/b]:\n- No fun to get around open world\n- Awful stealth\n\nIt is tough to decide wether to recommend this game. I'd say this one has the best combat system in the whole series, but the other parts of the game just mediocre. There's also a couple of stealth segments, which are just as awful as DLC boss in the first game.

However, many problems still remain, problems that lie far deeper than any gameplay or environment improvements could improve. For one, I'm certain the dialogue is written by high school students, and the untalented ones at that (maybe they were trying to be campy, I dunno). The lead character is badass for about an hour before he turns into an adult with teen angst. In fact, most of the characters come off as fragile, in a way that makes you wonder how the writers who were so obviously attempting badassery fell so far off the mark. Plus, at no point did I actually feel anything for any of the characters: the emotions are so forced it's like you walked into a soap opera mid season. The drama lacked context. As for the story, it often tries to pull off the ol' \"JRPGs: plotholes are a feature\" trick where you raise your eyebrows but quickly decide not to pursue the inconsistencies because the game's fun enough to ignore them. However, this game does not have the charm nor the wit to go about that and the plotholes metastasize on the narrative. \n\nSome of the boss fights are pretty cool! Others are pretty lame. \n\nElephant in the room? It's a God of War knock-off. No, not every hack-and-slash is a GoW knock-off, but this game and its predecessor are quite obvious about it. And it's a bad knock-off at that! The people who developed this clearly missed much of what made God of War so great. Most of the game is bland but competent, some of the game is actually interesting and enjoyable however, there were definitely times when I rolled my eyes and rethought my decision to keep playing. In the end, I couldn't finish the original game and I can't finish this either. \n\nThese games may have had good intentions, but they'll always be a series of subpar knock-offs to me.\n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1517612283, "timestamp_updated": 1517629681, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511274933815002441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39741996": {"recommendationid": "39741996", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986480861", "num_games_owned": 4192, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1544, "last_played": 1405648811}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tan bueno como el primero o mejor tal vez.

The combat is quite fun though it can be a bit of a chaotic mess when you are fighting tons of enemies. The idea that you gain magic by not taking any damage for a extended time makes hit detection really important and there were times when i didn't agree with the hit detection. \n\nOverall though this was a really fun game and there is a ton of content in it so if this is your genre then you should probably check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1517162042, "timestamp_updated": 1517162042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39663260": {"recommendationid": "39663260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010736785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1517081297}, "language": "spanish", "review": "yo no me puedo decidir si este juego es normal o malo al igual que la historia principal de este juego no se puede decidir si se trata de detener a satan o resolver los problemas familiares de dracula muchas veses se me olvidaba en lo que estaba en la historia principal por que me arrastraron al castillo para poder desbloquear una habilidad para poder continuar. los saltos entre el mundo real y el castillo no tienen sentido pero al final es un juego pasable si no se comprar con el primero", "timestamp_created": 1517081672, "timestamp_updated": 1517081672, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39655839": {"recommendationid": "39655839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133806369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2308, "last_played": 1513263589}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una mejora respecto a LoS, la camara ya no molesta, mejora en jugabilidad y graficos.

All your abilities and attacks contain lengthy cooldown periods which require precognition more than tactics or choice. They think they are preventing players from \"button mashing\".\nThey are not. \n\nIf you want a game with three-dimensional combat, you must make sure that enemy attacks don't clip through the player without damaging them, or that attacks which miss the player don't register as hits.\nThis game does not do that.\nInstead, all actions are based on the idea that where you must stand and what you must do are predetermined; if you are standing where an attack will hit, it doesn't matter if the enemy is even remotely near that spot. You will be damaged. If you are standing in a \"safe\" spot, the enemy can clip through you and you will not be damaged.\nThey do not have fun bossfights; they have gimmick-ridden car wrecks that feel more like poorly designed puzzles than combat.\n\nIf you want to have a game with climbing/parkour involved (wait, this game stars Dracula. Isn't Dracula supposed to be able to fly...), you need to have a system in place where players can choose where to go and have a degree of control over their own movement. Thus the challenge (and fun) of the game becomes choosing how to use your locomotion to reach a place you wish to go.\nThis game does not do that. \nEverything is on a rail. There is one SPECIFIC path, and you must take it and every step of it in a specific order. You may be dangling less than three feet above a walkway you have traveled a thousand times, but there is no button to let go of your handhold and walk across it: You must climb all the way over to the end of the platform and receive the contextual command to do so. You can see an item you need which is dangling in a place you can easily reach with a normal jump, but there will be an invisible wall between you and it which cannot be circumvented because you are intended to go three rooms over and get in through a different door. The distance by which you can jump from one handhold to another is determined solely by where the devs chose to place them, not by your aim, foresight, or even the physical ability of the character you control.

Can be an example for single player games. Solid story, solid gameplay, solid combo combat. Aside from the fact that bosses are little loo, I don't think there's other things pretty bad about this game. \n\nMusic, voice acting, character development, boom, blow your mind. \n\nI particularly remember when I played God of War on PSP, and this game has the same vibes. The mesmorizing story drives you into playing it, and you would simply stay for the world. \n\nI think the lore, world elements are pretty rich in this game. The background of Dracula and other characters in the game. It's really hard to see this kind of style in any other western games, only Japanese games would have this kind of \"beat bosses, reach final boss\" stuff. And they did do a good job on making the bosses memorable.\n\nIn first playthrogh I set the difficulty straight to hard, Lord of Shadow, and it feels pretty good. I guess if you play this game with k+m, or in simpler difficulty you will find it underwhelming.\n\nCutscenes and loading screens are great, great stuff. Many game theories can be found in this game and Mercury definitely executed them excellently. The levels in this game are nostalgic. As today's world has become more and more open-world, single player like this and levels like this would really show it's a gem for the genre. \n\nI still remember how Assassin's Creed, Prince of Persia and old Tomb Raider's levels, this one is pretty much like those, with its own Gothic and dark style. \n\nOn first hand, I thought this one maybe another Devil May Cry, but apparently it's not, it's much slower than DMC, but it has its own pace.\n\nAnd the stealth section of transforming to a mouse is really innovative. I think games I've played to handle \"stealth\" with this style can only be Dishonored, but that game is pure stealth game. Castlevanian is a combo game.\n\nI am not very familiar with the arcade Castlevania lore, even I played them when I was little, but this game's lore fasinates me.\n\nWorth the buy, recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1510532325, "timestamp_updated": 1510532325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512447714805603027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36399030": {"recommendationid": "36399030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115110908", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1387, "last_played": 1621107740}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Contin\u00faa la gran historia de Gabriel Belmont ahora convertido en Dracula, Pr\u00edncipe de las tinieblas con el estilo Hack & Slash de LoS1, magnifica ambientaci\u00f3n, m\u00fasica memorable y jugabilidad excelente, magnifica historia y puzzles entretenidos. \n \nSe recomienda jugar la trilog\u00eda en orden cronol\u00f3gico si quieres entender bien todo el trasfondo de lords of shadow y no olvidar que esta trilog\u00eda es canon pero que no sigue la misma linea que la saga principal de Castlevania.", "timestamp_created": 1510241206, "timestamp_updated": 1700686503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36353372": {"recommendationid": "36353372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058020519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1543254767}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1510093286, "timestamp_updated": 1510093286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36326876": {"recommendationid": "36326876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032365192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1498460777}, "language": "english", "review": "Controls are awful, and the game itself is a hand-holdy QTE fest.", "timestamp_created": 1509991133, "timestamp_updated": 1509991133, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.386462807655334473", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36283405": {"recommendationid": "36283405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275837843", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1831, "last_played": 1509801299}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, la verdad no entendi muy bien la historia ya que no jugu\u00e9 el anteriorm recomiendo jugar con joystick de x box aunque no sea un joystick original lo toma sin ning\u00fan problema", "timestamp_created": 1509838028, "timestamp_updated": 1509838028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451127827167510986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36239644": {"recommendationid": "36239644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027652577", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1048, "last_played": 1458508414}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La gente odi\u00f3 este juego por razones que desconozco.

Lords of Shadows 2 takes place after the events of Mirror of Fate and in two different timelines. It takes place in modern day where a city has been built upon the foundations of Dracula's castle. But it also takes place in the past. Through a strange time-travel sequence that may also be inside Dracula's head. But maybe it isn't in his head?\n\nIt's confusing. Don't try to understand it unless you have played Mirror of Fate. In that case you will have a headstart on this story.\n\nIf you're looking for a amazing sequel that builds upon the first game into a sublime experience you will find pieces of that effort here. It has plenty of hack n' slash fun and many great features, but do not be fooled so easily: it is not nearly as polished as its predecessor. \n\nI'll start with the positive since the negative is always easier to write about. The first two aspects which stick out are the music and graphics. Both are excellent, much like Lords of Shadow 1, but strike a different approach. Things are darker this time around and it is showcased both in the artistry and musical score.\n\nThe combat also received a small overhaul. Think of it as the difference between the first God of War and the second or the third. Combat is a little more responsive and, in terms of interaction between the NPCs and weapons themselves, a little crisper. \n\nWhile the time travel/in your head sequences may be strange at first the sequences follow a certain controlled chaos. The story can be followed but you may have to pause and remind yourself of a few things from time to time. \n\nThe Characters in this game also seem to have taken a backseat in terms of personality. Apparently, sleeping for several centuries can make a person go from an engaging and dynamic personality to a static one. In the first Lords of Shadow I enjoyed taking Gabriel through his trials to defeat the Lords of Shadows. In this game, while the goal is clear, I never found myself being drawn into the story via its characters on the same level.\n\nIt also suffers from the classic \"our game is too short let's put in some pointless challenges that have nothing to do with anything.\" This is one of my video game pet peeves. Similar to the Trials in the first game but with less substance. Throughout the game you collect the pieces and unlock Kleidos challenges which you can attempt from a particular area of the castle map. They are difficult after the first few and serve no purpose other than achievements. I don't know why game companies feel players want this kind of fluff which adds only to our achievement list. I know I would choose between the options below\n1) 5 hours of gameplay which has no impact on the rest of the game's story, character progression, or collectibles\n-OR-\n2) 5 hours of gameplay which advances and expands the story\n\n\nDespite these shortcomings we still have an enjoyable game. I found myself happy more often than frustrated or upset. I recommend playing it through at least once. The story of Gabriel is a fun reboot to the Castlevania franchise.

It BARELY was fun enough to warrant a recommendation. That being said: Steam currently only has the ultimate edition \"on stock\", which is, as far as I can tell, never on sale. At least that is the case in Germany. The game is also quite pricy for being that \"old\". Don't bother with the DLC imho. None of it is any good. Most is just cosmetic or cheat DLC, while \"Revelations\" doesn't \"reveal\" anything, is barely 1 hour long (unless you get stuck on its stupid puzzles) and offers barely any new or interesting gameplay nor story...waste of time and money to be honest, but that's what you get with tacked on DLC...in fact the combat in the DLC is worse than in the main game, so on to said main game.\n\nLoS 2 continues the story after LoS. If you haven't played Mirror of Fate, however, you're lacking a lot of key knowledge, if you're interested in that. Who the fuck is Alucard? Trevor? Samuel? The story from MoF is conveniently ignored in this game...at least almost.\n\nGone are the linear levels from the first game, replaced with 2 semi-open worlds, one in the real world and one in Dracula's imaginary castle...I've gotta say the castle trumps the real world in asthetic by miles! Apart from that not that much has actually changed. Dracula is a bit more mobile, the camera can now be rotated and platforming is a bit simpler most of the times. On the other hand, blocking is still a pain in the ass, because it again shares a button with dashing, which means you have to face the right direction before you try and block an attack. But why bother? 95% of the attacks in this game are unblockable anyway -.- And the only advantage of blocking is that you get to counter attack, which does marginally more damage than a regular combo attack...meh. Most of the time not worth it. Problematic is also if you've played any Souls game and are now accustomed to dodge having iframes...nooooope, not in this game. Despite that fact though, you'll be dodging/dashing pretty much constantly. \n\nLight and Dark magic are replaced with Frost and Chaos, but they pretty much do the same thing. There are a few gimmicks in the game where you have to freeze enemies or environment or break armor or explode stuff with chaos magic. Then you get a few new abilites like a bat swarm, turning into a cloud and a few relics with limited uses. I didn't really use any of the relics most of the time. One lets you heal up, one slows down hit enemies and another gives you full magic for a duration. Those are perhaps the most important. The rest is meh.\n\nI've found myself cursing a lot when enemies seemingly hit me from nowhere or stun locked me. I'm so used to being able to stagger enemies as well. This doesn't really work in this game, so enemies will hit you through your attacks, but on the other hand many enemies have stances that completely block your light attacks.\n\nThe best part about the game are no doubt the boss fights. There are a lot of them and each one is quite fun in my opinion.\n\nThe worst part are definitely the puzzles, the stealth sections and the cutscenes. The puzzles can't be \"auto-solved\" anymore. You have to figure them out. There aren't really any tips. One could argue that this isn't a bad thing, however, this is a brawler and if you've played the first one you might get annoyed by this. The stealth sections are imho superflous and just prolong the game unnecessarily. Then we have the cutscenes. I'm not just talking about actual cutscenes, but everything in LoS has an indirect load time attached to it. Change sectors? Animation. Change into a rat? Long animation. Press a switch, ultra long cutscene that flies around the level for half an hour. Srsly, it's obnoxious how many cutscenes there are for no apparent reason. Do you want to watch a character walk 10 meters in 1 minute? LoS 2 got you covered.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it definitely has its flaws. It by no means deserves the terrible Metacritic score it got.

A place where cutscenes are stacked back to back and you have to go and skip each one individually. I couldn't even get an hour into the game with just how bad this is. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nFirst, you get a cutscene to skip. Then another. Then another. Finally, you get to move around. You walk slowly to the door and then cutscene. After the cutscene, a few regular enemies to test moves on. Make sure not to mess up pressing buttons at the right time, because the game won't let you continue until you can prove you can use its poor controls.\n\nTrying to block is pointless, because you can't face enemies easily. If you try to block and move, you dodge, so you end up no where near the fight any more. You can dodge back, but the enemy will be ready for another attack you need to block, so you'll inevitably miss it. Oh, make sure to swap between 3 different weapons for no reason at all, because a whip, a sword, and claws are all needed to do what a single weapon would've been able to do otherwise.\n\nFinally, you get through the warm-up and walk out into the hall. After a cutscene of course. Yay, slow and tedious climbing ahead! Make sure you pay attention to tiny dots that you're supposed to climb towards, otherwise you end up falling to your death or just not moving the way you want to go.\n\nAnother cutscene. And another one. And another one. Finally, a \"boss fight\". Oh god, this guy just spams the same 3 attacks over and over. I have to get in, chip a tiny bit of health, then dodge away from his ridiculously wide attacks. This probably took up the most time in the 20 minutes I played. Ok, his health is down- wait, he's run off. A cutscene again. And another.\n\nNow I'm playing God of War and climbing on a monster while fighting trash enemies. Great, climbing is just as boring as before. Hmm, the giant metal war machine robot is smashing me into a castle. Am I supposed to be doing anything? I'm just watching it pulverise the castle. Oh, each time it does, a metal band breaks off of it and I can climb further up its arm. Yay, climbing simulator! Oh god, it's even more climbing, and I have to let that boss from before shoot at bits so I can climb higher.\n\nRight, I'm finally at the top. Another cutscene. And another. Back to the previous boss fight. OH GOD DAMN IT JUST STAY STILL AND LET ME HIT YOU. Sod it, I'll just button mash, my sword heals me anyway. Yup, for every 10 spinny attacks and jumps the boss does (which are no threat to me, they just knock me over), I get one small hit in. Repeat ad nauseum until the boss is \"dead\". Cutscene. And again. And again. And again. And again.\n\nNow it's modern day. Well, at least I get to walk slowly 10 feet towards a gate- ANOTHER DAMN CUTSCENE. Sod this, I'm playing an actual game, not a button-mashing, hack-and-slash, climbing-simulator, cutscene-obsessed excuse for a game.\n\nWhy do I buy these things just because people say they're good?

A thousand years have passed since his battle with Satan when Draculas old enemy Zobek, Lord of the Necromancers, show up to ask for his help. Apparently Satans Acolaytes are planning on bringing him back, and if so both Dracula and Zobek will be tormented by him forever. But if Dracula can aid Zobek in finding the Acolaytes and slay them before Satan is summoned, Zobek will give him what he wants the most - eternal rest.\n\nPersonally, the story has been a bit downgraded from the last game. Lords of Shadow didn't have a great plot, but it had a kind of campy epicness that made the whole game really cool. It feels like the developers tried doing something similar with this entry, but none of the character really stuck with me and I never really felt invested in anything that happened until the very end of the game. The plot also suffers from the \"amnesia-syndrome\" where the main character don't remember everything - meaning that a lot of the dialogue in the game are very vague and cryptic, trying to build up to a cool twist that sadly falls a bit flat. Also, moving the game to modern time gave room for much less interesting enviroments. The first game had enchanted forests, graveyards, snowy mountains and deadly swamps. This game more or less are all very industrial looking, with some small glimmers of a cool gothic design.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you've played through the first Lords of Shadow (wich you probably should if you're interested in a sequel) you more or less know what to expect. The game is a combat-focused hack'n'slash game where you have to combine different attack-combos, special powers and some cool secondary powers (like Blood Daggers) in order to kill of the huge selection of enemies and bosses this game provides. The combat actually have been decently upgraded since the first one. First of all, you can now move the camera freely, giving you more control over your vision and therefore avoid some of the irritation the first game had with its static camera. Also, both guarding and dodging feels a bit more snappy and quick, making for a better control-scheme overall. And hey, if you don't like QTE's, this game actually gives you the option to turn them off!\n\nThe plattforming, which was something I really didn't like in the first game has been greatly improved too - taking a note from Sucker Punch's Infamous series, Dracula now snaps to a landing spot rather than it being controlled freely - which gives the impression of you controlling a truly agile figure. This, acording to me, is a great step-up from the last game.\n\nThe developers also included stealth into this game, and it is by far the worst part of it. This parts of the game are slow, boring and in many cases not even logical. At some points you are forced into a sneaking section where you have to sneak around a boss-character while activating some switches - only to have to face the boss in the very next room. I really don't get why I have to sneak around them if I'm just going to fight them five minutes later...\n\nBest part of the game:\nThe game has an incredible fun combat-system, and using Draculas different abilities to battle through hordes of demons is great!\n\nWorst part of the game:\nThe stealth-sections. They make no sense, aren't fun and are just slowing a combat-focused action game down to a halt.

You can not fight ANY of these guards, despite the fact that you've been annhilating epic bosses the size of buildings, tearing off their limbs, drinking their blood and generally being a demi-god.\n\nIt's not because of alarms. During one segment, you are forced to use the stealth mechanics even though it's incredibly obvious that it's not to hide or remain stealthy, because you have already made so much of a scene that random things are attacking you, but THE GAME LITERALLY DISALLOWS COMBAT. For some stupid, pointless reason the regular guards are unstoppable.\n\nThe last segment that made me put the controller down and uninstall this fucking mess? Stealth. Get caught, start back at the beginning. OH. WHAT. FUN. THAT.

The combat isnt hard. Even on Prince of Darkness difficulty most bosses can be beaten by an attack/dodge routine, there are just certain moves that can 2 shot you now.\n\nThe problem with combat is the fact that the parry move is largely unused as every mob from the smallest grunt to the final boss spams unblockable attacks, where in the previous game you were rewarded for having the skill to parry, here you rarely get the chance because 9/10 attacks are unblockable and unable to be parried. This doesnt make the combat harder, as you just spend more time dodging out of the way, but with those unblockable attacks comes with it an annoying sound to let you know an unblockable attack is coming and you will hear this sound every few seconds during combat at least, but often in succession until the last mob is dead for the entire game. The entire game.\n\nMaybe this is different on easier difficulties, but i'll never know. If it is, making mobs have 9/10 attacks be unblockable didnt make the game harder for me, just incredibly annoying.\n\nThe shielded Vampire mobs also have an incredibly high pitched sound they will spam if you are not in their line of sight, It's so bad it makes me wonder if the devs wanted to annoy the players on purpose.  Then I remember there is a cutscene for restarting a checkpoint or dying and I have to assume that yes, that was their goal.\n\nThe challenge arena will never start you off with full health, it will leave you at whatever you were at during the previous challenge or when you entered the arena. This means if you want to do more than one challenege you need to go back to the castle, leave the shop use an item to heal yourself, renter the shop purchase another healing item if needed reenter the arena and pick your challenge. During this process you will have to watch or cancel out about 6 small cutscenes. That is crazy. \"cinematic\" can be a good thing depending on the game, here it's a disease.\n\n\nAs for the story of the game, it's not great, or at the very least it's told poorly. some elements are never explained and are extremely confusing when you first experience them and what I imagine was meant to be a twist or at least a surprise was pretty much obvious from the start. \n\nSay whatever you want about the first LOS not being Castlevania enough, it didnt have forced stealth sections and demons with shotguns, grenade launchers, and automatic weapons. I dont know how a team of people sat down and agreed that what Castlevania was missing was a modern day setting with guns and mechs. Maybe someday we'll get a MGS game set in 1700's\n\n\nIt's not terrible, if you can look past the mountain of little annoyances it's an ok game, but for me those annoyances are too constant for me to suggest anyone else deal with them.", "timestamp_created": 1498493773, "timestamp_updated": 1498493773, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599691271781921387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32797835": {"recommendationid": "32797835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218501465", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1676794178}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego +10 y a fav", "timestamp_created": 1498446137, "timestamp_updated": 1498446137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32792786": {"recommendationid": "32792786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233359556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1466796066}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1498433112, "timestamp_updated": 1498433112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32763426": {"recommendationid": "32763426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010202391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1500278121}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really well made game, you can turn the option on to turn off QTE's which are a hassle if you're not into that stuff.\nThe game has a lot of cut scenes but it's very interesting story.

Remember the forced Stone Idol Titan \u201ctwirl-left-stick\u201d QTE in the first game that had dumbfounded pretty much everyone who could not afford a controller? Well, now you can turn that sucker off, granting Gabriel the power to auto-succeed all QTEs at the expense of some experience points. \n[*] The [i]LoS1[/i] skill page has become a skill tree; it's easier to browse and see what skills lead to which. Still, the game funnily \u201creimburses\u201d you should you go for a NG+. Mildly annoying, but it does show you just how much experience you've accumulated. \n[*] The combat flows more freely if compared to [i]LoS1[/i] and the Somersault move no longer makes you feel like you've cement blocks around your ankles. (Yes, I like Somersault.) Unlike other games I've played (namely Alice: Madness Returns), you get a clear visual/audio indication that your attack did not hit/did no damage. The new Weapon Mastery system gives you an incentive to vary your combos.  \n[*] The character design, the bosses, the voice acting, and the OST. Holy hell, A+. Play the game just for these. [spoiler]The Toy Maker and Inner Dracula deserve special mention.[/spoiler]\n[*] Unbound camera! Finally some use for your mouse/right stick. \n[*] The atmosphere is amazing, especially if you stop to sightsee. \n[*] The story is engrossing, and it ramps up the stakes in the last ten minutes, too. \n[*] Purely IMO here, but I do think Gabriel's one of the finest examples of good video game writing. His depiction of Dracula is nuanced and endearing. Same goes for Alucard, really. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[*] Forced stealth is meh. It's not that particularly hard, mind; the enemies you're expected to slip past are brain-dead. They don't look up, don't ring the alarm at the sight of bats in a pharmaceutical corporation, and blame mosquitoes when you fling a dagger at them. The only exception to this is [spoiler]Agreus, but his AI is just as exploitable. Psst, ignore the bells, wait till he rushes you and Mist Form away.[/spoiler]\n[*] The Xbox prompts stay even if you do not have a controller plugged in. Again, a mild annoyance that very nearly got me killed when the game had asked me to \"press B\" or \"down on the D-Pad\". \n[*] The cheap hitscan potshots enemies like to take at you when you're out of range (or just performing an aerial combo for too long). Soldiers chuck daggers, heavies chuck axes, demons spit, vampires, uhhh, scream (?)... you get the picture.

At 16 hours its about half as long as LOS1. The best part of LOS2 is that they did away with the QTE button mashing of LOS1.  Wish they hadn't got rid of the rope swing though... LOS2 essentially plays similar to LOS1. Leveling system has been refined and improved yet the climbing and platforming have been overly simplified along with the fun that accompanied that...  Fortunately the combat has weight and feels good as you gracefully hack and slash enemies to pieces.  As Dracula you are nimble and easily move through the environment using magic, wits and brut force- as opposed to dexterity and timing from previous games.  Your magic abilities like possession, turning into a cloud of mist, or summoning bats, are fun to use and as platforming takes a back seat, they provide a layer of stealth and strategy that feel novel, yet a bit odd for this series.  Levels have verticality and are fun to traverse.  The map keeps you on track toward your objective--although portals and fast travel points are confusing and can get you lost. Oddly enough this makes the game feel less linear and more metroidvania like.  Graphics are stunning and easily the best in the series but textures and detail in some areas are inconsistent.  My biggest complaint is the modern day 'Gotham like\u2019 city and cyborg enemies pulled me completely out of the gothic world that I long for when I play this IP.  I want castles, forests, courtyards and cemeteries- not robots in Times Square!!!    Dialog, cutscenes and music are brilliant- especially the toymaker level. In short, the platforming and puzzles take a back seat to better visuals and are nowhere near as fun as in previous games.  There are some novel ideas like possession of enemies or turning into a rat, which are interesting, but some of the weird environments and enemies  feel out of place.  Overall it's an excellent game, but I'd recommend playing MOF, or LOS1 first and wait for LOS2 to go on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1496741485, "timestamp_updated": 1510116412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32188345": {"recommendationid": "32188345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076614628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1658, "last_played": 1496519901}, "language": "english", "review": "The Lords of Shadows Saga is awesome!!", "timestamp_created": 1496622928, "timestamp_updated": 1496622928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462889045476913452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32149757": {"recommendationid": "32149757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101595117", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1149, "last_played": 1690027464}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a very good game.

If you're a fan of classic Castlevania on the NES and SNES, then play Mirror of Fate (very underrated).\nThe first Lords of Shadow was criticized by some for being more fantasy than Castlevania, but it was more of a prequel to the saga. The real saga is Mirror of Fate. This is more of a post-saga, and it takes place largely in a loney version of the modern (near-future) world. In many ways, the style of enemies you fight are more fitting of the Warhammer franchise, and you're fighting an evil corporation that's being run by figures possesd by the devil's army (despite being Dracula, yourself).\n\nGameplay is standard and enjoyable (2016/2017 play period). \nIt might be worth noting that if you were annoyed by the level-break style of LoS1, they've smoothed it out in this one, using clever lock transitions to handle loading of different areas. So not completely seemless / open-world, but a lot better than distinct leveling that we saw in the first.\n\nSo my rankings are as follows:\n\n1. Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate\n(The heart of the Castlevania saga, brilliantly retold. Side-scroller.)\n2. Lords of Shadow 1\n(A prequel story to the saga.)\n3. Lords of Shadow 2\n(A post-saga, modern setting that feels a little muted.)", "timestamp_created": 1493287049, "timestamp_updated": 1493287049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31388945": {"recommendationid": "31388945", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999914689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 4368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4368, "last_played": 1493277155}, "language": "english", "review": "This time around the grappeling and swinging around like Tarzan has been ommited. But free look camera on the right thumb stick has been added and it helps out a lot in combat and discovery. My first playthrough it had been some time since I played the previous LoS. I knew the story must take place in a modern/future setting but I had hoped they would find a way around it so it wouldn't feel corny. In a way they did and it was pretty genius. It did feel a bit corny the first playthrough but after some time and recently replaying through LoS and Mirror of Fate I found much more to be appreciated in LoS2 and enjoyed it quite a lot. Peicing together the story accross the games was a lot of fun as well. There are so few action/adventure games made these days; and fewer still that are worth playing. The LoS trilogy is quite good and worth owning for fans of the genre. LoS gameplay draws a lot from God of War and some from Shadow of the Colossus with a good sprinkle of classic Metroidvania. The expeience and skill tree system I quite prefer in this game if I am to have one. The moves you use are the ones you gain experience in, as it should be. And gaining experience and leveling your weapons doesn't take forever. 3 levels for each of the 3 types. I can live with that over leveling to absurd numbers. The DLC is short but appropriate.

Great controls, well optimized with a perfect game length and plenty of exploration and replayability, it's a game where you'll get your money's worth. The combat is a little better than the first game, being similar to other 3rd person action games like God of War. The story isn't quite as good as the first because I think the character progression of Gabriel is what really made that story great, but it isn't bad here either. The level design overall is nice and the music is decent. My only real complaints are that some of the puzzles seemed unnecessary and the stealth bits were somewhat annoying, although infrequent and easy enough that I didn't care all that much. Overall it's a pretty solid action game that's worth a play especially for fans of the series and there's not much bad to say about it.\n\nThe Revelations DLC is decent, I'd say it's maybe slightly better than the DLC from the first game.

It is probably the closest someone got to make a full 3D experience of Castlevania Symphony of the night. As for the first reboot the game is also at its core a spectacle fighting game.\n\nThe story of the game is suspended between two moments in time. In the present, your character, Dracula, wakes up after a very\u2026very long sleep and faces a the evil deeds that are being made in what remains of his castle, now part of a whole city with a high tech facility rule by evil itself. Dracula also has to gain back his lost powers and it will do so traveling back in time to his old castle. Unlocking new areas and abilities will allow Dracula to travel more and more freely to every part of the levels in the typical Metroidvania style. Enemies will respawn every time in the same place giving you always some challenge. It may though get to become repetitive (a common problem with backtracking in this type of game design). What will not become tiresome is how beautiful the environments are! Especially the old castle, simply stunning. The same effort was not exactly put into enemy design, which are a bit more repetitive than in the prequel (no more mounting on orcs or giant spiders!)\n\nThe combat system is solid, strikes have impact force despite being almost all whip based and allow for a decent amount of combination, crowd control and power strikes, but not as much as tytles like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Mobility during combat is now much improved compared to the prequel, you can dash as much as you want in any direction, which really gives you the sensation of being a superpowered mischevious vampire that moves swiftly and strikes hard! The combat itself did not changed much from the first game. Magic attacks now use a sword and gauntlets instead of different colors of the whip attack, changing a lot the range of actions, but the combo scheme is copied into every weapon set (whip, sword and gauntlet alike).\n\nThe interesting combat mechanic of the series, the focus mechanic, comes back. This mechanic builds up a meter for chaining combos and variation of techniques used (as the meter of score for Devil May Cry) and is set back to zero if you are hit. Instead of just being linked to a score rating this focus meter is directly linked to the combat. Once it is filled enemies start giving magic refill, which you can absorb to fill up one of your two magic style (healing/defense style with the sword or heavy attack style with the gauntlet). \n\nTiming your block properly is probably the most efficient way to build up focus meter and create opening to attack even stronger enemies. The sync block mechanic (such is the name of this timing block thing) will create a sort of light explosion which will stagger enemies and slow time for a bit, great visual effect and good for planning your reposte.\nI had the impressions that enemies and boss design had a step back compared to the prequel, but it may be due to the amount of time you will have to backtrack (especially for completionists).\n\nIn conclusion, I liked playing this title as much as the prequel, it is probably a more direct 3D successor to Castlevania than the first Lords of Shadows. It has some flaws for sure, but it a solid title if you wish for a good spectacle fighter with a Castlevania flavor.  I really hope a third title comes out taking the good of Lords of Shadows 1 and 2, combining them and smoothing the mistakes. That would really be a great game\u2026but unfortunately it is Konami we are talking about\u2026so don\u2019t hold your breath.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487615152, "timestamp_updated": 1487615152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30026449": {"recommendationid": "30026449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007618668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2589, "last_played": 1487482868}, "language": "english", "review": "Second part of this new Castlevania saga with a really weird new story of the Belmont's family.\n\nStory.

Obviously my first 2 are the other Lords of Shadow games on steam. Lords of Shadow 1 and Mirror of Fate. \n\nI have to start out saying this game at max settings with the texture pack on is beutiful. Atleast the environments are, the character models are about the same as in the first lords of shadow game. But the Marble floors and walls look amazing same with the castle. \n\nThe gameplay is 99% the same as the first lords of shadow lots of X and Y if you are using a controller, it has full controller support so I dont see why you wouldnt be. There is 1 change which I found annoying. They switched the function of the right trigger and B button on an Xbox controller from the first game. In the first game right trigger was used to pick stuff up and now its B. This threw me off as it is bascially the only controll change. \n\nSPOILERS. \n\nI found this game to be more enjoyable than the first but I liked the story in the first one more. This story is confusing. \n\nSo in the first one you were sent on a mighty quest to kill the three lords of Shadows, Werewolf, Vampire, and Grim Reaper man. This one you are gearing up to fight Satan in a modernish city. \n\nThere are basically no puzzles in this one which were prevelent in the first one. They have been replaced instead with weird stealth sections. Which absolutly make no sense as you are Dracula who is going to destroy Satan but dies in 2 seconds these large mutant guards with basically rocket launchers in futuristic armor. Very annoying. \n\nThere is also a sub plot with the castle which was destroyed at the start of the game. Then it sort of becomes its own dimension were stupid BS things happen. Like the blood of the castle is trying to keep him there and basically Mutates anything it touches. \n\nAlso Zobek is a business man now. \n\nI am notgoing thru the entire story but its basically you awake its the future you are in modern city, there are people trying to sommin Satan, you beat them and other bosses , then fight Satan and an old god. With weird BS stuff happening in your Castle dimensional realm. \n\nI think the castle became the new Shadow plane maybe?

Este Juego porque soy fans de castelvania desde super nintendo, iniciando algo que me gusto era que le hab\u00eda puesto c\u00e1mara 360, no como el anterior, pero no est\u00e1 muy optimizada pero se disfruta mejor eso s\u00ed, tiene nuevas habilidades, definitivamente que el latimo es lo mejor en ataque a larga distancia, porque cuando usas el dlc con alucard usas espadas y es dif\u00edcil pelear asi, corta distancia tienden a mas darte golpes, el dlc vale la pena yo los compre todos XD, de all\u00ed la campa\u00f1a est\u00e1 algo larga, en aventura no le falta un poco ya que a veces me aburr\u00eda, y despu\u00e9s se recuperaba con los jefes es excelente es lo que m\u00e1s apegaba al juego, en aventura el anterior era mejor mas pegajoso, aun as\u00ed se disfruta bastante cuando comienza a tener m\u00e1s habilidades, la principal es la de las alas una de las mejores en mi opini\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s eso de que Gabriel se convierte en rata 0.0 como que no es de ayi, prefiero el lobo azul de alucard, tambi\u00e9n la tele transportaci\u00f3n de alucard muy fina, buen juego definitivo lo recomiendo, asi la forma de supcionar sangre para la vida muy buena esa parte me gusto bastante porque te las descobras mucho  de esos malditos enemigos XD, lo de la defensa hay q pulirlo mejor, lo de esquivar est\u00e1 buen\u00edsimo uff eso como me salvo en muchas ocasiones, as\u00ed

Especially the toymaker bit.\n\nMuch needed update.\n\nI have to restate my original opinion.\n\nThis is perhaps the MOST underrated game of all time.\n\nI have to make a few statements about the game. The combat is absolutely Sublime.  When I had written my previous review, they were many titles in this genre that I had not played, the DMC series, Bayonetta, MGSR...  Now that I have, I can say with certainty that the combat in Lords of Shadow 2 is right up there with the best of them, though it's God of War influence still shines through.\n\nThe game also holds onto its metroidvania influences, by motivating the player to revisit areas after they've unlocked new abilities , this is par for the course with this type of game..  but in Lords of Shadow 2, every chance you're giving to revisit some of the gorgeous artwork, and fight enemies once you've upgraded your skills is an absolute Joy.\n\nThe graphics are what I would have to call \"the best of last generation\" , the appearance of Dracula's castle would have benefited massively from higher resolution textures and more modern processing techniques, even so the design is still a megalithic Gothic masterpiece.\n\nThe platforming and Exploration put other third-person games to shame, This truly is up there with the best of them making they're like the Assassin's Creed games seem like a waste of time, much like Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor did.\n\nLOS2 represent the crowning achievement of the old philosophy of game design, that understood it's audience and sought to give them what they WANTED, challenge them and make a game that could captivate.\n\nNow, AAA games are tailored to an imaginary audience and the publishers view gamers as credit card livestock, then claim those same players are toxic if they complain.\n\nThere are a few issues.\n\n1. Despite having a fantastic voice acting cast, the delivery on some of the material does not come through properly, making the script seem like less than it is..   combined with some pacing issues, it lessens what would have been truly epic.\n\n2. This particular issue is take it or leave it, one of the things that didn't fit with the theme in my initial estimations were the stealth sections, especially once you unlock more of Dracula's abilities, the dragon nuke in particular, there's no reason to be sneaking around past the golgothan guards later in the game.... However, if you view these segments of the game as puzzles, are other many games they are actually quite enjoyable and much more inspired than most of the crap on the market now.\n\n3. I feel like it was a game that was held back by its need to appeal to a teen audience, if they had had the opportunity to include more nudity in graphic violence oh, it would have completed the dark atmosphere that this game achieved and an even more effective fashion, even so it's still more interesting Fair in most of the puritanical crap being released by AAA Studios today.\n\n\nI point out these flaws to be forthcoming and honest in my opinion of the game, it's not perfect, but it's an 8.5 out of 10 that would have been 100% with just a few changes.\n\n\nSo what happened...?  LOS2 has a 54 metacritic score and the low sales got the series cancelled.

Gabriel-Dracula, now a thousand years old, awakes at the exit of the Cathedral into the nocturnal streets of Castlevania City, built upon the remains of his old Castle. He won't be astray much time but soon be meeting the two characters guiding him through the plot: young Trevor Belmont, the never known son, and Zobek, Lord of the Dead and former nemesis, now an influential businessman.\n\nIt apparently has been one of the developers' worries to enhance the game where the first Lords of Shadow has most been criticized: so the camera can freely be moved in a 360-degree angle now, the framerate is increased, and the formerly linear setting and storyline made place for an open-world design offering a greater variety in the pacing chosen. Also the gameplay has notably been improved and the sound, vibrant combat mechanics using the default X360 controller is thoroughly satisfying to use (Quick-Time Events can be deactivated in the Game Options menu).\n\nWell-executed are also the necessary climbing and jumping sections that seem largely scripted, in addition to some occasional platforming elements which are usually easy to achieve thanks to a generous savepoint system.\nSwarming bats indicate audibly where to proceed to the next ledge or ladder which is useful during as well as after beating the game, in addition to the White Wolf Medallion and the Map rooms for quick-traveling, to continue exploring the medieval Castle and the modern City.\nBoth the epic bossfights and the numerous collectibles (580 in total) give the game its replay value, in order to try oneself on a higher difficulty level or get one's skills and gauges maxed out.\n\nNo doubt, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an ambitious game: what sets in quite like another God of War replica and stumbles at the gloomy entrance of Castlevania City's Sciences district, soon evolves into an extraordinary, creative Gothic action-adventure, with breathtaking visuals, atmospheric music (\u00d3scar Araujo), and an unforgettable plot that relies heavily on the franchise's previous releases.\n\nStory-wise, Castlevania is an epic family drama the likes of Star Wars: akin to Anakin Skywalker, Gabriel Belmont changes sides as he becomes the Prince of Darkness which opposes him to his own son Alucard (Luke), albeit those family bonds seem to be the only human trait left as he shows indulgence towards Victor, leader of the Brotherhood of Light and last of the Belmont bloodline.\nThe story finds a worthy conclusion in Lords of Shadow 2, but the myth is probably just too good to simply let it die: \u201cWho knows what fate has in store.\u201d\n\nRead the full user review on: http://www.gamespot.com/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2/user-reviews/2200-12606707/", "timestamp_created": 1480001346, "timestamp_updated": 1480001346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27079935": {"recommendationid": "27079935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112361182", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1067, "last_played": 1495918128}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1479977492, "timestamp_updated": 1479977492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26987292": {"recommendationid": "26987292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089020374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1954, "last_played": 1466569838}, "language": "english", "review": "reminiscing the old castlevania. love alucard as ever", "timestamp_created": 1479953398, "timestamp_updated": 1479953398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26969540": {"recommendationid": "26969540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987996116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2234, "last_played": 1419217004}, "language": "english", "review": "Someone just needs to give Gabriel a hug.\nThis game is one of the most prominent in recent memory to completely break my heart. So much potential in setting, story telling and gameplay squandered. The finale of Lords of Shadow suggested the coming of a great tragic villain.

It was all there for Mercury Steam to knock out of the park. \nInstead the swung and missed. \nThe sad part is, there is actually some incredible gameplay here. The combat is markedly improved over its predecessor. The addition of vampiric speed and strength to Dracula's style really empowers you. Sure you have probably read about the stealth sections that drag the game's momentum to a squealing halt, and this is true, although perhaps not as miserable as others have suggested. The free exploration of Dracula's castle really improves upon the linear formula of the previous game. So yes, there is much to like here.\nBut oh god what did they do with the the boss fights (a highlight of LoS) and, more unforgiveably, the story. I wont spoil anything here but suffice it to say that the finale not only drops the ball on the conclusion to Gabriel's arc, but does it in spectacularly cringe worth fashion.

Transforming into pack rats, turning into mist, commanding bats, travelling between two eras in the world (visiting the Dracula's castle is probably best part of this game), and drinking blood, loads and loads of blood (which you will need to use all the devices in the castle).\n\n[h1]Stealth sections[/h1]\nMany people hated these parts, especially considering that as an unstoppable vampire you have to hide before the aforementioned guards and you also have to take a cover in the front of some bosses despite the fact that you will normally fight them, later. I personally liked the stealth sections as they give a little variety to the gameplay. Plus being able to transform into rats, throwing swarm of bats or even possessing bodies of unsuspecting guards is the most cool thing you have ever experienced.\n\n[h1]The train[/h1]\nThis is one part of the game where I am going to give you one spoiler. The reason is simple, I needed help there, as well. There is one level where you stand on the train and you have to avoid various obstacles in the tunnel. After spending over 20 minutes in this level I decided to check the discussion and figure out what I am actually meant to do. So, after a couple of minutes of avoiding getting smashed to the face there is a short section without any need to jump side to top to avoid hits to the head.

It\u2019s an example of how not to do sequels to good games. The first LoS game was a good reboot of the Castlevania setting with an ending that was baiting for a sequel, so I was anticipating this game, hoping for something better or at least more of the same. What I got was mostly the worst parts of LoS1 made even more annoying.\n\n[Spoiler alert for LoS1 and LoS2]\n\nThe story and the way it is developing is boring and goes to unbelievable lengths to be stupid. The whole premise \u201cYou are Dracula\u201d is being thrown away almost immediately and replaced with a redemption story that defies almost any reason, considering the setting and the narrative. The game starts you with a DmC tier edgy vampire lord and then repeatedly shows him as some pathetic weirdo, who was visions of his son he never actually saw in his young form. The gameplay humiliates the character of Dracula even more with annoying stealth sequences that make you hide from some demonic space marines \u2013 these sections of gameplay have zero freedom of approach and challenge \u2013 you just have to make progress the way it was intended or you will face ridiculous fail states or invisible walls.\n\nAnd oh boy, this desire to limit the player can be traced through the entire game when you are stuck with forced tutorials, platforming that makes little sense considering the level geometry (you can\u2019t get to a secret you see hidden behind a 1,5m tall cinder block with wide gaps by its side, because you have to circle around it and use the Mist Form skill after a decent chunk of story progression)\n\nThe level design being \u201copen world\u201d doesn\u2019t help at all \u2013 it\u2019s just badly designed locations, taped together in an attempt to create a fake metroidvania feeling. It actually brings frustration instead of interesting exploration because there are no ways of traversing the world that are fun. You would think that being Dracula could mean that you can fast travel by turning into bats or something like that, but no \u2013 you are stuck with tedious running and platforming with fake loading screens behind switches for doors and elevators.\n\nThe things that made this experience actually bearable and occasionally fun were the visuals and the combat system.  The visuals and the designs of sceneries and enemies were pretty cool and the combat system had an interesting leveling gimmick that motivates you to use different moves as often as possible (if you want to level up your weapons faster).\n\nBy the way, the Alucard DLC shares the same problems of the base game \u2013 it\u2019s more of the base game if you want it.\n\nThis game is not the worst game ever, but it\u2019s a disappointment and you can almost always find a better action game to play and waste 15-20 hours on.", "timestamp_created": 1478748215, "timestamp_updated": 1478748215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530905485153198242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26503821": {"recommendationid": "26503821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004811351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 693, "last_played": 1478693191}, "language": "english", "review": "\u00a0 Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 should be the shining example of how not to do a sequel. The first Lords of Shadow game was a successful reimagining of the Belmont clan's eternal war against Dracula, with a solid combat system and gothic story that ended on a cliffhanger that easily teed up a continuation that would just have to stay the course to be enjoyable. Instead, MecurySteam seems to have dug deep to unearth the worst parts of the original, then added a pile of steaming shit on top of it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 I've never played a game that was so hellbent on taking control away from the player as this one. You start out in Gabriel's throne room, fighting back an invading army of armored foes. Every few steps you take, the game pauses to display tutorial text detailing moves you have available. It's a standard introduction to the controls, I thought, that's fine... Then I arrived at a section that required platforming, which was excellent in the prequel. Here, swarms of bats appear on handholds, and you just jump bat point to bat point, with no rhyme or reason to how high/far Gabriel can jump; often where you're jumping is completely off screen or doesn't make logical sense, you just jam jump to follow an arbitrary bat path. The movement in general just feels very stiff, linear, and unreliable. The camera is much too close to the character when \u201cexploring\u201d, and trying to jump a two foot gap could mean death in one instance, but you're deftly performing acrobatic leaps when the game wants you to...\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Lords of Shadow 2 is more movie than game. After about the two hour mark of barely controlling the character, watching intolerably long cutscenes, taking two steps forward then triggering another obnoxiously long cutscene, I tried to grin and bear it, holding out hope that the game was setting the scene and would go off the narrow rails later. I was wrong. The reliance on movies to fill out the play time is persistent for the entire game. A few minutes of control, fighting a few small, easy demons... ten minute cutscene. Fight a boss for five minutes... ten minute cutscene. And the story is miserable; part emo, Dracula wants to kill himself, and part cartoon/anime cringe-y, Dragonball Z trash, every story beat somehow manages to be stupider and less cool than the last.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 On the off chance you aren't watching a cutscene, you're presented with a poorly designed, fake open world to explore. It's only \u201copen\u201d in the sense that you can theoretically move among the levels at will without loading into them, but good luck with that. The environments are these super tight, twisting, confusing to navigate messes that's don't connect logically, and you're often forced to hit switches and wait for load-hiding mini-cutscenes to play out before you advance. It didn't take long before I completely abandoned any desire to look for optional power ups or secrets and just wanted to rush through the main path as quickly as possible. And even that can be a nightmare...\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 And then you'll hit the stealth sections. Oh, boy. They are really bad. Putting aside the idiotic narrative leaps where Gabriel can rip the heart out of a skyscraper-sized demon in one scene but will cower and automatically fail if a Strogg spots and shoots him the next, it's just a horrible, tacked on mini-game that you're forced to endure six times too many. Like the rest of the game, these horrible tests of patience expect you to play like a robot, using what powers they want you to use when they want you to use them. Experimentation is discouraged; there were a few instances where I thought I was pretty clever and found shortcuts around the unnecessarily long path they laid out, only to run into invisible walls or nonsensical fail states. You can transform into a swarm of rats if you activate set \u201cdark spots\u201d (because apparently Dracula is shy) which seems neat, but you're forced to watch more canned animation play out every time you do this, and you're often tasked with following a glowing skull bread crumb trail through narrow, linear vents, which is about as much fun as it sounds.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The one thing Lords of Shadow 2 has going for it is the visuals. I guess throwing player agency to the wind has it's perks, because the artists had the time to make a beautiful game. The demon and boss design in particular is excellent and creative. From fighting a Guillermo del Toro looking, tentacle-headed scientist to battling Satan riding a flying Cthulhu worm, the unique monsters and reimagined classic foes are pure, inspired eye candy. This ends the positive things I have to say about the game...\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The \u201cUltimate Edition\u201d includes all of the DLC, including a mode called Revelations that I think lets you play as Alucard in a new set of single player missions. I can't say for sure, because I didn't play it. I honestly couldn't wait for this game to be over so I could delete it off of my hard drive and be done with it.

First game of the series reboot by MercurySteam has greeted you with a slow gothic fantasy. This time the game gets right into the action. The protagonist is Dracula himself. He uses his own blood as a whip. His castle is under attack by an army of thousands. This army has a giant humanoid robot. The stakes are high, rivalries are thousands-of-years-old, prophecies are dark, and angels are fallen. And then there\u2019s the usual removal of all those nice abilities which used to allow you to perform a complete massacre on poor grunts of the army which was attacking you.\n\nThe combat system looks exactly like the one of its predecessor: accentuated counter-attacks and two bars of special energy used to break blocks and heal. Both kinds of magic now have unique weapons, but controls are still the same. What stands out is a free-floating camera as opposed to static angles from the first game. A lot of delightful improvements to what already worked perfectly before aren\u2019t the biggest surprise. The game looks back at the series\u2019 legacy and remembers where the second part of metroidvania term came from. The world is a holistic labyrinth with inaccessible high passages and grates standing in your way. This promise of big and small secrets is the foundation for everything else here. The story progression path goes in big stretches only occasionally offering to come back to the earlier places. You could replay levels in the first game to access locked upgrades once you\u2019ve acquired the required ability, but you also had to go through the repetition of story scenes and routes weren\u2019t particularly interesting.\n\nThe second installment simply blends the secrets in the world as a part of a bigger picture. The scenery is grotesque most of the time and is occasionally filled with details for you to look at for some time. Half of the locations are in the future, of course, so it adds up to a final result of a truly bizarre over-stylized collage.\n\nThe wild outlook in accompanied by an equally wild script. It defies logic in favor of having more and more bizarre characters and spectacular action scenes. If there\u2019s a fight on a moving train it\u2019ll end with a crash, explosions and acrobatics. You can\u2019t just kill the giant boss \u2014 you have to rip out its heart. It is completely normal for the protagonist to ride a giant gas bottle because he needed a new entrance in the building. The headcount of unlucky enemies of Dracula is in a thousands range. Relentless postmodern carnival wouldn\u2019t give you a break, so at some point you just can\u2019t be surprised by anything. Raisa Volkova, the daughter of Satan? Sounds completely normal!\n\nLords of Shadow 2 wants to go further than its predecessor so desperately and tries so much new stuff, that sometimes it ends with stuff that is just too cringeworthy. Clumsy stealth sections simply don\u2019t hold up to the pace of the game and are irritating rather than entertaining.\n\nStill, you get transformations into blood mist and rat pack out of this torture. Two more instruments for world-exploring toolset. You can see in it the reminiscence of what Symphony of the Night did to Rondo of Blood. The story of the series also goes in circles on the moebius band of time-travelling nonsense. The game may pass a self-parody for the long franchise with a few dozens of titles in it.

In fact, I'd call it very good if it weren't for a few glaring flaws.  Critically, this game floundered since the media focused on what the game did wrong rather than what it did right.  This game has many extremely memorable moments.  The battle with medusa and the battle with the toy maker immediately come to mind.  However, for a short amount of time,  the game throws some bad stealth mechanics at you.  There isn't much to say about them, the stealth is barebones and feels very out of place in the story, outside of a single instance where it seemed logical.  Luckily, their presence is more like a puzzle in the game than an actual mechanic.  You won't spend much time stealthing around.\n\nNow, on to what this game got right:\n\nCombat is A+.  It's up there with the best action games imo: God of War, Devil May Cry, etc.  It's more comparable to DmC: Devil May Cry all the way down to the weapon swapping mechanic.  It feels smooth, responsive, and impactful.  \n\nThe graphics are fantastic.  The art team did a wonderful job in this game and the engine devs did a great job focusing on the most important aspects of the engine for this game.  The modern city looks great and manages to feel victorian while also looking modern, and Dracula's castle is absolutely gorgeous.  The game also runs like a dream (originally played on a gtx 780 with plenty of power to spare).\n\nThe story is...well it's nothing to brag about.  The premise is interesting, and the beginning isn't too bad, but some cringy dialogue and a painfullly bad ending ruin it.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game.  The good outweighs the bad by a long shot.  Critically speaking, it's a heavily underrated game.  It's hard to accurately express what makes the good parts feel so much better than the bad.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, download the demo.

Admittedly, I'm biased because I really dig Castlevania, enjoyed the first Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and am a sucker for the idea of playing as Dracula himself. But even at its most frustrating moments, Lords of Shadow 2 isn't nearly as bad as Edge Magazine (which gave it a 4/10) or any of the other mainstream reviews would have you believe. \n\nBloodsucking awesome stuff:\n+ I feel like combat's speedier and more responsive than it was in the first Lords of Shadow, and there's less reliance on quicktime events. This might have to do with the fact that I'm just more experienced with the combat system after playing through the first game and Mirror of Fate, but I had a lot of fun beating up some of the bosses, which leads me to the next point...\n+ The boss battles (with the exception of the finale) are grand as hell! You've got some classic mainstays in there, like Death and Medusa, whose inclusion instantly make this game seem \"more Castlevania\" than its prequel.\n+ On that note, the first Lords of Shadow got criticism from many people who felt it was Castlevania in name only (though in a surprising twist, I've noticed that the first game is now retroactively considered great in the wake of the poor reception the second got). This isn't the case here - from the getgo, when you start out as Dracula in your castle sipping a glass of blood, Symphony of the Night references start popping up everywhere. These plus the haunted atmosphere and the inclusion of Alucard just make the game *FEEL* more like a proper entry in the series. \n+ Lords of Shadow 2 is beautifully presented, and like its predecessor, has some of my favorite menus ever in a video game. (I'm just a sucker for any menu that resembles an old torn book and has little hand-drawn animations showing your available attacks.) The music feels like it's from the long-lost Castlevania movie that got stuck in development hell, and the environments are amazing...at least for the flashback sections of the game. \n\nNot so bloodsuckingly awesome\n+ The game has two worlds, Zelda-style - a flashback castle that sort of exists in Dracula's mind (or in another dimension, it's never really explained) and a modern setting. And while the castle is gorgeous, the modern levels are laboratories, deserted hospitals and dirty streets that resemble Gotham City in the Arkham games at their best but are just forgettable at their worst. \n+ With the strange duo world thing comes the plot, which I actually enjoyed for the majority of the game, even though there's one big twist near the end that is really the most comic book thing ever, and I don't mean that in a good way. But the ending is very weak. Let's just say that the final boss battle doesn't exactly hit the heights of previous fights, let alone the epic clash of Gabriel Belmont versus Satan from the first game, and even though there's a big redemption story that builds up for Dracula over the course of 30-some hours, the whole thing concludes like a wet fart in the night. Also...Victor Belmont, what a waste.\n+ Unlike Lords of Shadow 1, this sequel's a Metroidvania. This is good in theory, but on the negative side, enemies are still damage sinks, which interrupts the joy of exploration, and the shackles of the level-based structure of the first game are still there. Many times you can only traverse areas in a VERY SPECIFIC WAY that the game wants you to take - ie, even though Drac gets a double jump, he can't jump over this crappy little ledge to get the collectible on the other side even though you can CLEARLY see he should be able to reach it. No, you have to take the long route around and use your mist form to pass through a gate (and the mist form can only be used in a few key places too) because the game's been programmed that way. Mirror of Fate had this issue as well, but it wasn't as noticeable because that game was 2.5D. In a 3D environment, it's very obvious.\n+ Tying into this element of restrictiveness, the stealth sections that got slammed by every reviewer ARE quite annoying. If you dunno what these are - there are a few enemies, like some huge armor-plated guards and Pan's brother, who can kill Drac in two shots, even though in every cutscene the Prince of Darkness easily demolishes much bigger foes. The only reason Drac is vulnerable to these guys is because the designers needed an excuse to make the players complete so-so puzzles where you need to change to rat form or cling to walls to sneak by them. It's kind of a ham-fisted way to switch up gameplay, but luckily it's only about 5% of the game. \n\nLords of Shadow 2 got massacred upon release, but I'm glad to see it's at least getting positive reviews on Steam two years later. I still liked it enough to go out of my way to find every collectible, which is rare for me. It's biggest flaw is that it has the restrictive design of a PS2 game, but was released in 2014, a year which also saw innovative titles like Shadow of Mordor which introduced fresh gameplay mechanics. (OK, I agree that Mordor was overrated - but it did offer a solid open world, and the Nemesis system WAS great.) Reviewers were expecting more when this came out, frankly, and rated the game as such. As it stands, it's still not a horrible way for the Castlevania franchise to end, and worth a look for more open-minded fans who aren't opposed to Castlevania games not made by Koji Igarashi. \n\nIf you're interested, I wrote some longer thoughts on this game and the negative reception it got here: http://pixelgrotto.tumblr.com/post/150812695901/musings-goodnight-sweet-prince-eurogamer", "timestamp_created": 1474626610, "timestamp_updated": 1474626610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604834616184234619", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25612343": {"recommendationid": "25612343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085013662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1474428142}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00a1\u00a1 Muy bueno !! :) :) :)", "timestamp_created": 1474422077, "timestamp_updated": 1474422077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25590791": {"recommendationid": "25590791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027552164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 859, "last_played": 1697243626}, "language": "english", "review": "I would most definitely recommend this game, it is really good in my opinion and continues the story of Gabriel who is now Dracula as he goes on to restore his powers and to fight the end boss the same end boss that he fought at the end of the first lords of shadow", "timestamp_created": 1474306068, "timestamp_updated": 1474306068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417240709066390991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25576932": {"recommendationid": "25576932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137960013", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1465, "last_played": 1513908799}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es bueno este juego??

Mucho menos meterle un 4 y pertenecer a un medio especializado, no tiene ning\u00fan sentido, LOS 2 no es un juego de 4, desde luego no eres un gilipollas si le pones un 4, pero mejor ded\u00edcate a vender bol\u00edgrafos, porque la industria del videojuego no es para ti, eso seguro. No eres un gilipollas pero tampoco un cr\u00edtico con credibilidad, y un cr\u00edtico sin credibilidad es como una Puta sin culo, vamos, que est\u00e1 la cosa jodida xD.\n\n Mercury Steam intent\u00f3 mejorar su primera parte introduciendo mec\u00e1nicas nuevas de forma totalmente l\u00edcita, y en algunas cosas lo consigue (dise\u00f1o y mec\u00e1nicas de los jefes finales) y en otras patina (sigilo frustrante y poco divertido, y un dise\u00f1o de niveles que sin pretenderlo, hace que te pierdas en el mapa con demasiada facilidad).\n\n Destaco:\n\n - Jefes finales, lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado. El maestro Juguetero es la poll\u00edsima xD.\n - OST impresionante, de lo mejor que he escuchado en un videojuego.\n - La historia es muy simple y no destaca demasiado, pero est\u00e1 muy bien contada y eso es un punto que hace que el juego acabe siendo muy entretenido, y no te pierdas con cliffhanger y dem\u00e1s recursos que entorpecen el normal desarrollo del guion.\n - El control del personaje y la respuesta del mismo en los combos es sublime. Sientes que manejas a Gabriel Belmont. No como en The Witcher 3, que a veces sent\u00eda que en lugar de a Geralt De Rivia manejaba a un fan\u00e1tico del RedBull xD.\n - Personajes con carisma. Alucard me tiene enamorado xD.\n - Combates divertid\u00edsimos y con una dificultad inquietantemente perfecta. Es muy equilibrado en este sentido, retos chulos pero no imposibles.\n - El armamento de Gabriel y su sistema de magias, retocado un poco en esta segunda parte, mejoran claramente el ya casi perfecto sistema que ten\u00eda el uno. En esto tambi\u00e9n han mejorado al primero.\n\n No me ha gustado:\n\n - Fases de sigilo. El tema de las ratas s\u00ed que me gustaba, y adem\u00e1s sonaba una m\u00fasica en ese momento acojonante, pero el resto es para tirar de la cadena. Son fases poco inspiradas, frustrantes a veces, con poca libertad de acci\u00f3n; hay que hacer lo que quiere el juego y como quiere, en caso contrario est\u00e1s muerto. La buena noticia es que a penas representan un 10-15% del total del juego, la mala es que incluso en ese 15% estropean much\u00edsimo la experiencia.\n - El sistema de combos me ha parecido el mismo que en el LOS 1. Aqu\u00ed han arriesgado poco, la verdad es que son combos muy chulos, pero deber\u00edan haber introducido nuevas combinaciones en esta segunda parte.\n - Dise\u00f1o de niveles: Me parece horrible, me perd\u00eda much\u00edsimo y no porque encontrar una zona supusiera un reto jugable, sino porque el dise\u00f1o/estructura estaba tan mal implementada que sin ser un reto del juego, se convert\u00eda en un puto desaf\u00edo \n\n En resumen:\n\n Un juego de 8/10 injustamente condenado al ostracismo, por una corriente de \"Retroalimentaci\u00f3n Hater\" que por no entender/abrazar su lore lo hundieron en la miseria. \n Creo que lo que le ocurri\u00f3 a este juego, es que peque\u00f1os aspectos como el sigilo, que es nefasto, lo reconozco, pero no representa ni el 10% del juego, o su LORE que tiraba de ambientaci\u00f3n SteamPunk en la actualidad, y esto no gust\u00f3 nada, engrandeci\u00f3 una bola de nieve peque\u00f1ita al tama\u00f1o de un Alud Napole\u00f3nico.

Pr\u00e1cticamente igual que el primero, pero con mejores texturas (si seleccionas las \"HD\"; que no ocupan mucho m\u00e1s que las del primer juego en VRAM), y en general algo mejor los decorados. No se ve del todo mal, bastante aceptable. La jugabilidad es id\u00e9ntica \"combo a combo\". Juegues con teclado o mando (teclado es IMPOSIBLE; como en el primero... llegu\u00e9 al cap\u00edtulo VI y y tuve que coger el mando), los botones en textos en pantalla y en libro (inventario, etc) aparecen con el BOT\u00d3N DEL MANDO... Y al igual que el primero, todo lo que se indica es relativo a \u00e9ste, una conversi\u00f3n a PC que parece que est\u00e1s jugando a la consola (si eso fuera bueno en algo...).\n\nLa historia empieza cont\u00e1ndote todo y ya se ve qui\u00e9nes son los personajes, nada m\u00e1s aparecer.\n\nEl primero juego si en vez de ser una secuencia de apretar botones QTE sin sentido, lo hubieran sacado como una pel\u00edcula de animaci\u00f3n, habr\u00edan triunfado. Parece una pel\u00edcula, pero en vez de palomitas te meten QTEs para putearte.\n\nEn esta segunda parte se puede SELECCIONAR DESDE EL MEN\u00da DEL JEUGO \"DESACTIVAR QTEs\", con lo que las secuencias salen sin tener que hacer el panoli apretando botones absurdamente. Todo un acierto.\n\n\nMercurysteam si se dedicara al cine, ya que el dise\u00f1o, puntos de c\u00e1mara, secuencias de animaci\u00f3n, cinem\u00e1ticas, etc. son muy peliculeros y resultones, tendr\u00eda mis bendiciones (son lo mejor del juego), pero la parte de \"juego\" falla estrepitosamente); como \"videojuego\" no puedo recomendarlo, salvo si quieres un viaje al mundo de la mala hostia.\n\nEn principio, salvo las cosas t\u00e9cnicas (que no hay por d\u00f3nde cogerlo: esto no es una conversi\u00f3n a PC ni una versi\u00f3n de PC, sino que est\u00e1s ejecutando un emulador de consola, como el MAME, parece...), parece superior al primero.

Un juego largo y completo, con una historia interesante que explica en profundidad y cierra todas las tramas que se originaron con el primer Lords of Shadow.\n\nEn este juego las novedades respecto a los anteriores son bastante numerosas. Comenzando por la inclusi\u00f3n de una c\u00e1mara libre, un sistema de combate m\u00e1s variado, con m\u00e1s opciones y mejor desarrollado, un sistema de juego algo m\u00e1s abierto que permite explorar los escenarios en cualquier momento, pudiendo hacer backtracking cuando conseguimos nuevas habilidades y un mayor sentido de la espectacularidad en momentos de acci\u00f3n.\n\nEl punto m\u00e1s destacable de esta aventura son los combates, que esta vez son m\u00e1s numerosos, convirti\u00e9ndose en el principal aliciente. Ofrece combates contra jefes de muy diferentes clases y con estrategias a seguir dispares, adem\u00e1s de luchas contra numerosas clases de enemigos menores tambi\u00e9n muy satisfactorias. El gran arsenal de Dr\u00e1cula, junto con un buen pu\u00f1ado de poderes m\u00e1gicos nuevos, reliquias y habilidades que iremos consiguiendo poco a poco hace que los combates nunca sean repetitivos, pudiendo intercalar todas estas posibilidades de la forma m\u00e1s eficaz seg\u00fan las clases de enemigos a las que nos enfrentemos cada vez, siendo su IA bastante diferente entre ellos. As\u00ed, el sistema de lucha se muestra complejo y profundo, pero sencillo de dominar con algo de pr\u00e1ctica, y muy satisfactorio en la mayor\u00eda de combates en los que tomaremos parte. Adem\u00e1s varios combates suponen un reto importante.\n\nEl otro gran pilar del juego siguen siendo las plataformas, un punto que sigue flojeando bastante debido a la linealidad con las que est\u00e1n dise\u00f1adas las zonas de agarre en los niveles, sin permitirnos apenas libertad en la forma de atravesar los escenarios. A\u00fan as\u00ed se intenta dar complejidad con trampas de varias clases, retos de tiempo y uso de habilidades especiales para hacer el plataformeo algo m\u00e1s variado, pero se queda a medio fuelle, ya que el control en el salto por ejemplo, no es todo lo preciso que podr\u00eda y deber\u00eda ser. Por lo tanto el plataformeo termina resultando mon\u00f3tono, f\u00e1cil y simple, a\u00fan mejorando el plataformeo del 1\u00ba Lords of Shadow.\n\nTambi\u00e9n nos encontramos con puzzles, la mayor\u00eda en forma de zonas de sigilo donde normalmente solo hay una posible forma correcta de hacer las cosas, siguiendo unos determinados pasos. Para ello Dr\u00e1cula puede transformarse en un grupo de ratas para atravesar peque\u00f1os canales y pasadizos, con sus propias trampas, tambi\u00e9n hacer uso de una bandada de murci\u00e9lagos para distraer a los enemigos, tranformarse en niebla moment\u00e1nemente para pasar desapercibido y sortear verjas, o incluso poseer a los enemigos desde atr\u00e1s para pasar a zonas de acceso restringido desde dentro de sus cuerpos. A pesar de las numerosas posibilidades, todas estas zonas son similares de resolver y no ofrecen una gran diversi\u00f3n porque est\u00e1n muy encorsetadas y solo se resuelven de una manera, aunque se agradece la inclusi\u00f3n de variabilidad en la jugabilidad.\n\nEl progreso de Dr\u00e1cula es bastante profundo y podremos mejorar multitud de habilidades de combate con sus tres armas principales, adem\u00e1s de aumentar par\u00e1metros como la cantidad de poder m\u00e1gico y vitalidad. Estos par\u00e1metros se mejoran mediante la b\u00fasqueda de unos artilugios donde Dr\u00e1cula har\u00e1 un peque\u00f1o sacrificio de su sangre, y en muchos casos habr\u00e1 que observar y explorar con minuciosidad los grandes escenarios para llegar hasta ellos. Tambi\u00e9n hay otros tipos de coleccionables, como diarios de soldados ca\u00eddos, documentos de la ciudad, ciertos clavos que nos permitir\u00e1n enfrentarnos a retos especiales de combate, puntos de habilidades,etc. En este sentido el juego premia la exploraci\u00f3n, y los escenarios invitan a ser recorridos en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n para localizar lo m\u00e1ximo posible. Incluso podremos obtener unas reliquias que nos ayudar\u00e1n a se\u00f1alar en el mapa la localizaci\u00f3n de algunos de estos secretos.\nEn general el dise\u00f1o de niveles del juego tiene una gran calidad. Hay bastante variedad en las maneras en las que recorreremos los escenarios, incluso colgados de plataformas movibles por ejemplo. Sobresale el grado de detalle de las estructuras, con un dise\u00f1o g\u00f3tico tan exagerado y barroco. En muchas zonas es f\u00e1cil quedarse mirando estos escenarios dada su belleza y alto nivel de detalle tanto en la ciudad moderna como en la otra realidad antigua del castillo. Los juegos de luces, el fuego, part\u00edculas, brillos y dise\u00f1o de personajes y enemigos tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 a un gran nivel.\nEl juego cumple muy bien en variedad de escenarios, y mezclando zonas en la ciudad moderna, como laboratorios y apartamentos, con el majestuoso castillo de Dr\u00e1cula en sus mejores tiempos. Ambos tipos de escenarios est\u00e1n muy bien recreados, ofrecen bonitas vistas y diferentes tipos de plataformas, uso de poderes y saltos para cada zona.\n\nLa historia es otro de los puntos fuertes de esta aventura, narrada con tranquilidad y con intensidad espor\u00e1dica, manteniendo siempre la atenci\u00f3n de la trama, que aunque no tiene giros dr\u00e1sticos del gui\u00f3n como en el 1\u00ba juego, cumple con creces en este aspecto y s\u00ed que presenciaremos varias sorpresas menores. Se profundiza en todos los personajes, d\u00e1ndoles una fuerte personalidad en la mayor\u00eda de casos. Hay bastantes cinem\u00e1ticas, pero no resultan aburridas ni rompen el ritmo del juego, que est\u00e1 bastante bien llevado.\nLa BSO es excelente, combina perfectamente en cada momento del juego y en general son piezas con mucha calidad y complejas que transmiten bien la emoci\u00f3n de cada situaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como el buen doblaje de personajes principales y secundarios.\n\nAs\u00ed, este Castlevania es un muy notable juego de aventuras cargado de acci\u00f3n y exploraci\u00f3n con una historia muy elaborada y llena de detalles que finalizan la epopeya del clan Belmont contada a lo largo de cientos de a\u00f1os. Un juego bastante superior a sus predecesores. Completarlo al 100% puede llevar hasta 25 horas, por lo que ofrece buenas horas de diversi\u00f3n. S\u00f3lo un plataformeo encorsetado lastrado de su 1\u00ba parte con poco control sobre el salto, un dise\u00f1o de niveles que ofrece pocas formas diferentes de movernos por ellos, unas zonas de sigilo tambi\u00e9n demasiado encorsetadas y con pocas posibilidades y una falta de mayor n\u00famero de novedades y minijuegos lastran lo que podr\u00eda haber sido un juego de aventuras sobresaliente con un aspecto y ambientaci\u00f3n excelente.\nMuy recomendable tambien el DLC de Revelations, donde manejaremos a Alucard en cierto intervalo cr\u00edtico de tiempo en la historia del juego principal. Un DLC corto, pero que reune lo mejor del juego principal, adem\u00e1s de ofrecer habilidades completamente nuevas, como el control de un lobo espectral o la reconstrucci\u00f3n de viejas estructuras da\u00f1adas, adem\u00e1s del manejo de armas diferentes a las que usa Dr\u00e1cula. Tambi\u00e9n encontramos en este DLC dos de los mejores puzzles de todo el juego, con secciones muy inspiradas tanto en jugabilidad como en su dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico. Incluso se mejora la satisfacci\u00f3n que producen las zonas de plataformeo haci\u00e9ndolas m\u00e1s complejas y complicadas.  8'4\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472176845, "timestamp_updated": 1472176845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25129084": {"recommendationid": "25129084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012962922", "num_games_owned": 3341, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 2297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2297, "last_played": 1403997384}, "language": "english", "review": "An underated, but fun Castlevania game.

Strong elements of several kinds without a smoot transition is what makes the experience feel forced, or what may force you to have harsh feelings about the game. (Like I did)\n\nMerging strong storytelling with exploration using cutscenes is a big no in the experience category. When you find a new area or get past or to a boss or story area, you get a cutscene that either  shows you everything you want to find on your own, or tells you a story that moves you from the area before you can finish exploring. Other games manage this type of merge by using character narration or slowing the walk speed. \n\nStrong combat elements with excessive backtracking: Having to down half a dozen enemies who are tiered to what part of the main story you are on just because you are looking for something is what I hate most about the game. The lack of loot and a equipment system makes me lose the edge for excessive combat, but in addition to that, almost every enemy has a ranged attack that has huge hitboxes that they are all too happy to use deciding you would like to skip the battle. Most battles near the endgame or after you gained a new traversal ability are begun with a groan because you've been shot off a ledge to the point where you do want to fight just so you can enjoy the game. The mastery system ends way too early to entice excessive battling and credits are easy to get provided you dpend them properly upgrading skills you'll most likely use. \n\nThe open world element is trashed by an isolated map system and the same looking load elevators and hatches. Find things in this game is met with repeatedly going the wrong way and passing points where you cannot backtrack through the area after you jumped down. The areas are intertwined somewhat and only one or two pllaces have this problem, but that tied with the block the area rests in being behind one of like 5 blue elevator doors makes the experience irritating and repetitive.\n\nBut after you swallow those strong flavors and seperate them by improvising, you can stop to appreaciate the art and fluidity of the combat and the thought they put into hiding the upgrades. And then when all that is getting good... The game is over. It's metroid all over again. Get the screw attack, Find stuff, kill the last guy. I just hope there is a secret boss or something. \n\nThe alucard dlc is honestly why I bought the game. For some reason, everything dracula backwards is in seems to get more polish than the game itself... for some reason, that's still true. Alucard has proper last gen hair animation, a shiny coat, skin that is also pale but not sickening to look at, skills that are practical, a sword and movelist that probably drove the fans crazy, and one of the coolest ideas for a puzzle element ever. It doesn't break pace ever, and it makes you feel like you're a strong character. Instead of being dracula where you never even got to beat one of the guards that caused you so much trouble without taking over their body and dropping their gun. \n\nIt's one of those games that gets better when you play it.

I find the dark style a little unwelcome, but that's just me.

On paper, this game has all the ingredients needed to send the series out with a bang; amazing graphics, expanded combat and upgrade system, larger and more explorable world, great score, and stellar voice cast. However, when taken together, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first Lords of Shadow game. One of the biggest problems is the story, which is all over the place as the player jumps between the past and present, represented by the enormous castle where Dracula resides, and the modern-day, gothic city. While MercurySteam's attention to detail and graphical prowess shine in both sections of the game, the city just wasn't as compelling as the castle, and every time I had to go back to the city to complete an objective, I sighed. This point extends to the gameplay in the city as well, which boasts uninspired and frustrating enemies, and stealth sections. In truth, the enemies in the city weren't actually that bad; I just felt that the castle's enemies were much better designed, and fit the \"Castlevania\" theme. Despite these issues, the core gameplay and combat is solid, and for the most part, better than the first game. The player is also free to roam around both areas looking for upgrades and collectibles; gone is the chapter-by-chapter format. Even with the story jumping around, it is fairly interesting, and the cast does a good job of keeping the player involved. However, the biggest problem emerged during the last third of the game, where it seemed like interesting characters and plot developments were either dropped or rushed to conclusion, culminating in a disappointing final sequence and boss that paled in comparison to the epic scale and confrontations of the first game. Stretching out some story moments or expanding on all the concepts that the narrative introduced would have made the story feel much more put together and complete. And ultimately, it is this feeling of \"what could have been\" that drags this game down to being simply good, and not great. There are some cool moments, and I did enjoy the experience enough to recommend this game, but it could have been so much more.

Picking up where the jump cut left off in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow; We are introduced once more to Gabriel Belmont now more commonly known as Dracul (Dracula). The game starts off very strong as we meet Gabriel at the height of his powers, but due to reasons unknown till later we go to the present where Gabriel is now weak and seeking one thing. He makes a deal with Death itself that if he can circumvent the events that are occuring; He will be given the one thing he truly desires after all these years.\n\nAs the game goes on Gabriel regains much of his lost powers by going to an alternate dimension where his Castle; Castlevania lies in wait. I prefer these trips to modern present day locales that we visit. Though both serve a purpose and with Gabriel constantly plagued by his former self and beliefs and his vampric ones; Gabriel struggles to maintain his hold on even his own power; We see just how truly he suffered and became Dracul along the way.\n\nCombat was exceptional and rewarding for using every move in your repertoire as it levels yoru strength of which ever weapon. It's satisfying as it rewards you for choosing to fight in your favorite ways.\n\nWhile some of the bosses come off as easy; I enjoyed the game through and through till the very last moment/ boss fight.

Pero no hay que confundirse, no estamos ante un juego simplemente bueno, sino un juego notable pero que a los que hemos jugado la trilog\u00eda nos duele que no se cierre con broche de oro.\n\n[b]Lo que se ha mejorado:[/b]\n\nEl combate, que ya era bueno, ahora no se limita a tener un arma principal y magias para curarse o hacer m\u00e1s da\u00f1o, sino que cada poder o magia es un arma distinta sumando un total de 3 armas distintas, oblig\u00e1ndonos a usar un arma para romper escudos, otra para congelar a enemigos que son muy r\u00e1pidos, etc. Adem\u00e1s, cada arma tiene muchas t\u00e9cnicas que desbloquear y dominar para as\u00ed subir el nivel del arma al m\u00e1ximo.\n\nSe ha mejorado tambi\u00e9n la forma de contar la historia. Se nota el esfuerzo que se ha puesto en las cinem\u00e1ticas, que resultan m\u00e1s interesantes. Las voces est\u00e1n m\u00e1s trabajadas, etc. La presentaci\u00f3n es sublime.\n\nAhora el juego no se divide en cap\u00edtulos a los que se acceden a trav\u00e9s de un men\u00fa, sino que la historia transcurre en una ciudad/castillo con diferentes zonas interconectadas que se pueden explorar libremente, sin llegar a nivel de \u201cmundo abierto\u201d. Hay unas \u201csalas de mapas\u201d que ofrecen la opci\u00f3n de teletransporte.\n\nLos desaf\u00edos de Kleidos, un modo arena con retos que superar bastante atractivo, tanto para completar el 100% del juego como para practicar. Creo que estos modos de juego tipo arena/oleadas de enemigos deber\u00edan estar en todos los juegos de accion. Explotan bastante la jugabilidad. Mejor este modo que tener que repetir cap\u00edtulo por cap\u00edtulo bajo unas determinadas condiciones, como ocurr\u00eda en la primera entrega. No hubiera estado de m\u00e1s un modo contrarreloj como en Mirror of Fate.\n\n[b]Donde se ha dado un paso atr\u00e1s:[/b]\n\nLas secciones de plataformas pierden fuerza en esta entrega. Ahora en las zonas de escalada el personaje es mucho m\u00e1s \u00e1gil y pr\u00e1cticamente con mover el stick de direcci\u00f3n y aporrear el bot\u00f3n de salto para llegar a los salientes m\u00e1s alejados acabaremos con dichas secciones r\u00e1pidamente. El primer juego no es que fuese dif\u00edcil en este aspecto, pero en Lords of Shadow 2 han simplificado demasiado estas secciones.\n\nEl sigilo est\u00e1 metido con calzador. Al principio del juego intentan justificarlo con que el personaje est\u00e1 d\u00e9bil y tiene que evitar enemigos, pero una vez la historia avanza podemos encontrarnos con situaciones tan forzadas como escondernos de un enemigo para que inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de terminar la zona de sigilo enfrentarnos a \u00e9l. Hay que a\u00f1adir que estas secciones son f\u00e1ciles, pero paran tanto la acci\u00f3n que por la ansiedad de acabarlas cuanto antes pueden llegar a matarnos una y otra vez y llegar a ser realmente frustrantes.\n\nConvertirse en rata puede resultar una mec\u00e1nica interesante a la hora de acceder a zonas secretas con coleccionables, desbloquear puertas, etc., pero no se ha explotado en este aspecto. Aunque es de agradecer que esta mec\u00e1nica sirva para algo m\u00e1s que las zonas de sigilo, tampoco aporta mucho y se podr\u00eda haber evitado, sin ser lo peor del mundo.\n\n[b]Merece la pena si has jugado a los anteriores[/b]\n\nEn definitiva, Castlevania, Lords of Shadow 2 es un juego totalmente recomendable a los que hayan jugado a alguna de las entregas anteriores y quieran saber c\u00f3mo acaba todo.

The downloadable content \u201cRevelations\u201d introduces Alucard as a playable character and provides some surprising background information.\n\no Variety of enemies is rather small and champions are too weak. Compelling storytelling in the beginning, but it loses momentum towards the end.    \n\n-- The stealth sections are an atrocity, and represent an insult to the legendary abilities of the Lord of Shadows.

However, the rest of the game does not reach the level of quality of its predecessor.

This system gives you points in whichever skill you are using, and when maxed out, can be used to upgrade the weapon itself. I found myself using more varied combos and different attack patterns, instead of just cheesing the bosses with Guillotine. \n\nI digged how Dracula / Gabriel is portrayed, and the other characters are well done as well. \n\nThough, be advised that the controls are not shown as keyboard keys, and will instead be like, \"push A\" and so on, corresponding to an Xbox 360 controller.

En esta ocasi\u00f3n, se nos dice qu\u00e9 ocurri\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de que Gabriel, en la cinem\u00e1tica final del primer juego, fuera buscado por Zobek y de repente apareciese en una ciudad absolutamente moderna; nos encontramos en el a\u00f1o 2057 y Zobek est\u00e1 enterado de que Sat\u00e1n va a ser tra\u00eddo nuevamente al mundo (espec\u00edficamente a la ciudad de Castlevania), tras los enormes esfuerzos de tres ac\u00f3litos que tienen mucha influencia en la sociedad. No me queda claro a\u00fan si el final del castillo que se vio en Mirror of Fate es el mismo que se vio al inicio de LoS 2, y poco o nada nos entera sobre la descendencia de Simon Belmont. Lords of Shadow 2, como cualquier juego y secuela, tiene puntos en donde flaquea y donde es fuerte, me entristece decir que uno de los puntos donde flaquea un poco es el final, que es medio \u00abmeh\u00bb, pero la historia general, la jugabilidad, los mapas, las gr\u00e1ficas, el sonido... es todo un banquete.\n\n\ud83c\udf1e Logros en Steam.\n\ud83c\udf1e Todo el juego est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol salvo los di\u00e1logos (que est\u00e1n en ingl\u00e9s), pero esos tienen subt\u00edtulos en espa\u00f1ol.\n\ud83c\udf1e Tienes la posibilidad de jugar con teclado o control tipo consola. El juego te recomienda que uses el control.\n\ud83c\udf1e Maravillosas gr\u00e1ficas y una banda sonora absolutamente magn\u00edfica.\n\ud83c\udf1e Pese al escenario moderno, la ambientaci\u00f3n es bastante obscura y sangrienta. Cuando est\u00e9s a punto de matar a un enemigo podr\u00e1s tomarlo y ver\u00e1s una cort\u00edsima escena que demuestra la brutalidad de Dr\u00e1cula.\n\ud83c\udf1e Tiene muchas cualidades del LoS, como un \u00e1lbum de ilustraciones (bell\u00edsimo, por cierto), una interfaz para que compres y veas tus t\u00e9cnicas (ahora hay muchas m\u00e1s).\n\ud83c\udf1e Cuenta con una expansi\u00f3n (DLC comprable) que es \u00abRevelations\u00bb. No la he comprado a\u00fan, pero entiendo que es algo cortita.\n\ud83c\udf1e Hay muchos rompecabezas y secretos por aqu\u00ed y por all\u00e1 (artes que debes buscar, memoriales con historias, cristales de magia del vac\u00edo, del caos y de vida, clavos de Kleidos para los desaf\u00edos).\n\ud83c\udf1e Los desaf\u00edos ahora ya no son en cada nivel como en el LoS, sino que hay un \u00e1rea en particular cuyos niveles de dificultad (que son cuatro) deben ser desbloqueados con cuatro clavos de Kleidos cada uno. Algunos te dar\u00e1n ganas de pedir misericordia, otros son muy f\u00e1ciles.\n\ud83c\udf1e Las peleas con los jefes son geniales. Disfrut\u00e9 con casi todas ellas, pero sobre todo con las de el Juguetero y la de Carmilla... \u00a1ah, y tambi\u00e9n la de los esp\u00edritus de la tormenta!\n\ud83c\udf1e La historia es muy atractiva, tendr\u00e1s que luchar en el a\u00f1o 2057 y regresar al pasado para completar la historia y recoger objetos.\n\ud83c\udf1e Las habilidades pueden subir de nivel y cada tanto puedes transferir la maestr\u00eda al arma correspondiente (hasta un m\u00e1ximo de nivel tres) para hacer que dicha arma sea m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\ud83c\udf1e Salvado autom\u00e1tico.\n\ud83c\udf1e Al haber sido LoS un universo alterno, LoS 2 viene a ser la continuaci\u00f3n de dicho universo, por lo que los fan\u00e1ticos m\u00e1s ac\u00e9rrimos de la saga deben andar con cuidado.\n\ud83c\udf1e Hay otros DLCs para comprar.\n\ud83c\udf1e Cuando termines el juego, podr\u00e1s iniciar una Partida+ para que lo intentes en otro nivel de dificultad.\n\n\u2620 No hay cromos en Steam.\n\u2620 Pese a poder jugar con el teclado, hay momentos en los que es muy dif\u00edcil llevar a cabo ciertas cosas. Por ejemplo, si bien en el LoS jugamos con Eventos R\u00e1pidos (Quick Time Events), era f\u00e1cil si eleg\u00edamos el teclado porque el juego nos indicaba qu\u00e9 letra de este apretar; en LoS 2 no importa si elegiste el teclado, el juego te indicar\u00e1 que presiones un bot\u00f3n del control tipo consola, lo que puede causar mucha confusi\u00f3n y hacerte perder estos eventos, impidi\u00e9ndote progresar. Por este motivo es que recomiendo ir a las opciones del men\u00fa y desactivar los QTE. Esto provoca que el juego sea MUCH\u00cdSIMO m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil, pero tambi\u00e9n te evitar\u00e1 muchos malos ratos.\n\u2620 La c\u00e1mara... Dios m\u00edo, no puedo dejar de mencionar esto. Si bien se mueve la mayor parte del tiempo apropiadamente, en los desaf\u00edos de Kleidos sol\u00eda ser muy molesta la manera en la que se mov\u00eda la c\u00e1mara.\n\u2620 El DLC de \u00abRevelations\u00bb que cuenta parte de la historia de Alucard (Trevor) tiene un precio un poquito alto, lo que a\u00f1adido al precio del juego base hace que sea un relativo lujo tener todo el juego.\n\u2620 Los DLCs extras son m\u00e1s est\u00e9ticos que otra cosa (disfraces para Gabriel). Hay uno que es una runa que permite transformar las reliquias en aquella que t\u00fa prefieras.\n\u2620 Existe un glitch que puede aparecer de la nada y consiste en que se crean paredes invisibles que no te dejan cruzar puertas o subir a pisos superiores. No es com\u00fan, me pas\u00f3 solo una vez en todo lo que jugu\u00e9, pero es molesto y se resuelve regresando al punto de control m\u00e1s reciente.\n\u2620 No cuenta con una opci\u00f3n de salvado, solo con el salvado autom\u00e1tico.\n\u2620 Nuevamente no aprovecharon la posibilidad de crear un modo \u00abboss rush\u00bb o \u00abcontrarreloj\u00bb. Ac\u00e1 se pudo explotar much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s considerando las grandiosas batallas con jefes que tiene.\n\u2620 Los enemigos son algo repetitivos, no hay mucha variedad en ese aspecto.\n\u2620 Los guardias del Apocalipsis. Son enemigos muy molestos y nunca tienes la oportunidad de vengarte de ellos.\n\u2620 El desaf\u00edo de Kleidos de Roland de Ronceval. No es que perjudique al juego pero... me lleva, c\u00f3mo hincha las verijas ese desaf\u00edo.\n\u2620 El final del juego deja mucho que desear.\n\nEn breves palabras, recomiendo mucho Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, tiene una jugabilidad muy amigable, una banda sonora envidiable y unas gr\u00e1ficas indiscutiblemente hermosa. Es un juego que, pese a sus flaquezas, se nota que ha sido hecho con cari\u00f1o. Yo lo compr\u00e9 en oferta y no sali\u00f3 para nada caro, quiz\u00e1 deban esperar un poco para encontrarlo a buen precio, por lo que recomendar\u00eda que lo pongan en su lista de deseados y est\u00e9n pendientes de \u00e9l.", "timestamp_created": 1462424354, "timestamp_updated": 1595620062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22758192": {"recommendationid": "22758192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050388512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1092, "last_played": 1468248031}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is about Dracula searching for relics in garbage 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1462178504, "timestamp_updated": 1462178504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496769070625305176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22755224": {"recommendationid": "22755224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030083207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4705, "last_played": 1462157239}, "language": "english", "review": "Bottom line: Solid game that is worth the money (on sale).

While there are a few issues that detract from the overall experience, they are not serious enough for me to not recommend the game. Some key points follow.\n\n[list]\n[*]The combat system is an evolution of the one in the first game, with significant refinements that make for a very smooth experience. For example, you can dodge and parry attacks even in the air. While the skill trees for each of the weapons may seem labyrinthine at first, if you put some thought into how they're structured and how each of the moves are executed, you'll start to realize how elegantly designed Dracula's moveset is. Gone are the difficult-to-execute combos in the first [i]Lords of Shadow[/i]; you now have a broad range of attacks that are easily performed with plenty of versatility for nearly any combat situation.\n[*]Setting and environmental design is generally excellent. Both in the castle and in the city, there's a great sense of scale, and the level of detail put into the environment is absolutely incredible. Overall, it's designed in the open-world \"Metroidvania\" tradition, with plenty of exploration and discovery. Many level design cues have been taken from the [i]Assassin's Creed[/i] series, which isn't a bad thing since I've always liked their level design; likewise, when not in combat, Dracula himself handles a lot like Connor from [i]Assassin's Creed III[/i]. However, it is not completely flawless; ...\n[*]...in particular, some of the stealth sections need improvement. While the ones involving Golgoth Guards aren't exactly bad, Agreus's maze and [spoiler]Carmilla's[/spoiler] blood curse puzzle are questionably designed, leaving the player very little room for error which can lead to frustration.\n[*]The story is good, but not great. Dracula as a character has some very nice background but scenario design can be a bit better and the ending is a bit too open-ended.\n[/list]\n\nAgain, neither of the last two points are enough to take away my recommendation. It's sad that these (relatively minor) flaws in an otherwise well-executed game led to such negative critical reception from several expert reviewers. Playing as the Prince of Darkness himself has been an unforgettable experience for me and I ultimately enjoyed the game.

OK, yes - fighting is perfectlty fine. Especially since devs dropped the fixed camera. But everything else? Not so much. It's like devs tought \"We have a good fighting that we improved with working camera. Lets call it a day, just fit anything as the rest. Who cares anyway - it's the beating that matters\". And  so we have booooooooring plot, told in Fast Forward mode (even faster than in previous part). With some sort of poor stealth sections instead of puzzles. And of course there are still platforming elements but just as in part 1 - you have to be deliberatly sabotaging yourself to fail them. And the visuals... Castle part is ok. Really. But the City?! Jesus, it's supposed to be somewhere around year 2000. So why dafuq everything that can tries to look like World War I thing?! The things that cannot are just plainand simple putting fantasy stuff in early XX's cetury seting, Which never looks good. I know, I know - we all want to be unique and original. But that doesn't mean we have to be ugly or do ugly things. And - last but not least - technicals. The game does not recognize controllers other than Xbox's.

I have not reviewed a game in a while but I really need to let out some steam. Lords of Shadow was a great game, a good incarnation of the Castlevania series and the first one to actually manage to pull a good game in 3D. With it's combat mechanics, it's boss fights and a story that I find quite interesting. The first Belmont turns out to be the one transforming into Dracula and the greater evil is Satan. Bravo!\n\nMirror of Fate was a good game, just that. It had a good story, the first time that the Belmont (Vampire Hunters) went on for Dracula's head and how Alucard came to be. Pretty original all around. But it can't compare of course with the first game. And then it came the trilogy closure. Lords of Shadow two. The first game to actually put you in the role of Dracula and in the present. At glance, it's an idea worth exploring, a finale worth telling; to know what happens to Gabriel Belmont now as Dracula and to see if Satan returns. Will Dracula find redemption? At least I know the game won't. The combat mechanics are the same as Lords of Shadow, but now instead of light and shadow magic you have a Void Sword (light) and Chaos Claws (Shadow). Not one change in the mechanics aside from that. If it ain't broke, why fix it?\n\nBut oh! Mercury Steam tried to step up the game with the world and the map. What a big mistake. The map, instead of being presented as the first game, in which you were advancing from place to place and you could revisit them whenever you wanted and relive the boss fights; now it's just a conglomerate mess. It deviates itself into a sort of open world with a map room every now and then in some locations that help you fast travel from place to place, but it is hard to keep track of where have you been and where you need to go to get all the upgrades. The map is divided in two: the city and the castle. What you may say? We are in the present day right? Yes! We are, but on that later.\n\nThe city is just dull. All grey, wherever you turn. Generic places, streets, alleys; only for a few landmarks where you fight bosses or big group of enemies. The presentation of the place is lame, it does not encourage the player to explore. The castle has some epic scenarios and places that vary from each other, one time you are on an underground city and another you are exploring a hall; and that's a good thing but unfortunately that is all. The enemies are generic as hell. The demon spawns are so generic and there are so few types of them that you feel like you are battling the same enemies all the game. It is another story for the castle, but nevertheless, there are not so many different types of enemies.\n\nAnd here come the bosses. I don't know where to start. Let's see...\nThere are many bosses on this game and their design is great, but just two of them managed to wake my emotion battling them. The rest of them felt kind of cheap. Also, there aren't any or at least few mechanics whatsoever to kill them. You literally (aside some exceptions) can blast your way through them with brute force. What thing that was a big letdown was the final battle. I was expecting an epic clash and what I received was a boss battle that felt forced and a killing scene that couldn't be more lame, LAME with capital letters, do you hear me mercury steam?\n\nNow, onto the point where you are Dracula, the prince of darkness, the dragon, the... Wait... Do I need to hide from this guys because I can't fight them? Do I need to turn myself into rats because of the fear to be killed by them? Am I not the Dragon? A force of darkness to be reckoned with? The one who vanquished Satan? \nLet that sink in. There are some parts of the game that put you up against some body guards of Satan and you can't fight them, you need to sneak past them transforming into rats or mist; I get it, Dracula can use those skills and I know that he is weakened by his long sleep but there is no part in the game that we face them directly in combat; but oh the final boss? Yeah sure bring it on! I am certain that after that fight, Dracula still needs to sneak from those bodyguards. So in a few words: you never really feel like the dragon.\n\nAnd now, for the final part of this review and my conclusion: the story, if that thing can be called that. The story is just a convoluted mess. Mercury Steam clearly had no idea on how to develop the story and how to end it. The premise is a fantastic one: you are now Dracula and you are about to confront the lord of hell, Satan himself with acolytes around the city paving his way; also, there is something within his mind, dreams (I really don't know what was it) that draws you back to the castle, and when you are there you discover that a corrupted blood, a dark entity is trying to keep Dracula there for all eternity. The story, as I said before, is developed in the present day at Castlevania City and in the Castle. You travel from one another by portals around the world or when a vision comes to play or Trevor appears and guides you to the castle. \n\nSo this was the ending of the trilogy, of Mercury Steam take on the franchise and what did they do with it? They blow it off. The story is weak, doesn't give a closure and nothing great happens. Dracula sets to stop Satan but ends in a very weak tone for this part and it is never explained why there was dark blood in the castle possessing the minions of Dracula, also it is never explained why you travel back to the castle.\n\n\nIn conclusion: this game is mediocre. All of it. The combat is the same as the first entry but you as a player don't need to develop it to conquer the game, there is no need for it. The map, the map is a mess. The bosses don't have any essence to them (in a story way) and have no mechanics whatsoever, just two or three of them. The premise of the story was amazing! It could have been taking through a glorious path and end on an epic note, but instead you get a story that feels dull and no closure at all.\n\nDon't play this game if you haven't. Just stay with Lords of Shadow 1 and Mirror of Fate.

Using his Void Sword, Shadow Whip and Chaos Claws to create powerful combos you'll become invencible, and in this point I have a negative opinion to say: I'm not sure if is because I played the first game and know how the combat system works, but I felt the game much easier, even when I was playing in Prince of Darkness difficult (except fora some Kleidos Challenges - they made a great work in those challenges).\nThey made a open world game this time and they made great in my opinion. Was amazing when I started to play and everything was...[i]normal[/i] and as long I kept playing I could see the world changing around me.\nThe fights, and in this point I have to say, they improved A LOT from the first game. Each weapon (Sword, Whip and Claws) has a different movement's tree and I just loved to use all: freezing smallers enemies and throwing them in the air with my Sword, breaking some shields and armors with my Chaos Storm and finishing them with my Whip was simply awesome, after all he's now Dracul and not just a simple human.\nWhitout no doubt a great game, not as much as the first one, but a great game. BUT like any game, this one has negative points too. Let's talk about bosses and enemies first.\nWe play as Dracula, but there isn't much fights to enjoy all our powers, and should have more since is an open world game AND (yes, I know we play in present days), but I felt a bit out of context when I needed to fight against Mech (like robots) and enemies with guns (WTF face that moment), like Dracul just dropped of in another world. And I didn't see those epics bosses fights as I saw when I played the first game. The [i]bosses[/i] in my opinion were just normal enemies a bit bigger (except for four: SPOILER WARNING [spoiler]the fights against the two first acolytes, Zobek and Satan[/spoiler]). You won't see an epic Titan or a dangerous Lord or some powerful Necromancer.\nWell, even with some negatives points and some troubles (I'm not sure if was 'cause my computer or the game so I decided do not talk about them), I still recommend to everyone to play this awesome and beautiful game.", "timestamp_created": 1459696082, "timestamp_updated": 1486939921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500666499137878418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22163934": {"recommendationid": "22163934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973244512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1078, "last_played": 1459591428}, "language": "english", "review": "[table][tr][td]PROS:[/td][td]The Dracula is real[/td][/tr][tr][td]CONS:[/td][td]Not 'quite' as epic as the first LoS[/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1459445333, "timestamp_updated": 1459445356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50635915994644165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22119896": {"recommendationid": "22119896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041756601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 2637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1419, "last_played": 1635964205}, "language": "english", "review": "Shortly: (trying no to tell any spoilers and and I didn't play the DLC: Revelations)\nBasically, the game is a sequel for the original Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and the Castlevania: Mirror of Fate games, and it continues the story of Dracula (Gabriel Belmont) thousand years after the events of those 2 games.\n\nThe game is staged on a modern era, where Satan is once again trying to destroy the world of men with the help of his Acolytes.\n\nUnlike in the original LoS game, this time the game is a openworld game, however you can only travel to new areas AFTER you've aquired a certain powerup to access them. And like in all openworld games, this one also has fast-travel system, but its pretty primitive.\n\nThere are 2 different worlds that you can travel, the modern era where the Satan's forcers brings havoc and the Dracula's Castle where the Dracula's own blood is trying to trap you.\n\nGraphics are decent, sounds and voice actings are doreable. The battle system is slightly better than it was in the original LoS, but at the same time it feels a little bit watered down from what it was.\n\nThe overall story is a cliche, because you can easily predict that what's about to happen. However, it is interesting enough to see it through. The ending itself however was a disappointment for me, because there's no conclusion, but that's just my opinion.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Battle and upgrade systems\n+ Boss encounters (though the last boss was disappointment)\n+ Lots of different enemies\n+ Lots of collectables for those interested\n+ Over 20 hours of gameplay if you collect every collectable like I did\n\nCons:\n- Disappointing last boss\n- Awful Fast-travel system (though you only need it when you're searching for collectables)\n- Lots of annoying enemies at the end\n- Bad ending (there's no conclusion in my opinion but then again I didn't play the revelations DLC)\n- The Shop's location is bad, because getting some of the collectables requires a certain item that can only be bought from the shop, so you need to visit it a lot\n- Kleido's Challenges offer no reward except a few Steam achievements\n- Few un-skippable cutscenes and events such as the slow paced transition between the modern era - Dracula's Castle\n\n\nDo I recommend ?:\nIf you're interested to see what happens to the Dracula after the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, then this might interest you. But if you haven't played those 2 games before, don't care about the story and are only interested for the action, then don't bother.\n\nVerdict: 6 / 10 - Slightly good game\n( 1 = Do-not-bother game\n  5 = Average game\n 10 = Must own game )", "timestamp_created": 1459239594, "timestamp_updated": 1459260292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22065115": {"recommendationid": "22065115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066673553", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 749, "last_played": 1459276998}, "language": "english", "review": "A stake right through the heart. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1459004789, "timestamp_updated": 1459004789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22056009": {"recommendationid": "22056009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100339706", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 6430, "last_played": 1700363327}, "language": "english", "review": "\nThe roots of evil are deep......\n\n\n\n\nIrreversibly so in the hearts of men.

Because LOS 2 is far from the great game the first one was, but also isn't totally crap - I'd say it's about 60/40 on the quality divide.\n\nIf you played LOS 1 you'll recall it finished with a gob smacking reveal - that had me extremely curious as to how the developers would follow up on this audacious twist. As it turns out - not particularly well. It's a beat em up platformer just like the first, but in this case the camera is moveable - which makes a big, and unwelcome, difference as it is slightly too far out to see the action, and also gets obscured by the ridiculous amount of special effects that happen with EVERY attack.\n\nThe game begins back in ye olde days with Dracula's castle being attacked by a giant robot that looks like a building. At first I was like WTF  is that?? because it looks utterly stupid - until I remembered the Titans from LOS 1: those majestic towering elemental creatures that were so impressive. Well, this is one of those - except it's been put through the moronometer, and come out with totally dumb design. Technically impressive for sure, but so NOT Castlevania!\n\nIf you hated the liberties the first game took with the series design - you'll be frothing at the mouth over this one....and I'd probably best not mention it gets even worse when the game jumps back to the present day, because those bits will  likely cause your brain to explode in disgust. They annoyed me, and I wasn't bothered by LOS 1's changes. \n\nIn the modern day bits you begin by traipsing through a pharmaceutical warehouse, beating up crates and plastic barrels - but not the enemies because you are too weedy after starving yourself of blood for hundreds of years. Yet there's a cutscene where Dracula gleefully murders a family of three - kid included - to regain some of his strength, and to show you how EVIL he has become...err, okay ...not really selling it so far (mainly due to Robert Carlylse's utterly shit performance), but whatevs!\n\nAnyway, because you've become a total wimp  the first enemies you face have an enforced stealth aspect, which is pretty basic - and by the way, said enemies are big dudes in demonic armour with a gun bigger than you are.......Wot tha fudge?\n\nEventually you get through these dull encounters, and get sucked back into ye olde times - which thankfully are (a) much more enjoyable, and (b) less crap stylistically, though the first boss you face in this world isn't the greatest to look at. Duff them up, explore a bit more, and then...it's back to the crappy warehouse, traipse thru that some more, and it's back to ye olde world. The games a YOYO!!! Ye olde world =good, modern day=big bag'o'shito\n\nBack in yon days of lore there's a bit with these creepy snake headed girls that's very....creepy, as they skitter about, and contort themselves in a fashion that really won't be doing their spine any favours. They're genuinely disturbing, yet at the same time it's such a pity the whole game seems incapable of maintaining the menace they exude. \n\nThe boss battle that precedes this bit has an awfully written cutscene, that's very japanese (even though the devs are spanish...) With an overtly sexual demonic villainess who laughs like a demented walrus, and then says you make her wet....yeeeessss, ok then. The bizarrest thing about all this - the first game had Hideo Kojima involved and wasn't this bad, this time around he was nowhere near this game and it's even more Hideo Kojimaesque than Hideo Kojima. \n\nAnd, well, that's as far as I've got so far : that's an awful lot of crappy aspects for the first 3 or 4 hours of a game. There's still some enjoyment to be had with it, but it's a shadow of LOS's greatness and a horrendous treatment of Castlevania.\nOn the plus side - Patrick Stewart is much less awful this time around, so there's that. So, here goes - time to push the 'meh' recommend button, oh wait - there isn't one.", "timestamp_created": 1458303026, "timestamp_updated": 1458303238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522900760173797607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21896677": {"recommendationid": "21896677", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969489829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 314, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 902, "last_played": 1458266121}, "language": "english", "review": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is lying to you, there are not Lords of Shadow in this game. But luckily there is a castle, so I guess it's not all bad. \nOkay, half a castle.\n\nYou play as Dracula...What, really? Yeah, you play as that guy you've been beating up since the 80's. Now, when I played Lords of Shadow I explained that I am not familiar with Castlevania outside of a little bit of Symphony of the Night. Now that I've played more than an hour of the original games I have a better understanding of the series. And now I come to you saying that Castlevania: Lords of Shadow as a series feels more like a fairly competent fan fiction than it's own universe.\n\nAfter an annoying tutorial sequence, you wake up in the DISTANT FUTURE OF 1999, at least I think it's 1999. Dracula awakens form his long slumber looking much like I do after a Saturday night, minus the incredibly handsome. After getting beaten up by a large T-rex looking monster, you are saved by a man in armor  who's wielding a suspiciously Japanese looking sword, lets just call him Scrungus Humungous for now. \n\nSo Scrungus takes you back to his master Zobek, who is Patrick Stewart but also a jerk. He tells you that Satan is using his Acolytes to revive him so he can dominate the world. Zobek tells you that if you can pull Satan out of hiding and defeat him, he will give Dracula the eternal rest he longed for. \n\nSo yes, this game is about Dracula fist fighting Satan. \n\nI should probably explain the game now.\n\nMuch like the first game, LOS is a action beat-em-up much like God of War. You have three weapons, a whip, a sword, and your dukes, but your dukes are on fire, how rad is that? Both the sword and your fire fists are on a meter of sorts while your whip is good to go at any moment, not unlike a whip in that weird teachers basement. \n\nYour enemies come in different shapes and sizes, with a nice touch that they all have lore and back story to them. But other than a few special moves they all attack the same outside of the very few bosses you run into. Standard attacks can be both blocked and countered, leaving the enemy open for a critical attack. But every now and then, or more than often, all the time, the enemy will use a heavy attack which you will have to dodge. Outside of a few items and changing weapons on the fly, that's about as complicated as combat gets. \n\nSo I'm going to say some bad stuff now.\n\nLike I said before, I finally got familiar with Castlevania as a whole, and now a lot of elements just leave a bad taste in my mouth. Outside of Dracula originally being Gabriel Belmont (Spoilers by the way, if you've never watched any of the trailers), the Belmont lineage kind of gets turned into that soup the weird lady hands out down town. Dracula and Alucard (That's Dracula backwards) are both Belmonts and the rest of the lineage kind of takes a back seat.  Actual spoilers by the way.\n[spoiler]You actually DO meet another Belmont named Victor, but he dies roughly 10 minutes after you meet him, so whatever. [/spoiler]\n\nThis is honestly kind of stupid, in the original series, Dracula was a man named Mathias Cronqvist, so not only did they change who Dracula actually IS but they also flat out replaced him with their own new character for the series: Gabriel. \n\nWhat was the point of this? I'm not in the fanbase but did anyone actually ask for Dracula as a playable character? It doesn't add anything because your best healing is the same healing you used in the last game because Dracula biting fools doesn't really cut it. If they really wanted you to play as a Vampire why didn't they just have you play as Alucard as you did in Symphony or that other part of Mirror of Fate? Alucard already plays better than his father does in the DLC and has a more interesting set of skills. \n\nDid they think that people really liked Gabriel so much as a character that they wouldn't want to move on to another Belmont? Perhaps continue the narrative in another way that doesn't include reusing an original character you made specifically for your reboot? It doesn't really even feel all that Castlevania like, really, outside of a few name drops and shout outs from previous games. \n\nAnd for a game with as much padding as Lords of Shadow 2, it sure as hell is rushed at the end. And by that I mean it just kind of ends, it's all over and then Dracula goes to take a nap. I'm not kidding, that's how it ends. Roll credits. I've watched bum fights with better closure than that. \n\nShould you play Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2: The Reckoning: Fury Road? \n\nThis is actually hard. Because the game has a really strong start but then kind of fades away at the half way point. A lot of plot points are just kind of shoved aside or hand waved before the game comes to an end and it drags on just long enough for the combat to become frustrating and boring. Just like my sex life. \n\nBut on the other hand, it's nowhere near as offensive as other reboots like, lets say, DmC, or my sex life. I just feel like it could have maybe cut out a lot of the fat and busy work and focused on it's strongest point. \n\nJust like my sex life. \n\n\nLOS2 is getting pass, but just barely, I would get it while it's on sale at five bucks or less. It's not great, but it's nowhere near as offensive as a lot of other reviewers made it out ot be. If you absolutely NEED a vampire game right at this moment, though? You can get the Legacy of Kain series for much cheaper.\n\nFortressmania 2: Kings of Shade gets 3 badly voiced sections from Symphony of the night out of 6. \n\nDracula backwards is Alucard.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation", "timestamp_created": 1458269115, "timestamp_updated": 1458269329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502224743366241455", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21830348": {"recommendationid": "21830348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022385974", "num_games_owned": 1422, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1426443751}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't say that it is best slasher.

And most of them call it inferior to the series or just simply say it's mediocre. This game made me to stop listening to these reviewers. I didn't really want to buy it, but I fell in love so hard with the story they presented in LoS1 and MoF I needed to know the conclusion and I felt like I wouldn't be satisfied if I just simply watched it on YouTube. So here I am amazed by this fantastic game...\n\n[h1]+Combat[/h1]\nIf you are coming from LoS1 (if not then please play it before this one) you already know the basics. They basically tightened it up, made it much more responsive and fluid then it was. There are new moves and combos, too. And this time we get a much more \"user-friendly\" skill page then in LoS1.\n\n[h1]+Story and narrative[/h1]\nThese were the second biggest positives I encountered in this game (the 1st one is ofc the combat). Of course there are plot twists, and most of them hit hard (you know it's good when your jaw drops). There are many interesting characters; there will be some who you'll hate and many who you'll love. It made me care about a side-character in ~20 mins and when it turned out he may die I felt really bad. But the ultimate peak for me was the Toymaker. It is that kind of rare time in gaming when a good story and a well-imagined narrative meets. I won't spoil it for you, you have to experience it by yourself. And most importantly it got rid of that bad narrative element that they used in the 1st game, which made up every little thing so dramatic that it felt like it just changed the whole world, but in reality it had no impact on anything.\n\n[h1]+Camera[/h1]\nThankfully they got rid of the fixed camera presented in the first game. Don't get me wrong, fixed camera can work pretty well (like the old Resident Evils), but a high-speed action came certainly doesn't need it. Surprisingly it's also dynamic. So like when you're just walking, it comes quite close to you (kind of like RE4). But during combat it goes much further so you can see better.\n\n[h1]+Platforming[/h1]\nJust like the combat, they kept it and made it better. Thanks to the accurate controls it's much more fluid and if you failed a lot of times during platforming in LoS1 (like me) than fear no more, it's much better. A little bat swarm will always indicate where you can jump to and during climbing you can (optionally) highlight where you can climb to.\n\n[h1]+Soundtrack[/h1]\nI know it's subjective, but it's still amazing. It's not that kind of music that you will download and listen to regularly. It just fits so well the game, that it greatly boosts its already good atmosphere. It's epic and beautiful at the same time. And when it needs to be, then it's emotional.\n\n[h1]+Bosses[/h1]\nThey are pretty diverse and just enough challanging.\n\n[h1]+Design[/h1]\nThe graphics are good, but the design is the thing that's important. When you're in the castle dimension it's simply breathtaking. Every little detail in every little painting and statue and thing in the castle...Everything feels just in place, that I risk that even in 8-bit it would still look beautiful. Now about the modern dimension...For a city design it looks good, but I couldn't wait to get back into the castle from the modern world.\n\nAnd the list could go on and on (good portray of Dracula, references, etc.), but let's talk about some not that good aspects of the game.\n\n[h1]+/-Stealth segments[/h1]\nNow this is the most criticized part...I don't hate them but neither love them. It's all about if you mind being taken away from the fast-paced gameplay and use your brain and patience a little bit. But the biggest issue with these is the fact that mostly there's only one way to do them! But people hate it like it's all over the place but you have to be stealthy like 5 times in this game...But I loved the parts when I could be a rat, it still really gave me the feels of being smarter and more powerful then my enemies.\n\n[h1]-No detailed map[/h1]\nYou get 2 kinds of map in this game: one that shows the districts and one that shows your surrindings.\n\n[h1]-Rare bugs[/h1]\nI encountered two kind of biggie bugs during my playthrough and I looked up if anyone else has encountered them and I didn't find anyone, so they must be really rare.\n\n\n[u]In conclusion[/u]: As a fan of Hack 'n' slash games and the first two LoS games I have to say that this is a must have. The game is very well optimized, so no worries about that. It has it's bad moments, but they're still mediocre at worst. \nI love this even more than the 1st one actually. The story and drama feels kind of weak if you don't really care about it, but once you start to think about what just happened you'll be amazed. Don't listen to the critics (probably Konami just didn't pay for good reviews), this game deserves much more than that (8/10 minimum).\n\nP.S.: I feel like it's needless to say about this kind of games, but a controller is strongly recommended (I played with a Steam Controller and it was very comfortable and precise).", "timestamp_created": 1455329638, "timestamp_updated": 1455361903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724075555801391602", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21087775": {"recommendationid": "21087775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095425411", "num_games_owned": 1473, "num_reviews": 217, "playtime_forever": 2372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2372, "last_played": 1455056233}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, after playing and seeing such a beautiful story as Lords of Shadow's and Mirror of Fate's, Lords of Shadow 2 didn't meet my expectations.

It's not a very short story but if I could've done the same in first one, I'm sure it would've took me no less than 12 hours. Stealth sections are terrible. They were pain in the ass. I can understand that stealth section which you had to do in the beginning but the other ones were really unneceserry. I mean he is Dracula and he is immortal. Why would he prefer stealth to action? I don't even wanna talk about that stealth section just before Agreus boss fight. And that ending... well after seeing beautiful endings of the other games, this ending was a disappointment. Long story short, gameplay is OK but story?

I definitely liked this game, and do wish there was a third ready to queue up.\n\nOverall it was a great game, with amazing visuals, great story, and an amazing soundtrack. However, it was an interesting mix of strengths and weaknesses, some being very different than the 1st game. I would say that its 1st strength is how powerfully it started, I was drawn into the story immediately and even felt goosebumps as the 1st cut scene gracefully sets the stage of what Gabriel has become, complete in its gothic splendor of visuals, music, and of being loathed by the locals and probably even by himself. It\u2019s the type of vampire that I wish could replace the entire Twilight series. If you\u2019ve read the Anne Rice novels, I noticed many details that were alike.\n\nThe 1st hour was a blast, then come an hour of wondering if this game was going to turn horrible, followed with an awkward climb back to awesome, and luckily it stayed there til\u2019 the end of the game.\n\nThe bad: There were many things that weren\u2019t explained in the 2nd hour which made the story seem artificial, luckily everything started making sense as you put the pieces together yourself, that\u2019s if you didn\u2019t bail in the meantime and read every piece of lore you found. Often there wasn\u2019t enough of a visual clue to know what to do next, I found myself running through the same halls over and over again, trying to find that one thing I missed and now I can\u2019t move on. Finally, the final boss is Satan, and you never really fought him, and then he was \u201cdead\u201d. Game over, time for DLC-expansion. Just so awkward.\n\nThe end result is we have lots of 10/10 experiences mixed with subpar experiences, leaving you wanting more if you made it far enough to understand its style, but also hoping they\u2019re learning from their mistakes and that they figure they\u2019re shit out.

Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 was an excellent sequel and just as good action adventure game.\nSo, this game tells what happened to Gabriel Belmont after the events of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. Needles to say, [b]there are spoilers ahead[/b] and if you haven't played the first one, I have to ask why first and then I have to warn you that you should probably stop reading if you care for the story of the game. If you only care about the gameplay, keep on reading.\nAlso, what I would like to mention is that I will be comparing this game a lot to the first one since they are very similar and I already wrote a review on the eLords of Shadow, so if you don't like that, you should prolly read another review.\n\nWhat I like about the sequel is that it keeps to its roots. Lords of Shadow 2 feels and plays very familiar, almost the same as the first game, but its just refreshing and innovative enough not to be a copy-paste of the original while still having that same good feeling of the first one. The main difference this time, story vise is that, instead of a holy warrior from the Brotherhood of Light, you are actually the Prince of Darkness, a powerful immortal vampiric being who, bitter and hateful because of how god \"rewarded\" him for his services and heroic acts, finds comfort and joy in terrorizing the mankind. Oh, and he goes by the name of Dracula :P\n\nAs for the gameplay, it still maintains that fast combat of the previous game, with a bit of tactics and different approaches to different enemy types but its a little bit changed and the fact that I can't really pick a favorite says a lot about them both. What I can say is that, the main difference now is, instead of having one set of moves with the Combat Cross(now called Shadow Whip) and two magic types to infuse it with, you now wield two additional weapons. A Void Sword to replace your Light Magic which heals you when you hit enemies with it, just like the Light Magic infused Combat Cross did, and heavy hitting Chaos Gauntlets that deal massive damage and break enemy armor upon impact, which replaces your Shadow Magic. These two slight changes make the combat a bit different but still try to keep it familiar. Other than that you can expect almost complete lack of stagger when attacking enemies. This can take a bit of getting used to especially if you play the game right after you finish the first one but still, it's not a big deal and after just and hour or so, you should get completely used to it. However, in terms of challenge, I have to admit that, the first game was much better since Lords of Shadow 2 feel very easy even when played for the first time on the highest(highest possible for the first playthrough) difficulty. There are challenges, yes, but they are more of a \"figure out how to do it and its easy\" rather than \"I know how to do it but I simply can't do it due to its difficulty\". I guess what I'm trying to say is that the challenges are more of a combat puzzles rather than combat skill mastery tests. Hope that makes sense to whoever is reading.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that, instead of a level based progression system, we now have a big, connected map with zoning transitions, (kinda like old DMC games but with much more freedom). Now, I won't say its open world because that term is used way too often nowadays and gamers consider every non linear game with a hub like world design to be an open world game. This is not the case. While you are indeed free to roam the streets of the city/halls of the castle, within playable boarders, as you see fit, and backtrack whenever you feel like it, it is still a very linear game with linear progression system, but in case of this game, it's not a bad thing. Addition of a dynamic camera is also great and lets you take cool screenshots, look around this beautifully crafted world and just appreciate the artful and detailed environment that this game has to offer. As I said in the review of the original Lords of Shadow, playing it simply for its beautiful scenery is worth it!\n\nAll in all, this was a great game. I really took my time with it and tried to enjoy it as much as possible and kinda felt sad when I realized that its over. Gameplay time can be extended by doing challenges and trying to collect all the collectible items like upgrade gems, concept art and game lore scrolls and also by playing the Revelations DLC(which is fairly short TBH but a very good and quite different experience). So it should be clear by pretty clear that I will, 100% recommend this game to every action/adventure game lover, everyone who enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow as well as everyone who appreciates stunning visuals, detailed and beautiful game world.", "timestamp_created": 1453049817, "timestamp_updated": 1453050013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20491611": {"recommendationid": "20491611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019884826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1819, "last_played": 1452623093}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good!", "timestamp_created": 1452623514, "timestamp_updated": 1452623514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20384250": {"recommendationid": "20384250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998530793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 3369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1445, "last_played": 1453049326}, "language": "english", "review": "well, this game is one of could have been a great game.

Mejora el combate de forma sustancial y, a grandes rasgos, es mucho m\u00e1s divertido que el primero.\n\nEs est\u00e9ticamente bastante bonito, aunque ning\u00fan portento gr\u00e1fico. Eso s\u00ed, funciona en m\u00e1quinas muy antiguas sin problemas. La m\u00fasica es de gran calidad y el doblaje tambi\u00e9n es loable, salvo el personaje de Alucard que, en mi opini\u00f3n, es m\u00e1s soso que un huevo sin sal.\n\nSi el juego es bueno, entonces, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 ha sido tan machacado por la cr\u00edtica? Bueno, es discutible y, en el fondo, no llego a entenderlo muy bien. Es cierto que Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 no es ninguna maravilla pero, dentro de su g\u00e9nero, supera claramente a otros como DmC, el cual le saca la friolera de 27 puntos en metacritic (nada merecidos, por cierto). Es cierto que a\u00f1ade fases olvidables, especialmente las conocidas vulgarmente como de \"sigilo\", que, sin ser especialmente malas, sencillamente sobran y el juego estar\u00eda mejor sin ellas. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso, no tiene ning\u00fan fallo destacable por lo que el 58 que tiene en metacritic es, a todas luces, un ejemplo de c\u00f3mo la prensa especializada a veces se ceba contra un juego en concreto o contra un estudio. En este caso, pienso que es contra el estudio completo porque Mirror of Fate tambi\u00e9n fue aplastado, a pesar de ser un juego competente.\n\nVolviendo al juego en s\u00ed que, como le\u00e9is, s\u00ed merece la pena (aunque no sea una maravilla), cabe destacar que la historia est\u00e1 a la altura de la del resto de los juegos de la saga. Es decir, que es bastante floja. Pero bueno, si juegas a videojuegos para disfrutar de grandes historias desde luego deber\u00edas hac\u00e9rtelo mirar (por supuesto, haberlas las hay pero no es el foco de inter\u00e9s principal de un videojuego, obviamente).\n\nEn definitiva, un Hack &  slash (de mundo abierto), lineal eso s\u00ed, muy divertido pero con algunas partes que sobran. Mejora, y mucho, el sistema de combate del original y, en general, todo \u00e9l se desarrolla como un juego mucho m\u00e1s org\u00e1nico y pulido. Una peque\u00f1a gema en bruto del g\u00e9nero, sin llegar a la altura de los referentes, como Bayonetta, pero superando holgadamente a los falsos profetas como DmC.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1448990111, "timestamp_updated": 1448990111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19399493": {"recommendationid": "19399493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021227526", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7534, "last_played": 1683389736}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si el primero fue bueno, este lo es aun mas.\n\nPobre gabriel, su historia es tragica y feroz a la vez...\n\nJugabilidad 10\nHistoria 10\nMusica 20 !!!\n\nA que esperas para tenerlo??.", "timestamp_created": 1448923503, "timestamp_updated": 1448923503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609040379524230957", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19370047": {"recommendationid": "19370047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015007645", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 359, "playtime_forever": 1332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1484127488}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok so the game is beast !!!!!!!!\n\nFirst of all the graphics are good, battles are intense, the story is sick.\n\nGabriel and Trevor(Alucard) wow just wow if you played first game youl love Lords of shadow 2.\n\nTo be more specific Gabriel aka Dracul (The dragon) has lost all his humanity, but something happens :O.\n\nI am no longer Gabriel woman.

The story of the main game was interesting and the art style is fantastic, but the gameplay and combat system actually got quite annoying near the end, when trying to get all the collectables.\n\nPart of the problem is the level design which is a non-obvious corridor, where areas are separated by a multitude of sluice-gates, elevators, decontamination rooms, etc. It's constant delaying and unnecessary gratuituous animations which get boring rather quick. It takes a very long time to navigate between areas and respawning mobs often prevent you from leaving before you dealt with them, even though you have nothing else to gain from killing them. Once I got the final secret collectible, it took me something like 20 minutes to get to the area where you trigger the final boss encoounter.\n\nUnlike the Arkham games where collecting additional content is enjoyable and adds to the experience, the design of the levels actually takes enjoyment away. I would recommend doing a story driven run and avoiding backtracking for collectables and challenges.\n\nThe music is OK on it's own, but doesn't fill inspired as much as the art style and often doesn't really fit the environemt or add much to the game.\n\nThe PC port is pretty bad. You pretty much need a controller, as all the button prompts are laid out for a 360 pad. It's much worse than the first game which you could play with KB/Mouse perfectly fine. The game runs well and stable, but it's absolutely impossible to tab out. You need to trigger an automatic save, which often happens between areas, but isn't reliable, and quit the game.\n\nLastly, something that bugged me personally.

Game lacks collectibles, gear to improve you status, weapons, etc\n\nGameplay its ok but having so many attack combos can be too overwhelming, most of the time you'll use only use 2 or 3 combos for the whip and sword, I barely used the shadow claws (except when required by the game). It might be my bad memory but I found myself checking too many times how to make that cool looking combo I just unlocked and not so much time using it cause you can beat the game without it. \n\nControls are fine but a few times they can get very frustrating, camera its also a bit frustrating since there is no way to lock your attacks to an enemy and the game will try to \"auto aim\" your attacks to the closest enemy but always the one you don't mean to attack. \n\nCollectibles are a bit boring, scrolls that try to complete the story and tell you parts of it that are not currently happening in game. You (Dracula) feel like the less powerful Dracula from the saga and the stealth sections of the game make no sense for a Castlevania game. \n\nOverall its a good game, not so much a good Castlevania. Definitely an improvement over the first LoS. \n\nI'll only recommend it if you don't mind a short game with almost no replay value and very little exploration like in past Castlevania games and you are a \"true\" Castlevania Fan \n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1446111720, "timestamp_updated": 1446112040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18724095": {"recommendationid": "18724095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039299380", "num_games_owned": 1159, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1595, "last_played": 1447535066}, "language": "english", "review": "Really i don't know what to say about this game.

Decent graphics and responsive gameplay, but heavily mired by a flawed combat system. Still perhaps worth getting if on sale for the mindless smash enemies combat. Great voice acting from the main actors, but less should have been put in to the voice acting and instead spent on developing a real story that respects the franchise mythology. Big thumbs up, the scourge of modern games, QTE's, can be disabled permanently.\n\n[b]Long Version:[/b]\n[u]Story[/u]\nAwful to put it simply, it's a train wreck. Castevania is at its heart a conquer the castle and kill Dracula game, this \"re-origin\" story series has just wrecked that with taking away everything that is Castlevania in exchange for trying to dramatise the backstory of Dracula to make him a tragic hero; with an overwhelming judeo-christian mythology shoehorned in to dominate the mythological aspects whereas previously the series was only very loosely tied to any particular mythology. The whole story was just 'Ugh, it's the devil is the bad guy story, how original...push that religion on us even more'.We are meant to believe the city is built on the ruins of Castlevania (dont even get me started on that nuke effect taht was shown large enough it would have destroyed several ENTIRE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), and the devils kids would use that spot to try bringing about their dad's return...ofcourse. Use the site your ancient enemy is at his most powerful as your base of operations.....yep, perfect sense. \n\nMajor plot holes exist *spoiler* e.g. Zobek could have read Drac's mind to discover his deception unless he lost his memories, but Zobek couldnt realise that his lieutenant had been replaced by Alucard by, oh I dont know...reading his thoughts....yeah, sure. I call bullshit. \n\nThe deal with Castlevania itself is never really clarified, is the castle real and split off from the modern era dimension, or just a figment of Drac's fragmented mind....Major problems arise with the story regardless of which it is.\nThe story is jsut a cavalcade of bad ideas. \n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nTight controls that function decently for getting around and in combat. Probably the aspect of the game that is most positive. The grappling aspects are a disappointment, see that you can only use fixed grapple points to get around, instead of simply making anything that is like a ledge able to be hung from, and the game is loaded with invisible walls which is hugely disappointing for exploration. The game is heavily walled in and you will find that you are limited to very selective above street level areas, and street level, if you want to go explore over the rooftops of the city like some real badass vampire god, forget it, go buy a copy of Batman arkham city, a game which did city exploration properly.\n\n[u]Combat[/u]\nThe combat is broken down into mobs using 3 types of attacks: range, melee blockable, and melee/range unblockable.\nYou have 3 weapons, a whip, sword adn claws. All with varying utility, the whip is a mid range weapon that is usable for building up 'focus' which when you hit 100% then attacking enemies will cause them to drop little gems that can be absorbed for magic power for your sword or claws, this only works with the whip though so you will spend a lot of time using it. Void sword burns magic and leeches life on hit, while the claws also burn magic but deal high damage and destroying shields and armour. The shields and armour shit was a terrible implementation, mobs can stand there blocking forever if you dont destroy the shield or armour, forcing you to use the real core combat mechanic, \"timed counters\" where you hit L2 at the right time in their swing to block an attack and stun them for a second and smash away, this builds huge focus so you can get your claws powered up to break the shields, alternateively you can somersault over attacking monsters and smack them in the back, whatever works. Unfortunately unless you are good at it, you are fucked, having spent significant time playing dark souls it was piss easy to time compared to parries in DS, but often if you are using the void sword or claws the actual enemy attacks get obscured by the flashy animations of the glowing weapons that you dont see them, this is a shit implementation really forcing play where you dont really engage upclose with magic weapons you mainly use a couple of specific moves then go back to the whip.\n\nThere is though a mechanic of \"unblockable attacks\", which is a huge flaw in the combat and you are forced to dodge, these attacks are indicated, but seems like lazy design, especially when you come to the bosses who their attacks are pretty much all unblockables or range attacks other than usually 1 blockable melee attack, this menas you can spend boss fights frustrated and magic starved as the range attacks keep you away, and the unblockables are chained so often the fight is 30 seconds of dodging and waiting to get one block and some melee attacks, absorb some magic and hit them a couple times for reasonable damage as the whip does fuck all. In this way the game lends itself to securing really only a couple of the actual skills for the sword and claws to 'gg no re' your way through the game, namely: Whirlwind for the Void Sword, and Flame Claws for the Chaos Claws. Both expensive to use but when you see them in action it's pretty much a no brainer to use them. You may simply discover the other method which is boss cheese and basically forces you to pop relics such as ensnared demon then go crazy with the inifnite magic while timer counts down (spam those flame claw attacks, for real, ~300 damage per hit on everything), then when it runs out pop the dragon emblem and finish the boss off, takes about 30secs per boss fight, even on PoD difficulty and is almost zero effort (you may have to use the void sword to freeze bosses to spam them hard with the claws).\n\nSkipping combat and bypassing trash is often impossible, as pretty much every enemy has some sort of range attack intended to knock you off a hang point if you try to grapple away. Some monsters (the wraith type guys at the end msotly) have ridiculous bullshit attacks that you cannot do anythign to avoid and hit extremelyhard, as noted, the wraiths, tey have a lightning attack that will hit you from 50 metres away, is practically instant hit and dodging it not really possible as by the time you see it, it is hitting you, and there is no way to defend against it other than popping the sword or claws shield magic. As these creatures fight in packs of 4-6 generally, you can imagine, Drac at max HP has about 300 hp, and lightning hit's for 40 each time....6 of them will kill you in about 3 secs, faster than you can close the distance to get to them sometimes....\n\nAlso, finally, the camera is terrible, even with \"combat assisted\", it is awful and seems like it tries to blind spot enemies, and the trash monster scripts seem they are intent on getting behind the camera when they can to hit you in the back. This because truly frstrating when their seems to be no 'free camera' even when assist is off and the camera constantly tries to centre in ways that make no sense and you often spend as much time trying to correct the camera so you can see wtf is happening as actually paying attention.\n\n[u]DLC[/u]\nRevelations has good puzzles, but disappointingly cruel end boss fight due to endless unblockable attacks and mechanics that dont work with the camera (teleporting behind and unblockable charge).\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\nIs the game worth buying? Not at full price, it seems like an effort to just milk some more money out of the Castlevania fans who are holding on to hope that each release will be the next Symphony of the Night.

The way the last game ended, the trailer involving the castle siege, the unique universe and artistic style the game takes place in; how could they go wrong?\n\nAnd at first, it seemed like they'd made another great game (just like the first, which also came out to muted-to-mediocre reception but would prove to be a stellar experience). Even beyond the introduction sequence, with the lackluster stealth, linearity and meagerness of the city, it stilled promised to be much more, at least to me.\n\nFor as long as I could, I held onto the concept that, at worst, it could be a poorly executed great concept; it kept sliding further and further away from that great concept ideal, to be expected of something coming from such a high plateu with too much expectation; a fault of my own if anything.\n\nWhat was dreadful about this game, however, was not its inability to match the former game's great expectations: it was unbelievably poor direction the plot lurches towards the mid-to-end of the game. In almost complete contrast to Lords of Shadow, which started off slow, picked up speed and took off into orbit: this game started off in orbit, slowed down and instead of just falling to the ground, somehow fell into a wormhole that took it straight into the jaws of a black hole where it went full-on Event Horizon.\n\nGive this game a massive miss; play the first and imagine what could have been, don't make the mistake that I did and assume the reviews were just a repeat of the first on release, of fans of Castlevania of old and this game just didn't live up to their rose-tinted rememberance of easiers times, and those who refused to do anything but accuse it of being a God of War clone, when it was so much more.\n\nIn short, this game represents a tragedy in what could have been, of which I am saddened to have been a part of.", "timestamp_created": 1443201441, "timestamp_updated": 1443201619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18162546": {"recommendationid": "18162546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963375232", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 725, "last_played": 1443032805}, "language": "english", "review": "This game clocked in just under roughly 15 hours or so.

I'm also quite fond of the openness, allowing you to go back at virtually any time to explore, collect items, etc.\n\n[b]+Graphics[/b]\nVisually, the game is beautiful, and there's plenty of areas in the game that are simply stunning. Found myself taking in the view more than once.\n\n[b]+Combat[/b]\nThe mastery system rewards using different skills to enhance your weapons' power. Each of Dracula's weapons have their own specific use, similar to the first game, but are more than just enchanting your whip with magic this time around, giving you entirely different movesets for each weapon. Also you get to drink your enemies' blood.\n\n[b]+Music[/b]\nThe music of the first game was good, but it lacked any sort of memorability. The music in Lords of Shadow 2 is much better, although you'll hear a lot of the same tracks over and over. Somewhat of a hit and miss here, but a majority of the music is good enough that this is more of a pro than a con.\n\n[b]+Pacing[/b]\nThere was a lot of nothing in between the major events of the first game; the pacing was just kinda crap, in all honesty. There always seems to be something going on in LoS 2, it's easier to feel like you're actually doing something rather than roaming through some ruins without much of a goal, which was a major problem throughout the first third of the first game.\n\n[b]+Gabriel is More Interesting[/b]\nI was completely incapable of feeling any sort of sympathy for Gabriel in the first game. He was a cardboard cutout of a character devoid of most emotion. In this one, however, he's a little more interesting simply because he is fairly PO'ed. Also he's the dark lord, he has a reputation to live up to. Thankfully, he does.\n\n[b]+Environment[/b]\nAs previously mentioned in the Graphics, the game is beautiful. The environment is also essential for this as well; for the areas that they created, the world is detailed and interesting. Areas are distinguishable from other places, and the concept of building a city on the ruined foundations of Dracula's castle is, honestly, quite interesting. It creates a distinctive gothic-type city that still seems reminiscent of Dracula's castle pre-ruin when you have opportunities to overlook the city.\n\n[b]+Lore[/b]\nWhile the story blows (more on that later), it does have some intriguing lore to find, some of which indicating that the people of Castlevania City are fully aware that monsters and magic are a thing. It's definitely a turn from the original Castlevania games and other games such as Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines where hiding the supernatural from the world was of the utmost importance. In Lords of Shadow 2, I find it intriguing that they accept, and are even fascinated by, the fact that there used to be werewolves, vampires, and even the siege against Dracula are merely documented as history and treated as such. Their history is as natural to them as our own is to us. This is certainly something I'd love to see expanded on in future games- maybe not Lords of Shadow, but other franchises where the supernatural is merely embraced as a part of history rather than hidden from the world for safety. \n\n\n[h1] Cons[/h1]\n\n[b]-It's Not Castlevania[/b]\nYou can add the title, give the characters the names, and everything else, but it still doesn't make it a Castlevania game. Let alone it's horridly out of place with half of the game taking place in a modern day city. To be perfectly honest, it feels more like Darksiders than Castlevania due to the themes throughout the game. The heart and spirit of the series is completely absent from Lords of Shadow, hence I only ever refer to it as Lords of Shadow.\n\n[b]-Story[/b]\nI find it ironic that they rebooted Castlevania with an intended focus on story, and then ended up dropping the ball. The first game had an okay, albeit not-very-original story with Satan having Necron Syndrome and popping up literally out of nowhere at the end. Mirror of Fate was an atrocity of a game and explained jack squat. Similar problems are in LoS 2- Gabriel often finds himself back in what appears to be either the past of his memories of his castle. Honestly have no idea because it's [i]never explained at all[/i]. His memories/past/whatever-the-fudge-is-going-on also has zero relevance to what's going on, aside from getting back his powers because reasons. There's also some Resident Evil bullcrap going on where the citizens are mutated by some demonic virus; this is so out of place it hurts. Everything else is fairly easy to follow, and there's some interesting things that do happen throughout the game, but it's nothing to write home about. Story is honestly not a good reason to play this game, and if it's what you're looking for, turn the other way.\n\n[b]Gabriel forgot how to Open Doors[/b]\nFound a door? Guess what? You're going to have to pull a switch to open it. He's only a superhuman Prince of Darkness, godforbid he opens a metal door on his own. There's a lot of this crap that just slows the game down needlessly, especially since it takes [i]forever[/i] for said doors to open. This game was made in 2014, this is rather inexcusable.\n\n[b]-Enemies can be Annoying[/b]\nThere's a guard/perfect guard mechanic in the game, which is quite useful. Unfortunately, roughly 50% of the time, the enemies perform an unblockable attack, which renders guarding a lot less useful than you'd like it to be. Also there's plenty of times where I simply wanted to get somewhere and didn't want to fight. Going places often involve climbing. Guess what? [i]Every freaking enemy in the game can use some kind of projectile to knock you down,[/i] often forcing you to fight enemies when you don't want to. This is often infuriating when you merely want to explore for upgrades and other hidden items.\n\n[b]-Stealth Segments[/b]\nOkay, I get that he's weak and whatnot at the beginning, but this just seems so unnecessary. Especially since the stealth segment with Agreus is absolutely infuriating.\n\n[b]-Bugs[/b]\nEvery now and then, characters may \"say something\" without sound- basically the sound file for the line they're supposed to say doesn't play (no subtitles either, which is even more aggravating). I've had other instances where the objective was the last objective I just did, and wasn't up to date. Worst of all, I've had it crash on me for no reason once.\n\n\n[h1] Final Verdict[/h1]\nWhile the story is laughable, the stealth is pointless, and bugs are afoot, the game is actually quite fun. I do not recommend it at full price; wait for a Steam sale to get it because $40 is a bit much for some of the frustrations of the game. Gameplay-wise, it's pretty good, despite the annoying gameplay oversights.

Without any spoilers, a lot has happened since Gabriel Belmont originally set out to kill the Lords of Shadow and Do Good Things.  And this is a worthy addition to that story.  But what we see here is literally centuries after everything that happens in the other two games, and that gap feels kinda weird.  I suppose it's all explained via flashbacks and things, but even still.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 improves on anything the first game did that needed improving, while not messing with 95% of the things about that game that worked great already.  And it THANKFULLY brings back one continuous world that you can explore as you see fit.  Physically walking back to an area with a new power to get a thing you saw but couldn't reach makes sense; selecting an earlier chapter from a menu in the first game, and running into characters and even bosses that are already DEAD... not so much.\n\nThat said, the tone of the two games is much different.  This one doesn't ride on Hope so much.  Some might like the darker story, but personally I thought that it was a little somber and depressing at times.  It was all well told, and Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart knocked their roles out of the park, but I think that the darker universe just kinda took a toll on things.  We'll be visiting different environments, but gone are the sunny paths, baked desert-scapes, and clear skied mountain fortresses of the first game.  Here you get plenty of variety, with stormy locales, night cityscapes, fiery caverns, frozen mountainsides... but you'll never be doing anything during the day.  That's understandable, as Story Reasons require you to get everything done in one night.  And hell, Castlevania games usually all happen indoors, in one night, IN Dracula's Castle, so I can't fault it too much for grim, darkness.\n\nPowers work better in this game than the first.  Alternate weapons/magic/sub-weapons, all that stuff is great.  In the first game, I found myself doing everything with the whip, and never bothering to use my daggers, fairies, or dark crystal.  I used Holy Water to deal with BS waves that got boring, but when I used sub weapons or items here, it was all strategic and useful.  Especially in the Kleidos Challenges.\n\nKleidos Challenges are unlockable (and thankfully optional) challenges that put you in a circular area with various enemies.  And there are three objectives, different to each challenge.  You might get, say, don't break any shields, don't use the Void Sword, and don't recover health by any means during the fight.  There's always the same 4th objective: do all three in the same run.  I did more than half of these before I got annoyed, and then just stopped.  For the super-hardcore, this is your kind of thing.\n\nCollectables are EVERYWHERE!  Kinda literally.  I've found 3 or 4 things in the SAME ROOM, sometimes I needed different powers for each... and sometimes when you find the first collectable, it's actually only half-way down a secret path, and going just a little farther will find you a hand-hold to climb or sneak or do something to get to another.  I liked that, using one power-up as a distraction so you'll think you've got it and miss out on the next one.\n\nSpeaking of those collectible powerups, the come from two major things: Pain Boxes and Piles of Sacrifice.  The Pain Box is a box with a mouth that cuts or stabs your wrist when you stick your hand in, but then you get a Health, Void, or Chaos shard to raise your HP or Void or Chaos magics!  The Pile of Sacrifice is a little statue of a dude with a big curved sword over his shoulder, and you slice your wrist on it, bleed a LOT into the bowl beneath it, and then the bowl gives you either a capacity upgrade for 5 of your 6 relics or a Kleidos Nail, to get them Kleidos Challenges unlocked.  Don't worry if hunting for all this sounds annoying: you can pick up or shop for Dodo Eggs, and using one will mark the nearest collectible on your map.  It was fun for me hunting these down, though I did Dodo around... 15 of the game's nearly 200, just because I was at the end and wanted to get everything before I hit the last area.\n\nSome people say that the bosses here aren't as good as the first game.  True, for the most part, but at the same time not true.  They're very different.  The first game's bosses were huge and awesome, but had some HIGHLY scripted ways to beat them, and most ended in a series of Quick Timing Events.  Here it's more a real fight, relying on your gameplay skills.  QTEs have been dialed back A LOT from the first game.  Lords of Shadow 1 must have something like 800% as many as this one does.\n\nSo I'll conclude here saying that this is a solid game with a cool story, and voice acting from two guys who do very good work.  Definitely, without question worth a buy on sale, and honestly even worth a buy at normal price if you're into Castlevania stuff.  But as a caveat, you might want to get the first game and Mirror of Fate HD first, as this is one epic overarching story, and though they do a pretty good recap at the beginning here, you want to be attached to the characters and the world first.  It makes this much more powerful.\n\nHere's hoping they make the intended third and final game, and round everything out as incredibly as I hope.", "timestamp_created": 1438200580, "timestamp_updated": 1438200580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17283497": {"recommendationid": "17283497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011676264", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1346, "last_played": 1438184009}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrific game, i would rate it as 8.5/10.

Time to see if I can put into somewhat coherent paragraph or two as to why that's the case.\n\nLet's start off by saying I was one of the people who enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow for what it was \u2013 not necessarily a creatively original masterpiece, but a game of astounding production values, competent writing and tight narrative punctuated by stellar voice work and lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it was a very meaty game which lead to some even saying it was too long for its own good. Fast forward to sequel and you can see it basically falters in each of these categories.\n\nInterestingly enough game seems to swing between two polar opposites with its visuals because on one hand you have this classic Castlevania look comprised of foreboding yet mystical gothic castle to romp through, as well as its assorted menagerie of beasties to but heads with and solve painfully few puzzles compared to the first game, but on the other you have to contend with extremely bland modern-day warehouses and science laboratories ad nauseam alongside some fairly uninspired enemies ranging from more classical demons and Satanists to, what really should've been more interesting that ended up, futuristic soldiers and cybernetic abominations roaming the streets. But honestly, it's this weird disjointed narrative that undoes the game the most in my mind because you can clearly tell there was meant to be more there instead of just going from A to B and meandering in-between retreading locations with nothing but brief radio contacts from time to time. And lastly \u2013 game is simply short compared to the first one and that probably ties into my previous point. Rumors abound regarding game's troubled development were apparently well founded. \n\nThat's not to say game is bad because, as you will have most likely noticed despite my continued rambling on regarding its negatives, this is marked as a positive review overall. It's still Lords of Shadow and if you liked the original you'll probably like this considering you can overlook its weak story. Gameplay feels familiar and skippable QTEs are god-sent, both of which are points in game's favor for me, not to mention combat and item system was expanded and enemy variety despite their designs actually means you'll end up facing quite a bit of different behaviors. Story establishes the mood very early on as one of Dracula's somber and more resigned journey, one profoundly personal despite all other events that unfold over the course of the game. Had it been properly fleshed out and Robert Carlyle's more subdued performance given time to develop, occasional hamfisted melodrama notwithstanding, it would've been a much, much better final product. I also heard some nay saying about mandatory stealth sections in the game to which I say it's about time to drop hand-holding. Barring for one section involving leaves and crazed Satyr these were a welcome diversion for me and fitting considering MC's condition story-wise.\n\nOne last caveat I feel should be posted is that playing the original game and Mirror of Fate is recommended before tackling the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1438093938, "timestamp_updated": 1438093938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.849169254302978516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17241915": {"recommendationid": "17241915", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994852092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1439061092}, "language": "english", "review": "Very faithful to the Castlevania series.

Both settings provide a nice contrast with each other and are fun to explore\n\n+ The first major difference from the original is the ability to control the camera as opposed to having a fixed camera in the first game. \n\n+ The second major change is all the levels are interconnected with each other. This provides for a much more immersive and seamless experience with gameplay. \n\n+ Combat is more refined than the original and just as fun. You have light magic that does less damage but heals you whenever you damage an enemy and chaos magic that does significantly more damage but is slower and has less range. Effectively dodging and switching between your magic meters is fun and engaging. If you played the first game, the combat should offer little surprise to you. One key difference is by using attacks over and over again you can increase your mastery of a certain weapons making them stronger. \n\n+ Boss battles have always been a highlight for this series and this game is no exception. Bosses are unique, well designed and will require you to use all your techniques in battle to defeat them. \n\n+ the game has plenty of collectables scattered throughout the world\n\n+ The game features 16 optional challenges to further extend your game time. Each challenge has a series of objectives that has to be completed in order to complete the challenge. \n\n+ option to disable quicktime events \n\n\nThe Average\n\nThe story is not awful but it didn't really do much either. It doesn't help that most of the dialogue spoken by the villains is bad. \n\nThis game has some REALLY annoying enemies that will test your patience\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nFor some odd reason the developers decided to include stealth sections in the game. I like stealth games and I like it when developers try to mix up the gameplay but this was just a bad effort. The stealth sections feel very out of place and are not always clear in what you have to do making for some really frustrating trial and error. It also feels very odd that you play a badass destroying most enemies in your path only to reach a section in the level where you have to avoid enemies. \n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game fixed two of my biggest gripes from the first game. The fact that the levels are interconnected and the ability to actually control the camera make for a much better gameplay experience despite the awful stealth sections. I was a bit baffled that reviewers panned this game pretty badly as I think this game improves the first game in many ways. If you enjoyed the first game then there is no reason why you shouldn't love this game as well, unless of course the modern day setting doesn't appeal to you.\n", "timestamp_created": 1436720755, "timestamp_updated": 1436720755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732932448387145996", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16994602": {"recommendationid": "16994602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001334031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1650156675}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a good game. \n\nI bought it during the steam sale for $10 complete and it was a waste.

Graphically, it fails to impress. Mechanically, it feels sloppy. The combat is frustrating and choppy and, while LoS1 had its fair share of controller-throwing platforming segments, LoS2 doesn't even justify its own such moments with an equal helping of fun, satisfying ones. I have only put a couple hours into the game so far, and already I'm mad at it. I cannot comment on the overall story yet, but the beginning feels rushed and strange, and I have to feel bad for Patrick Stewart being forced to deliver such a petty script as Zobek. The writing is childish and uninspired, and the semi-animated lore sequence explaining the Belmont lineage is utterly boring.\n\nBut you know, I could forgive all of that if the game didn't so completely miss its own point. At no time during play did I ever FEEL like Dracula, who is supposed to be an absolute powerhouse, combining strength, speed, and magical abilities to devastate ranks upon ranks of foes. The most basic of enemies can take a monumental beating from any of your weapons, and can even attack straight through your combos to strike you. One minor strike from an enemy, however, will interrupt your combo and send you flying, which makes your stature feel pitiful, even if you aren't taking significant damage from those attacks. These problems are only magnified and exacerbated when, after the tutorial sequence, the story fast-forwards some centuries and resets all of Gabriel's powers, requiring you to slowly unlock them, one by one.\n\nOther games have successfully portrayed their protagonists as extremely powerful beings without robbing the game of its core challenge. A great case in point is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Lords of Shadow 2, however, takes the legendary Dracula and nerfs him into the ground, and then poops all over him with bad gameplay mechanics.\n\nI'll say it again: if you want more LoS, play the first game again, because you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.", "timestamp_created": 1436239875, "timestamp_updated": 1436239875, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16916516": {"recommendationid": "16916516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032687176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3697, "last_played": 1435268925}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed the first game this one is even better, spoken as one of the many who openly hate other attempts at 3d Castlevania titles, playing as Dracula for once was a welconme twist to the normal gameplay.\n\nThe combat system can feel a bit tired at times, but plenty of awesome lore and story again.", "timestamp_created": 1436217873, "timestamp_updated": 1436217873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16885351": {"recommendationid": "16885351", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980315200", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 971, "last_played": 1436050721}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful graphics and soundtrack!

No more fixed camera, and there's a decent arsenal of subweapon to experiment with.  They way you level up weapons and techniques encourages variety in combat.  Unlike the first game the Light and Dark magic forms have their own weapons.  Void Sword and Chaos Claws once leveled up can be used long enough so you can experiment with them instead of just using them when you know you the extra health or damage.  Also since the game is open world it's much easier to backtrack and find secrets you may have missed on your first time through.  That was the biggest pain about LoS1 since you have replay an entire stage.  Though at least the chapters were divided up into multiple areas.\n\nHard to understand all the hate for this game.  The story whacky, and the events that bridge the two games have their own 3DS game (which was ported to console and PC).  Kind of depressing since the summary they give in the beginning of this game is really interesting.  Almost wish that Mirror of Fate would've been Lords of Shadow 2, then make this game Lords of Shadow 3.  My biggest complaint about the story is how they treated Victor Belmont.  I assume he's suppose to be Richter, but given that you meet him and 20 minutes later he sacrifices himself, I can see why they changed his name.  Really wish there was more of him in the game.\n\nEnvironments in the present day segments are pretty dull.  No real variations in it, just greyed out industrial areas.  The other parts of the set Castlevania's past feel alive.  Definitely feels like the devs had fun making those areas.  On the other hand, maybe it's some sort of commentary from the devs saying that building and architechture in the present day are boring compared to ancient castles.\n\nEnemy designs also don't feel very varied either.  Boss design is on point though aside from the final boss.  *SPOILER WARNING* Final boss is Satan inside Alucard's body.  I was hoping for something a little more unique.  And since you only see Alucard for the last little section of the game (though technically he is there for the entire game disguised as the Zobek's second in command) it's disappointing that he's only there for that last little bit.\n\nSpeaking of Alucard.  his DLC is solid too.  It has actual cinemas unlike how the DLC for LoS1 was handled.  He doesn't have new weapons for the magic modes, but the DLC is just long enough you don't notice it.  The only disappointing thing about the DLC is Alucard doesn't have any attacks for his Bat Swarm or Spectral Wolf abilities in combat or with magic.  Would've been a nice touch.

In the end, it is very funny, entertaining, dramatic and inspiring.\n\n8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1434304453, "timestamp_updated": 1434304453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16384843": {"recommendationid": "16384843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066715689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 780, "last_played": 1422486349}, "language": "english", "review": "The ending ruined this game.", "timestamp_created": 1434281298, "timestamp_updated": 1434281298, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429845035076141357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16380192": {"recommendationid": "16380192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008093440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2065, "last_played": 1425023010}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I was not expecting anything from this game.

Otro punto muy flojo son sus gr\u00e1ficos, en muchas ocasiones se miran las texturas acartonadas y muy poco trabajadas, esto es algo muy com\u00fan durante todo el juego, solamente algunos personajes se rescatan un poco.\n\n\nLos jefes no son algo muy destacable, aunque hay un par muy interesantes, que te pueden poner a pensar, supongo que algo tenia que heredar este juego de su antecesor... Los personajes secundarios, en este caso hablo de los villanos, son demasiado genericos y a la larga cansan que sean demasiado repetitivos, por otra parte el juego se puede volver muy f\u00e1cil usando items, practicamente te vuelves invencible si compras muchos items.\n\n\nOtra cosa que no me gust\u00f3 para nada es la ambientaci\u00f3n, es mala, los lugares donde se ambienta son la ciudad, un castillo, entre otros, no terminan por ser muy buenos y mucho menos ser\u00e1n recordados, adem\u00e1s que muchos escenarios son bastante pobres, si sumas escenarios pobres m\u00e1s villanos secundarios genericos y predecibles, entonces tienes algo malo.\n\n\nTal vez de las pocas cosas buenas del juego es su combate, se mantiene practicamente igual que el primer Castlevania LoS, bueno, ser\u00eda horrible que involucionara, al menos se mantiene muy jugable, adem\u00e1s de no ser un juego muy corto, eso se agradece.\n\n\nEn resumen, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 no es un juego para todos, recomendar\u00eda jugarlo solamente si terminaste el primero, te gust\u00f3 mucho y quieres ver como continua la historia, si no has probado ni el primero Castlevania LoS entonces no te recomiendo para nada probar este.\n\n\n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1431985454, "timestamp_updated": 1431986072, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440685778856277466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15876773": {"recommendationid": "15876773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119423274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2212, "last_played": 1437160180}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aviso que este review contiene algunos spoilers.\n\nEl juego es bueno, pero hasta ah\u00ed, est\u00e1 apenas por sobre la media, y por eso llego a recomendarlo.

Take note that this is a review from a gamer that ACTUALLY read all the memorials, did not skip a scene, took the time to look at statutes, arts and building structural designs, and all the back stories in every description. I also take this game as it is, instead of relating it back to any other Castlevania, such as Symphony of The Night or the first LoS.  \n\n10/10 would recommend this game, and here's why: \n\nPros\n\n1) The story is amazing.  As I dig deeper into the story, I feel I can relate to some of the characters, know why they did what they did, and that is important! Some may argue that the ending is dull, I personally think that it is fitting.  Reading the memorials help me understand how the modern era portrays the world and history.  \n\n2) Voice acting is phenomenal.  They not only fit the characters, they brought out the emotions of their characters and made the story more colorful. \n\n3) The soundtrack is amazing as well. \n\n4) The city and castle designs are amazing.  While it is set in a modern world close to ours, it also retain some original castle structures that makes sense to remain there.  The castle is, well, Dracula's castle, and it is beautiful.  The texture of the stone/wooden floors, ceilings, and walls are so detailed that they are worth admiring, one could feel that this is not a simple copy-and-paste world.  I actually took time to look at statutes from different angles, just to admire them.  The world is interconnected, different routes to a place is possible.  \n\n5) Game's free-camera-control is great, and the combat is fluid. \n\n6) I love it when in Dracula's rat form.  While some will argue it's necessity (Dracula too powerful to be a rat), it gives me a different view of the city.  What amazes me is that despite everything being bigger, the texture of the world is still amazing (floor tiles, walls and cables)!  So what he turns into a rat? He's a fucking Dracula! \n\n7) The most controversial part of the game: Argreus.  I like the stealth part in his maze.  Again, many people would argue that since Dracula is so powerful why the sneaking and the one-shot-kill? Ever heard of Pan's Labyrinth? Well, Argreus IS Pan's brother, so it makes sense that a maze like that would be his world, and the one-shot-kill is justified.  That is why we have to make it past the maze to a higher ground where it is not a maze to fight him.  Savvy? \n\nCons\n\n1) The stealth system is flawed.  While bat swarm works on certain enemies (only on the red armored marine if I recall correctly), most of the time when you use it sneaking up on an enemy, it just draws attention to every enemy in the vicinity to focus on you (once you use it, they know where you are).  \n\n2) Despite having so many different skills, as the game progresses, skills will become less useful.  Some enemies are so aggressive that you just don't have time to use different attacks without being knocked down first.  I ended up using basic attacks in most of the situation.  \n\nOverall, this is a great game.  You will be missing out if you rely your decision to buy this game on unprofessional critic's opinions about this game.  Hell, reviewing a game ain't even close to my profession, but after seeing some negative reviews of this game, and after personally playing it, I feel compelled to write something to justify the unjust.

It has some flaws, but it has fun gameplay and a rich atmosphere. It's mostly a character action game with some Metroidvania style exploration elements.\n\nFirstly, the good stuff. Most of the time playing this game you will be either in combat with enemies, or exploring the world. Combat is very fun and engaging, albeit not the deepest of the genre. It can't rival the likes of Platinum's work, but still creates a fun system that keeps you wanting more. It has a nice rhythm to it as it requires you to always keep an eye on enemies and properly timing blocking to keep your combo up, which is crucial for the \"Focus\" system. This system is also what gives you the power needed to use two of the three main weapons. These two weapons also have special effects, such as freezing enemies or burning away their armour, but break your Focus. It creates this flow to combat that feels very fluid and back-and-forth, meaning you can't get lazy and just endlessly wail on enemies without opposition, especially on higher difficulties. The different weapons also feel distinct from each other outside of their special effects. They each have different range, speed, and power, and there are plenty of combos in each weapon that all have a use in different combat situations, which are unlocked in an RPG style experience system.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is also great. Everything has a dark and intricate look to it, with stunning Gothic architecture and really interesting world and boss design. The soundtrack is also fantastic, with a sweeping orchestral sound that fits the melodramatic and dark feel of the game. This makes simply being in the game world and moving around it a lot of fun. It does a good job of helping you soak in the atmosphere, both in and out of combat. The kinaesthetics too, are fantastic. The weapons all have a very satisfying feel to them. A sense of power and impact, but also vibrancy. They leave trails colour that arc around in the air as you swing your weapons, or explosions when they hit enemies. Some of the more powerful moves are especially impressive in how they surround you in a storm of whirling lights that destroys everything in the area.\n\nThe structure of the game world is pretty interesting as well, and quite unique for the genre. Unlike the first game in the Lords of Shadow series, this game is set in two moderately sized Metroidvania-like overworlds. It is somewhat inspired by the traditional Castlevania style of level design, but isn't really the main focus of the gameplay here. Yet it still manages to achieve this feeling of place to the game world. You can explore around seamlessly without any loading screens, and many areas are connected, and sometimes loop around on each other. This also aids the sense of atmosphere to the game, and gives the game much better pacing than the first as well. Here you're not thrown back to the main menu to sit through a long loading screen every fifteen minutes. But despite its interconnected nature, main story progress through the game world is mostly pretty linear. Apart from a few specific points, you won't be revisiting older places unless you go out of your way to find upgrades and collectables. It's not as dense and maze-like as some older Castlevania games, but for what it brings to the type of game it is, it's a great addition.\n\nThere are also some areas of the game which are clearly lacking, though they are not anywhere near significant enough to ruin the experience.\n\nFirstly, there are the much lamented stealth sections. These are pretty bad, but not game-breakingly so. They feel half-baked and somewhat forced in to the game, by taking away your ability to fight while entering a stealth section. The mechanics of the stealth sections are also shallow, and it\u2019s not exactly clear when you are detected or not. When you are, although it's not an instant failure, it might as well be, given that you will be attacked by enemies that can kill you in two hits or so, even with all the health upgrades. But even so, these sections are relatively rare. They make up only what is probably 5% or less of the actual main story. On top of that they are all incredibly short and easy. All they require you to do most of the time is sneak to the other side of a small room. Usually that involves nothing more than distracting one enemy, or possessing another. Additionally, once a stealth section has been cleared, you will never have to do it again if you return to the same area. \n\nAnother problem is the story. It's a confused mess of underutilised characters and poorly explained plot devices. This game was set up as a big finale to the Lords of Shadow story, and unfortunately it mostly fails at that. There are a lot of characters in the game which don't get as much time as they need to really make the impact they otherwise could. They often appear only as bosses, given a short introduction and forgotten immediately after. While the boss fights themselves are fun, from a story perspective they feel like they are being given the short straw. There are also some elements of the story that are fairly crucial to the plot which aren't explained well at all. For example the Mirror of Fate, from the game of the same name, also plays a prominent role in this game, but its significance isn't explained here, and its role seems unrelated to the game it was introduced in. But despite this, there are a few good moments. A conversation or two that hint at some interesting themes, although they are never explored as they could be, still bring out some good character moments. There's a sense that this game is trying to do a character study of Dracula, exploring his inner struggle between opening up to accepting his family or succumbing to the power of the evil vampiric curse. But it deals with these themes clumsily, and doesn't give them enough time and attention. The best part of the story was mostly the tone and feeling of it, which in both the previous games and this one, are mostly achieved through the aesthetics.\n\nSo overall, Lords of Shadow 2 is a pretty good game. Far from perfect, but certainly undeserving of the overly harsh critical mauling it got on release. If you were a fan of the previous Lords of Shadow game(s), then this should be right up your alley as well.

I loved Lords of Shadow. It had some issues, but was incredibly enjoyable, from the variety of settings to the classic monsters Gabriel did battle with. \n\nI'd read that this one was very slow to get going, but that once it did, it was solid. That disappointed me in and of itself, but it also made me wait for a sale to buy it. Finally a good one came along, and I bought the game, looking forward to get back into the world and see what had become of Gabriel since we'd last met. \n\nBecause I'd read the reviews already, I was willing to sludge through the awful stealth sections where you have to turn into a rat to accomplish a variety of goals. And yes, they were terrible. But what was also very annoying was a constant sense of \"where do I go\" and \"what am I supposed to do now?\" A lot of time was spent backtracking or wandering all over the map looking for the next goal. There were areas that I couldn't get to simply because I wasn't SUPPOSED to get to them yet, even though I could see things I wanted just beyond simple things like rocks that Dracula should've easily been able to leap over and obtain. \n\nNot this Dracula. So that took me right out of the immersion. But OK, I can overlook it if the game itself is good. \n\nIt's just the opposite of the first LoS to me. That one was excellent with a few flaws. This one is generally bad with a few bright spots, none of which make up for the game as a whole. \n\nThe voice acting, aside from Dracula, is absolutely terrible, especially the \"extras\" you fight who constantly shout out the same lines over and over. The monsters in this one are poorly designed as well, and even the humans look bizarre. Garbriel's head often seems way too small for his giant body, for instance. \n\nSome of the fights were OK, but the vast majority just came down to relentless button mashing mixed with evasion. You can learn all the \"cool moves\" you want, but you really don't need them. Just mash that X and Y, and you'll get through most of the fights. Boss battles are typical of the problem with so many of these types of games today: big, giant, lumbering beasts or creatures that you have to climb or hit a glowing portion on, blah, blah, blah. Nothing exciting, nothing very interesting. \n\nThe only thing that kept me going in this was really wanting to see a resolution to Dracula's story. Quite frankly, I wanted to see him become Gabriel again. But about 3/4 of the way in, I realized that, despite what some of the reviews said, this game was not getting much better. I was revisiting the same places over and over again, and who wants to walk Dracula around science labs in a game like this? Drab, boring science labs is where you spend much of the game, not the gothic settings of the first. \n\nSPOILER:\nAnyway, I was getting so frustrated wtih the game that I decided to spoil the ending for myself. I wanted to see if it was worth playing through to the end for a solid payoff. Well ... for me, it's not. Not even close. There was no resolution whatsoever. Silly me. How could I not get that they were just going to leave everything open-ended for yet another one of these things. The plot has become idiotic, downright stupid. I felt dumber for having played as much as I did. \n\nBut at least I got it on sale. A true shame what they did to this franchise after such a great predecessor.

The mechanics are well varied and properly executed, and at its' very beginning, launches the player into action. \n\nThe boss fights are bloody, epic, and memorable. Little was spared in terms of length and difficulty when encountering various bosses, who are well varied and endowed. Prepare to die a few times in your quest to make progress.\n\nNote that duie to the nature of the story (see section below) , repetitive gameplay is necessitated for one to unlock Dracula's potential abilities as the story progresses. This is executed in a repetitive manner, and as such, incurs a considerable challenge at the early stages of the game. However, as an indirect consequence, later sections are very rewarding as your new abilities are fully utilized in making progress. Prepare for a challenge. \n\nThe stealth system and mechanics used are not ideal and are out of balance. A being such as dracula shouldn't be reduced to a powerless imp in the stealth sections, which can be confusing and often convoluted. \n\nGraphics:\n\nExcellent, judging bu its' requirements and visuals. They are well balanced and properly executed. Details are clear and vivid, and so are the vast, open world environments. Character forms are well refined and so are their spectral abilities. \n\nStory line: \n\nAll in all, dependin gon your background, its' taste may differ to you. I've read previous reviews from people who played the games' prequel and most were not pleased.\nin my opinion, I found the fusion of both the present and the past (through the use of the Wolf Medallion) a bit unique in that you can switch to either timeline and progress at your own rate. In a manner, this further enhances the open world experience. As a drawback, this can make the game very repetitive since the environments are consrained to one transitional area, a chemical company. This also incurs a drawback to the overall quality of Dracula's retelling as a legendary vampire who must be trapped to a moden themed factory for extended periods of gameplay time as a requirement to progressing in the game. This repetitive nature may not bode well for all players. \n\nOverall rating:\n\nThe production quality is superb, and so is the gameplay.

I played 1st one as well so I was interested in how the story ends especially because of amazing outro. The story of previous game was amazing with a lot of plot twists. However, in case of this game, it was shorter and narrower. Anyway, I still enjoyed it and I really loved the ending. If I would play it as a standalone game I would be still satisfied, but I also understand those who are disappointed especially when they are comparing it to the first game.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay - play this game with controller!!! (I played with X-box controller and I can only recommend it). There was like only one mini game when I switched to mouse for a faster and smoother aiming. Otherwise this game is really difficult to play with keyboard, especially because hints are given in X-box controller binding (for example \"Press [insert green circle with A letter] to continue\").\n\nCombat system was amazing compared to the previous game. Camera was also improved. Those two things let you really enjoy all the fights, especially those with bosses. On the other hand, difficulty was decreased (at least this is my impression) compared to the previous game. And not only during fights. I also found climbing passages much easier. Yes, they were smoother, more intuitive and much less painful than in previous game, but on the other hand, I felt like I am just moving stick in one of the 4 directions and Gabriel is auto-piloting himself through those catch points on the wall. If those passages are replaced with cinematics of Gabriel climbing some wall, I would not see any difference and that is a bit disappointing for me.\n\nWhen it comes to stealth passages, I see a lot of people did not like them. Honestly, I expected those passages will be very often and very boring after reading some reviews, but I found them quite interesting and there were actually only few in the game.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention are puzzles. I really liked puzzles in the first game and this was probably the biggest disappointment for me, because there were only few puzzles and difficulty of all of them was like difficulty of puzzles in pre-school kid magazines.\n\nAnd last thing I would like to talk about are graphics. They are really amazing. Especially castle is truly master piece. However, it is looking quite the same all the time. During playing the first game, player is going through various environments. Each one looks different. Each one got different colour scheme. Each one got unique textures. Environments in first game are truly amazing and I still remember a lot of amazing sceneries from there. But with this game everything is dark and quite the same. Only colourful place I can remember was one garden passage within the castle (I will not say more details to not spoil it). Details are still really amazing, but everything is so dark and similar, that you will stop sense them.\n\nI guess this is mainly because the game is open-world like and not level system like in previous game so environment have to be \"one solid connected piece\". In the first game all what was needed was simple introduction \"and in this level Gabriel went to some other place far away from previous one\" and environment could change drastically. In this game it has to fit all together, because there is no space for long distance travelling.\n\nWell, to sum it up - I was satisfied with this game. If I would not play the first one I would probably enjoy it much more. The truth is, that the first game set really high standards and they were overcome only in a very few cases. For the most of them, they were below those from the first game. Still, I would give this game something about 70-80%.", "timestamp_created": 1424184361, "timestamp_updated": 1424184361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14486568": {"recommendationid": "14486568", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989807190", "num_games_owned": 2254, "num_reviews": 575, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1225, "last_played": 1424021697}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, this was quite a waste of potential.

It felt like it was trying to be a good an exciting game. Usually it wasn't.

It looks better technologically, tries to rebalance some things in a good way, makes camera mostly good, removes the linear level progress in favor of the open world and makes soundtrack especially nice.

While I have not played the Handheld Mirror of Fate, I did play the First Lords of Shadow (which, seemed more like different series than Castlevania at all).\n\nStory-wise it seems to be true to the \"Lore\" its built more or less. I think it might have the weird notion of putting lore in there you might not really interact with, nor I think it was as compelling as First one in that regard. The story does have at least one twist near the end, but seemed ye can probably guess fair bit of it. Nonetheless, conceptually still pretty cool at least, and castle bits I'd say were the more interesting of it all. Funnily enough, taking to a modern-futuresque setting seems like what the series did before its reboot...\n\nGameplay wise, its similar to the first, but with too many enemies that have Guard-breaker attacks. Quite a bit of depth with lot of the moves you can use, including fun glitches which you can find at a give GameFaq's site for more details on. Unlike the more mission/level selection screen of the first, they instead wanted to opt for little \"exploration\" like the more hack & slash ones did. Albeit not as focused on it, making getting collectables/powers-ups far more tedious than the first LoS. In addition to that, there's a lot of \"Waiting\" with exploration, that I felt really bogged down the game. As well that most of the exploration isn't till near the end game, making the likelyhood you'll do so that much more unlikely.\n\nLastly, yes, there is Stealth, and its alright. It's moreso just very short puzzles of sorts. It makes sense in the begining from a story perspective, but after that seemed uneeded, they were mostly not that fun unfortunately (I'm on generally ok with Stealth gameplay in games).\n\n\nI understand this isn't really a in-depth review, but I figure the ones top-voted already do the game better on details.

The early reviews for the game made it sound like it was terrible, but it really wasn't that bad. However, that's not to say it isn't without its flaws. \n\nThe highlight of the game is probably its combat. You get three different weapons this time around instead of just magical powerups for the whip like in the original LOS: A light magic sword, dark magic gauntlets, and the whip returns as the default weapon. Each has their own style and role in combat; the sword can heal you when you do damage, the gauntlets do more damage than the other two overall and can also break enemy blocking, and the whip has good crowd control skills and has more range overall. Each weapon also has a fleshed out skill/move set tree that you can unlock with experience points. Gabriel controls more or less the same as he did in LOS with a couple tweaks, like a free moving camera.\n\nFor the overall main plot the game is shorter than the original Lords of Shadow, but it has much more in the way of secret items and challenge modes. The game is also much less linear than the original, with a semi-open world map that you can freely roam when not in a specific mission. The voice work is high quality, with much of the cast of the original returning (Patrick Stewart FTW) along with some new cast members who give a great performance as well. The game itself also looks great with very detailed and unique locals, characters, and monsters.\n\nThe biggest let down of the game is probably the forced stealth sections. They slow down what is normally a relatively fast paced game to a crawl, and don't work out well with how the game controls. They also don't really make sense in the context of the game, you are supposed to be this powerful being and yet these power armored lackeys can utterly destroy you if they see you. Thankfully there aren't many of these sections, and the rest of the game definitely makes up for it.\n\nOverall I'd say the game is pretty good and is definitely worthwhile if you've played the other Lords of Shadow games.", "timestamp_created": 1422231549, "timestamp_updated": 1422231549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14154520": {"recommendationid": "14154520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018251251", "num_games_owned": 851, "num_reviews": 522, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1422153029}, "language": "english", "review": "What happened to you Castlevania?

En mi caso s\u00ed, es inferior a la primera parte en todos los aspectos.\n\nEmpezamos por la localizaci\u00f3n y los escenarios. Mientras que en el 1 son simplemente incre\u00edbles, y todo el royo medieval le queda de lujo, y los paisajes son magn\u00edficos, en este que sea en la \u00e9poca actual y en medio de la ciudad pues resulta bastante chocante por lo menos. Sin contar los robots y mechas. S\u00f3lamente cuando regresamos en ocasiones al castillo y alrededores mejora algo. Y otra cosa de la ciudad, en esta segunda parte dejamos la linealidad del primero para conseguir una especie de sandbox como en el Batman Arkham City. Adem\u00e1s cambia la c\u00e1mara fija por libre, algo que te pod\u00eda gustar o no en la primera parte. \n\nContinuamos con la duraci\u00f3n y dificultad. Much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s corto, 16 horas sin contar el dlc que no creo que sea m\u00e1s de 1 o 2, frente a las 24 horas que me llev\u00f3 su primera parte. Y mucho, pero que mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil. Pr\u00e1cticamente los jefes no tienen dificultad, tal vez el final, pero vamos, que el combate no tiene problemas. Adem\u00e1s en el 1 los jefes sol\u00edan ser enormes y ten\u00edamos que ir escal\u00e1ndolos. En el 2 suelen tener un tama\u00f1o normal. Tambi\u00e9n tiene muchas menos zonas de habilidad de saltar de aqu\u00ed para all\u00e1 como ten\u00eda el 1. Y otro punto negativo de esta nueva libertad que nos da el mapa es casi pasamos m\u00e1s tiempo dando vueltas que avanzando en la historia.\n\n\u00bfY porqu\u00e9 han hecho esto? porque la historia es muy corta, y nos pasamos casi medio juego viendo cinem\u00e1ticas. Pero descarado. Un punto a su favor es que la cantidad de QTE es inferior, deber\u00eda ser cero porque menudo c\u00e1ncer son los QTE, pero acambio ganamos en cinem\u00e1ticas, bonitas, pero cansinas. Tambi\u00e9n decir que se pueden desactivar todos los QTE en opciones, \u00a1menos mal! Y tambi\u00e9n podremos escoger nuestro atuendo.\n\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico y rendimiento es bueno como en la primera parte, buen port y optimizado. Pero como ya he dicho no es tan \"bonito\" como el uno. \n\nOtra cosa negativa son las fases de infiltraci\u00f3n. Nos transformamos en rata para pasar desapercibidos. \u00bfEn serio? ni que esto fuera un Splinter Cell o algo as\u00ed. Y tambi\u00e9n decimos adi\u00f3s a los puzzles, que le daban un toque interesante al 1, aqu\u00ed directamente desaparecen.\n\nUna cosa que no se le puede criticar al juego es que ha innovado frente al 1, pero tal vez demasiadas cosas y al final ha salido un t\u00edtulo m\u00e1s radical y de ah\u00ed las cr\u00edticas que le llovieron. Te lo venden como la continuaci\u00f3n de su primera parte, pero parece que estemos frente a otro juego distinto. No es mal juego, pero es muy inferior al 1 sin ninguna duda.\n\nNota: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1421424520, "timestamp_updated": 1421425004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631181538105010986", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13992358": {"recommendationid": "13992358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039263406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3389, "last_played": 1540408147}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1421309304, "timestamp_updated": 1421309304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13974847": {"recommendationid": "13974847", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986192912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 824, "last_played": 1421184998}, "language": "english", "review": "I Really liked the first Lords Of Shadow, but this game is in my oppinion way worse.

A 58 out of 100 seems awfully low for a game that plays so well, that I'm baffled by the hatred it gets from critics. Or, perhaps, the way Metacritic aggregates review scores is the problem? A single negative review can make that score right there plummet and provide extreme misinformation on an otherwise great game!\n\nLords of Shadow 2 does a few things quite well. First, it removes the stupid locked camera. Second, it has easy to learn combos that the game outright encourages you to use via the \"mastery\" system. Third, it has far more gothic scenery and themes that pay a deep homage to Castlevania in general. Fourth, the graphics are absolutely beautiful yet they run at 60 frames per second. Fifth, the bosses are incredible. Sixth, there's a ton of secrets and for the most part you are encouraged to explore at your leisure between objectives. Those are the six key aspects I can think of, besides the music, voiceacting, and controls being stellar as well. The story can be confusing, but it's the most tragic tale of Dracula I've ever seen in my life, and that is awesome in itself! Have you ever found yourself rooting for Dracula in all of the Castlevania games? Well, you WILL in this game!\n\nThe most criticized aspect of this game is that it \"doesnt know what it wants to be\", on critic reviews. I'm sorry, but there is such a thing as \"gameplay variety\". Consistency is nice, but this game isn't trying to be 100% like God of War, and offers decent stealth segments which aren't awful. Some of these segments are even a little clever, but they could be better. In fact, the game IS consistent for the most part, offering lots of platforming, action, exploration, secrets, and grand vistas. So why is that the worst part of the game? Is it really too linear? Does it really change too often too fast with the gameplay? Is it not trying hard enough to be Metroidvania style? These questions don't matter. The classic Castlevania games were by far more linear than this game, except the often criticized Simon's Quest entry. There are things wrong with Lords of Shadow 2 as well, but does it really warrant a FIFTY EIGHT OUT OF ONE HUNDRED Metascore?!\n\nSo, I highly reccomend this game.

You can adjust the camera by mouse so there are no more fixed angles and even jumping is fun again. No more QTE, thank you for that dear devs. \n\nThe game is kind of an open world game, you can constantly roam your castle and the modern world and unlock secret after secret while advancing through the game. \n\nThe speakers and the music are nearly over the top.

La trama, por otro lado, cumple bien, aunque es m\u00e1s directa y simplona que la de la primera parte, con menos personajes y di\u00e1logos, y la alternancia con la mente de Dr\u00e1cula (las escenas en el \"pasado\" son en realidad luchas interiores) no acaba de tener del todo sentido. \n\nA nivel gr\u00e1fico el juego est\u00e1 muy bien, con un gran nivel de detalle y bastante buenas expresiones faciales; aunque est\u00e1 muy bien de ejecuci\u00f3n, su dise\u00f1o est\u00e9tico si que es claramente inferior al de la primera parte, que ten\u00eda mucha m\u00e1s variedad de localizaciones y muchas de ellas m\u00e1s imaginativas que los escenarios m\u00e1s o menos repetitivos de esta segunda parte. El apartado sonoro tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 muy bien y, aunque la banda sonora es ligeramente peor que la primera, tiene en general un nivel muy alto. \n\nEn resumen, Castlevania 2 cierra la saga de Lords of Shadow con un buen resultado que consigue entretener mucho aunque no alcanza el nivel de la primera parte.

(People really seem to love the 'plots' of Castlevania games without understanding that the story is generally pretty weak.)\n\nGameplay-wise, big improvement over LoS1.  The camera isn't locked, the environments are open for fighting and the \"background\" doesn't obstruct the combat the way it did in LoS1.\n\nThe platforming is guided, there aren't a lot of fall down and die challenges, if you can make a leap, you'll make a leap, and there's a lot less guesswork than there was in the first one since the camera now sits behind Gabriel not a mile away from him while you judge a gap.\n\nThe pace does get disrupted in several moments with these bizarre stealth pieces that, as you approach the end of the game, will have you wondering how it is you still aren't powerful enough to sneak around enemies you should be able to kill.  If you've been playing about 45 minutes of combat, then expect to spend the next 45 dealing with sneaking.  There are a couple of scenes that will definitely test the frustration durability of your controller as well.\n\nThe game allows backtracking, but it isn't as crucial as it was in LoS1.  I remember in LoS1 NEEDING to go back and get some more upgrades because combat was such a pain.  In this I tended to find enough health upgrades, power upgrades etc. along the way if I kept my eyes open for side passes, that I did not backtrack at all.\n\nI didn't backtrack because it is a giant pain in the ass.  The environments are HUGE, there is a quick travel system but it goes to like 4 waypoints in massive areas in the city or in the castle, so it doesn't exactly put you right where you want to be.  I thought about it said \"nope\" and never backtracked, aside from hitting up a shop.\n\nYou may also get locked into certain fights and you can't back out of them to go back and farm health potions, so you're screwed.  Let's just say I spent so long fighting the last boss starting with a shred of health and zero void sword power that I had to learn how to fight and counter him effectively.  I'm probably pretty much unbeatable now thanks to my own lack of preparation going in to the end game.\n\nDespite some of the flaws, fun game.\n\nSo...\n\nGet this if:\n\nYou love the atmosphere / plot of the Castlevania games and aren't so linear in your thinking that \"ZOMGZ ITS NOT CASTLEVANIA IF ITS NOT 2D!\"  Or if you were ever a fan of the Legacy of Kain games, because there hasn't been a better \"bad-ass-vampire platformer\" since the last ones of those were made.\n\nAvoid it if: \n\nYou need complicated platforming, not the hand holding kind, or if you're the kind of person who will put a game down if the pace of it gets disrupted.

The ending is rather anti-climatic i expected so much more from Satan but i suppose it makes sense since he spends centuries hiding from Dracula. \n\nTips for Stealth sections - Use Mist to cross leaves\n                                          Use Shadow Daggers to hit bells\n                                       Use Bats to distract Golgoth Guards \n\nThose sections are really not that hard once you know how to approach them.", "timestamp_created": 1419624362, "timestamp_updated": 1419665742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600753486156463623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13613099": {"recommendationid": "13613099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132916487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1517092976}, "language": "english", "review": "coool\n", "timestamp_created": 1419607243, "timestamp_updated": 1419607243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477792739868164063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13612028": {"recommendationid": "13612028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016003941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 2423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1214, "last_played": 1613586025}, "language": "english", "review": "Due to steam reviews not saving all of my edits for my review of this game I will sum it up in two sentences:\n\nThis game is a complete mess and will make you angry!

It's not a particularly difficult game but it does have some stealth scenarios that can be annoying. The boss fights aren't particularly intuitive, just hack and slash and avoid getting hit.

Without knowing until after I finished this Lords of Shadow series follows an alternate timeline from the others in that series, and without playing Lords of Shadow 1, I enjoyed it a lot. The game catches you up to the story of Lords of Shadow well, and I enjoyed the plot and flow of the game.\n\nGameplay (fighting) is pretty hack-slash with comboing using the whip, or sword/chaos claws but is quite simple. I've read people compare it to God of War, but having not played that series I wouldn't know. I wasn't expecting anything amazing in combat but I did find it fun to play despite not a huge variation in enemies. At least most of the enemies weren't annoying, but I did dread getting into fights. There was a fair bit of platforming, some stealth missions which I hated, and some nice simple puzzle-solving. There as good flow and variation during the story to keep it fresh.\n\nExploration in this game is pretty lacking. Missions/the story is pretty linear/guided, and unless you wanted to upgrade your weapons/skills (not necessary if you played on an easier difficulty like me, I just wanted to play this game casually) there was no point in re-visiting areas. You can access 'new areas' in levels with upgraded abilities later in the game, but there's really no point unlike in Castlevania:SotN because you won't be getting new weapons/skills/etc. doing so. Don't expect some Skyrim/TES bonuses from going off the beaten path\n\nVisually, this game is pretty good. Nice background scenery, the castle looks beautiful. The modern city is kind of 'meh', but I did appreciate how the game looked. Some of the audio tracks are great too, but you will run into a lot of the same music.\n\nOverall, I had fun with the game and enjoyed it for what it was. I admitedly got frustrated with some parts of the game and would just quit playing 10 minutes in if I couldn't advance through the story fast enough to do other stuff but my yearning for knowing what happened in this game kept me coming back.

Though it differs from the first. It is by that measure that I think its best compared.\n\n+Graphical Presentation+\nThe first game had your character crossing an elaborate, Lord of the Rings like world with plenty of variety and set pieces. It was absolutely beautiful.\n\nNone of that beauty comes close to be realized here. Instead, what you get is an atmosphere...\n\n...THAT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE CASTLEVANIA!\n\nThere are many reviewers who will cry at the fact that the last game was prettier, but here, you are in a dark, moody castle with full control of your camera and dammit I just couldn't help but love how it actually felt like you were involved in a dark tale of vampires and demons, unlike the first. So between this and the first, its an apples to oranges comparision. In the end, the graphical presentation gives you that SoTN feel that the first game was missing (the sexy mountaintops of LoS1 be darned).\n\n+Story (Spoiler Free)+\nThe first game was about losing faith. The second game is about redemption. Obviously. What else is new? What's important here is characterization and voice acting delivery. To which it does an absolutely fantastic job of delivering. Though, in my view, its story is not as heavy as the first, given that every single chapter in LoS1 had Captain Picarde himself explaining what the heck is going on in detail. We really could've used that narration to explain some of the strange stuff having in this castle-city. Like what the heck is a castle doing here in the first place? That was a head-trip, but hey, its Dracula; his castle be constantly respawning I guess.\n\nSo here's what I recommend you do before jumping in here: 1) Play the first game first (or read its cliff-notes). 2) Play Mirror of Fate (or read its cliff-notes) . They frequently make references to the first game and the hand-held tie-in so if you skip these steps then expect a confusing plot. \n\nGiven that I didn't skip these steps, I found LoS2 to make for a pretty good story. Certainly has more heart than most games these days. It's like a DMC that you can take seriously.\n\n+Gameplay+\nHere is the one place where I can say without a doubt that it delivers better than the first game. You see, LoS2 is easier than the first, for all the RIGHT reasons.\n\nThe first had some Nintendo-hard bulls*** issues holding it back that have been fixed. For one, you have more options given the three weapons to choose from. The lame Light and Dark Magic system is replaced by an Ice Weapon and Fire Weapon.  In the first game, you only switched to Light to heal on occasion and that was it, as you were constantly struggling to fill up the focus meter to fuel your heals. Dark magic was never used. It was nothing more than an unimportant DPS buff. \n\nHere, the replacements to the old magic honestly feels different enough for you to want to mix it up, what with the fire ability being able to break enemy shields and blocking (in addition to doing more DPS), and the ice sword having some mean crowd control abilities (in addition to healing you). Filling up the focus meter is much faster and easier so you can continue to fuel these things without fear, and with the camera in your control, you just won't feel as frustrated as before.\n\nThe side items and powers are must more useful as well, and a power you get later on adds a whole new dimension to to your defensive options. Overall, I'd say LoS1 comes no where CLOSE to being a steller action game in the gameplay department. It was servicable and that was it. Here, we actually have a system that's as fun as God of War.  YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOD-DAMNED DRACULA, AND NO ONE CAN F*** WITH YOU! You ARE the final boss of over 30 games, and nothing can stop you, only slow you down.\n\nHell yeah. \n\nAbout the only thing relatively weak are the stealth sections, which make sense only at the start of the game...how is it that you're a threat to Satan, but these red guys can blow your ass away doing 9999 damage per shot? I need Captain Picarde to explain. Fortunately, such sections are mercifully short and easy.\n\nThere are also fewer puzzles than the first game. But who cares?\n\n+Overall+\nOverall I give this game a 7.9/10. Its not the greatest thing since Bayonetta but taken as a whole, the Lord of Shadows series offers the best story in the action game genre today...taken as a whole.  View Lord of Shadows 1 and 2 as one really long epic and you're pretty much doing it right.

This was fun by all means but the story felt lacking.  I didn't find myself driven to seek out secrets as they were more tedious to go back and find than enjoyable as i felt the first game was.  Fighting is very fun, combos and new skills make it feel solid and tactical.  There was some parts that annoyed me greatly to keep no spoilers ill make this vague....you are tasked with sneaking around in a few spots if you fail you are one shot killed.....only to then (seconds later) fight the same enemy and dominate them....I know its a game but this forced  game play mechanic annoyed me greatly.  Also the city/castle are hard to navigate, I remembered seeing places I could come back to later on to get upgrades but getting to these locations a second time seemed much more difficult then needed and I found myself just pushing forward instead.  Finally the story does tie everything up but the ending battle and conclusion felt....\"eh\" to me.  All the other fights felt great, similar to the original game they had a nice massive scale to them with a nice evily twist given your charcater.  I picked this game up on sale after seeing iffy reviews about it at launch I held off for a few months and im glad i did.  This game to me is worth playing, its not bad by any means its just lacking in some areas but I would not have been happy if i dropped full price on it.

However, it's not without its share of problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's the setting. I didn't mind the fact that a significant portion of the game was set in the near future, but the open nature of the environments (both the castle and the city) seemed to sap the creative element from their design. Yes, it's cool that all of it links together, but that feeling of exploring strange new landscapes with all their weird quirks has been completely sacrificed. I get that it works with the plot, but I feel like the game would have benefited from having a level structure like the first.\n\nSpeaking of plot, there's the second problem. The story in LoS2 doesn't stack up to the first game at all, opting to go with a campier plot more reminscent of other Castlevania games than the original Lords of Shadow. While this isn't inherently a bad thing (I love Castlevania as a series, cheese and all), there's a massive plot hole introduced at the beginning of the game that is never resolved. Dracula was defeated at the end of Mirror of Fate, but apparently rose up again at some point between that game and this one. This is entirely glossed over in the main narrative and only offhandedly mentioned in Alucard's lore entry. I might be expecting too much out of the story of a Castlevania game, but it bothers me nonetheless given the detail and work put into the first game.\n\nThen there's the stealth sections. Oh god, the stealth sections. For the most part it's not too bad; there is one enemy type that requires you to go around instead of confronting directly. These sections are mostly just mild hiccups in the pacing (which also isn't quite as good as the first game), but the final one is absolutely one of the worst segments I've had the displeasure of playing through. Not only is this segment immensly frustrating, but you battle the thing you were sneaking around immediately afterwards; no new weapon, no new powers, no upgrades whatsoever. You just fight it straight away, essentially rendering all the work you just did completely pointless.\n\nFortunately, it's not all bad. The combat is a ton of fun, giving you three different weapons with distinct features and fighting styles. It also looks fantastic; though I disparaged the nature of the new environments earlier, I can't deny the level of detail put into the city and Dracula's castle. The creatures and characters all look great too, from the detailed facial animations of the humanoids to Satan's grotesque abominations. Voice acting is solid; the actors did a good job delivering the lukewarm script in a believable way.\n\nAll in all, Lords of Shadow 2 is a solid action game with a few flaws. Go into it expecting more of a Devil May Cry experience than a Lords of Shadow 1 experience and I think you'll be able to derive more enjoyment from it that way.", "timestamp_created": 1418063604, "timestamp_updated": 1418063918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563758373260498047", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13276184": {"recommendationid": "13276184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024959727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1218, "last_played": 1417990191}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very fun to play, yet poorly written game.
