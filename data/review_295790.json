I say that because the game itself isn't all that enjoyable and feels like it's getting in the way of what I actually want to be doing - learning about another culture.\n\nFirst thing - if you're having problems with 'Never Alone' automatically switching back to Co-Op controls even when you're trying to play single player, do yourself a favor and create a small text file named \"autoexec.cfg\" in the game's root folder (\"/steamapps/common/NeverAlone/\") and fill it with the following two lines:\n\nwait 20\ninputmode 2\n\nThis should fix some of the problems that a lot of people are experiencing with the controls. Otherwise, you're basically forced to find another human being to play with. Remote Play Together is your friend.\n\nOK, let me first talk about what I love about this game - the \"Insights\". These are short little films mostly featuring interviews and stories from native I\u00f1upiaq people. The majority of these are directly related to what's going on in the main story (itself an adaptation of an I\u00f1upiaq tale) in some fashion. This gives a fairly bland puzzle-platformer a whole lot of depth. I ADORE this as a way to teach about culture.\n\nJust one problem: the way to get these cinematics is to find owls scattered throughout the game. These are either so obvious as to be impossible to miss, or else kind of a pain in the butt to find without a lot of middle ground. Having to back-track through a pretty big chapter to grab one of these collectables doesn't feel good.\n\nAnd I say that not because I have a particular disdain for backtracking for collectibles, but because 'Never Alone' itself isn't particularly fun to play. There's a bit of clunk to the movement that feels really unrefined. Things like the characters not wanting to turn as a jump is being executed resulting in the occasional awkward backwards hop when a direction and jump are pressed almost simultaneously, but the jump is registered first. These are the sorts of little things that wreck a game like this.\n\nHowever the issue that frustrated me most (beyond the control scheme swapping thing I mentioned at the beginning) were some of the chase sequences at the end of the game. This game's mechanics are NOT built for reflexes. It's a co-op puzzle solving game and when it sticks to that it's OK. Not great, not even particularly challenging, but OK. But when it gets to the chases there are times where it feels like it wants the players to do things faster than it's allowing us to. Particularly in single player, it felt like running a race with weights on and was neither fun nor fair. While I did eventually succeed, it was largely in spite of a game that until that point seemed built to help me and not hinder me.\n\nAnd this is why I can't [i]really[/i] recommend 'Never Alone'. It's a good experience for learning about a culture that most of us would otherwise barely know exists. But it's just not a very good [u]game[/u] and having to play it often feels more like it's getting in the way of the learning... which stinks because it's set up so well to have the two complement each other perfectly.", "timestamp_created": 1686070755, "timestamp_updated": 1686070755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593758642673492432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139478699": {"recommendationid": "139478699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060051029", "num_games_owned": 966, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1685797435}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel guilty leaving a bad review here but i will also leave a few ideas to make the game better.\n\nAnyone can feel the love behind this project, but in terms of game-play, it is a disaster.\nI played with my wife and it is so stiff.\nSometimes you have to take decisions in half a second but the screen doesn't follow fast enough.\nYou end up not being able to see your character, the level or anything a all.\nSome places are too dark and you don't know where to go or what to do.\nYou will die once somewhere and try the exact same jump but this time it will be OK.\nIn general, the level design is unclear and the controls are unresponsive. \nTo sum it all up, lots of frustrating deaths.\n\nThere are bonuses in this game, little documentaries that look really interesting, but you will have to finish the broken game to unlock it all.

You trek through a never-ending blizzard to save your family from the devastating storm, traveling through several different regions of Alaska while encountering dangerous situations including the environment, wildlife, and a fire wielding man. You swap between Nuna and Fox to solve environmental puzzles in single player or control both simultaneously in local coop.  While short and relatively linear, it is fun to progress using different abilities corresponding to Fox and Nuna. The environments and atmosphere are gorgeous with beautiful scenery, moody atmospheric music, and large set pieces you parkour across. Despite being sidescrollers, the 3D backdrops help to expand the scope of the world around you. The game also does a great job  educating players about I\u00f1upiat culture through optional educational videos that double as exploration collectables. These videos are very interesting, heartfelt and help reinforce the messages and themes present through the game. Although overall enjoyable, some mechanics such as the Bola and spirit manipulation are awkward to use quickly and effortlessly, leading to a lot of deaths when the game expects quick actions dependent on these mechanics. This might be easier to use in coop, which I have not tested personally. There was also some occasional collision and geometry issues when jumping or climbing but these were not game breaking or frequent. The optional Fox Tales DLC adds a few extra environments to explore with more challenging puzzles and more cultural insights videos. If you love games like Stray and can overlook a few rough edges, Never Alone is a very cool experience that can be casually enjoyed through in an evening.

You play as a little girl trying to find the source of a blizzard that is affecting her village, and as you play you are introduced into her culture: the I\u00f1upiat/Inupiaq people.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a simple platformer with clever puzzles, beautiful art style, and very immersive music. The art of the game is a major point, the character feels really relatable with her animations, expressions, and overall interactions with the little fox. You can switch back and forth between her and the little fox in order to solve puzzles, I haven't tried it in co-op but I bet it's a nice 'couples game' to enjoy with someone. Also, the game runs very well, only had 1 bug during the entire playthrough and it wasn't really a big deal.\n\nThe documentary part relies on videos, as you play you discover parts of lore which allow you to watch real-life videos about the I\u00f1upiat culture. Before playing this game I didn't know anything about these people, and this is one of the things I like about videogames, they can be fun but they can also be educational while keeping its entertainment level. The videos are really well done, good interviews, short and to the point so as not to bore you, good background music, subtitled, overall great production value.\n\nThe game isn't very long, but that's ok, it's a short nice little adventure which also teaches you about a bit of real-life Alaskan culture, took me around 4-5 hours to complete, I was taking my time enjoying it so it can probably be completed in 3-4 hours, or more if you are like me and want to take your time.\n\nGreat job by the developement team.", "timestamp_created": 1674245572, "timestamp_updated": 1674245572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620530962944030762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131140157": {"recommendationid": "131140157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064901169", "num_games_owned": 1225, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1674069615}, "language": "english", "review": "Many bugs, bad controls, many cultural insights don't work, many boring moments", "timestamp_created": 1674127386, "timestamp_updated": 1674127386, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491351604461669922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131117677": {"recommendationid": "131117677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968417790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1672191339}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game!

Reading others' reviews, it seems I am not alone, though I AM recommending the game because of the visuals - titles and fonts, color choices, art styles, etc - and I loved the integration of video game and story-telling, not to mention the puzzles. The addition of the interviews and personal stories made it all worth it.\n\nI did not try co-op (see controller issues below).\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nVague spoilers included below.\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe rest of this is venting (hence some bad grammar), and hopefully will get to the developers, because I'd really love to play this game all the way through again, frustration-free (besides the actual puzzles) if they ever did an update.\n\nI tried to play with the controller, died about 30 times in the first two minutes of the game because I didn't realize the fox and Nuna were supposed to jump together AND the fact that I couldn't switch between the characters added to my confusion. Tried to switch to mouse and keyboard, but couldn't even exit the game by using the controller (only pause which gave me the option to resume game or view the controller config that didn't even work). Ctrl+Shift+Esc > End Task. Start back up, try mouse and keyboard. Ok for the most part, except when 'swimming' mechanic presents itself. Tried to switch back to controller at one point to show my husband the problems I was having, but had to exit game to do so. Of course, THIS time, I could switch between characters..... For about 30 seconds. Broke again. Can't exit game, so Ctrl+Shift+Esc > End Task, restart game, hellbent on finishing the game, therefore stuck with horrible mouse and keyboard config. All-in-all, probably died 200+ times (no exaggeration), and ended up looking up walkthroughs because I was literally getting a headache from how frustrated I was. And for this kind of story immersion, it should not be rage-inducing.\n\nOther random issues: \n\nWhile viewing the cultural insights, upon clicking one, it wouldn't go anywhere, just back to the cultural insights menu (sometimes I had to click on one two or three times, this happened with probably 5 between main game and DLC). \n\nGame would occasionally go to the menu when I was in the middle of gameplay (possible fat-finger, but seems unlikely to hit escape while using default configs)\n\nController I was using is an off-brand PS controller that works absolutely fine in other games, so maybe this is why buttons would stop working? Also with the controller, I tried using the bola at one point, and couldn't figure out how to 'release' it (whereas with the mouse, it's a click-hold-aim-release mechanic). I did not look up a solution since using the controller wasn't working and I was just testing that feature with it at one point. \n\nOne game mechanic that was irritating (though possibly due to using mouse/keyboard and/or user error) was the 'commanding spirits' - sometimes it would respond quickly, and other times it would be very slow.", "timestamp_created": 1672349147, "timestamp_updated": 1672349345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129618145": {"recommendationid": "129618145", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161684501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1671893834}, "language": "english", "review": "Its local game and cant play multiplayer on long distance", "timestamp_created": 1672333364, "timestamp_updated": 1672333364, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129439426": {"recommendationid": "129439426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002510878", "num_games_owned": 931, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1661011232}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game to play shared screen coop.

I love the setting of this game. I love how much real world culture is in the game. I love the optional live action cut-scenes where a lot of the lore is revealed. But...\n\nAs a game \"Never Alone\" is pretty annoying to play. The physics are jank as hell. The weather is hard to read and in numerous sections of the game the weather changes after each jump. The AI will often jump to it's death, which causes you to fail. The hitboxes are all over the place. The characters are easy to get stuck in the physics system; I accidentally got the main girls' character model stuck twice in a single play through. The game is very inconsistent.\n\n\"Never Alone\" should have been a very relaxing adventure game. It has soft music and cute visuals. And for the most part it is a nice relaxing game, but that only makes the inevitable jank you experience that much more frustrating. You will run into sections of the game that will piss you off not because you are a bad gamer, but because the game is simply poorly implemented.\n\nThis game is better when played 2-player. If you have 2 players you won't be reliant on the poor AI not to kill itself and things will be generally faster since you don't have to swap characters to solve puzzles. However, playing as the fox is boring; the girl does the majority of the activities. So while it is better with 2-players it is also an imbalanced experience.\n\nLastly, the game is too simple and short. It is a pretty bare-bones 2D platformer that you will likely complete in less than 4 hours, and I don't have a strong urge to replay it personally. There are unfortunately just a lot of better games out there. It's not a bad game, but this is a genre with a ton of competition and \"Never Alone\" is at best another average game in the genre. If you are a die-hard fan of 2D adventure games then you will likely enjoy it, but if you are on the fence I would hold off on this one.\n\nHere are some other games on Steam I would recommend over \"Never Alone\":\n- Journey\n- Little Nightmares\n- Ori and the Blind Forest & Ori and the Will of the Wisps\n- Limbo & Inside\n- Celeste\n- Spiritfarer", "timestamp_created": 1667262071, "timestamp_updated": 1667262071, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730713009834289551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124414775": {"recommendationid": "124414775", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994135829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 239, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1666791697}, "language": "english", "review": "A casual action, puzzle game with a nice art style and an informative story.

The bite-sized documentary-style videos about the Inupiaq culture are very interesting, and they tie into the game well and always leave you waiting for the next one.\nDoes this game succeed as a game, though? I'd say well enough, but nothing extraordinary. The characters and the little fox are cute in the game's art style. The puzzles are more finicky than actually difficult. The weird thing with the story, though, is that it feels very... generic. It's a very specific story from a very specific real-life people, but honestly it's one that contains very common themes and a very common structure. It's the type of story you've already seen a hundred variations on, you've seen it embellished and appropriated and blended with other stories and other aesthetics and other emotions, but that's just it... this is one of those base stories that all those variations are based on.

Never Alone trata de contarnos historia como se ha hecho desde la antiguedad, donde los ancianos explicaban a los mas jovenes cuentos alrededor del calido fuego de la hoguera. La trama, basada uno de esos cuentos populares del pueblo \"I\u00f1upiaq\" y relatada como tal, explica como una chica junto a su zorro deber\u00e1 descubrir que es lo que causan las incesantes ventiscas que atormentan a su pueblo.\nEn un principio este juego esta pensado para dos jugadores como Unravel 2 o It Takes Two. Pero, que en parte, se hace disfrutable en solitario, pues sus mec\u00e1nicas permiten cambiar de jugador durante la partida. Cada personaje tiene distintas hablilidades con las que se necesitaran el uno al otro para seguir avanzando. \nLa duraci\u00f3n, pese a que es corta (2'30''), no se siente incompleta. A parte, depende de la edici\u00f3n que compremos, nos vendr\u00e1 incluido un DLC (Foxtales) de 1h de duraci\u00f3n aproximada que no defrauda en ning\u00fan aspecto. Todo esto complementado con distintos fragmentos de video que recuerdan a los de un museo, donde en cada uno de ellos, nativos \"I\u00f1upiaq\" nos contaran sus historias y tradiciones.

I got all achievements, so you should know I went through the whole game. To be honest, I have mixed feelings about it. While I liked the way Alaskan Native culture was presented and explored throughout the game, and I believe this medium was fairly appropriate for telling the story, it has some pretty big problems gameplay-wise, which can make playing it to the end quite frustrating and annoying. There are three main problems: \n- Movement problems: I thought most movement problems had to do with me playing it with mouse and keyboard, and so I went for a couple of missed achievements with a controller; sadly, it didn't really help. While some things were easier with the controller, others (like aiming the ball and string thing you throw) were painfully worse; it basically balanced out, and it ended up being the same, annoying experience. \n- The game ends up becoming too repetitive pretty soon, and the new mechanics they slowly introduce, come around way too late and way too sporadically to make it engaging.\n- When playing single player, the AI controlling the second character is plainly awful. Sometimes, the other character will jump to their death, or blatantly stand up in front of an enemy and get caught. The amount and variety of ways you can die in this game, along with the character reactions to them, is pretty impressive; however, they too grow old and become annoying when you are doomed to repeat some stuff because your partner simply decided to jump off a cliff.  \n\nGiven those problems, I can't fully recommend this; however, I can't also recommend against it, since it has some meaningful content that's interesting and can make up for those flaws. All in all, I decided for a thumbs up, but take it with a grain of salt: it's definitely a neutral review (and it would be a neutral rating if one existed).", "timestamp_created": 1655610138, "timestamp_updated": 1655610138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117104562": {"recommendationid": "117104562", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998873407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1655432532}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun, short, cultural, historical, 2D, puzzle platformer.

It's rare that a game teaches you about a culture you never knew anything about, documentary-style, and gets you really invested in their lore. Using the medium of a video game to do so was genius and it flows beautifully because of the traditional allegorical storytelling that Native Alaskans and other First Peoples incorporate into their daily lives. I found myself really caring about the collectables, which were not too hard to find, because I wanted to see more of the film footage, documentary-style clips that accompany this game's menu. If you don't want to see them, however, it's optional unless you want achievements.\n\nSpeaking of achievements, for achievement hunters this is a pretty easy game to 100%. If you miss any collectibles, there is a chapter select feature. But now I get to the negatives. I played this game with a companion on Remote Play and while our lag can not be blamed on this game, the sometimes frustrating controls and platforming left us needing to take frequent breaks. There is an item called a Bola that one character must use to throw and knock down things such an ice blocks and it has no aiming reticule. A gamepad is recommended, yet aiming with the Bola becomes less natural with it, so it is up to personal preference.\n\nUltimately, if you are interested in foxes, Native history, and allegorical storytelling then this might be one to check out. If you're easily frustrating by finicky platforming and weird controls - while this game might be pretty easy - definitely get it on a big sale.\n\nCheck out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/catizens/curation][b]Catizens Curations[/b][/url] for more fox games and more!", "timestamp_created": 1647921934, "timestamp_updated": 1647921934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680345833301544189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112594254": {"recommendationid": "112594254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432220275", "num_games_owned": 773, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1647870545}, "language": "english", "review": "it was a nice co-op exprience.", "timestamp_created": 1647870589, "timestamp_updated": 1647870589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112578131": {"recommendationid": "112578131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030288058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1653119065}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a heartwarming story.

I fondly recall a story a woman told of her older brother having to raise polar bear cubs after he killed the mother in self defense, and how the woman would ride them \"like horses\"! lmao \n\nThere's other gems in the interviews, like a man explaining how he can gauge how many inches down the ice levels are, and how they determine when ice will shift and it's time to move to a new area. Of course, mythological stories are also featured, and they're lovely. It was so cool to learn the true mythos origins of the Northern Lights, and that one I won't spoil---you have to hear it from the people themselves. \n\nAlaska Natives rarely get representation within American culture even, so I think purchasing this game and giving it a play, especially when it has coop (perfect game for playing through with a gf tbh), is so needed! It doesn't feature any violence at all either, and there's no combat--just escapes from close encounters with polar bears or mythos creatures. It would be a great educational buy for parents, that is still fully a game and charming. \n\nThere is precision platforming in this, so if you're someone who enjoys walking simulators that tell a story, this won't be it. But I strongly encourage to try it anyway, the platforming and timing within the game makes sense. Alaska Natives deal with the harshest form of life, the worst predators, true and complete darkness, and even the ground below their feet is not trustworthy. This game features mechanics of shifting ground and blizzard winds that require precision, but it's used to tell the full story and I think was implemented well. \n\nThe story itself is a popular mythological tale in their culture, and it is edited slightly to incorporate other cultural references and stories within it. The original story also featured a man, one of the interviews revealed, but they wanted to give the representation and platform to a woman----which is think is so endearing and beautiful in itself, that people who receive such little representation in general still wanted that representation to be of their women. <3 \n\nI learned A LOT from this title, and after completing it, I rushed to tell my friends' some of the interview anecdotes I learned.

It's rare to see a narrative-based game like this that evokes so much passion for its source material. It's also very interesting to see a game delve into a specific culture that is, presumably, not very well known by most people; a niche. Additionally, the art style is very unique from any game I've seen before. It is undoubtedly a very beautiful game overall.\n\n[Cons] My primary cons regard gameplay mechanics and it was immediately obvious that this game was gonna be a chore to play through because of them. Firstly, the controls can be pretty frustrating to work with (I played using a controller). The characters move very awkwardly, almost drunkenly, which makes platforming very difficult at times. This brings me to my second complaint: the camera. In Never Alone, you control two separate characters which you have to switch between in order to complete puzzles. However, the characters will move on their own regardless of which character you play as. This simple \"mechanic\" led to me dying numerous times unknowingly and it had a tendency to awkwardly ruin beautiful moments in the game. That in combination with the awkward controls makes the entire experience an abysmal hassle to deal with. Lastly, the puzzles can be unnecessarily confusing and tough. I personally love a challenging puzzle, but a lot of these puzzles didn't make a lot of sense. I also found that many of them will lead you to believe the puzzle has a different solution (the polar bear puzzles were the biggest offender). The use of the environment in puzzles was also unnecessarily challenging a lot of the time.  \n\nOverall, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a really short, sweet adventure that has an interesting and engaging story to experience. However, with all of its cons, it can ultimately ruin what is otherwise a very emotional and unique experience. Polar bears and caribou feet will probably be the least of your concerns when playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1643875566, "timestamp_updated": 1643875566, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109330681": {"recommendationid": "109330681", "author": {"steamid": "76561199240383646", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1643818541}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like the design of this game with how it has informational insights into the culture during the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is unplayable for me.

I think, having completed it now, I see exactly why the game was so hot at the time, and why it hasn't been mentioned since.\n\nWhat the game is doing is novel -- a video game adaptation of traditional Alaskan native folktales, and it really goes out of its way to let you know it's doing that. The narration is voiced by one of the storytellers (in his native tongue, no less), and the unlocks in the game are small clips that talk about their way of life and cultural traditions and beliefs. Art in the cutscenes is based on traditional scrimshaw, and zany mythological beasties and spirits abound.\n\nUnfortunately, that's pretty much all of the substance the game is bringing. Nowadays, it smacks of woke culture by constantly and insistently rubbing in the player's face just how very much this narrative and setting are tradition...and I suppose the implication is that just because something is traditional, that is inherently meritorious?\n\nI can't say I agree. The world is full of stories, and many are much more interesting than the one Never Alone tells, and many are much better told and better explored.\n\nThe gameplay just isn't very good. The puzzles aren't any more in-depth or engaging than solving the problem of how to move to the next platform ad nauseum. The AI companion several times jumped straight to their death, forcing a restart on me, and several other times, moved or disappeared the platform I was jumping from/to, making me jump to [i]my[/i] death. Inputs feel floaty and droppy, ledge grabs are inconsistent yet required nearly everywhere, and good input design, like coyote time, buffered inputs, or even being able to gracefully change facing are all extremely noticeably absent. \n\nWhich is a shame, because the broad strokes of a great game are in here. Delving into interesting lore and mythos of other cultures is incredibly engaging, and the potential of a co-op platformer has been proven again and again.

They have an ethereal look that matches their ability.\n+ Animators made the fox move/act incredibly like a real fox.\n+ Narration is comforting, like a grandparent telling you a bedtime story.\n+ Voice acting, while basic (grunts and groans), sound natural and not forced.\n+ Cultural Insights are fascinating and--for lack of a better term--very insightful.  Plus, watching them in the middle of a playthrough doesn't disrupt the game.\n+ Platforming and puzzles are challenging.  Unsure as to how they are with a second player but for single players, a lot of brainpower is required.\n+ If you do get stuck, the game offers hints via symbols of where to go and/or throw the bola.\n\nNOT SO GOOD\n- Characters are prone to getting stuck to walls, whether on land or underwater.\n- Aiming with the bola can be difficult.  Despite using Nuna's non-throwing arm as a guide, there were many times I missed the mark.\n\nRANDOM\n~ I'll never see the Northern Lights and Steamed Hams the same way again.\n~ Part of the ending didn't make sense to me (ex. something breaks but eh, it's fine), though it might just be because I'm not of I\u00f1upiat descent.\n~ I was expecting new playable characters in the Foxtales DLC, but got the main game characters instead.  Though I was slightly disappointed, it was nice to see Nuna and Fox again.\n~ Some Cultural Insights are in hard to reach places and I was SO upset I couldn't get all of them.\n\nOVERALL\nHighly recommend this game for adventure, puzzle, and education.

Based on a traditional tale, you are going through the Arctic as Nuna and Fox to help your village survive the endless blizzards. The more you progress and discover hidden elements in-game, the more you unlock video insights from Inupiat elders, storytellers that act as a 30-minute documentary into the Inupiat culture and reality that you can watch later.\n\nMechanically speaking, the game was frustrating, the controls weren\u2019t great, and aiming the bola (your weapon/tool), was a complete chore. Playing the game alone was tedious but with a friend (thanks [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/spoonkillerxd]Lukara[/url]), it made the experience extremely fun, and we laughed a lot while discovering the stories of the Inupiat. This way of incorporating a documentary into a game is unique and I honestly learned a lot about a community I knew nothing about.\n\nIf you have no interest in learning about the Inupiat and just care about another platformer, skip it. If there's no one else to play it with, try it but the experience won't be optimal. Though, if you want to take the 3 hours to discover a new world, remove the dust from it in your Steam library and dive into another culture, go for it.

They are just all over the place. Whenever you die the camera often goes crazy and zooms in the right corner for no reason, or when one of the characters glitches stuck somewhere and cant get out. When spirits randomly dissaper causing the main character to fall to her doom. Just by playing through the game normally you will encounter several of them, to the point that it becomes one of the games main challenges.\n\n-  the controls feel weird and really bad. You often get strange momentum that causes you to miss jumps, and therefore die unfair deaths, not even to mention the snowstorms, that blow in a certain direction meaning you have to wait until the snow blows in your direction before making a jump. Plus, You constantly have to switch between Fox and Nuna because of the next point.\n\n- bad AI. If your playing this game alone, like me, the second character will be used by an AI. The problem is, that this AI fails to do simple tasks like climbing up a rope, doing a difficult jump, swinging a weapon, interacting with the spirits, etc. Meaning you have to constantly switch between Fox and Nuna. \n\n- I sometimes found myself stuck, not knowing where to go, or how to progress, so I had to go to YouTube to look at a playthrough of the game. \n\noverall: I like the concept and it would be a truly great game if it wasn't for the bugs and bad controls.

The whole thing has been created in collaboration with people grew up in this culture.\nI'm taking some time to explain all of this because, in my opinion, such an attempt is already an ambitious undertaking worth looking into. But does it succeeds at its attempts?\nIf you see this game as a way of learning something, yes, definitely. It showcases inuit art, language, a tale, and information. Some of this content may feel like spoon feeding, so it was a good call to make some of it optional.\nThe animation is nice, both in game and in the cinematics. The art direction in general is very coherent and nicely executed. I especially enjoyed the lighting effects on the ice and snow. The gameplay on the other hand is okay but could have done with a little more polish to make it more enjoyable. Some phases were somewhat unclear or frustrating to play, and I did run into the occasional collision bug. I sadly didn't play with someone, so maybe it makes the experience harder. It doesn't make it bad, and I managed to finish the story in 3,5 hours + watch all the interviews I unlocked.\nThe two main characters are endearing, even without a line of dialogue. The story is nice and has some good surprises.\n\nSo all in all, Never Alone isn't a great platformer, but that's not what you play it for.

It's not a major thing, but it does take away from the \"beauty\" of the game.  It just doesn't seem like it would have been that far of a stretch to do the in between graphics at least close to the game play graphics.  \n\nThe only other gripe was the inconsistency of the movement.  Sometimes you would need to \"grab\" and move something, and the first time you do it, nothing happens.  Sometimes your character would get stuck in a location, or on a ladder, and then 5 seconds later fall off completely out of control.  A lot of deaths were from bad movement.  It wasn't terribly frustrating though because the game is more than generous with the savepoints.\n\nI got this in a bundle, so I got it cheap.  It's pretty short, about 3 or so hours.

To get from each area to the next, you need to maneuver the girl and the fox to jump across gaps, climb cliffs, and avoid dangers. The girl can shoot ice with her bolo to break it, while the fox can summon tribal spirits to help get through the area. One player can switch which character to control (like the LEGO games), or two players can control both at the same time. I wouldn't say it's a particularly noteworthy platformer, though. There are no lives or items and there's no backtracking; you've just got to figure out the puzzle of how to get through the area, and you've got to have enough manual dexterity to maneuver two characters through it (unless you're playing with a friend).\n\nOn another level, it's a story. read aloud in a native Alaskan tongue while subtitles appear on-screen. I enjoyed being exposed to the language, and the spirits summoned by the fox were fascinatingly weird-looking with their tribal designs (especially the Aurora Borealis, which here becomes a wonderfully-designed obstacle). But the story itself was a typical tribal kind of story, just a sequence of strange events happening. There's no plot to it, no character development.\n\nAnd on a third level, it's an educational tool. Playing through the game unlocks documentary videos about the tribe and its heritage which can be played at any point. These have a good production value, but I only watched two of them until I got bored and wanted to return to the game.\n\nThe game's title, \"Never Alone,\" isn't really relevant to the game. My best guess is that it means the girl is never alone even when she's separated from her people because the fox is always with her - but there's nothing in the story that's nearly this introspective. Also, I completed the game in two and a half hours (even after multiple tries on some areas), so $14.99 might not be a worthwhile price for such a short game.\n\nThere could have been some slight replayability to this game, because it keeps track of how many \"cultural insights\" (unlockable videos) you find in each area. Unfortunately, these are hidden achievements, so that even if you [i]know[/i] it's keeping track of these, there's no way to see how many you've found until you've found them all.\n\nIf you enjoy a puzzle platformer with a story being read to you in an unusual language while you unlock documentary videos, then this game is just your thing.

The game is clearly made for two players, but has a single player version where you can swap back and forth between the two main characters. While this style of game play is not new, this particular game's adaptation of it is not very fun.\n\n The controls have a very clunky feel which you can definitely adapt to, but many of the late game puzzles depend on your ability to do a lot of precise maneuvering while flipping back and forth between the two characters and doing it all at speed or with some kind of timer. A lot of time was spent dying on puzzles simply because it wasn't clear which area I was supposed to jump to next and the AI of the character you aren't actively in control of is unreliable and frequently that character will just sit still or wander away, not allowing the camera to pan far enough to see parts of the puzzles or deactivating puzzle elements mid jump. \n\nWhile I would not recommend this game for the game play aspects, I will recommend it for the documentary style insights about the Inupiaq people. I learned a lot and was quite charmed with the way the game incorporates the story telling and visual elements of Inupiaq culture into the game.

The narration was great, I like the fact that instead of English the narration was done in of the Alaska's Inuit languages which goes perfectly with the theme of this game. The sounds also fit the game just fine, it is not something that will blow your mind (or rather ears) but it is neither good or bad. The graphics are okay. The gameplay can be a little frustrating because Nuna sometimes gets stuck (and unstuck in 5 seconds), it gets annoying, especially, at the end where you have to escape from one of the enemies.

You're on a quest to stop the storm that's threatening your village. On your way, you deal with everything that the harsh conditions of the Arctic Tundra have to offer. Your progression is accompanied by a documentary film interviewing real natives, addressing themes you come across, such as traditions, hunting and even global warming. Experiencing everything, including that short DLC, will get you almost 5 hours in playtime.\n\nMechanically, the game is very raw and clunky, lacking in level design (which is pretty generic and uninspired in many sections) and polish. The girl character can shoot a bola, run, jump, swim, row a bot and carry/throw items. The fox can run, jump, swim and interact with spirits in the game world that act as dynamic movable platforms. While controlling one, the other character follows (also performing jumps and climbing). Platforming is mostly not demanding, but there are some Limbo-esque precise platforming sequences that can annoy you, mainly due to the game not communicating what will kill you in a clear manner. The wind element is probably the only interesting gameplay feature, as it pushes you around.\n\nArt style is cute for a few minutes, but nothing to write home about. There's a Inuit narrator talking some jibrish here and there and not adding much to the experience.\n\nOverall, I wanted to like this one, but it just didn't click for me.

That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad; far from it, actually! Never Alone is more of an interactive story and documentary than a game, but the combination was certainly refreshing, and quite honestly a pleasure.\n\nIn Never Alone, you start off with a couple of documentary and interview style videos (insights), introducing you to the premise of the game. You then take on the role of a young girl and her arctic fox companion as you venture out into the land to find the source of all the blizzards in her village. You can play with a friend in co-op but, naturally, I played solo. Along the way, you unlock more insights, providing the background behind something you\u2019ve just experienced or you\u2019re about to experience. These are accounts taken from actual Inupiaq and reflect their experiences, allowing the game to portray certain aspects of their lives, beliefs, and stories.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2435674369\n\nThe gameplay is simple. It\u2019s a side-scroller with some basic platforming and puzzle elements, but quite frankly, I don\u2019t think it needed to be anything more than that. I wasn\u2019t expecting an action packed FPS anyway, and the experience was a rather educational and insightful one, and done in a way that kept me engaged throughout. If you\u2019re one of the people who skips videos and dialogue in a game then you\u2019ll likely be disappointed with the gameplay, so don\u2019t skip them; play the game for what it is, embracing all of its content.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2435674572\n\nThe Foxtales DLC adds a separate little story with the same characters, lasting somewhere around 50 minutes. It\u2019s not quite as charming as the base game, but the puzzle elements require slightly more thought (not drastically more). It\u2019s certainly worth experiencing if you enjoy the main game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2435675308\n\nI\u2019d say Never Alone is perfect for all ages, and a great way to relax and learn something new about a different region and people; one that I knew very little about to begin with. I actually made the \u201cmistake\u201d of starting the game at around 23:30, thinking I\u2019d play for half an hour or so and finish up the following day. Of course, I didn\u2019t want to stop once I started and ended up finishing the game in one sitting, somewhere between two and a half and three hours later. No regerts! Of course, for any achievement hunters out there, these ones are quick and easy to get, although the last four do require the Foxtales DLC.\n\n[quote]For more reviews follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33506892/]Gawain Games Curator Page[/url] and check out the [url=https://gawain-games.com/]Gawain Games Website[/url].

No pude encontrar mucho positivo para poder recomendarlo. Es un juego muy corto, por tratarse de una aventura en scroll 2D y plataforma presenta muy poco desaf\u00edo y muy pocas mec\u00e1nicas. Hay un par de puzzles muy sencillos que resultan m\u00e1s molestos que otra cosa (sobre todo los del DLC) debido a controles toscos y una IA deficiente,  y si bien la historia esta bien, esta  tampoco termina por salvar el juego.\nOpino que es una grand\u00edsima idea la de traer a los videojuegos algo tan atractivo como el folklore y las leyendas de las tribus esquimales, en este caso los Inupiat ya que sus costumbres y sus creencias son extraordinarias; pero realmente siento que estuvo muy desaprovechado el potencial. Tambi\u00e9n despu\u00e9s de todo hay que tener en cuenta que es un juego de un desarrollo bastante humilde.\nEl juego cuenta con cooperativo ya que hay dos protagonistas principales en la aventura. Lo pase la primera vez con un amigo y la verdad no nos atrapo en ning\u00fan momento. La segunda vuelta la di solo, alternando entre los dos personajes y en donde la computadora te ayudara a controlar el segundo personaje en momentos cr\u00edticos o claves, o mientras tu avanzas por el escenario. Bueno resulta que la ineptitud de la inteligencia artificial, las primeras 30 veces que mor\u00ed por su culpa me resulto gracioso y hasta entretenido\u2026. Pero despu\u00e9s ya no, por obvias razones. Jugarlo en solitario es sumamente frustrante y aburrido. Sobre todo el DLC.\nSolo comprar en una oferta regalada, ya que tampoco es muy caro despu\u00e9s de todo. La verdad es que termine nervioso despu\u00e9s de jugar esto. Y eso es ir\u00f3nico ya que a medida que la trama avanza el juego comparte una historia hermosamente narrada que cuenta y habla de la sabidur\u00eda de los pueblos, el respeto por la fauna, el amor de las familias y las ra\u00edces\u2026 para que vos despu\u00e9s estr\u00e9s trabado y muriendo sin parar en una plataforma sencilla con p\u00e9simos controles y una IA sumamente deficiente\u2026.

Y no, ya se lo que est\u00e1n pensando, y si, se pueden cambiar (por que son un par de teclas las que usas lol), pero aun cambi\u00e1ndolos son una mierda.\n\nPara explicarles y que entiendan mi punto, yo hab\u00eda jugado Never Alone versi\u00f3n pirata hace unos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s y lo deje porque hay una lucha con un enemigo especifico donde tienes que ir controlando al zorro y unas ramas para que el enemigo no te mate con sus bolas de fuego, PERO LOS PUTOS CONTROLES SON TAN MIERDA QUE DESPU\u00c9S DE 320154654 INTENTOS TERMINE NO SOLO SACANDO EL JUEGO, SINO ELIMIN\u00c1NDOLO. Pero como pueden ver... lo compre en Steam y me lo pase todo.\n\nAdemas, prep\u00e1rate para morir DEMASIADAS VECES (Dark Souls, quien sos? jajaj). Vas a morir tantas veces que puedes que vayas a buscar un v\u00eddeo en Youtube o una gu\u00eda en Google, A\u00daN CUANDO SABES LO QUE TENES QUE HACER, PERO COMO VAS A MORIR TANTAS VECES ya empezas a dudar sobre vos mismo y tu inteligencia. \nPero... porque vas a morir tantas veces? Los controles, y la posici\u00f3n de la c\u00e1mara, pero sobre todo porque este juego esta hecho para ser jugado en CO-OP y realmente se nota. Si pensas jugar solo, ten en cuenta que vas a morir el doble que jugando con alguien, ya que la AI es pat\u00e9tica y muy mala. Y hay situaciones en donde si saltas un cent\u00edmetro mas o menos de donde tenes que saltar, el juego no lo registra bien y terminas muriendo o el enemigo que te persigue te mata, porque no hay una dificultad para elegir y todo es extremadamente dif\u00edcil.\n\nEntiendo que este juego puede ser el primer proyecto/juego de estos devs, pero por el amor de jeb\u00fas, como no testearon los controles de los personajes y la c\u00e1mara antes de publicar el juego?? es que no se entiende, dios mio, nunca me hab\u00eda tocado jugar un juego con unos controles, una c\u00e1mara y opciones de guardado autom\u00e1ticos tan malos.\nSep, los auto guardados tambi\u00e9n se bugean y van a tener que andar saliendo al men\u00fa y volver a jugar porque ni cargando el punto de control anterior se arregla el problema.\n\nY se preguntaran, pero como es entonces que si tiene unos controles tan mierda por que dec\u00eds que hay cosas buenas? bueno es simple, los relatos me engancharon y realmente me gusto como los devs supieron captar la esencia de la tribu en la que esta basada la historia del juego.\n\nAl avanzar la historia del juego puedes ir desbloqueando relatos, que son v\u00eddeos cortos que cuentan y nos muestran cosas sobre la vida, la alimentaci\u00f3n, la vestimenta, la conexi\u00f3n entre los animales, la tierra y los integrantes de la tribu, el calentamiento global, etc.\nEs como un mini documental que expande la historia del juego. Y realmente creo que los devs pudieron captar todo eso de manera excelente sin ser irrespetuosos o cambiar aspectos importantes sobre la vida de esas personas.\n\nLa verdad que si no fuera por esos relatos hubiera abandonado por segunda vez este juego sin dudarlo, la historia en si no es buena pero no sabr\u00eda explicar si es por los controles, los personajes, o por el giro que da la historia cerca del final. Se puede decir que es una combinaci\u00f3n de todas esas cosas malas que arruinan la experiencia del juego y por el cual hay tantas rese\u00f1as negativas en Steam.\n\n[b]Pero igual recomiendo jugar el DLC ''FOXTALES'', me encanto y fue 546516546 veces mejor que la historia principal, sobre todo ese final feliz con el peque\u00f1o nuevo amigo \u2665, ademas de tener una leve mejor\u00eda en los controles.[/b]\n\n[u]Para cerrar esta rese\u00f1a...solo recomiendo el juego si realmente queres jugar algo nuevo en el sentido de que se diferencia de los t\u00edpicos juegos indie, pero si no soportas que los controles sean horribles y sos de esos que rage quit bastante, entonces no lo compres.\nY si lo compran, que sea con un 85-90% de descuento.[/u]\n\n5/10, no lo volver\u00eda a jugar y mejor ir\u00eda a ver un let's play en youtube.", "timestamp_created": 1613780773, "timestamp_updated": 1613781635, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87037836": {"recommendationid": "87037836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409456664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1613679023}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful little game. \nControls are sometimes a bit clunky, especially (sorry for being vague, don't want to spoil it) the fox' special ability.\nTook me 7 hours to play through both Main game and DLC, including watching the insights.\nThat means, compared to other games, the default price is a bit steep, especially since there's not really a reason for replaying... maybe at least a \"don't die\" Achievement or something?\nI would recommend waiting for a sale, but definitely getting it.", "timestamp_created": 1613754516, "timestamp_updated": 1613754516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86906116": {"recommendationid": "86906116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857718155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1613593533}, "language": "english", "review": "Really blurs the lines between a game and a documentary, which places it firmly as a rare breed.

Listen to all of these negatives comments, they are all stupid. Its not supposed to be an online game, its supposed to be frustrating, no the controls arent laggy or buggy, every game has glitches but the ones in this game i dont find affected my gameplay at all, and no its not repetitive. You need to understand this is a small community game not some AAA title. For the type of game that this is its fantastic but other people dont see it that way and thats annoying they dont take for granted this cultural small game ran by a lesser known company, give it a break. This game IS worth FULL price along with the Foxtales is like a must have. I didnt want the game to end but all stories end at some point. People are complaining about it not being online, this game isnt supposed to be an online game even for co-op. What so people can play through a short story? Then what? Keep playing the same story with online players? Thats kind of pointless dont you think?????????  What about Ori or Shantae games? Like this one, they are freaking amazing but neither of them are online. Stop taking for granted all these new insane graphics and online experiences of other games. This is supposed to be a short story game. If you want some high end fps or open world go to COD or GTA not this game, thats not what this game is aiming towards. At least respect the company for trying to make something nice. Other then that, this game for what it is, is fantastic. Shut up haters. Not every game is made to be online and not every game is made to be the best game you ever played. Grow up. This game for me is just enough to be a must play for anyone no matter what games you play, if you like puzzle games that take some brain power then try this one, specifically the foxtales DLC was harder then the main story. My only complaint with the fox tales DLC is that is was more then 2 times as short as the main story but its meant to be a DLC not Never Alone 2 so thats okay. The biggest problem with this game which wont even affect most people is that it does not support native 3440x1440 resolution (UWQHD) 21:9 aspect ratio AKA ultra wide. But other then that? I have found 0 problems with this game. It has a 3440x1440 resolution option but for foxtales it was cutting out the bottom and top a little and it was impossible to complete one of the levels so I had to put it back to a 16:9 aspect ratio which is what 90-95% of people are going to be playing on anyways so it doesnt affect the game really what so ever. This is the only reason I took off 2 points on the final rating.

Some platforming sections could be tricky but after several attempts even a slow player like me can pass those.\nThe game is really beautiful and offers a lot of varied locations to run through. There's some jumping, swimming and light puzzle solving. A good variety in levels helps a lot to keep this short game fresh until the very end. You'll experience some calm moments and at time you'll run for your lives with your fox.\n\nWhere this game shines is in cut-scenes which has I\u00f1upiat people from Alaska. These are video cut-scenes with real people and i must say it was really enjoyable to watch. So you get a decent platfromer and learn some stuff about native Alaskan people along with a nice legend.\n\nControls could be frustrating because sometimes they're not very precise but not too bad.

Platforming is often not precise enough - not being able to turn during jumping is a big offender, and aiming the bola with the mouse is tricky. I also would have preferred more puzzles and less instakill platforming. This aspect is much better in the DLC though, which is more about puzzles.\n\nThe real highlight of the game is the story and the lore. It is based on Inupiat folk tales, narrated by natives. The game also has short documentary videos that provide insight into their culture. This is nicely complemented with the beautiful visuals, both during the gameplay, and the cutscenes which are done in the style of Inupiat art. The amosphere of the whole game is just great and unique.\n\nSo while gameplay isn\u2019t anything special, the visuals and story are great and memorable.

But she is not alone for a young fox comes with her to lend a paw. But can these two unlikely heroes do it? In a land that with one wrong move could be your death.\n\nNow the likes. The art/graphics style is very beautiful it's just nice to just stop and look at it sometimes. The levels are good and pretty varied from Snowy Tundras, to abandoned villages to even forests.\n\nThe game\u2019s story is very good as it\u2019s told like a fairytale. The atmosphere in the game is very good it can be beautiful and kind of spooky sometimes. The puzzles were Fair and weren't that hard to figure out. The soundtrack/music was very nice especially the part with the owl man music.\n\nThe two best parts were one those cutscenes that were like a scrimshaw art, they were simple yet beautiful very interesting looking. Two those cultural insights were very good it was cool to learn about the I\u00f1upiat culture, way of life and their beliefs.\n\nNow the dislikes. Well there is this big bug in the game; you see the game can be played with a controller. But every time I played with a controller and switched to the fox or the girl the controller would lock up and go into co-op mode and no matter what I did like unplugging the control and plug it back in or switching it back to single player mode, every time I touched that controller it would always go back to co-op mode. \n\nIt was just really frustrating I tried the fix that was in the discussions and it still did not work, but you can still play the game with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe game can be a little awkward to control if you're using the keyboard and mouse instead of a controller. Game can also be a bit short you can probably beat it in 3 hours if you're not going after achievements. Game is also bit expensive for such a short game but not too bad. \n\nOkay with that said Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a cute and beautiful puzzle platformer game, with a very good story, very beautiful art/graphics style and very good insights into the I\u00f1upiat culture. \n\nSo if you want to play an interesting platformer and you want to learn about a different culture then this game could be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1608624682, "timestamp_updated": 1608668040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82859496": {"recommendationid": "82859496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060986520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1464531433}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful game obviously made with a lot of respect for northern american native culture and telling a captivating story.", "timestamp_created": 1608606131, "timestamp_updated": 1608606131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82810464": {"recommendationid": "82810464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045057378", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1609402529}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the game's story, its informative video insights/lectures, its tie to Alaskan Inuit folklore, and the adorable little fox companion. The animation is beautiful and well done; it kind of reminds me of the old claymation shorts. The creature designs are also very imaginative and well drawn.\n\nHowever, I found the controls frustrating at times, especially during chase sequences and the sequence where you ride a tree across a frozen lake. The camera close-ups often don't let you see what obstacles are coming up until they're right on top of you, hints come late, and I often found it difficult to mentally switch between the characters (remembering when to switch, remembering what their controls were, etc.) which got me killed numerous times as I tried to manage through the chases. Further, sometimes the other character will freeze in place while I try to move on, and other times they will try to catch up to the played character and get themselves killed. \n\nIn addition, the fox character became difficult to manage later in the game, as his movements felt like swimming mechanics (hard to manoeuvre at the best of times, worse when trying to complete timed events), and his range for manipulating spirits was often not big enough.\n\nFinally, the instructions for explaining the control keys were often difficult to read due to the font, and the close grouping of the movement keys (A,S,W,D) and \"Switch Characters\" keys (Q and F) on the keyboard often meant that I was accidentally switching characters while trying to run away. \n\nOverall, if you love learning about different cultural beliefs and have the patience for the control issues that I have mentioned, I do recommend playing this game.

Durante la aventura encontraremos en determinados niveles diferentes b\u00fahos que desbloquear\u00e1n un v\u00eddeo determinado cont\u00e1ndonos diferentes aspectos de la cultura I\u00f1upiaq, ya sea su relaci\u00f3n con la naturaleza, sus creencias, o historias personales de diferentes personas, entre otras, y todo con el objetivo de acercar a la gente este pueblo y su mensaje sobre su comprensi\u00f3n del mundo y la naturaleza.\n\nEsto es realmente interesante, y te hace descubrir una manera diferente de comprender las cosas y, adem\u00e1s, ver c\u00f3mo han vivido y viven esas personas en ese ambiente tan sumamente hostil.\n\nPor supuesto, el juego no va de ver v\u00eddeos, obviamente, pero es un excelente a\u00f1adido que hace que toda la experiencia gane muchos enteros en su conjunto.\n\nComo tal, nuestro objetivo es viajar con la peque\u00f1a esquimal atravesando toda clase de peligros y entornos peligrosos para averiguar qu\u00e9 le ha sucedido a nuestro pueblo y por qu\u00e9 han desparecido todos.\n\nDurante la aventura, al principio de la misma m\u00e1s concretamente, nos encontraremos con un zorro \u00e1rtico, el cual nos ayudar\u00e1 utilizando sus habilidades para poder seguir avanzando.\n\nEl juego puede jugarse tanto solo como con alguien, tomando una persona el control de la ni\u00f1a y la otra el control del zorro. Sin embargo, no hay ning\u00fan problema si decidimos jugar solos, ya que tanto el zorro como la ni\u00f1a responden perfectamente por s\u00ed solos.\n\nObviamente, si nos ponemos a hacer idioteces por el entorno, es muy probable que volvamos un poco loca a la IA y el personaje no nos siga tal y como nos gustar\u00eda, pero eso no suele pasar si uno juga como una persona normal. Adem\u00e1s, siempre podremos, y tendremos, que cambiar entre los diferentes personajes para realizar una acci\u00f3n u otra.\n\nEn lo que se refiere al nivel de calidad del plataformeo, yo dir\u00eda que cumple sobradamente, al menos con mando que es como lo jugu\u00e9 yo. Ni es muy f\u00e1cil, ni es injusto. Simplemente te exige un m\u00ednimo razonable para seguir avanzando. Eso no quiere decir que vaya a ser un paseo, eso seguro, ya que moriremos en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, y de dos, a lo largo de nuestra aventura.\n\nEn lo tocante a su calidad gr\u00e1fica, el juego cumple igualmente con soltura. Los entornos est\u00e1n muy bien recreados, as\u00ed como las animaciones de los diferentes personajes que pueblen los diferentes escenarios, especialmente los de la ni\u00f1a, los cuales est\u00e1n a un gran nivel.\n\nLos escenarios son bastante variados, sobre todo si tenemos en cuenta que estamos en el \u00e1rtico, en entornos nevados donde la imaginaci\u00f3n no puede desmadrarse demasiado, pero, aun as\u00ed, habr\u00e1 bastantes momentos de sorpresa durante la aventura.\n\nEn lo referente a la calidad sonora, el juego ofrece unos efectos de sonido y de voces bastante buenos, adem\u00e1s de utilizar el idioma I\u00f1upiaq, haciendo que todo gane mucha mayor verosimilitud.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n del juego es bastante escasa por otro lado, durando unas 4 horas, y si te haces con el DLC, algo que recomiendo, se ir\u00e1 a las 5 en total. El DLC cuenta una historia diferente, con otro mensaje diferente y m\u00e1s v\u00eddeos explicativos acerca de esa historia y del porqu\u00e9 de la misma.\n\nEn definitiva, Nerver Alone es una experiencia realmente sorprendente, donde se une una buena experiencia plataformera con una intenci\u00f3n genuina de dar a conocer una cultura bastante desconocida m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los t\u00f3picos de sobra conocidos. Sin duda, es un t\u00edtulo bastante diferente a lo habitual, y tal vez por eso sea a\u00fan m\u00e1s recomendable.", "timestamp_created": 1606346332, "timestamp_updated": 1606346389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679777026176452637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79680884": {"recommendationid": "79680884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071357475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 381, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1606079960}, "language": "spanish", "review": "HERMOSO!!!!! hacia tantos a\u00f1os que no jugaba un juego tan bello y alucinante en la nieve desde Cryostasis. Obviamente que es un juego de terror y shoter y este es de plataformas. Pero es maravilloso lo bien hecho, ambietado y narrado que esta a pesar de ser un juego de aventura y plataformas. \n\nLa historia es bellisima. No contare ningun detalle porque sino cuento todo el juego. Solo dire que es sumamente emocionante, emotiva, y conmovedora. Por momentos te dan ganas de llorar. Ya que si bien los personajes no hablan por medio de sus gestos y su animacion te encari\u00f1as al instante. Son sumamente entra\u00f1ables. Es una idea super original la de contar una historia acerca de una tribu indigena del artico, narrada en su propio idioma nativo. Vale un monton la pena conocerla.\n\nLa jugabilidad no es muy diferente a las plataformas clasicas. Es trepar paredes, desblokear caminos, vencer enemigos, usar muy bien tus reflejos, tu habilidad, y repite el ciclo. Pero no hay que dejarse enga\u00f1ar por la tematica tierna. Ya que sebes tener mucha presicion para superar los obstaculos, saltando y demas. Ya que ademas entre otras cosas muchos de ellos son contrarreloj. Asi que no te frustres si tenes que hacer en nivel varias veces. \n\nEl partado artistico me parecio hermoso. Ya que es una tematica, que no es ni polemica, ni perturbadora, ni para adultos, para ser buena, y aun asi brilla por si misma. Un muy refinado y delicado estilo de animacion y tambien de estetica. Ya que en este juego te encontras con seres sobrenaturales, pero que no dan miedo, sino que transmiten mucha belleza y pureza. Sin llegar a ser una tematica melosa, o empalagosa. Muy bien logrado.\n\nEl apartado sonoro tambien es fascinante. Le agrega aun mas emocion a los momentos de peligro, y aun mas belleza a la historia. Y en los momentos de tranquilidad te relaja. Espectacular.\n\nEstoy muy contento de haber terminado este juego. Algo distinto y nuevo dentro dentro de las plataformas clasicas.\n\nTOTALMENTE RECOMENDABLE!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1606081276, "timestamp_updated": 1606081276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79481492": {"recommendationid": "79481492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039572032", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1605737592}, "language": "english", "review": "The story line was very good and emotional.

Basically, almost no gameplay, and the little gameplay present is shit.\n\nIn between chapters there are awful cinematics (1st grader style drawings) narrated by a dying yak in what I think is the most audibly unpleasant language I ever heard (and I am from Eastern  EU)!\n\nOnly good thing about this \"game\" is that it takes like an hour to finish, with FurryTales DLC included. Do not be confused by mine ~4hrs of gameplay I did, once I went to take a crap mid game and forgot that I had it minimized for few hours. Music also might be good, but its difficult to enjoy eating creme brulee in a septic tank. \n\nTL;DR: ITS SHIT!", "timestamp_created": 1604019603, "timestamp_updated": 1604019603, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.322580575942993164", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78362224": {"recommendationid": "78362224", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999855544", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1604089749}, "language": "english", "review": "cool story", "timestamp_created": 1604006515, "timestamp_updated": 1604006515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78350641": {"recommendationid": "78350641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968783693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1603993018}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game code with PC Gamer a while back but only recently installed the game.

And it's not even that the puzzles themselves would be difficult. At least the game has many checkpoints, so it doesn't really matter then the characters refuse to jump and decide to just run into water or down a bottomless pit.\n\nThe story itself is quite sweet, and the idea behind the game is empowering. The connection inuit had with nature, the world, and all living things is interesting. Sadly it feels that the narrator doesn't have any emotions and the atmosphere is lacking.\n\nThe two player mode is quite fun, but all the puzzles are made so they can be solved in single player as well, which makes them really one sided and boring when playing co-op. There isn't that much to do for two people.\n\nI would recommend the game for children, if the game wasn't so buggy and controls so broken.

It's fun regardless but it's much more fun with a friend.\n\nI ran into a healthy sum of bugs where I would get stuck in the ice and either had to restart to the last checkpoint or restart the chapter all together, this happened a fair amount of times at certain points of the game. To top of the negativity the game is super short for the asking price, If you're interested in tribal folk-law then this is the game for you but I do strongly suggest getting this on sale.\nTotal Score = 68/100.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nOri and the Blind Forest\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nNever Alone, also known as Kisima In\u014bitchu\u014ba (\"I am not alone\"), is a puzzle-platformer adventure, based on the traditional I\u00f1upiaq tale, \"Kunuuksaayuka\", which was first recorded by master storyteller Robert Nasruk Cleveland in his collection Stories of the Black River People.

Every impact, every crack, every gust of wind was emotionally charged and it made all the difference in gameplay.\n\nAccessibilty rating: C\nThe captions appear on screen as the narrator tells the story, but gameplay is happening while the narrator is speaking which means that I missed some of the story. \n\nControls rating: B\nThe controls were pretty solid, however they mapped the switch character to the right mouse button and the bolas to the left mouse button and sometimes I'd accidentally hit the right mouse button, switch characters, and then plummet to my death.

Upper one games have preserved this story in  a different form to its oral roots - allowing a person to experience the story through a different medium and watch it unfold before their eyes.\n\nIt is said that a boy and his parent lived alone without any knowledge of anyone nearby. The son, whose name was Kunuuksaayuka, was old enough to hunt and had grown capable of doing many things. They were not in need of food. The son was able to hunt and there were many caribou. Thus was the life of the woman and her son. One winter day, as they lived in their usual manner, eating caribou as before, there came a blizzard. The weather did not clear up as one blizzard was followed by yet another blizzard. It is said that with each gust of wind, the powdery snow blew in every direction. Following that, it stopped briefly and then became windy all over again. It was difficult to see anything in the blizzard. The woman\u2019s son was unable to hunt caribou. They began to run out of food. Although Kunuuksaayuka was a good hunter during clear weather, the blizzardy weather simply was not a time to hunt. It was dangerous to travel at any distance. All one could see was a mass of white swirling snow. Kunuuksaayuka waited day after day for the weather to clear until finally one day, he wondered, \u201cWhat, oh what, is causing the weather to be like this?\u201d Saying this, he dressed himself properly and went outside. He walked, facing the wind, and began to walk upriver along the bends and steep undercut sections of the riverbank. Meanwhile, the wind blew the snow strongly in the blizzard. He continued on his way up the river and he hadn\u2019t gone far when he noticed a spot further up the river that wasn\u2019t as blizzardy. It was rather bright and the weather appeared to be clear beyond it. He approached this spot and saw that for some reason, the blizzard seemed to be originating from a small tundra meadow. He looked around carefully as he walked closer to it because he was curious to know what might be causing it. Since light seemed to be filtering through the swirling mass of snow, he grew even more curious and as he looked carefully around, he found what looked like a [spoiler]person, a man, apparently working hard on the flat tundra. He noticed that the man was indeed working hard. It is said that the man used something to mash the snow until it was loose, then he shoveled it off the ground. Each time he did this, a gust of wind came and blew the loose snow in the direction of Kunuuksaayuka\u2019s home. Kunuuksaayuka saw this and said to himself, \u201cSo that\u2019s the one who does it.\u201d [/spoiler] He had found the source of the blizzard.\n", "timestamp_created": 1596028539, "timestamp_updated": 1596028539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73368693": {"recommendationid": "73368693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087210735", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1595871227}, "language": "english", "review": "really simple and pretty game, i really liked the story and the short cultural videos you unlock", "timestamp_created": 1595872149, "timestamp_updated": 1595872149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73367122": {"recommendationid": "73367122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072592880", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1595873818}, "language": "english", "review": "The culture insights are easily the most interesting and compelling parts of this game.

The visual representation of the stories and the accompanying music are amazing. However, the gameplay is quite frustrating.\n\nLong Review: The Never Alone games do very well to pay homage to the Inuit culture through story-telling as well as the unlockable \"cultural insight\" documentary clips about where the mythology that the games are based on. It gives you insight on the culture straight from folks belonging to that culture. You also get insights on how climate change is affecting them. While playing the game and absorbing the artwork, the narration and the story, one cannot help but fall in love with the culture. Watching the folks in the documentary clips recount fun as well as thrilling stories from their lives brought a smile to my face.\n\nI played Never Alone and Foxtales in \"single player\" game mode and it was pretty clear the game was designed to be enjoyed with a friend. The game reminded me of Disney's Pocahontas platformer game in that you often have to switch between the girl (Nuna) and the Fox to solve puzzles. \nHowever, whereas the animal companion in Pocahontas had his own path most of the time to get you to the end, in Never Alone, you find yourself solving the platforming puzzles and traps twice: once for Nuna and once for the fox. If you control one character and leave the AI to follow you as the other, it will most definitely fall into the trap. Additionally, at the harder platforming traps, if you don't constantly switch between characters to make sure they are close to each other, the character whom you have already taken beyond the trap will try to back-track and come back to the other character when you switch.\nOther timed levels require very quick switching between characters to remove obstacles and those end up being very frustrating.\nThe controls are also quite laggy for some reason, so puzzles that require quick responses can be infuriating.\n\nBugs: \n1) The worst bug I encountered was one where if you die and restart from the previous checkpoint, the character often spawns in places where you are immediately killed.\n2) One of the boss levels bugs out once you die so it's hard to tell what you are supposed to do.\n3) The \"Cultural Insight\" videos often close immediately when opened. You have to try to open them several times for them to play.\n\nDespite the frustrations, I would still recommend you get the game and play with a friend.", "timestamp_created": 1595189549, "timestamp_updated": 1595189549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72957993": {"recommendationid": "72957993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313642674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1595176177}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Graficamente el juego es bonito, pero a la hora de jugar tiene problemas no por que el juego sea dificil de pasar sino por que el personaje se queda pillado o se traba y eso hacen dificil y complicada la jugabilidad.

In fact, it feels more like an interactive documentary and I will explain why.\n\nI came into the game expecting similar gameplay to Limbo but instead there are hardly any puzzles. The puzzles are extremely straightforward with the answer staring right at you. As a platformer, it isn\u2019t a very good one too unfortunately. I didn\u2019t like how the characters controlled personally, especially the fox as it felt too floaty for my liking. The platforming segments are really straightforward until the final act where its just plain annoying with that endgame sequence. I won\u2019t spoil it but you can expect many deaths and retries unless you are used to MOBA or RTS games and are able to effortlessly switch and coordinate actions between your two playable characters with a time limit. In short, if you are thinking of getting this game for its gameplay: I think you will end up disappointed. \n\nWhere this game is unique however is that there is a short documentary featuring multiple short interview clips with real life Alaskan natives and their culture, folk tales and way of life within the game. In the game you will encounter owls. Each time you encounter an owl or progress the plot to a certain extent, an \u2018insight\u2019 or a mini documentary/clip is unlocked. I find these very interesting to watch and is the feature that made me ultimately decide to recommend others to play this game.\n\nHaving said that, the story is kind of a mess and doesn\u2019t feel cohesive. It feels as though they are trying to make a plot based on the documentary clips. For example, one clip talked about how a woman\u2019s brother raised a bear cup after killing its mother. The next segment features a polar bear. And when there is a clip of northern lights who are children who died early and will pull off your head to play football with it. The next segment features these playful but harmful spirits. Therefore, I feel as though I am playing through a series of scenes rather than an actual story. That\u2019s why I was surprised when the credits rolled and the story was actually adapted from a source material.", "timestamp_created": 1594808656, "timestamp_updated": 1594809262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612013280391693115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72493621": {"recommendationid": "72493621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064923796", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1594465762}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for a game that will provide you with great and useful information on a culture that is largely unknown, this is 100% your game.

El juego es relajado, con una m\u00fasica tranquilizadora y un estilo gr\u00e1fico suave y tridimensional mezclado con la gr\u00e1fica original de las tribus Inuit que se utiliza para la narraci\u00f3n d ela historia y los cinemas dentro del juego. Lo interesante y el motivo que hace a este juego tan particular es que est\u00e1 narrado en el lenguaje tradicional de estas tribus, si no que los objetos coleccionables nos dan unas peque\u00f1as capsulas en donde se entrevista a los habitantes y descendientes de a estas tribus y  nos explican sus costumbres, tradiciones y cosmovisi\u00f3n del mundo en un ejercicio de recuperaci\u00f3n y divulgaci\u00f3n cultural notable.En el juego controlas a una ni\u00f1a y a un zorro con los que debes de intercambiar el control pues ambos tienen habilidades complementarias, la ni\u00f1a puede manipular y utilizar objetos, pero es un poco torpe y su movilidad es limitada y el zorro es bastante \u00e1gil y puede manipular esp\u00edritus, pero sin duda es mas dependiente de la ni\u00f1a. Mec\u00e1nicamente podr\u00eda ser mas fluido, pues por momentos se sienten un poco torpes los personajes pero tiene la opci\u00f3n de jugarse con un compa\u00f1ero, opci\u00f3n que sin duda enriqueser\u00e1 tu experiencia. El DLC os cuenta una historia adicional, en el que controlas a los mismos personajes y el narrador es el mismo, pero aporta otros datos culturales por lo que a mi parecer vale la pena. Lo malo del juego adem\u00e1s de que por momentos la movilidad puede ser un poco frustrante es que es muy corto yo creo que en la mitad del tiempo que tengo registrado puedes terminarlo al 100% y no ofrece mucho reto para jugadores experimentados, pero a mi parecer vale la pena el juego solo por la historia y la intenci\u00f3n de preservar un mito en un medio digital distinto (similar a Brothers).

I feel confident in guessing that most people are the same in that regard. I do like those bits of knowledge, shared through \"cultural insights\" along the way that don't break the game flow unless you want them to. However, the actual game wasn't very good. It started quite well, with only a few complaints about the platforming. It was fun for my daughter to run around as the cute fox. But there were a few issues that got only more glaring as time went on. -Short reaction time in some sequences made it hard for my daughter who is just learning to play video games and handle controls.-The controls seemed a little loose at times, making it easy to make mistakes.Later, the fox changes and that player's abilities and functions in the team drastically change. My daughter actually seemed to still like it, much to my surprise. But as an observer, partner, and in imagining myself as the fox player, I hated it. I no longer liked how the two characters interacted and that's when the gameplay became much more frustrating.The story started out really well and interesting, but the ending didn't make much sense. I just shrugged that off as it being a folk legend, for which that seems to often be the case.

Pretty relaxing despite the action filled adventure. The environments are what makes the game special to me. I like the story as well. This game is very special and I have never played anything like it before. Focusing on Alaskan natives is a really clever starting point, which I assume only one of heritage would come up with. I don't know anything about the game dev though, so I can't say for sure. I would definitely recommend this game if you're ready for storytelling and cut scenes, these are pretty focused. There are boss fights as well, a few of them actually. Some more difficult than the rest. I will admit - in 2016 I wasn't feeling this game when it got recommended to me by a friend. But it has since grown on me. I was 23 at the time and was mostly playing Dead by Daylight. So, switching from DBD to Never Alone was a HUGE step in a crazy direction. Now I've come to see myself as more of a 6Am3R, someone who's open to more than 1 genre of games. This is, over all, a very good game. The controls are a bit ass depending on what type of controller you have (I have a random one in the design of a PS controller). I think it would play best on Xbox controllers. But I've never tried, so what do I know. (What I'm referring to is when you're about to throw your weapon at something. The aim and release is messing me up since I need to use the wonky joysticks to do it.) Oh yeah - What I miss in the game is probably controls input. Right now it doesn't seem like it exists, which is why I'm stuck with wonky joystick shit. But, hey; I learned! So it's fine.\n\nTLDR; Great game if you want cool atmospheres, some mild boss fights, beautiful music, interesting storytelling and a really, really, really cute couple of main characters (Nuna, a little girl- and a white fox just called \"Fox\"). :')", "timestamp_created": 1587083656, "timestamp_updated": 1587083656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67404352": {"recommendationid": "67404352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164003687", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1587237607}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a beautifully artistic game with interesting stories.

Thank you to the Alaskan I\u00f1upiaq community for the opportunity to listen to your experiences!   The format is informal, personal and entertaining, with lots of individual stories and perspectives.     \n\nThe animated story sequences throughout the game are done in a nice style that evokes the legends well.  The overall idea of working with others to survive and not being self centred tie the insights, story and game together.\n\nAs for the game itself, mixed review.  The visuals are quite attractive, if bleak at times.  I really liked the design of the helper spirits, otherworldly yet comforting.  The characters of Nuna and the Fox are both very cute, making it kind of sad when they fall off a ledge, unfortunately (Especially since the surviving character will begin crying for a few seconds before the sequence restarts.).  The puzzle platformer element is sometimes fun, other times a bit tedious and sometimes just frustrating.  I did encounter a bug where a boss fight that should have been easy became impossible.  When I redid the sequence, including the chase that led up to the fight, which I really didn't want to re-do, the fight was over in a few tries.  To be fair I don't really like platformers anymore except metroidvanias, but this one did seem quite clunky.  The controls don't matter so much in the first half of the game as not much precision is required.  In the second half the difficulty is increased but the controls still aren't responsive enough to allow you to make precise moves.

I will list the goods, the bads, and that's it. WOo. Also to preface, I had to play this game as homework for my Game Design study, which is why I played all of it.\n\n\n [h1] What the fuck is it about [/h1]\nNever alone is a game about a little girl who wants to find out what's causing the blizzard that's pestering the home town. On her journey she almost fuckin dies so a fox has to save her. From that point on they decide to work together for some reason. \n\n[h2] The main gameplay [/h2]\nNever Alone focuses on the little girl and the fox how they work together. In multiplayer, one player controls the fox and one player controls the little girl, they both have different abilities so they can't continue without each other. You can also just play in single player, then you switch between the two characters with the press of a button. The girl and the fox have to overcome puzzles and platforming like this.\n\n[h3] So what's good? [/h3]\n\nNever alone mainly focuses on a country's very specific culture. It does this by making the entire story of the game based on one of the folk tales of that country. It does this very charmingly, accompanied by cutscenes with interesting visuals I was pretty interested.\n\nBesides that, the visuals looked absolutely stunning. I can tell they put most of the budget of this game into the visuals, but I'll get to that later. \n\nYou really do get immersed by the sound design and the visuals, when there's a snow storm you almost feel cold, and never did I have the feeling of something looking out of place or just straight up bad.\n\n[h4] Um so what's bad [/h4]\nBasically the rest. Honestly, let me go into detail because I have many fucking gripes with this game.\n\nFirst off, I started it off and my dual shock 4 controller did not want to work with the game itself. I tried a lot of things, but the game just refused to acknowledge my controller. I works fine for literally any other game in my steam library. This forced me to play this platforming game with mouse and keyboard, which already was a bad sign.\n\nThen the gameplay began, and it started off charmingly and nice. But as it got more difficult, it got less and less fun. It's a platformer, but the controls are [b] atrocious [/b]. Legit, I got so frustrated with this game, I just wanted to be done with it at some point. This frustration basically ruinted all the other good aspects of the game for me. Due to it I wanted to skip cutscenes, and dying due to the controls being extremely inconsistent and unresponsive really was not fun at ALL.\n\nBesides this, the game is buggy as well. For instance, if you're playing in  single player, the character you're not controlling will follow you controlled by an AI. This is nice because you don't have to keep switching, this is not nice because they will sometimes just fucking yeet themselves into a pit, causing the section to start over (yes this actually happened). \n\nBesides that bugginess, the environment was clunky as hell. My character fell in place at least 13 times during my playthrough, it was laughable honestly. \n\n[h5] In conclusion, would I recommend it? [/h5]\n\nNever alone lacks in every single thing that makes it a game, the visuals are the only redeeming quality, and in my opinion it's better off being a movie. I would not recommend this game to anyone, due to it not being fun in the slightest. You will likely not have a good time with it.\n\nThank you for reading! \n", "timestamp_created": 1571179880, "timestamp_updated": 1571179880, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496854841709136963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55518069": {"recommendationid": "55518069", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993100818", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1578004311}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost everything in this game is bad.

Hence human life is almost exclusively maintained by hunting.  I don't expect any discussion of vegetarianism in this game, as plants practically don't exist (at least I haven't seen any within the first hour of the game).  Rather, this is a discussion of life begetting life, and at an intuitive level the mind guiding each individual to survive.  There is folklore and animism explaining how the frozen world works and remains whole.\n\nIn the gameplay, you are the little girl who is accompanied by an arctic fox to find her village after getting lost in a blizzard.  You can play with the keyboard or with a gamepad controller.  Switch between the fox and the girl to access special moves.  It is a long series of platforming puzzles to go through - there's some exploring, and the solutions to the puzzles are sometimes off-screen in the surrounding area.  \n\nThe Game In A Nutshell:\nThe artwork is very immersive, presenting animated drawings of the girl's story, and the filmaking is 5-star documentary quality.  The game is essentially something like a History Channel documentary explaining the daily life of arctic indigenous people broken up over time by a fairly easy puzzle platformer game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1880706431\n\nI like to play this in small doses, and learn about this remote people who live in a very hard place, smiles beaming, happy to be here.", "timestamp_created": 1570370275, "timestamp_updated": 1570374128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584704816341400146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55429479": {"recommendationid": "55429479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868248640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1590104911}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmospheric game with a beautiful story, an exceptionnally cute character and legends to discover.

For example, you will leap for a cliff, and your partner will stupidly leap to his death.  It doesn't happen often (it really doesn't) but it is frustrating when it does.\n   - despite the largely fun to play and solve puzzles, some are really frustrating and the controls, oh dear lord, the controls don't want you having an easy time of it either (I played with keyboard and mouse) and seemingly conspire against your best intentions.  Expect to repeat certain challenges over and over and over and over due to inconsistent and downright frustrating controls, particularly those that involve your fox attempting to manipulate spirits to further your progress.  Also, while most puzzles aren't too complex (pleasantly so, see above), several (particularly in the DLC) require you to do several things, practically at once or at least in very quick succession, and those bloody controls just won't let you do it, even when you know EXACTLY what to do next.\n\n  Ultimately, I feel I can recommend this game, as the positives far outweigh the negatives (but DAMN, those bloody controls and some of those puzzles in the DLC and the final third of the main game!!!)", "timestamp_created": 1566786878, "timestamp_updated": 1566786878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54770065": {"recommendationid": "54770065", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981698816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1445216850}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun.

Bolo aiming is poorly indicated, with the arm not actually pointing in the direction the bolo will fire. Controls in general are a bit unresponsive, which is fine considering it's usually a slow game, but the spirits need to be manipulated quickly towards the end of the game so that's unforgivable and my main complaint.

I'm fascinated by world religion and mythology, and as someone who both loves platformers and knows very little about Alaskan Native culture of any kind, I was pretty excited to put this game on my wishlist. Aesthetically, it was pretty cool - I like the subtitled storyteller, as well as the animations done in the traditional Inupiat art style. While the graphics weren't amazing, it's an indie game anyway, and the scenery nonetheless managed to convey the desolate beauty of the far north. The folktale was fun, the fox companion made adorable barking noises, the story was dire enough to be significant - but the gameplay was absolutely atrocious. Many other reviews mention how the frustratingly buggy AI of the non-player character - girl or fox - is combatted with a second player, thus playing into the themes of teamwork and togetherness present in the game, but that still wouldn't save the floaty controls, poor collision detection, and extremely linear, uninspired level design that makes playing Never Alone a nightmare. I also question the inclusion of the documentary clips - wouldn't it be far more innovative and fun to weave the cultural education into the gameplay itself through bonus items or optional areas? Lots of games with fictional cultures and histories do a good job of showing aspects of that world through bits and pieces the player experiences and picks up, so why not apply that to a real culture and in doing so increase the player's sense of discovery and enjoyment without feeling like their video game came with a side of PBS? It's a shame, because a game with a unique storyline, concept, and worthy goal of educating players about a culture they're likely unfamiliar with could definitely have been great - but its good qualities can't support it through the dull and frustrating game design.", "timestamp_created": 1564889823, "timestamp_updated": 1564889823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54382244": {"recommendationid": "54382244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865547582", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1562079530}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just the CUTEST puzzle platformer with an enchanting story.

The graphics are beautiful and the story is touching, but more importantly, this game honors and educates about Inuit life and culture as well as serving as a poignant reminder of our tenuous relationship to the natural world. Unfortunately, while I'm 100% on board with the agenda and thought this game had a lot of potential, in my opinion it was just too clunky and difficult to be enjoyable.\nThe gameplay, particularly the platforming puzzles, actually reminded me a lot of old Zelda games. The problem is that those types of tasks require a lot of technical precision to execute all the necessary movements, but you are severely limited in that department when playing this game.There is pretty much constant wind blasting you around, making it almost impossible to move quickly or precisely enough to make the necessary jumps, etc. There are also some extremely frustrating parts where the AI takes over and just falls off of things/jumps to their death; might have been better as a 2P game, but since I played it on my own, I was constantly cursing at whichever character I wasn't controlling for just dying in stupid ways about a hundred times a minute. This game definitely crossed over the \"challenging in a fun way\" line to just being so frustrating I didn't enjoy it.

You are either constantly running from a threat or you are solving puzzles, as you need to if you are wanting to make progress with the game. The puzzles were easy to solve but in order to make it less boring they\u2019ve added an option to swap between the character. However, they do have their own abilities and some puzzles can only be solved as that certain character. It\u2019s actually quite neat that they have included this as it makes the person playing think more and put more effort into solving the puzzles. It\u2019s far better than letting the AI doing it for you. Also, the game is very sort. I managed to complete both the main story and the Foxtales DLC in 4-5 hours. So, it\u2019s definitely a game you would be able to complete in one sitting. \n\n[h1]Things I like about the game: [/h1]\n\u2022\tThe controls were simple and easy to use. I\u2019ve seen people complaining about it, but in my time playing I haven\u2019t had any trouble. \n\u2022\tThe overall art of the game is just amazing.\n\u2022\tIt was short. Some people may see this as a con, but I can\u2019t really see it being enjoyed as much if it was a long story. I feel like it would just be really repetitive and boring. So, I\u2019m glad it is a short game.\n\u2022\tThe puzzles were easy to solve so anyone would be able to pick up the game and solve it. It\u2019s not like you had to think a lot about it when solving or it had multiple puzzles in one. \n\u2022\tNot only is it an awesome story driven game, it is also very educational as you get to learn about their culture. \n\u2022\tWhen the characters were first introduced I instantly liked them. Even more so when I made further progress. I just loved the bond between these two characters.   \n\n[h1]Things that could improve: [/h1]\n\u2022\tThe puzzles were easy to solve but I would of liked to see a variety of puzzles as repeating the same ones was very boring and repetitive. So, it would have been nice to solve different ones. \n\u2022\tI would have liked to see more interactions between the characters as well as exploring their personalities further. \n\n[h1]Graphics & Sound [/h1]\nThe graphics was really good despite being in a deserted setting. I thought both of the characters was very well designed and animated. From all the small details that is added, it does clearly show how much the developers care about this game. For instance, seeing the hood getting blown of Nuna\u2019s head from the impact of the wind, the movement of the characters when swimming underwater. The scenery was all the same, it was all taking place in one location, but I fair enjoyed it. \n\nI enjoyed the sound as well as, I enjoy the little narration between the chapters that\u2019s explaining the story. I also enjoyed the sound of the wind howling, along with whenever the characters were moving, hearing their footsteps. I thought the music was good as well, it fits in well with the whole atmosphere. \n\n[h1]Did I Experience Any Bugs? [/h1]\nDuring my time playing I didn\u2019t experience any bugs. This is including the main story as well as the Foxtales DLC\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, I would but not for its price. Don\u2019t get me wrong it is a very good 2d puzzle-platformer with a good story. That is also very educational as you get to learn about their culture but for the playtime you are getting with this game along with the DLC I would rather just wait for it going on sale. Unless money isn\u2019t that big of an issue, if that\u2019s the case, sure go for it. If you do end up getting it, I hope you enjoy this fabulous experience.", "timestamp_created": 1560116414, "timestamp_updated": 1560194495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504045248031616211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51122868": {"recommendationid": "51122868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042846362", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1513889045}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a beautiful game with a stunning soundtrack, and you get to play with a fox-friend and that's super dope.", "timestamp_created": 1560016604, "timestamp_updated": 1560016604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51117702": {"recommendationid": "51117702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237496256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1558288641}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful, emotionally impactful and culturally significant games I\u2019ve played.

Thus, for #LoveIndies I went back to it briefly to yet again spark up those feelers of playing it the first time and here are my thoughts on it.\n\n+++ Folklore and it's presentation\n++ Animations\n++ Animated tribal art\n++ Cultural Insights\n+ Puzzle mechanics\n+ Cute Art\n\nIn Never Alone you play through folklore of the I\u00f1upiat, one of the native tribes of Alaska, narrated by the elders of the tribe passing on stories as they were passed on to them. These stories are beautiful and harsh, as is the environment where those stories originate and they take you on an adventure to understand the values and hardships of the I\u00f1upiat.\nYou play as a I\u00f1upiat girl, Nuna and her furry friend, both having their own little tricks up their sleeves. You solve puzzles, escape tight situations and converse with spirits by switching between those two playable characters. (There's also a co-op mode where you can play with your friend, each controlling one character.)\nThe game art is quite nice, especially considering it's on Unity and first released in 2014. The animations are definitely cute, but what really sold the game to me visually was the animated tribal art as story cinematics. The native spoken narration by the elderly made the gameplay very immersive and made it feel like I was but a child sitting by the fireplace and listening to my elders telling stories of their youth.\nThe only thing that bothered me, which unfortunately is a rather big thing when it comes to gameplay, was the wacky control mechanics. It felt like there was definitely some thoughts put behind them, but the execution was rather clunky and made the gameplay just that much less fluid and enjoyable. I recommend playing with a controller instead of a keyboard and mouse.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game a lot. I felt sad after finishing the initial story but was rewarded with a DLC, that made everything better. I love to learn about folklore of other cultures and Never Alone definitely pulled through both as a game and as an educative experience.\nP.s.

In that regards, it definitely lived up to my expectations and felt both genuine and well translated to video game format. The style, including the sound and environments were very fitting and on a sensory-level the game does incredible.\n\nUntil you try to play it. Generally speaking, the controls are 'ok' 75% of the time. The tighter platforming areas and the high-tension levels are difficult to navigate because of sluggish character movements and difficulty predicting movement mechanics external to the character, such as wind and Spirits. On top of this, the side-scrolling aspect of the game doesn't make it easy in places with complicated-looking platforms makes it confusing sometimes where to go. This made it difficult for me to play at times.\n\nOverall, the game is great.

You swap control between two different characters, Nuna and Fox, on a quest to find out what's causing a perpetual blizzard. The storyline (apparently) is based on actual Inuit mythology. \n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b][u]Cultural Narrative[/u][/b]: I won't spoil the story here nor will I be applying my cultural opinions to a work based on another culture's mythology, but I can say that it was very refreshing to play a game from an untapped cultural mythos. The characters and storytelling were definitely new and unique to my eyes. \n\n[*][b][u]Art & Sound [/u][/b]:While not the sharpest graphics I've ever seen, the artstyle was charming and pleasant. The set pieces were fairly clear providing information to the player and the character designs were interestingly diverse. I also thought the background music was wonderfully atmospheric. \n\n[*][b][u]Puzzle Design[/u][/b]: I noted that some of the puzzles made particuluarly clever use of the few abilities and game mechanics. \n\n[*][b][u]Storytelling[/u][/b]: I also really apreciated how some of the more dramatic moments in the story synched up with the sound and the setting in such a way to create a sort of flow, which would have made for an exceptionally exciting experience... if not for some of the game's flaws. \n[/list]\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b][u]General Glitchiness[/u][/b]: This game is fraught with performance issues. At least once every play session a screen would appear during gameplay informing me that there were performance issues and that lowering my resolution settings would help. This occured at all resolutions. Changing resolutions never helped avoid this warning, nor improved performance. \n\nFor the record, I have a machine running a CORE i7 6500U, 12GB of RAM and a Geforce 930M. I can play Assassin's Creed without a problem on this machine, so I doubt cartoon graphics were creating the issue. \n\n[*][b][u]Lack of Editing?[/u][/b]: The cutscenes telling the story randomly change the protagonist's gender from female to male towards the end of the story. Intentional? Or Inconsistent? How am I to judge?\n\n[*][b][u]CO-OP AI liked to Troll[/u][/b]: There were many occasions when my ally (whomever I wasn't playing at the time) would gleeflully run into a monster or jump to it's death, through no fault of my own. Good ally AI is a must for any buddy-platformer games. Just sayin'.\n\n[*][b][u]HORRENDOUS Controls[/u][/b]: There was about a half a second delay in response time during play at irregular, but persistent intervals. Hit boxes were sketchy, maneuvering spirits was exceptionally clunky- sometimes moving too fast and other times moving painfully slow, without rhyme or reason... [b]AND F*^%$ THOSE BOLAS CONTROLS![/b]\n\nTaken together, it made what would be an otherwise pleasant and uplifting game into an incredibly and needlessly frustrating slog. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION: [/h1]\nI am a staunch advocate for games being a form of artistic expression and that video games are at their best when they feature mechanics that are fun to play and when they tell a story that's engaging. The fact that a little indie company was established that shares this view is admirable and it makes me want games like Never Alone to succeed. \n\nThat said, I cannot help but express the opinion that the technical execution of this game, particularly the controls, are [b][u]unequivocally[/u][/b] bad and the game overall lacks polish. \n\nIronically then, Never Alone is a game that is the complete opposite of your typical EA gaming franchise- focused heavily on story and narrative while mostly negligent with regard to gameplay.

That said, there's a good chance I'll get the dlc in the future.\n\nNever Alone is a 2d platformer game where you play as both a girl lost in the snowy lands and an arctic fox that helps her.  There as an ability in this game to co-op, where one player can play the girl and one play the fox.  I decided to play this game solo, where you hit a button to switch between the girl and fox - to verify that yes, it can be done seamlessly.  \n\nThe game length is short, and made longer by interspersing videos about life in that region and the various traditions of the people.  These videos are very interesting and insightful, and brought an extra amount of depth to the adventure that you just wouldn't get by playing without them.  It also made the game feel a bit like a cultural history lesson.  Additionally, the videos felt like part of the game play instead of being an interruption, and I had fun collecting them all.  \n\nThe animation is beautiful, and the cutscenes in between felt unique in style.  \n\nThe story, meanwhile, is riveting and intense.  Sometimes too intense.  There is a scene with one of the antagonists midway through the game that is not friendly for younger children - and even caught me by surprise as an adult.  However, it equally fits with the story being told as a whole.  The story also has many exciting chase sequences.  It held me through the entire game and never once was I bored.\n\nControls: I used a game controller to play Never Alone.   Switching between the two characters was easy.  Using the bola was a little difficult, but became a fast learning experience during the many chase scenes.  Jumping and all the normalcies of a platformer were fine.  \n\nThe game is moderately difficult in terms of general puzzles and obstacles.   I died many times.   In the past I had issues with the AI, where the girl or fox would jump off a ledge trying to follow each other, but playing it shortly before writing this review yielded no issues.  The hints on where to stand or what to do were also extremely helpful and didn't make the game too easy by any stretch.   I imagine playing co op would make the game much easier in certain parts. \n\n\n\nOriginally when I purchased Never Alone a long time ago, I was unable to play it because my video/graphics card couldn't keep up.  The AI was a pain, and there was lagging.  With a more up-to-date machine and game controller, and subsequent updates since the game's release, all of these problems went away, the game runs great, and I experienced no bugs or glitches during the entirety of playing.  \n\n\nIn short, Never Alone is a fun, quick 2d platformer with cultural insight, tense gameplay, and moderate difficulty.  It really is a gem in terms of games, and if you like the main story there is a bonus story in dlc.  If you're an achievement hunter, you cannot get all achievements without the dlc.", "timestamp_created": 1553726124, "timestamp_updated": 1553726429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682819128036499023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49727117": {"recommendationid": "49727117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025286003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 331, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1561994127}, "language": "english", "review": "An artistic but challenging game at points.

Each character is slightly different, and must help each other throughout the journey (e.g., the girl can climb ladders, the fox has a wall climb/wall jump ability). The only part I had problems with was the girl's orb spiny attack, the whole \"point joystick back, aim and the move it forward to shot\" is a little bit to iffy for me, in fact, it can get a bit enfuriating at times.\n\nYou run away from bears, you use wind to propel you to other platforms, you use magical beings to walk acoss water, you swim, and all other good stuff. Visualy the game is stunning even after all this years, probably one of the better parts of the game alonside the story.\n\nI saw a lot of people complaining about the controls for this game, but I didn't find any problems (aside from the orb thing). Maybe it's because I am using a controler, but why would you not use one in a plataformer is beyond me. That being said, it is not an excuse to give people that don't have the option to use a controller a bad time because the game is not optimized for keybord and mouse.\n\nNever Alone is definitly worth the money you are giving, especially considering how often you can find it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1546176774, "timestamp_updated": 1546176774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47955214": {"recommendationid": "47955214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847925783", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1546268718}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful masterpiece.

In both games, you're playing a mythological journey that is very light on actual gameplay, while collecting bits of information about the mythology and people behind the journey.\n\nThere are some puzzle and platforming elements, but they're not really the focus of the game, and aren't challenging.\n\nFrom time to time, you will gain a new video, which is almost like a documentary fragment about one of the people of Alaska. The biggest difference between Mooseman and Never Alone is that the former is about a past culture (with archaeological evidence from the 7th-9th centuries), while the latter is about a still living community - although they are largely modernised by now, and the game is an attempt to \"preserve\" (although that isn't really a good word - perhaps \"present\" is more appropriate) their older traditions and values.\n\nOne very interesting aspect of these videos is how they tie the mythological journey with the rather mundane adventures of the people speaking, or their close ancestors (parents, grandparents at most). There was one particular story - about father and two sons being lost adrift in a piece of ice calling 911 (yeah, not very poetic!) and having a few hiccups but being ultimately saved. This is used in the game, where you're also lost adrift - although it is given a more poetic treatment and added to the overall \"myth\". This happens at several points - the videos either elaborate on something you see in the game (like the children spirits of the aurora borealis, or the context of hunting in the community), or provides a justification for it (like the drifting story).\nIt makes me wonder whether mythology itself may be created from these more mudane stories of multiple people into a single hero to represent them. Probably an element. Either way, this was a cool aspect!\n\nThe music isn't very traditional, which is unfortunate, but it still worked very well within the game and created a great atmosphere.\n\nThe graphics are cool as well, although they're tricky. Most of the background is blurry, so it could be rather unimpressive. Still, they manage to play with the colors in a great way, especially with the aurora and the underwater effects. Not the best looking game out there, but I found it surprisingly nice.\n\nFinally, some of the scenes in the videos are really great and so are the colors.\n\nNot much to say about gameplay. It's slow, and the DLC, which focused a bit more on gameplay and puzzles was rather tedious. Still, I had heard bad things about the companion AI in the game - I didn't have many problems. It's an okay game, although nothing worth playing for its mechanical strength of artistry alone.

En los ratos de ocio este pueblo suele reunirse y contar historias, pues el desarrollo literal de este juego es una de estas historias que ha sido contada por este pueblo medio tribu.\n\nEl documental sirve de gu\u00eda para contextualizar y tematizar el juego, resultando bastante interesante esta exposici\u00f3n, pero sin embargo es demasiado... superficial y supersticioso, al final s\u00f3lo se cuenta lo que se quiere que se vea.\nResulta demasiado subjetivo, adquiriendo el juego demasiada esencia posesiva. Lo describo en lo que se refiere a obra literaria como opaco e ins\u00edpido. \nPor mi parte, no me gusta esta idea de hacer juegos que proyecten un trabajo original e independiente que ya tiene otro significado. El juego de alguna manera, deja de ser videojuego. \n\nLa jugabilidad pu\u00e9s tampoco muestra ning\u00fan atisbo de poder contrarrestar esto. Est\u00e1 demasiado fragmentada y resulta demasiado discordante, discurriendo de forma farragosa y simple. Las cosas estan ah\u00ed, trabajando bajo un sistema crudo e inconsistente que pueda unir su pr\u00e1ctica y funcion con elocuencia. \nEl juego es de acci\u00f3n ligera y din\u00e1mica sobre plano lateral en scroll. El dinamismo se ejecuta respecto a lo que hay o sucede en el escenario y se tracude a modo de intuici\u00f3n en buscar lo que podemos hacer. El resultado es una din\u00e1mica comprensiva pero que evidencia poca intensidad por un sistema de juego crudo. \nEl desarrollo es intervalado y es conllevado por la narraci\u00f3n y el inter\u00e9s de qu\u00e9 sucerer\u00e1 despu\u00e9s. A este inter\u00e9s de eventos se le acoplan algunas vistas del escenario muy hermosas que regularizan un impacto bastante bueno. \n\nSe propone de forma cooperativa para jugar. Se puede jugar en la misma pantalla en cooperativo o bien un jugador alternar el control de los dos personajes. Esta rese\u00f1a est\u00e1 basada en haber jugado en modo un jugador. En cooperativo estoy seguro de que ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s divertido y agradable al desvincular parte de esa din\u00e1mica comprensiva. Incidir\u00e1 considerablemente hacia una jugabilidad entrelazada y conmutada.

The gameplay is simple and fun with the jumping mechanic being a little bit iffy, but functions fine throughout the game. I also found the story to be creative and engaging. In addition, the soundtrack can be relaxing at times, while certain parts are meant to be somewhat alarming. What was suprising was the extra content unlocked during the game. These short videos were a nice addition and explains many of the lore and its associated culture. Not only are they in-depth and imo interesting, they're also not forced on players like other games I've played and can be accessed at anytime after unlocking them.\n\n- The main cons would be the game feels short, however, I waited until after I completed the game to watch all the videos, so doing this during the game might change that.

Before and after most dangerous areas are checkpoints. Even so, a couple times I had to repeat the same area 5-10 times to finally succeed. But most of the time it isn't difficult to advance. \n\nFox Tales is quite short, only about 30 minutes. \n\nRecommended. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1535455630, "timestamp_updated": 1535455630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567322909832000732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44414611": {"recommendationid": "44414611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970693896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1537995373}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically it's a fairtayle from the native people of Alaska within a jump-and-run Game.

button for interacting with spirit elements in the game. \nCharacter can't turn in the middle of jump which kind of uselessly makes things slower.\nAt least couple of times character got kind of stuck and jumped betweed locations flickering.\nOne of the ice ladders teleports and drops you down when you try to climb trough the icy roof where the ladders end.\n\nBut overall nothing really game ruining here so no need to be worried.\n\nGame creates a captivating atmospheric mood that carries trough the game, only thing I have to bring up is that towards the end game mechanics doesn't evolve anymore in any way, which makes the end not as charming as the first 2/3 of the game.\n\nSadly very short experience, maybe +3h to run through, no matter that there's nice gallery of cultural insights in video format.\n\nFor hardcore platformers this doesn't really give any thrilling challenge because difficulty is very beginner friendly, which is because of the story focused build I think.\n\nAs a

The story, theme, characters, and music are all top hole in my book! On the other hand, the jumping mechanic is spotty and sometimes you'll fall off a platform for no reason. Sometimes moving a spirit platform will make it stop supporting the girl. Sometimes the girl will jump farther than other times. Sometimes you\u2019ll turn around and fall off a ledge in the process, other times you\u2019ll want to fall off a ledge and the game will resist you. Having to hear the little girl cry or the fox whimper every time you miss a jump is aggravating. And using a controller, at least in my case, caused both characters to be locked in tandem movement, so it was literally impossible to play the game and I was forced to use the keyboard controls, which are exclusively left hand oriented with the occasional mouse click. I found my fingers stumbling over the Shift, Ctrl, and Caps Lock. Additionally, even though the switch character button is mapped to Q, pressing almost any unmapped key also switched characters, meaning that if you accidently press anything other than the A S W D keys, you\u2019ll loss control of the character you intended to be playing as and they\u2019ll more than likely fall to their death, get mauled by a bear, or end up with their head impaled upon a spike. Lastly, fair warning, prepare to see the fox die, a lot. Also the girl, but the fox upset me more, as I was so annoyed with the girl\u2019s inability to jump (or simply run, at times), I felt less regret for her passing, that is, until the scond half of the game where the fox became the bigger rage trigger.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind replaying it a bunch because you missed an owl (the last one, in my case), or if you have some sort of mental defect that causes you to take pleasure in the repetitive death of a small girl and her fox, this is the game for you!", "timestamp_created": 1531127003, "timestamp_updated": 1531127003, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550423860549926758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43410805": {"recommendationid": "43410805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046549553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1531421936}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cute indie game with a lovely story.

The fox that's so playful, the information you get, the way it's made. It's really loveable and that's what I really enjoy about this game and wants me to keep playing it. \n\nBut really... The controls are sh*t. Especially if you play it in single player. You sometimes have to change characters pretty fast but the game is just too slow for it to do so. It's reacting so late to it. \nI also got killed numbers of times because the NPC character (which one I was not playing) fell off, or got killed another way. Like... How am I suppose to control it that the NPC is jumping wrong on places they should have been easily been able to jump right. It was not in a co-op part where you had to change. It's very annoying when that happens because you have to replay it while it wasn't your fault. \nThere are so many bugs in the game that it just got me on a point I cannot continue. At first I thought I was doing something wrong, that I didn't see the clue. But after 15 minutes I decided to look up a play through and the thing that happened in there, was something I had already done! And the man was still chasing me down and killing me. And every time I respawned, I spawned next to the platform instead of on it, leaving me for death as there is no way to escape. \nI am still not passed that point because the game keeps bugging and I just cannot continue. Which sucks, because I really want to finish the game, despite the controls being shit and slowly reacting and buggy all the time. \n\nI really hope the bugs are getting fixed because it's just annoying and sad, because it's really ruining a very beautiful game.

Sometimes, you have to summon a spirit as the fox for the girl to stand on, then while I took control of the fox to look for the next step forward, I learned the spirit disappears if the fox gets too far away.  Haha, thanks game for not telling me that, go ahead and load a save.  I can't count how many times I said \"wow how the HELL was I supposed to know that?\" while playing.\n\nThe story itself, along with the artwork, is very quaint and pleasant, I really liked that part.  I also appreciate that as you play, you unlock 2-minute mini-documentaries about some aspect of traditional native Alaskan life, they are really interesting to watch.

The game heavily dependent on portraying its story, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  While the game is designed with co-op in mind, it's still very playable alone.  There might be a little redundance and the occasional AI flub, but your partner will follow and sit still when they're supposed to for the most part.\n\nThe cultural insights that you unlock are timed pretty well to fit with the narrative and there seems to be an actual effort to anticipate questions regarding terminology or cultural references right when the player is about to ask them.\n\nAs far as improvements, I'd up the brightness in certain sections.  It's hard to see in the cave area as well as the underwater sections in the DLC; the rest of the game's pretty visible, though.  The other issue I had was with the final bosses in both the main game and DLC.

I learned a lot about the ways of life, traditions and values of those people, in a way I never anticipated. It gave me a real appreciation for a group of people that get little attention in our society, and I feel enriched for having experienced it. You will unlock portions of a documentary as you progress, containing interviews with tribe members discussing various aspects of their lives and community. It was very much worth watching them all, and gives much needed context to the game and your actions.\n\nGameplay-wise, the systems are pretty straightforward, but with a few unique twists. In single-player, you alternate between controlling the fox and the girl, in order to solve some platforming puzzles. Each one has different capabilities, such as the fox's ability to interact with spirits, and Nuna's thrown bola. With a second player, each one takes one character, and you will have to cooperate to get through. The gameplay was mostly pretty easy, but I actually died in certain sections more times than I would have expected to. Most of the time it was my fault, but occasionally some janky AI would send one character jumping to their death when I wasn't controlling them. I did also have a few moments where the controls did not respond fluidly, resulting in death. Minor frustrations like those aside, the puzzles are fun and creative, and overall not too taxing. Thankfully, you are never sent too far back when you die, and checkpoints come frequently.\n\nThe graphics themselves were serviceable, and for an indie 2.5-D platformer like this, I thought they looked well done. The art direction is fantastic, and really holds everything together. The cutscenes are done in an interesting scrimshaw style that lends itself well to the storytelling. The whole presentation really draws the player in. The music plays into this atmosphere, but there weren't many particularly memorable pieces in the score. It's definitely good, just not \"amazing\".\n\nMy overall impression of this game was very good, barring a bit of jank that didn't kill the experience. I was too involved with progressing through the story and learning more about the tribe to care too much about those few issues.

Based on an I\u00f1upiat tale, a people native of Alaska, and narrated as such, [i]Never Alone[/i] is a puzzle-platformer that tells the story of a girl named Nuna and her fox companion, as together they brave many dangers to find the cause of a blizzard that is threatening her village. It's an experience perhaps better suited for co-op play -and indeed there is- as both Nuna and her fox have complementary abilities that will allow them to traverse the landscape. As you do so, you will encounter a series of owls that unlock short interviews about the I\u00f1upiat people and their culture (beliefs, customs, way of life, etc.). Some of these are easily found, while other may take some additional exploring. For my part, these videos never broke the flow of gameplay but rather enriched it, providing a nice glimpse into such a different, yet alluring, culture.\n\nBack to gameplay, there is a noticeable ramp up in difficulty as you approach the ending, particularly during the final boss sequence which requires you to be fast and precise about coordinating the action of the two characters while paying attention to your surroundings. Fortunately, checkpoints are well-placed but this can induce some frustration nonetheless. For reference, I played with a controller and I did notice some lag. I cannot say whether you'll experience the same with M+K.\n\nIt's a bit difficult to recommend the game at full price ($15), even though it's a beautiful one to look at and listen to.

I didn't, because the controls make the story a lot less appealing.  I wouldn't recommend buying it.\n\nNever Alone is a platformer that tells the story of an Alaskan Native myth.  The story is enjoyable enough, the graphics are decent, and the cultural insights are interesting.  However, the game really isn't coded well, and the issues with the coding make the story harder to follow.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to die, and the deaths make the game less enjoyable.  The collision detection is poor, and the jumps are too inaccurate for the way that collisions are coded.  This resulted in several unnecessary deaths during my playthrough.  The characters move faster than the platforms that they manipulate, which results in even more unnecessary deaths.  You have to be almost frame-perfect to stay alive in certain situations, which greatly detracts from this story-heavy game.  I suspect that most disabilities are only likely to exacerbate these issues.\n\nI wish this game had been done better.  While I did enjoy the narrative, I got stuck about halfway through due to the poor collision detection.  I got so frustrated with the quality of the gameplay that it detracted from my enjoyment of the storytelling.

That and a few handfuls of wall clipping/collision detection glitches/bugs in various parts of the game can make it very frustrating.

Taking that away and replacing it with a flying human spirit (especially one with terrible controls) stripped the atmosphere of its charm as well as making the gameplay a chore for the supporting player.

As you play, small videos - 'Cultural Insights' - are unlocked which offer nice little snippets of information about their culture. None of them are overlong and can either be accessed in the breaks between 'levels' (which you may find you takes you out of the game a bit) or saved up to watch from the main menu instead. It's a fascinating insight into a culture I didn't know much about and I've enjoyed learning about them. (Who says games don't teach you anything...!)\n\nSadly the richness of the game's culture don't make up for lackluster controls. I played as a single player using a controller and movement is sluggish; it felt like such hard work. Jumping had the same moving-though-mud kind of feeling which could make it very hard to control. I don't mind having to replay through an area several times to learn the pattern required of me, but I don't like it when I have to replay it what feels like a zillion times because the damn controls are so janky. (Maybe I've been spoiled by the beautiful, fluid movement of Ori and the Blind Forest?) \n\nThe AI of the characters for single player was often bad, sometimes truly awful; I experienced multiple instances of Nuna or Fox comitting suicide by jumping off a ledge instead of staying put, or by Fox deciding to move and straying too far from the helping spirits, making them disappear and leaving Nuna to fall. Perhaps the game works better in Co-Op mode?\n\nAfter a while Nuna's over-dramatic gasp when Fox dies (and to a lesser extent, Fox's whining when Nuna dies) really wore thin. In areas of the game such as the chase sequences, it also felt sometimes like the action began slightly ahead of the scene returning from black which, once you realise this can sometimes help a little, but also often resulted in more dying. The game seems to make checkpoints very often though which is a big positive, otherwise I'm sure I wouldn't have bothered continuing!\n\nI also felt that in multiple instances the game was pretty obscure with how to progress onward (there is an option for game hints to be turned on but these seemed to trigger sporadically - often just as I was dying yet AGAIN)...but maybe I'm just a big dummy :o)\n\nI've logged just over 3 hours playtime (even with lots of dying) but even with such a small game, I had to break it down into chunks and space it out over a couple of weekends and in between other games to keep the frustration in check. (I hate leaving a game half-played, especially when I know it's such a short one.) It was a relief to finish it and I'm sorry to say I instantly uninstalled it without even checking out the Fox Tales DLC as I have no wish to spend any more time with the game.\n\nTLDR; lovely idea, but excecution is bad.

But do not let that deter you from diving into this wonderful cultural exhibit of the Inupiat people who are introduced in this story, their customs, their traditions, they values, their beliefs, their positive attitude, their hard-working nature, and their connections to everything else around them. The game has wonderful graphics, both in-game and in the animations. The animations contained two different styles, one to reflect the modern 2-D platforming game, and the other more traditional, likely to showcase the scrimshaw carvings that are used for storytelling, and through that, for them to educate their young. The game is accompanied by some great music and if you got the game with the DLC, then a few additional short but fun puzzles as well. The best part of the game involves the documentary \"Cultural Insights\" that are stories told from different perspectives, including personal recounts of growing up--both harrowing and fun. The deep connections that these people have with the nature around them, the living creatures, forces of nature, intertwined with their deep-seated beliefs, really provided for me quite an educational experience. \n\nThe game does work with a controller, I played with the Steam controller and it worked without any problems. There were times when I felt that a second player could have helped out a lot instead of me having to switch between the two characters in a timely fashion in order to move on. As a result, one of the two characters perished (yes, you read that right) on multiple occasions. I got used to the controller, and so I did not want to switch to keyboard and mouse, which probably would have made it a little bit easier for parts. But hey, the game is short enough as it is, so having to replay a few parts was not a big issue. The Bola was a bit difficult to control on the Steam controller. That was my only complaint with the controller. I do not have an XBox controller, which would have made it a bit easier, I think. There were a few small bugs were I was clipped into a wall or got stuck for no reason, but the constant check-point system of the game made it easy to just restart from a few moments ago, and hardly caused any significant playability issues.\n\nIf you have been interested in this game (story, really), I think there are many reasons to emerse yourself in a different world, yet one that exists in reality on Earth, for a few hours.", "timestamp_created": 1519792169, "timestamp_updated": 1519792169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655756175518035889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40400906": {"recommendationid": "40400906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402889507", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1520470129}, "language": "english", "review": "It's nice, it's a nice cultural experience and that's about all the good I can say about this game.

Switching back to Nuna and having her draw the bear to attack her again (in order to crack the wall) is NOT intuitive - would you normally do that?!  The designers should either have the bear charge and crack the wall at the beginning of the battle to provide that hint, or give Nuna the option of using the bola to take down or stun the bear.  She has this magical bola that can take out large chunks of ice but can't use it against the bear -- once again, game design flaw.   In addition, having the fox jumps up onto the ice sheet on the left wall was rather difficult - not in term of challenging but more about following exactly what was programmed in the game.  The jump has to be precise and will have one chance of doing it.   The software needs to provide a variance where the fox jumps up and grab the ice wall.  There were times the fox got stuck after the jump and was unable to climb up any further (and got killed).  Also, during the bear attack, if the fox ran toward Luna and climbed safely up that plateau, the bear did not charged.  It should have charged in order to provide a more consistent game play as well as another option to win.\n\nOverall, it's a good game but still needs rooms for improvement.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517866295, "timestamp_updated": 1517866295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39867116": {"recommendationid": "39867116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316734859", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1519484332}, "language": "english", "review": "more like Advertising the culture and nothing else!", "timestamp_created": 1517841430, "timestamp_updated": 1517841430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427574753761291504", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39862967": {"recommendationid": "39862967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128383171", "num_games_owned": 603, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 357, "last_played": 1517827273}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely game with an unique idea inspired by a traditional story from the I\u00f1upiat.\nIt's a 2D game with good puzzles about a girl who tries to save her people from an eternal blizzard while facing various obstacles.", "timestamp_created": 1517825406, "timestamp_updated": 1517825406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39860828": {"recommendationid": "39860828", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971411597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1517765290}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing Never Alone and being immersed in Alaska Natives' folklore.

It was quite refreshing and a little ironic, playing a game set in a Winter wonderland, during our Summer here in the Southern hemisphere. Snowstorms on the screen and 38C (about a 100F) outside :) The game definitly helped me chill out.\n\nNever alone is a short platformer set in a fantasy world of the Northern Arctic. It is a game with alot of heart telling a story (or two if you get the expansion dlc) about the Inuit people of the Arctic region. It is also packed with video clips that are unlockable telling you more of their culture and heritage.\n\nGameplay envolves basic platform jumping, shooting, swimming etc. with some puzzles that are challenging, but not impossible. It is a game that will resonate well with the 7-12 year old crowd. I did find the main game more fun than the dlc expansion Foxtales. But it is still worthwhile getting the full package.\n\nPros - Beautiful culture rich fantasy stories set in a Winter wonderland. Fun characters and easy game play.\nCons - Quite short even with dlc. Some glitches (especialy with Foxtales dlc). Character got stuck or jumped off screen with gravity algorithms not kicking in (happened twice, so not a deal breaker).\n\nIf you enjoy easy platformers, or need a good game for kids, where they can actualy learn something about a very interesting people and culture, this is it. 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1515696330, "timestamp_updated": 1515696330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39242643": {"recommendationid": "39242643", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980949132", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1514237984}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautiful and I love hearing it told in the tribal language; it really helps with the immersion of the story.

Each atmosphere/ biome, color, and each character (Nuna and Fox) have a beautiful and cute style. The game really evicts emotions to the player. The girl and fox have a special companionship that is revealed to be based on a true story in one of the factual cutscenes. The companionship is so strong that if you ever dies the other starts crying then you're sent back to the last checkpoint which is actually really sad, but again it is interesting because normally I'm not attached to the characters in a game like this. As you duck and fight off the blizzard, it is truly heartwarming and wrenching how these two lost characters (both of which you can play as and have special roles/ skills) try and survive from the help of each other and spirit friends along the way.  Through the hardships in life and in the storm, they have each other. \n\nOne of the very interesting aspects of this game was the documentary/ cutscene aspect to this game. As you playthrough the game, you unlock interviews  and footage of the Alaskan people this game is based off of. Some of these scenes include the type of clothing they wear and how storytelling influences their culture. There are 24 of these documentary scenes, all unique and adding to the immersion of the player into the lives and culture of the people. It is quite fascinating to me at least and truly gave me a connection and context to the game. \n\nThe puzzles in this game are not incredibly difficult, especially if you are not a casual gamer and are looking for something more complex.

Una vez sabido esto, Never Alone es un juego PRECIOSO, tanto est\u00e9ticamente como por lo que representa. Vamos por partes:\n\n[h1]Historia:[/h1]\n\nNever Alone nos cuenta la historia de una ni\u00f1a llamada Nuna, que pertenece al pueblo de I\u00f1upiaq del \u00c1rtico y sus aventuras junto a un zorro. Su objetivo es encontrar el origen de una ventisca eterna que est\u00e1 afectando a la vida de su pueblo. La historia est\u00e1 muy bien contada, adem\u00e1s dot\u00e1ndola de mucha autenticidad al hacerlo en lengua i\u00f1upiac por un maestro cuentacuentos, todo ello subtitulado como es l\u00f3gico (s\u00ed, est\u00e1 incluido el espa\u00f1ol entre los idiomas disponibles para subt\u00edtulos).\n\nAdem\u00e1s de la historia del juego en s\u00ed, Never Alone cuenta con muchos v\u00eddeos que iremos desbloqueando conforme vayamos avanzando, a modo de documental del pueblo de I\u00f1upiaq mostrando a sus gentes, sus costumbres, vivencias y experiencias, adem\u00e1s de historias y leyendas t\u00edpicas de su folclore. \n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\n\nNever Alone es un plataformas simple pero con algunos puzzles muy originales. Salta, ag\u00e1chate para protegerte de las ventiscas, aprovecha las r\u00e1fagas de viento, usa al zorro para llegar a donde Nuna no puede hacerlo, etc. Hay que reconocer que (al menos bajo mi punto de vista), salvo dos o tres puzzles entre juego base y DLC, la mayor\u00eda de ellos son muy sencillos y no supondr\u00e1n un reto a los que busquen algo m\u00e1s complejo.\n\nUno de los puntos m\u00e1s destacables de Never Alone, es que nos ofrece la posibilidad de jugarlo solos o con un compa\u00f1ero que controlar\u00e1 al segundo personaje, ya sea Nuna o el zorro \u00e1rtico en cooperativo local. No he podido probar a jugarlo con teclado, pero con mando la experiencia es buena (yo uso el mando de XBOX 360). El juego se puede pasar perfectamente jugando solo como ha sido mi caso, teniendo que ir alternando entre ambos personajes para ir solucionando los puzzles que se van presentando. \n\nComo punto negativo, hay que decir que el control no responde todo lo bien que deber\u00eda, provoc\u00e1ndonos fallar muchas veces en los saltos siendo imprecisos. Tambi\u00e9n en el aspecto de jugabilidad, sufriremos los fallos de la IA de vez en cuando, puesto que el personaje que controla el ordenador se quedar\u00e1 atascado, no avanzar\u00e1, o \"se suicidar\u00e1\" en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]Sonido:[/h1]\n\nEl sonido cumple perfectamente siendo muy agradable, tanto la banda sonora (incluida en la edici\u00f3n Artic Collection) como el sonido ambiental y las voces que narran la historia. \n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\n\nNever Alone usa el motor gr\u00e1fico Unity, dando como resultado un conjunto muy bello. Los paisajes y modelados de los personajes est\u00e1n realizados con mucho mimo. Sin duda uno de los puntos fuertes del juego. El agua, hielo, nieve, las ventiscas, los bosques, lagos, fauna, el modelado de los personajes... todo es de una gran belleza, se nota que se ha hecho todo con mucho cari\u00f1o.\n\nPara no extenderme m\u00e1s, os dejo a modo de resumen mi lista de pros y contras:\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n\n- Est\u00e9ticamente es muy bello\n\n- Es una bonita historia\n\n- Los valores que transmite\n\n- Los personajes secundarios del folclore i\u00f1upiaq\n\n- El zorro\n\n- Los peque\u00f1os documentales que incluye y que podremos ir desbloqueando conforme avancemos\n\n- Tiene logros Steam\n\n- Se puede jugar en cooperativo en el mismo PC\n\n- Traducido al espa\u00f1ol\n\n- Se puede encontrar muy barato en \u00e9poca de ofertas, junto con el DLC y la banda sonora\n\n- Tiene cromos Steam\n\n[h1]CONTRAS:[/h1]\n\n- La IA del personaje que controla el ordenador a veces falla\n\n- Algunos bugs en las f\u00edsicas\n\n- No tiene cooperativo online\n\n- A veces tiene bugs que impiden avanzar, oblig\u00e1ndonos a salir del juego y volver a cargar la partida (me ha pasado un par de veces, una en el juego base y otra en el DLC)\n\n- El control podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s pulido\n\n- Puede hacerse algo repetitivo\n\n- Es demasiado f\u00e1cil, no supondr\u00e1 un reto a los jugadores experimentados en plataformas\n\n- Es muy corto, en 3h y media como mucho lo tendr\u00e1s terminado sin demasiados problemas\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n:[/h1] \n\nNever Alone me ha parecido un juego muy interesante por la parte cultural, por hacerme conocer m\u00e1s de cerca las tradiciones y costumbres del pueblo I\u00f1upiaq del \u00c1rtico. Como juego de plataformas me ha parecido bastante simple y facil\u00f3n, aunque original en algunos apartados y de una gran belleza visual. El conjunto es bastante bueno y merece mucho la pena, siempre que tengamos en cuenta desde un principio que se trata de un t\u00edtulo m\u00e1s cultural y de caracter divulgativo que de un plataformas cl\u00e1sico. Ideal comprarlo en ofertas a precio reducido y especialmente en su versi\u00f3n Artic Collection, que incluye el DLC Foxtales (a continuaci\u00f3n incluyo el an\u00e1lisis) y la BSO.\n----------------------------\n\n[h1]AN\u00c1LISIS DE NEVER ALONE: FOXTALES (DLC)[/h1]\n\nEl DLC a\u00f1ade 1h/1h y media aproximadamente de juego adicional a lo que ya pudimos ver en Never Alone. Si te gust\u00f3 el juego base recomiendo que juegues tambi\u00e9n al DLC (viene incluido en la edici\u00f3n Artic Collection junto con la BSO, opci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s interesante que comprarlo por separado). Viajes en canoa, m\u00e1s plataformeo con el zorro, nuevos puzzles y retos por superar, m\u00e1s v\u00eddeos culturales de la tribu de los I\u00f1upiaq y poco m\u00e1s que a\u00f1adir. \n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n\n- Una nueva historia relacionada con el mundo de Never Alone\n\n- Poder disfrutar m\u00e1s tiempo del zorro \n\n- Los nuevos escenarios\n\n- Viajar en el \"umiaq\" (canoa con piel de foca)\n\n- Traducido la espa\u00f1ol\n\n- Los mensajes educativos que inculca\n\n- M\u00e1s videos culturales para conocer las historias, costumbres y vivencias de la tribu I\u00f1upiaq\n\n- El rat\u00f3n (sus dos versiones)\n\n- Tiene unos cuantos logros m\u00e1s adem\u00e1s de los del juego base\n\n[h1]CONTRAS:[/h1]\n\n- Muuuuy corto, en 1 hora y media como mucho lo habr\u00e1s terminado\n\n- Su precio si lo compras por separado es muy elevado con respecto a lo que ofrece\n\n- Requiere el juego base Never Alone\n\n[h1]CONCLUSI\u00d3N:[/h1]\n\nSi te gust\u00f3 Never Alone ju\u00e9galo sin duda, aunque en mi opini\u00f3n no merece la pena comprarlo por separado al precio original de 3'99\u20ac debido a su cort\u00edsima duraci\u00f3n y poco contenido adicional, espera a encontrarlo muy rebajado o [b]mucho mejor si lo compras en el pack Artic Collection que viene con el juego base y la banda sonora.[/b]\n\nNo dud\u00e9is en dejar vuestros comentarios si quer\u00e9is hacer alg\u00fan aporte, correcci\u00f3n o valoraci\u00f3n del an\u00e1lisis.

Add in managing to glitch on ledges so my character would be stuck twitching mid-air, and characters randomly refusing to face the direction I was indicating, and it gets frustrating fast.

The bad news is you will undoubtedly be using them even if you don't screw up anything yourself.\n\nI threw in the towel after the third time climbing up several spirit ledges and platforms (controlled by Fox), alternating between the two characters to get both to the top, only to have the uncontrolled character dive all the way to the bottom - requiring me to start the whole process over again.

Not exactly unique in the gaming industry. However, games focused on the arctic and Inuit culture are more rare. Unfortunately, despite the beauty and cultural immersion, the game doesn't provide a worthwhile experience.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Gorgeous Graphics. I don't believe I've ever seen such beautiful images. The character models are incredibly detailed and the motion is extremely smooth.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Bad Platforming. You could call this a \"heavy\" platformer, similar to Trine. The controls are slow and there is a lot of physics going on. Unfortunately, this game is way \"heavier\" than Trine. The physics are outright frustrating.\n- Poor Game Design. So you have a heavy platformer, which already makes the controls difficult to handle. Then the designers had the great idea of making a primary mechanic be a blizzard. Which makes the controls even more difficult to handle. And kills you occasionaly, since you have to be watching extremely carefully to find the pattern.\n- Lackluster Story. The story isn't anything special. It's a retelling of an Inuit tale, which is fine, but nothing stellar. And it's completely linear, so there are no choices at all to be made.\n- Mediocre Music. I can't remember it. It does nothing for the game.\n- Glitchy Death Sequences. Sometimes they triggered and you saw the second character cry before the screen faded to black. Sometimes there was an abrupt flash and you found yourself back at a checkpoint. \n- Stunningly Stupid AI. In the vein of many games recently, there are two protagonists and you must switch between them to complete the puzzles. Unfortunately, the AI is extremely poor. It killed itself on several occasions, and would often just stop following you forcing you to switch characters just to move through a level.\n\nCONCLUSION;\n\nThis game could have been better. Much better. It could have been quite enjoyable, though it's so linear. But the gameplay ruined it.

It revolves around a girl named Nuna and a fox that desides to help her on her journey to find the source of what is overwelming her village with a never-ending blizzard. This can be played both single player and co-op (locally). It tells a traditional story of the I\u00f1upiat, who are an Alaskan Native people, and gives video insights throughout the game to tell you more about the members of the Alaskan Native community's culture, values, and wisdom.\n\nIt took me about two and a half hours to get through the main game. An extra hour is me going through a certain section again to get an insight video that I missed, and to take some screenshots, as well as buy the DLC (Never Alone: Foxtails). The DLC is about an hour long and I got the rest of my time from going over the last section in the DLC to get more screenshots.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game, the art/graphics (while a bit outdated), still look fairly good considering the passage of time and the general budget of Indie titles. I enjoyed the story and getting to know more about the I\u00f1upiat culture. I loved the connection between the girl and the fox and their personal journies through the environment. I've read a lot of people talking about the controls, and although I see their grievances to some extent, it never bothered me all that much. For the most part, I was able to do as I needed to progress through the game. There were times where I would die because I wasn't quite sure where to go, but I felt like it was either my fault for not getting it, or just a part of discovering what to do because the game decided to let you figure some stuff out on your own. That isn't to say it was completely hands-off either, because when I died on a particular part a couple times it would give visual hints of what I needed to do. There was only a very rare occasion where I knew what to do but couldn't do it but of how precise you had to be. These situations mostly happened in the last section. At that point I did get a bit frustrated, but it didn't even come close to overshadowing the good parts of the experience (which was a vast majority of the game).\n\nThe menu is a bit troublesome in my opinion because you have to use arrow keys, where with the rest of the game you are using WASD, so it was a bit unintuitive and confusing. There are settings and options for graphics, audio, ect. and it was all pretty standard so there really isn't anything to complain about there.\n\nDespite the negatives I mentioned, I personally recommend this game, because I enjoyed it regardless of these minor (in my opinion) inconveniences. However, I would say you need to understand this game is more about the journey. If you are someone who gets frusterated easily you might not enjoy it because the moments where the game isn't flawless might blind you from seeing the rest of the game. Considering the game is only about three hours to complete (and giving the negatives above) I would reccomend it on a sale.\n\nHere is a link to the DLC review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamingphoenixfox/recommended/355740", "timestamp_created": 1510992178, "timestamp_updated": 1510992287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36540270": {"recommendationid": "36540270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034739619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1510783570}, "language": "english", "review": "Never Alone is a very short double story platform. \n\nIt's mandatory to get also the DLC because the game can be finished with a good number of achivements in a day.\nUnder the veil of a videogame lies anyway a documentary about Alaska peoples. And it makes a really good job. Unlocking achivements you directly unlock a short movie of the documentary, that I've found sweet and interesting. \n\nThe culture of the peoples is transmitted and it will be clear in the middle of the adventure that the game is just secondary to a great message: respect the nature.\n\nIn any case, I've found well realized everything you will see, even if short as I've already told.\nThe secondary tale, the Fox tale or tale of the big rat, is in my opinion better designed and realized. Graphics reaches a photographic level with blurred elements in the first field and the focus in the middle, to give you a depth of field very well done.\n\nMusic can be listened even after the game has been finished, as a relaxing new age experience... if you need this kind of \"sounds\".\nAt last just a little bug. The final scene of the fox tale has been suppressed by a black screen, while I've seen that there was a \"final scene\" by a documentary video.

Also you have to make sure your character is facing the right way, beocuse you can't turn around once you grab the bola....\n\nThe camera often leaves you wondering what it is doing, when a character is up high they tend to focus that character more then one that fell down, needs to climb back up.

It's hard to control but easy to love.\n\nBuilt on the rich Inuit culture, Kisima Ingitchuna encompasses art, story, language, characters based on the history and folklore of those peoples. The presentation of this is mostly done in a solid manner. Inuit art and language are used for cutscenes as well as the story being a traditional I\u00f1upiaq tale. By playing the game, unlockable videos also provide insight into some of the concepts and items behind the game.\n\nThe gameplay takes place in a 2D tundra world where obstacles provide the meat of the light puzzle solving where not too much thinking is required. The basic concept here being switching between Nuna and Fox where both have their own skills to help the other. The theory being when you move one, the other will follow (if you opened the path for them). This however does not always work as expected as I found myself having to switch between characters frequently as the other would just not do what I wanted and sometimes even killed themselves. The developers did include a local co-op mode so the second character can be controlled by a human. I recommend you try that.\n\nControlling the characters is a whole other can of beans. Characters feel heavy when moving, shooting the Bola is imprecise, swimming is.. well lets just say Mario would win gold in Olympic swimming on his day off after he had too much to drink the night before, Luigi would be second, Nuna and Fox would be disqualified for drowning. Controlling the kayak (DLC) is basically impossible.\n\nNever Alone does a beautiful job of presenting itself. It has an unique concept tied to it and the execution of its artistic values are done well. Technically, it's a bit of a mess especially in the controls department. Gameplay is passable but too shallow for my taste. It's weak in puzzles and platforming and can hardly stand on its own adventure. There's no real depth to anything apart from the story if you can delve past the ambiguity of it. It's a shame because it is artistically very pleasing.\n\nI don't think the game is worth the full price but you should try it just the same.

The story revolves around a child who becomes separated from her village during a devastating blizzard. Luckily, she's rescued by a seemingly magical Snow White fox. The primary objective of the game is to find the unknown source of the blizzard and stop it at any cost necessary. Throughout the game, you're able to switch between playing as the child and the white fox. Quite a few puzzles actually require you to do so in order to navigate through them.  \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWhile the gameplay is very straightforward, I honestly found the simplicity enjoyable and preferred in this scenario. During gameplay, you're forced to navigate through multiple puzzles that are thought-provoking and intertwined with the plot. Completing these puzzles will progress you through the story and unlock absolutely amazing cutscenes that further develop the narrative. Throughout the game, I had experience with controls occasionally being unresponsive and frankly unusable for a certain duration. Even though it's a disappointing defect, I found the game amazing nonetheless.\n\n[h1]Narration/Audio[/h1]\nThe narration in Never Alone is heart-wrenching and soul-defining. From the moment I started the game, I was hooked and unable to stop listening to the beautifully composed narrative. Furthermore, the music they incorporated into the gameplay is perfectly suited for the atmosphere that's demonstrated within the game.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nNever Alone is a beautiful demonstration of how a puzzle-adventure game is done correctly. I was pleasantly pleased with everything the game had to offer, and while a few defects are present, I genuinely don't believe they're a significant issue. Overall, for the reasonable price of 14.99$, I would highly recommend Never Alone to anyone who enjoys a casual puzzle experience with a twist. \n\n[h1]General: 7/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1507229192, "timestamp_updated": 1507230155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810919106006622314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35426347": {"recommendationid": "35426347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069238064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1506970785}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego muy sencillo en sus planteamientos jugables, siendo un juego de plataformas y puzles bastante sencillo.

Character designs were cute, not the most unique, but nice. The fact that the storyteller spoke the native tongue of the Inuites really spoke to me. (heh) And the game had an ethreal ambience to it, the overall 'feel' is calming and beautiful.\n\nHOWEVER \n\nI haven't screamed at a game this much for a while. The game has a good cause, but it has been executed REALLY BADLY.\nThe first few levels are allright, because the game keeps it fairly simple. You (most of the time) have time to react to things, and can work out the fairly simple puzzles in peace. However, when the pace gets faster, the clunky controls really start to drag you down. You'll die multiple times, not only because of the controls, but because your character decides to jump on itself over the ledge, or the dumb-as-a-boot-AI decides to kill itself by stopping to a place where it most likely will be squashed between two platworms. When playing a single player game you don't only have to look after yourself but also the AI with an IQ of a vegetable. If those things didn't make the game unfair for the player, should I mention that the game is RIDDLED with bugs. \n\nThe biggest fault in the game however is its inconsistancy, in terms of both gameplay AND storytelling. There are a lot of things that aren't explained to the player, and things that have been INTRODUCED at the start of the game, but end up working completely differently later on in the game. This causes you to AGAIN die multiple times before figuring out that the game designers have had a complete brain fart, and don't remember how they introduced a certain game feature, and ended up changing it, without realizing that this might confuse the shaite out of the player. There are also things that you realize to be deadly, but you can't figure this out before you're dead. Sometimes the game also requires you to have the reflexes of a karateka, but with the controls that is just a complete impossibility on your first run. \n\nAnd about the inconsistancies in the plotline. (Mind you, I did not watch the info videos, because I wanted to keep my immersion to the story as keen as possible, and I thought that the videos were only disturbing on that part.)  There were A LOT OF THINGS that made no sense. After beating the game I'm just left with a bunch of questions which I never got an answer to. What was the point of the Bola (other than showing the spirits)? Why did the bad-guy want itso bad? What was his role in all of this (more than be a filler), if the girl's town and family were going to be alright in the end anyway? But the biggest question at the end is: WHY WAS THE GIANT HAPPY after Nona literally WRECKED the thing that he was working on?! (Whatever that was anyway) There were just so many things that didn't make ANY sense. I could've forgiven the technical difficulties to the game, if they'd only delivered on the part of the plot but no. Sorry no, I just can't. \n\nOn the top of this.

The fox is much more fun.\n\nThe game overall [i]is[/i] fun, but honestly, I would recommend this game as I grind my teeth. I don't regret playing it, and will probably come back to it later just to snag the last few achievements and play Foxtales, but that'd be it. The puzzles are mediocre, the platforming can be incredibly frustrating at parts, and there are a few bugs here and there that can halt the progress at times.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nAs I was saying, the gameplay itself is alright. I found myself really annoyed with the wind mechanic, as even though there is a pattern to it, it does occasionally change, or sometimes, because of the level design, it can basically make you over-jump a gap and end up dying anyway because you flew right over the platform you were aiming for. The magnet mechanic to try and help you avoid falling over the edge can also be a pain, because at times it can make trying to make moving around a bit clunky as you might end up sticking to the edge for a moment and lose some momentum. Overall it's not terrible, but it feels like it could use some polish.\n\nAlso mentioned before, choose the Fox if you have a [strike]slave[/strike] friend to [strike]do all the tedious work[/strike] help. He's a lot more fun and feels better to move around with. I understand why Nuna doesn't move around as much, given her giant parka she's in, but nonetheless feels more fun to be able to leap around, wall-jump and get to do some of the more interesting work. \n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nThis was probably my favourite aspect of the game. I really love how the game presents itself. It does have that Limbo sort of feeling with the calm and quiet atmosphere, which is a refreshing feeling and change of pace. You don't feel too rushed and you can enjoy the scenery. The spirits that help you along the way are simple yet charming, Nuna and the fox are simple in design but look really nice. One character that I thought was a little off was [spoiler] the man who attacks Nuna's village.[/spoiler] I understand he's supposed to be bad and therefore unlikeable, but I feel like he just stood out a bit too much. Overall though, I love the look of the game. It doesn't try to be anything extravagant, and that's okay. It's simple but charming presentation is beautiful and definitely pleasing to take in all throughout the game.\n\n[h1]Bugs / Issues[/h1]\n\nThis is the part where I almost considered giving it a thumbs down, but I do feel it wasn't bad enough to sour my whole experience. When I played with my girlfriend, we'd find that sometimes Nuna would get stuck on platforms when she's climbing on spirits, I got glitched off and would fall to my death. I also mentioned in the gameplay section how the wind screwed me over occasionally as well. There is usually calm air with - I believe - a rhythymic gust that comes along every so often. One thing that I found, however, is that during some parts there's also this tiny little blow of wind that can impede your momentum, which isn't really used for anything. So I had a few instances where I was going to leap for a platform, and it's like the game poked me during midair and said \"lolbye.\" I had this happen a few times and it just felt annoying.\n\nThe camera is fairly solid, but there were I think two areas where it wasn't really clear where I had to go, and ended up going towards a small platforming area where I needed the fox to show the spirits before we went. There was one spirit rope that you would fling across, but there was a second one you needed to reveal to make it to the other side of the gap. We thought that maybe you just needed this stupidly precise jump to be able to clear it, but after we went back a little bit and checked out the area above, [i]then[/i] it showed up, despite not doing so before.\n\nAnother thing was the Insights. I couldn't actually play any of them because it would just result in a black screen with nothing going on, so I simply restarted the game. There are 20-some of them and they look interesting, but I can't even check them out, which is unfortunate. I had to go on YouTube to see them.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nDespite my incessant whining, I really did enjoy Never Alone. I'm usually playing a lot more hardcore games, but I got Never Alone as part of a bundle, and I think you should do the same, or at least wait for a sale. It only took me 2 hours to beat the game, and if I wasn't dawdling, I could have probably finished in an hour and a half. It's a lot to pay for so little gameplay. If you do get a chance to get the game for cheap, I would definitely recommend it for a quiet night where you want to wind down with a simple story and relatively calm progression.\n\nFox/10, wouldn't play again, but enjoyed the first ride anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1506016195, "timestamp_updated": 1506016231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35031903": {"recommendationid": "35031903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051929770", "num_games_owned": 881, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1505680283}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty disappointing in my opinion.\n\nThe controls are very.. frustrating.\nThe AI is dumb as bread and even kills itself a few times in the game.\nEspecially when wanting to play as the fox mainly, you'll have a bad time waiting for the little girl and be forced to switch to her (in places it shouldn't ne necessary) sometimes or else you can't progress.

The gameplay is very solid either in singleplayer or through local as co-op. It has a very fluid feel to it all, as well as a beautifully crafted story. \n\nThe story is based off the Alaskan natives known as the I\u00f1upiaq, and the game has very strong cultural undertones. To be more accurate the game is based off of the stories that the I\u00f1upiaq people tell eachother and pass down from generation to generation. As you play throughout the game you can discover these hidden little owls that unlock short movie clips (about 2 minutes each) that explain the culture and traditions of the I\u00f1upiaq people. There are 24 clips in total, with 5 additional in the DLC known as Foxtales.\n\nIt was a absolutely beautiful experience I had playing this game, and would reccomend it to anybody looking not only for a fun platforming game, but also for a fascinating learning experience of a different culture. \n\nThe base game took me roughly 4 hours to beat and would score it a 4/5.\nThe DLC Foxtales took me 1 hour to beat and would score it a 5/5. (This DLC is a masterpiece) \nThe last hour was spent watching the 29 clips in total.\n\nSo for 15 dollars (19 if including Foxtails) you're getting about a 6 hour experience full of fun and laughter and challenges along the way.

It is an E X P E R I E N C E. From the art to the soundtrack, the presentation was high quality, and these elements delivered a cohesive vision about the spiritual connection that humans have with the world around them. There is something so lonely yet comforting about the game and its embodiment of this message. Just thinking about the title screen, I can feel a tug on my heartstrings, and I can hear the soft piano track playing in the background. The high production value also manifests in other aspects of the game. Everything just looks really nice, from the art to the level design to font choice and to the documentary videos that you unlock as the story progresses.\n\nWith that said, some people may be turned off by the game-documentary-game-documentary format that is pushed by the developers. I didn't really mind it when I was playing it, but I do think it limits the \"fun\" of the game in a sense. On one hand, the short videos explained cultural elements of the levels, making my experience more enriching. Because of the background provided, the storyline and spiritual elements made sense.\n\nCharacterization was a little lacking; I didn't even know Nuna's name until I saw it on gamefaqs. You don't really get the antagonist's reason for being evil, either. Both simply exist because legend said so. I think the devs deliberately made this trade off to push the educational aspect of the game. Personally, I don't see why they couldn't do both. What I will commend them on, however, is fostering a relationship between the player as Nuna and her fox without having them say a word. This animal is your only companion in a bleak and grim world. It reminds me of Wander and Agro from Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nIn terms of level design, the game was easy to medium difficulty as a puzzle platformer. I felt that the solutions were intuitive, and you would quickly learn what to do and what not to do when interacting with spirits. There were only a handful of times where I got stumped to the point where I looked the answer up. I will say that the whiteness of the snowy backgrounds did make it hard to see both A) the solution and B) death-inducing parts of the environment. I can't tell you how many times I acidentally jumped into icicle spikes, thinking those were in the background.\n\nRegarding my frustrations, I was mainly more upset by the controls, as I found it extremely easy to fall off and die if you did not climb juuust high enough before jumping off a ledge.

This could be done with two players and I honestly think that would make the experience more enjoyable because at times you have to swap very quickly and move the characters a bit far to get through different obstacles. This would be much more seamless with a second player taking care of the different tasks while you focus on the tasks of one.\n\nIt does a great job teaching you all about the culture of the indigenous people of Alaska, the Inupiaq. It swaps back and forth between gameplay and live action video of people from the tribes explaining life in the\u00a0brutal conditions. Learning about this lifestyle is really what kept me personally interested until the end. It was so cool to hear them talking about how they are able to hunt for food in the month of November when there is no sunlight for the entire month. This among other anecdotes from the native people was a very entertaining addition and I believe that it gave the game an extra bit of depth than it would not have had otherwise.\n\nThe young girl and the fox set off on a journey that is an old tale of folklore called Kunuuksaayuka\u00a0passed down by the elders. It is traditionally a boy in the story but for the video game they decided to have the protagonist be represented as a girl. The girl comes home after being chased by a polar bear\u00a0to find that her village has been burned to the ground and destroyed. She runs into a man wearing a mask who inexplicably knows who she is and asks her to retrieve a drum of his that some mischievous little guys stole from him.\n\nAfter finding and returning the drum the girl is presented with\u00a0the bola, which is used to open many ice covered areas in the game, and is traditionally\u00a0 a weapon used for hunting. An evil man soon catches up to the girl and it becomes clear that the man was looking for the bola when he burned her village to the ground. The girl and the fox make a break for it using the new weapon to aid them in their journey moving forward.\n\nA very beautiful section of the game comes when the girl and the fox come across the Northern Lights. A phenomenon that is clearly visible from Alaska and is tied into the gameplay in a very interesting way. They say that the Northern Lights would come down and grab the children if they ventured too far, surely as a means to keep them close to the adults and not wandering off into hostile territory. So to tie this in they made the Lights fly around the screen leaving a green trail everywhere it goes. If you come across the front of the trail where there is a face and arms pictured, you will be snatched up by the lights, just as in the old tales of the elders. An interesting touch and it made for some very beautiful level designs.\n\nAfter a perilous journey, tragedy strikes and\u00a0(spoiler: highlight to reveal) the fox dies after a hard fall. The girl is heartbroken but as in the title she will learn that she is never alone even when her dear friend has passed on. The spirit of the fox comes to aid her on the rest of the journey and we are taught a valuable lesson that the natives believed about the spirits of animals. From this point on the floating spirit is the second player.\n\nThis leads to a bunch of new and cool mechanics, such as obviously the flying around to any point on the screen, but there are many other things it introduces as well. The fox can awaken the spirits of the land and help by moving things to help the girl get around, such as the branches of a tree or something to get a grip while climbing up the side of a mountainous area. I wasn't sure I was going to like this change at first, but when I saw all of the different mechanics that it brought along with it I was sold. The change helps to bring a sort of new life to the game when you are starting to get a little bit burnt out on doing the same types of\u00a0environmental puzzles with the two characters.\n\nSo the apparent mission of the two is to hunt down whatever might be causing the everlasting blizzard that has been plaguing all of the people. After searching long and hard and finding their way through many strange and difficult environments, they come across the answer. There is an Ice Giant that is constantly hammering away at icy mountain tops, causing the incredible snowfall and wind that has made it so hard to reach this point.\n\nThe girl notices a way to get up to the hammer of the giant and with the help of her spirit friend she climbs up and knocks it out of his hands. The two make their way to the hammer and are able to damage it so that the giant can not use it to cause the terrible blizzards anymore and the girl is immortalized as a hero to the people. It wasn't a very long game but the story is rich with culture and history, it makes for a very unique experience and the gameplay was good enough to at least keep you going as you uncover more and more about this unique sect of people who have endured such a harsh and rugged land.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFull review here https://wordpress.com/post/thewellredmage.wordpress.com/76973\n\n\nFollow on Twitter & IG @SublimeReviews\u2028http://www.sublimereviews.wordpress.com\n\nI also contribute at http://www.thewellredmage.wordpress.com as the Midnight Mystic Mage\n\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel for all of my Let's Plays and more! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN6DkRKURAREGW6WqsNXp4w", "timestamp_created": 1499994001, "timestamp_updated": 1499994001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33504887": {"recommendationid": "33504887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102968340", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1499955972}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Never Alone[/i] is an linear light puzzle platformer with the Alaskan Natives' culture and mystical elements. \n\nThe game does well in being a puzzle game; it offers appropriate difficulties, ensuring it can be enjoyed by the masses rather than the hardcore minority. However, what makes [i]Never Alone[/i] stands out is not only the game itself; it is all the cultural elements integrated in the gameplay, the story, the setting, and the art style. \n\nThe killer point of this game: it offers [b]minute-long documentaries about lives, values, and cultures of the natives as well as elements in the game.[/b] The documentaries are offered as collectables that present themselves in the game as owls. This provides both an incentive to unlock all achievements and an unique opportunity to peak into the lives of the Alaskan Natives, who remain in hunting-gathering lifestyles till this day. \n\nThe short documentaries, known as \"Cultural Insights\" in the game, total to a number of 30, including those in the Foxtale DLC. The documentaries paint a vivid picture of the Alaskan native culture and the people thereof, and it immediately sparked my interest. [b]The clips reveal values and philosophies of the native people[/b], which could very well lend insight to the lives of us city-dewellers. I may not play the game itself again, but I probably will watch the clips again.\n\nIn the game there are two controllable characters, the girl and the fox. If you are playing alone, you alternate between the characters to solve the puzzles. [b]The game also offers a cooperation option[/b], so you can play with your friend, family, or boy/girlfriend if you have one. I don't.\n\n[b]Be sure your FPS is high for this game.[/b] If you have a bad computer like I do, you will get very low performance. As a result, the controls become delayed and unresponsive. This is DAMAGING to the gameplay. For a lot of my hours spent on the game, I wrestled with the controls. But please beware of the fact that this is my problem, not the game's.\n\n[b]The Foxtale DLC is a must-have.[/b] I picked up both during summer sale for an insane price, and it is worth every penny even if I bought it for the original price. The DLC offers a new story with the same characters and another hour of gameplay, while revealing more insights into the native philosophy. I personally feel that the puzzles in the DLC is more fun to solve than whose in the original game.\n\nOverall, [i]Never Alone[/i] is a casual game that is fit for all to play. If you like puzzles, casual games, love documentaries, and/or have a boy/girlfriend, I strongly recommend this. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1499957471, "timestamp_updated": 1499957502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33429419": {"recommendationid": "33429419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208281208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1499688572}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful game with a great story about the North Pole told by people from the North Pole.\nRuns great on a GTX780 and a I7 4770K 60 FPS 1440P.\nI played this with my girlfriend the whole story till the end. \nHad a great laugh and the game showed us some wonderful moments about friendship. \n\nHad this in the Steamsale and totally worth it, for full price it's a little expensive.\nBut together with DLC, great for 4 hours.\n", "timestamp_created": 1499688933, "timestamp_updated": 1499688933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33415664": {"recommendationid": "33415664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118214414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1499453782}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the way, how the developers turned the old story into a game and combined it with cultural insights.

You play a little bit then unlock a new video that talks about a particular aspect of I\u00f1upiat life. The video clips somewhat reflect what's going on the game. The documentary itself was around a half hour long all together. The documentary was somewhat interesting. It was jarring to learn about the very harsh environments they survived through in northern Alaska without the benefit of modern technology. No modern day wussies would be able to hang with them. It's a far cry from the climate controlled, on-demand amenities of modern living where there's free time to play silly video games. The actual game play in the main campaign is just boring. The puzzles are simple and weak. There's a mechanic where the fox interacts with spirits that move objects in the environment. Anything to do with manipulating spirit objects was tedious. Moving the objects was slow and the button had to held down the whole time while moving objects into place. The controls felt like they needed another round of polish too. They were somewhat stiff. The graphics were Ok. The game world is set in the frozen Alaska wilderness so there's just a lot of different shades of white. The aesthetic of the game is bland as everything is covered in snow. That's the terrain of where the I\u00f1upiat people live in so what are you gonna do? The DLC, Foxtales, was a bit of an improvement virtually on all fronts. The visuals were noticeably punched up and there were some actual puzzles to solve. It was actually engaging and made me have to think about things for a moment. Thankfully, you can play the DLC right away from the main menu and you can skip the main quest and dive straight into the fun part. The game took around 6 hours to finish everything.

The game allows controlling the two characters individually, and is a platform puzzler. The game is notable for combining a traditional cultural story into a video game layered with authentic artwork and narrated in the native tongue. There are several in-game videos that can be unlocked to know more about the cultural background of elements found throughout the game. Though the gameplay feels somewhat unpolished, the overall experience is that of an interactive story, and is rewarding as a co-op adventure. The entire array of narration, artwork, and design lends an amazing credibility to the story and feels authentic. It somewhat reminded me of Studio Ghibli in a very distant way. The puzzles are interesting, but not the focus of the story. Playing them is one way to enjoy the story rather than simply click to move forward.

Road to hell is paved, etc etc.\n\nThe idea with this game was to tell a Native Alaskan folktale with the input of the actual Native Alaskans. That\u2019s a lovely sentiment, and indeed the game is interspersed with video of the people talking about their culture. These videos, dubbed \u201cCultural Insights,\u201d were really cool and interesting, and were easily the best part about the game (edit: except in that they had to be unlocked by triggering random waypoints, which was really annoying when they were the highlight).\n\nThe art was also very nice, though the 3D models themselves were awkward.\n\nThe problem is literally everything else.\n\nFirst of all\u2026 okay. So you move around with your left hand and the normal WASD controls. But the \u201cinteract\u201d button is the left shift key. Not either shift key, not the right, the left. This meant that to interact with the environment, you either had to cross your right hand over, take your hands off the arrow keys, or contort your hand so that you could, say, hold W, D, and LS at the same time. I have small hands, but I am confident that after hours of this anyone would be uncomfortable. I literally was still in pain the day after I played, not joking.\n\nMeanwhile, You use the space bar to jump and the left mouse button to attack. So while your left hand is playing Cirque du Soleil, your right is hopping back and forth between the mouse and the keyboard, all in a vain effort to play the damn game.\n\nMEANWHILE, the key to toggle character modes is Q, while is right next to W, so as you\u2019re flailing around trying to jump and drag and walk to the right at the same time, you may just accidentally swap to another character somewhere else on the map. Then you die.\n\nLike\u2026 I know this may not sound bad because I\u2019m not sure how to describe four hours of increasing pinky pain and utter frustration, but I don\u2019t think this is a complaint I\u2019ve ever made on this blog before, or in my life before, so try to give me the benefit of the doubt.\n\nMeanwhile, when the controls did work physically, they were incredibly clunky and unreliable in the game. Often I had to press the mouse button several time to get one attack off, jumps seems to execute whenever they felt like, and the physics were just not. This game is ostensibly a platformer, a genre that is predicated on quick, precise controls. Between the unreliable nature of the characters\u2019 weights, jump distances, and speed, the question of whether or not button-presses would work, and the ridiculous layout, the game was almost unplayable. Forget about something like timing jumps. It was so fucking frustrating.\n\nMeanwhile, so, there\u2019s two player characters. At all times, one of them is controlled by the single stupidest AI ever, and if the AI dies it counts as a death. So much of my time was a race to the next save point before the AI committed suicide. So. Much. There were also parts of the game where the two characters had to be close together or the platforms would disappear. The AI seemed to get great joy out of wandering off and letting me fall to my death. Over. And over. And over.\n\nThe game is also really buggy. Sometimes when you\u2019d jump to cling onto a wall, the sprite would hit the wall, flail in the air for 10 seconds, and then die, even if there was ground right underneath. There was a whole area of wall-climbing that was just the most Sisyphean exercise in futility. There was also one point where I was standing on solid ground waiting for a platform to come close, and I just fell through the ground into the level below. Just, plop, into the hillside and out the bottom.\n\nAnother big issue is that there was very little sense of gameplay progression. Large swaths of the game are just walking through barren snowscapes, and every once in a while there will be a platform you have to jump to. There\u2019s not much of an increase in difficultly as things go on, and new mechanics are introduced very sparingly. Then there\u2019s the narration that actually tells the story, which is really, really widely dispersed. Every fifteen minutes or so the narrator would spout of two \u201cAnd then this happened\u2026\u201d lines and then disappear forever, something no doubt made worse by the billion times I died. Then there\u2019s the cultural videos, which are a few minutes long apiece.\n\nThe end result is that the pacing is terrible. I\u2019d love to see the entire script for the game; it\u2019s probably just a few pages. This game took me four hours to play, and virtually nothing happened. You\u2019d think that working with folklore there\u2019s be a lot of interesting and exciting plot events to throw in, but the vast majority of the game was just walking in silence. It never really feels like you\u2019re getting anywhere; the protagonists don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re accomplishing anything. Hell, it feels like they\u2019re at the whim of the narrator, not the setting itself; they have no real agency or personalities, no real emotions we\u2019re shown, they just walk, then stop for two lines of narration, then walk some more.\n\nOne thing I really don\u2019t think the game considered is that these stories that come from oral traditions are meant to be experienced all at once. When in between the old woman (well, man, but I picture it as a woman) dramatically giving her monologue you intersperse (frustrating) video game, you lose something that I think is really integral to the experience. The whole thing is disjointed, as though the game, the storytelling, and the real people we\u2019re seeing on video all have nothing to do with each other.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just kind of confused about the way this was told. Why doesn\u2019t the girl get any lines? Why doesn\u2019t the villain? Why not make her, the character, the way through which this story is told (as one would expect) and use the narrator as a bridging event, for time jumps and to skip the \u201cwalking through barren snowscapes\u201d thing that sucks so much? I think whoever was behind this had the idea of what they wanted to do \u2014 Alaskan folklore, with the Alaskan people, in video game form \u2014 but really had no idea how to weave those things together in a coherent whole. The result is something that even awful gameplay aside is less than the sum of its parts.\n\nSo\u2026 yeah. Skip the game. But go watch the cultural videos, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re online somewhere, and they\u2019re wonderful.", "timestamp_created": 1496259485, "timestamp_updated": 1496259485, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451019048690795898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32085895": {"recommendationid": "32085895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051817494", "num_games_owned": 5015, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1495735321}, "language": "spanish", "review": "IT'S A TRAP!\n\u00a1Este juego ES un documental!\nBueno, luego de dada esa advertencia casi obligada...

First, game control, especially for single players, is really irritaing, because the player has to switch between the two main characters. Once you are in control of one, the other moves purely on AI, which often falls behind the character being in control, and fall off platforms. This causes the player to have to replay the scene from the check point. \n\nMoreover, there are times that the AI-controlled character just stands still and the scene is fixed, restraining the other character (in control) from progressing. This, once or twice, has resulted in death of the character from hitting the constraint and falling.\n\nThe characters' reaction when the other one dies is highly unrealisticm which really agitates me. The fox/ the girl whines when the other dies wherever they are, even when they are not supposed to see the death, e.g. they're facing the other way or they are behind walls. Some people might not care, but this really bothers me (sorry for the rant.)\n\nThe narrative of the game is based mainly on cutscenes. The game itself doesn't provide much additional information that would keep the player intrigued. There are collectable short documentaries (which I honestly don't watch because it is complete separated from the game and watching them while playing would take away the flow, but that's my personal preference. I'm sure they are informative, but I just don't like watching it while playing. I prefer having the game telling the information, not documentary videos.) \n\nIn the game, most levels are highly repetitive, with the same jumping and running over and over again. There are quite a few chasing scenes, which requires the player to perform the same task over and over.\nNew methods are introduced intermitently, but they become overused after a while. \n\nGame levels are puzzle-based, with in-between scenes where you just run. The puzzles aren't so intuitive, plus there are hints available, which is good in case you're stuck. Nevertheless, the character movements are really slow, and the graphic response isn't really good. There are times I try to jump over rocks and stuck mid air, doing glitchy moves, before falling into pits; or trying to jump to the wall with the fox, but falling directly into the water; or getting confused with the preset movement, especially getting up from water (which requires the player to press W, while sprinting uses SPACE, which results in me jamming SPACE, trying to get up.)\n\nThe 2.5D platformer puzzle game style reminds me of Limbo or Inside, with a more heartwarming story line. However, the puzzles in Never Alone, I emphasize, are way less complex, and the story progress slower. \n\nFor me, this game lacks components that would keep the players interested for a long time. It has nice aesthetic and eye-opening storyline, but the simplicity and lenghtiness, combined with uncompromising puzzle game mechanics take away the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1494383825, "timestamp_updated": 1494384400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542208731174468994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31624016": {"recommendationid": "31624016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166097372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1465081235}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game with an amazing story-telling and nice puzzles.

I still was enamored enough to finish it, but I'm left feeling a little unsure of how willing I am to recommend this game. \n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1492530712, "timestamp_updated": 1492530712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525105774402618408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31190476": {"recommendationid": "31190476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024176408", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1492484494}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Increible juego, increibles graficos, y sobre todo, cuenta una historia real.\n\n200% recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1492392936, "timestamp_updated": 1492392936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31170980": {"recommendationid": "31170980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048459369", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1492319292}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a short-story, great for a couple hours.

It plays very well as a local co-op game and I encourage everyone to play [i]Never Alone[/i] together as the dynamic of girl and fox is much more fluid with a friend by your side. I played through with my wife and it was much preferred to playing solo.\n\nThe visuals and audio are as adorable as each other. The sounds of the fox, especially during the accidental death of either character, are so heartbreakingly cute. There were a lot of unintentional deaths though, mainly due to how poor the controls are in this game. The wonky physics also contributed a significant amount to our demise as we would often be launched into the stratosphere or violently teleport all over the screen after becoming stuck on a ledge. Despite these issues it only took us roughly 4 hours to play through both the main story and the expansion. I don't think I could recommend [i]Never Alone[/i] at full price so it's worth waiting\u200b for a sale.\n\nThe portrayal of these indigenous people and their culture is fantastic. I loved unlocking and watching each little piece of footage that provided further exposition to the game, to the history of its story, and to the people it is based on.\n\n[i]Never Alone[/i] is a lovely little game where a lot of patience and care has been put into its design and development. It never outstayed its welcome and the mechanics of the game were changed up often enough to keep things interesting to the very end.

It's not your average shooter, or whatever. This game has much more to it then what we usually see as gamers. There is a story and a long history put into this that many people don't get to see or hear. I have always been interested in Alaskan history and stories, and though my beliefs are not the same I greatly enjoyed playing this and learning about the I\u00f1upiat people. I appreciate it when people put so much effort into a game and its story that you can take it with you wherever you go. I can't remember the last time that I heard a story that made me ponder about it afterwards. I might even tell it to other people I know! There are many games that I play only once, but I know I will play this many times. I really wish that there were more games like this out there, and I hope that the devs will come out with more stories like this in the future. I don't ever hear stories from the people around me, so I get excited and love to listen to stories like this when I get the chance. I know that some people were agrivated that this was more of a documentary then a game, but I feel like it should be ok for there to be games out there that have backgrounds that come from people's hearts, rather than the games we have today. A lot of the games I've played have an empty feeling to them, and they don't feel like they have much substance. \n\nNow for the actual gameplay! First off, I absolutely loved the art. I don't think I've seen artwork as beautiful as this, and I've played a variety of games. The music, sound effects, and voice over fit very well with the game and the story! Some people thought it was too short, but I thought it was just right. Do we always need 60-70 hours of gameplay? I don't think so. I grew up playing games again and again, and it was fun because I got to experience memories of the last time that I played. The controls did seem hard at times, but I personally thought that this added to the challenge of playing. The puzzels were sometimes easy, I found a handful that were hard, but I think that this is good as it makes it to where people of all ages can play. I can imagine that this was the devs goal, because this is more about getting a story out than challenging hardcore gamers. I'm not saying that there's no challenge, I'm just saying that it's challenging enough that it is playable by everyone. I also liked it that there were only a few buttons that were used throughout the game, instead of having 10+ buttons involved. This also kept things simple so that anyone could play. The companion AI is also the best I've ever seen. I usually spend most of my time in games getting the AI out of trouble, but this rarely happened here! \n\nSo would I recomend it? You bet!

It's very cute and has a lot of native and cultural inspiration. My favorite part about the game is how much research they put into this game and how much it shows. Watching the insights really gives you, dare I say, insight on the background of this game. The environment and story and characters are relatable and brings out your inner hero(ine) and make you feel immersed in the game. I started watching the insights for the achievement in all honesty, but when I actually listened, I felt a connection to the indigenious people and their culture as well as the game. After playing this game, my eyes were opened to a new way of life and thinking, and I appreciate it so much. I loved the impact that this game had on me.\n\nMoving onto the game itself, it's a bit difficult to master the controls, but you get used to it. I would probably reccommend using the co-op mode (which I wish was not only local) because I think it would be easier, and also mirrors the connection between Nuna and her fox friend (though I personally have not tried it). The graphics are simply stunning, very simple yet so detailed. The relationship between the fox and Nuna is so important because as the title suggests you never feel alone, and really the title suggests more towards the spirits that guide us and are always around us. In such a technological age, it's nice to feel that connection.\n\nThe interaction with the spirits is unique and I love the appearance of them all. Whenever the game shows a story, it is depicted in an art style that reflected the I\u00f1upiat's and it was so lovely to see.\n\nPros:\n+ Heartwarming story\n+ Addresses an issue of climate change\n+ Characters feel real\n+ Lovely graphics\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Narrator (no dialogue)\n+ Real-world inspiration\n+ Immersive, impactful\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes scary (I get scared easily though)\n- No online co-op\n- Some areas are difficult (resulting in lots of death and death noises)\n- Controlling Nuna and the fox at the same time can be difficult (single-player)\n- Controls are admittedly slow\n- AI Nuna/Fox could be better\n\ntl;dr If you like seeing cultural influence and spirits fascinate you as much me, I reccommend it!

A message however that could have been delivered in a better way.  At a glance may seem completely harmless, but even with the aesthetics and tone of the game, it is a flawed experience.\n\nSoundtrack\nSound is nothing even worth mentioning here. It has tone that fits but is very half-hearted if you ask me.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is not fun at all. The controls are sluggish, and the terrible character AI movements will result in a lot of unwanted deaths. Frustrating, clipping glitches all throughout the game make it hard to trudge on. This game follows a lot of 2D Sidescrolling Puzzle-Platformer tropes. I liked that you had videos to subsidize and compliment the game but I ended up skipping them because I was more invested in playing than watching which usually I don't skip cutscenes. However here I was already not very into it and felt like I could just watch them after. I figured it would be like pieces of a documentary that are parted out and could be watched all at once later to become a complete set. However when I later went to watch them after playing the game I had no idea what they were talking about since there is no continuity between them. You pretty much have to watch them as you play or play it all then watch it all in the same day to know what is being talked about.\n\nStory\nI did not enjoy this element in the game.  Folk tale or not I walked away knowing jack all about what was happening in the game. The presentation is quite weak. Anytime I was interested I was ripped out to be educated in video format. I'm playing a game for a reason. It  was an interesting idea but for the same reasons above I was not on board with whatever this story is.\n\nGraphics\nThe aesthetic at first was appealing but the more I saw the more I felt like it was just low effort for the sake of resources rather than an intended choice.\n\nThere is something to value in that it is trying teach you stuff in a puzzle platformer but the puzzles aren't as interesting and there is a lot of real boring platforming and running away from stuff. The game wants to give you an adventure, but the poor controls and the stuff mentioned above make this game below average at best.

This one sees you playing two travelling companions: an Alaskan Native  I\u00f1upiat girl separated from her village and a white fox who she stumbles upon. The two become in separable. And they each have unique abilities that are essential to the pair's survival. I'll start off by saying the characters are SOOOOO appealing. A mix of cartoon and slight realism, especially for the animals. There is a fierce polar bear too but he kind of wants to eat the both of you. Yet still totally huggable. (before he mauls your face). Now lets get to the gameplay. They can both jump and climb very well. The controls are very usable on the keyboard. The fox can call spritis to help them in their journey as well as has a little more nimbleness, able to ricochet off of walls to get to higher places. The girl, fluffy parka and all, can attack things with a bola...usually ice chunks essential for the fox to use his trickery. You do become attached to the two rather quick. And the whole thing is authentically narrated by an Alaskan native as well. Like Nihilumbra the narration supports the story and sets up each puzzle screen. These two get out of the frying pan into the fire a lot we'll just say. I will also say that at times this game IS really hard. Not unplayably hard tho. That's kind of good as it gives you MORE than just the story. There are actually tricky puzzles that force you to actually do the moves correctly. Knowing is only HALF the battle after all. It DOES kind of hold your hand a LITTLE too much perhaps but that's also helpful. If you can't get past a screen in a few tries, it illustrates via picture which character should be acting next and where they should be. That is nice for screens that you get stuck on. Myself, if I am stuck, I turn off a game and try the next day. If I'm still stcuk after more tries then I look it up. This kind of short circuits that whole getting stuck thing...and still...even when you are presented with those hints for where you should be...you STILL have to do the moves. And it doesn't tell you exactly all the moves. Just nudges you really hard. So that IS satisfying. And man I'm SO SICK of that polar bear. He's likely to join Limbo's Spider in the animal villain Hall of Fame. And again....THANK you Limbo for bringing this kind of game to the forefront. I expect I shall have many delightful hours crying about my dead Alaskan friend....as I HAVE to play the fox as much as possible, ya know. (and it IS really sad when one of them dies. Because the other character DOES start crying! ;( )\n\nedit: I've made it much further in this game now and realize what people's gripes are about.

Also, playing through this very few bugs were encountered, only one was, and that was not being able to watch the final cutscene in Foxtales (the DLC), which wasn't even in the main game, and we just watched the cutscene on YouTube.\n\nNever Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is a beautiful game, not just in graphics, but in everything about it. The educational value of the game, the co op gameplay, and the resistance to being Westernised were all great reasons this game is amazing!\n\nThe educational aspect of this game is very well done. The more you play, the more videos you unlock. The videos are people speaking about their culture, stories in their culture, and explaining what exactly is going on in the game. This is a perfect way to learn about different cultures, as it gives the marginalised a voice for talking about their experiences, and it gives us context. Never do the videos feel like they are interupting the gameplay, as the videos are often found when you are not doing anything particulary important. Nor are the videos a chore to find, never while playing this did we have to look up a guide for the videos. The videos also were never a chore to watch, but always a pleasure, as it gave a nice little bit of context to what you were doing in game.\n\nThe gameplay itself was amazing, especially playing co op (I have played only up to the fox being introduced singleplayer, the rest I have played co op). The game was made for being co op and works best that way. No single character is used more or less in the game, and each player feels like they have an equal and important role in the game. Despite this being my account, I even played second player myself, because animals are awesome! While my co op buddy played Player One, and at no point was I bothered. I quite enjoyed playing second player, as the fox has so many great roles, such as moving spirits, wall jumping, and [spoiler] flying! [/spoiler] But player one also has so many great roles, such as throwing the bola, pushing things (and paddling in Foxtales, which my co op buddy told me was a lot of fun). Despite the controls being very minimal, the game never felt constricted or empty. \n\nAlthough I, myself, am not a part of any cultural minorites, the game not letting itself be Westernised was a very important thing. The whole game is not in English, instead it is in the langauge of the I\u00f1upiat people, but with English subtitles. I personally don't mind subtitles, and eventually get used to reading them, so this provided no issues for me, but did do a really good job of giving the native people an actual voice instead of giving it an English voiceover. Other ways that the game refused to Westernise was that the entire plot of the game was derived from an actual I\u00f1upiat story, and the story wasn't changed to make it more interesting to a modern audience, because it didn't have to be changed, as it was perfect. As well as the beautiful story and the language, the game also had lovely art cutscenes, as well as the game cutscenes.\n\nOverall, it was a very unique experience to play a game made respectfully and made beautifully such as this one. I loved learning about a culture that I was very unaware of, I loved the co op gameplay, as it made me feel good to share this wonderful game with someone, and I loved the authenticity of the game. Even if I tried I could not find any reason to hate this game, no bugs did we encounter, we did not get stuck too long while playing, and we both had a brilliant time while playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone who has: an open mind to learning about different cultures, a controller, and an IRL friend to play with.", "timestamp_created": 1486268327, "timestamp_updated": 1499363151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568603634834289551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29707049": {"recommendationid": "29707049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040603623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1619327831}, "language": "english", "review": "Never Alone is a single player (and co-op) platformer based around Native Alaskan stories.

I would have preferred it to be the opposite, with a more engaging story and some more twists.\n- Controller bugs. If the controller disconnects (e.g. due to depleted batteries) there is no way to continue. The game suggests to press Space to connect, but that doesn't really resume functionality, with only a couple of the buttons working. I always had to close the game and start it again to resolve these issues.\n- I played singleplayer and it's clear that the partner character is a bit AI-challenged, sometimes managing to get itself killed in situations where a human player would easily survive. I'd assume local co-op is a smoother and more satisfying experience.\n- Some cultural insights are less easy to unlock (I must have missed a few of the owls).

If you are interested in truly playing \"together\" (as we were) ... instead of playing against one another, then you may find this game to be a nice diversion.\n\nMy wife appreciated the fact that the game wasn't overly \"stressful\" or had much in the way of \"destruction\" (i.e., where the means of accomplishing a goal was essentially to hurt, break, or destroy something else).\n\nThe game has some bugs that sometimes resulted in our not being able to unlock every single piece of bonus content (i.e., if we failed a jump at the very end of a chapter, the chapter might advance anyway, without giving us an opportunity to try again).  Also, I found that the Cultural Insights bonus videos would not play on my machine when I launched the game through Steam's \"Big Picture Mode\".  However, if I launched the game outside of Big Picture (i.e., by directly running the Never Alone icon on my desktop) the Cultural Insights would play fine.  So yes, there are some quality issues ... but not too frustrating and not enough to make me not want to keep on going.\n\nI played as fox ... which I enjoyed quite a bit.  The movement and animation, while perhaps \"simple\", was still fun to watch and control.  [spoiler]In the latter part of the game, fox undergoes a transformation ... which I found not as enjoyable to play for me personally ... I just wanted to get back to being fox again. Thankfully, I got to play fox some more afterward: in the Foxtales DLC.[/spoiler]\n\nIf you are looking for a pretty casual little game to play together on your couch with your friend or significant other, then I think you might want to consider this game.

The I\u00f1upiat are an Alaskan Native group of people, and some of the developers of the game involved are actual members of the culture, with stories throughout the generations being passed down.\n\nNuna and Fox, a little girl and an actual fox, are setting out to learn what is behind a blizzard that is destroying her family's village. To play their adventure, you control both of them, or can play co-op with someone else.\n\nIn order to get around, the game is a 2.5D platformer, with some pretty nice graphics for nature and beings you come across. Most parts of the gameplay are nothing that new for platformers, as you switch back and forth between the characters to use a small number of unique abilities - i.e., Fox can wall-run and wall-jump, while Nuna can move objects or throw a bola (a netting of stones), to name a couple.\n\nMost of your time is spent solving little puzzles to move forward. Many are easy, as they just involve having one of the two characters get to a place the other can't, then opening a path. Though there are some more unique challenges here and there to get through, such as non-material platforms that can be moved around with special capabilities. At a few points in time, the game also has some chase scenes which are enjoyable, but later ones in the game get to be a little picky and the flaws of the game's mechanics show up there a lot.\n\nSpeaking of, let's get into the gameplay flaws. While you should be able to complete the game in a few hours and not have that many problems, there are definitely a handful of places in the game where you will suddenly get angry. Certain places in the game require perfect jumping with the winds, for instance. But the game seemed to be inconsistent with the physics. You will clearly see when the wind is blowing in one direction or another, but sometimes the game will still keep the physics of the wind direction even when no wind is moving along the screen. When that happens, it will easily lead to you falling down, sometimes to your death.\n\nThe reliability of moving along the platforms is also finicky at best. Sometimes the character will glitch out and act as if they can't grab the ledge, usually ending with their death again. And even worse, the AI (whichever character you are not controlling at the time) will follow you along on its own, but sometimes move or jump at the wrong time, causing itself to die and making you restart a section.\n\nI definitely got more frustrated as the game went along with the above issues happening more often, especially in slightly more challenging sections. Nevertheless, I was able to push along and still complete the game. Even the most glitchy sections did not hold me back that long.\n\nBut the only reason I did the above was what I mentioned at the beginning - the folklore, culture, and style. I believe that the developers made the game efficient in showcasing that, but by also making it connected as a game. It is not like you are just sitting and watching a documentary. Which is funny, because as you play the game, you unlock \"Insight\" collectibles, which are actually videos of developers, I\u00f1upiat family members, and other people being interviewed about the game and the culture. Some clips and photos also show the areas of Alaska in modern times as well as from mid/late 1900's, it seems.\n\nAnd yet I never felt bored or like I was just sitting through information. In fact, I felt emotionally attached to the story. So, I recommend Never Alone for a more unique style of game wearing the outfit of a traditional platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1484501657, "timestamp_updated": 1484502004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574774205684661865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29252597": {"recommendationid": "29252597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110846072", "num_games_owned": 998, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1484414473}, "language": "english", "review": "My thoughts about this game are very \"colorful\"... \nOn the first hand i really enjoyed it.

Weird letter-boxing on 16:10 screens. Otherwise fantastic little platformer.\n\nIn this game you play two characters, Nuna and her fox. You can swap which one you play (Q) and each has unique abilities. The fox can run up walls, jump higher, control spirits, and is generally more agile. Nuna can throw her Bola to break ice in some spots, activate spirits, and use opposable thumbs to climb rope. The story is well written and the lore is rock solid. Both are in the game at the same time and whichever character you aren't playing as is controlled by artificial intelligence. That term used lightly, of course as countless times the AI has killed itself due to being completely inept at anything. If you play with two people the experience would be better, but I have yet to test that. With that possibly being remedied there is one other looming issue. The controls are garbage. No other way to dance around that truth. Even with a high end keyboard (BlackWidow X Chroma TE) I feel like I am telling a deaf man what buttons to press via postage. Yet somehow the Bola controls are worse. I have to literally slide my mouse along my desk to get it to aim down a little. Also, as a Mac user, my screen is 1440x900 which is a 16:10 aspect ratio.

I love the thought and purpose behind this game - it teaches so much about Inupiat culture (in a very interesting and non-intrusive way, I might add). There's a lot of good wisdom there. The story is interesting, the characters are charming and sweet. I feel like it has just the right amount of player involvement for the length and plot of the story. (i.e., a good balance of emotional investment for like... 4 hours of gameplay).\n\nI really recommend watching the videos that give more information about the Inupiat people; they're all really short and made the game a lot more interesting. You can tell the developers really put their hearts into the purpose of this project.\n\nThis game is sometimes a little exciting, but overall it's not a heart-pounding ride. If you need extremely action-filled games to fill your adrenaline addiction, this probably isn't for you - it's basically a long, pretty sidescroller maze where you have to time your jumps and movements just right to avoid death.\n\nAnd that's my only complaint about this game: There were some places where I died repeatedly just because I couldn't switch deftly enough, or move quickly enough, or make the jump or whatever. And there's no health bar. You die instantly! So I'd have to do them over and over again. That happened in a few different places, to the point where it was laughable... but I managed to get through.\n\nLike everyone else says, play with a controller on co-op if possible.

As you play, you will unlock 'insights', which are only a few minutes long, but give you a fasinating look at the I\u00f1upiat people, both with their folklore, culture and way of life. Every new insight I collected was a journey of discovery, and when I realised I had missed a couple during my playthough, I had to go back to collect them. I would reccommend watching as you play, as each part links into what you are doing in game.\n\nThe controls are very simple and new mechanics are added as you go through the levels. You control two characters, the little girl Nuna and her friend Fox, but you only need to control one character at a time, while the other will follow behind you, which is a nice touch.

It doesn't reach the heights of LIMBO due to the controls but isn't too bad. Buy on sale.\n\nLong version:\n\nAt its core the game is a platformer with a lovely graphical design, an interesting premise and slightly mushy controls. \n\nThe game is a joy to behold and that's the #1 thing it has going for it. The art style is beautiful and that carries over to the environments, characters and so forth. The premise - using native folklore - to traverse this beautiful world is also endearing. If you want there are a number of movies in the game that help you better learn the way of life and the lore behind this story. Frankly, I skipped those parts because I was not all that interested. I may very well go back and watch those videos later but I felt they interruped the core gameplay too much.\n\nSo...beautiful game, interesting premise, a chance to learn about another culture...is there a downside? \n\nIt's the gameplay that's a little bit of a downer. The controls - even on a 360 controller - aren't tight as they are in LIMBO. If I died in LIMBO it was always due to my own fault. Here, I died quite a few times due to the controls being mushy. You control two characters for most of the story and one is often dependent upon the other. Yet this other will sometimes drift away and thus you die due to no fault of your own. The bola controls are truly hideous. \n\nThe other downside of the game is that it's quite short. I finished the game in 2.6 hours and I'm not particularly good at these kinds of games. Because Never Alone doesn't have the same kind of emotional impact as something like LIMBO, I don't see any replayability in this title either so those 2.6 hours - unless I go back and watch the videos - are all that's going to be there. That's not very good for a game that sells for $15.\n\nHowever, I bought it on sale at 80% off and at $2.99 it was worth the money. At full price I would be ticked off because there's not enough value here. On a sale that's above 50% off, it's worth your time.\n\nEdit - Went back and watched a couple of the videos.

In the first hour the journey begins with a little girl being chased by a polar bear while an arctic fox saves her life. They soon become friends and the side villain is introduced after a tragic event occurs. Story is simple, but effective. The native speaker really helps you to immerse yourself in the beautiful Alaskan setting.\n\nThe controls eventually become second nature and work quite well. I played single-player but the constant switching between the two characters proved to just work. Never Alone features good heart-warming (and breaking) cinematics and the level designs are fantastic. It has many moments and locations I just had to pause and screenshot, as well as some tricky platforming sections. Puzzles are mainly simple and focus is on the platforming.\n\nThe final level was probbaly the most dynamic boss level I have ever played in a platformer requiring quick thinking and precision. The Foxtail DLC is a great story and platforming puzzler of its own and lasts around an hour long, while main game is unfortunatly pretty short with only 3-3 1/2hrs of gameplay however it's tottally worth it at the sale price. The extra unlockable mini-documentaries are a neat addition that let you understand the culture Never Alone payes homage to.\n\n9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1482708176, "timestamp_updated": 1482708176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28648751": {"recommendationid": "28648751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072659138", "num_games_owned": 1679, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1480964507}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game, I came to a conclusion that \"artistic experiences\" are not for me.

Perfectly doable solo, however.

Not for the bragging rights though. While many people criticize this game for clumsy and irritating controls (and not without a reason I must admit) I have seen the early platforming games with barely minimal physics and collision model inferior to what can be created in 20 minutes with the help of contemporary tools like GameMaker or Clickteam fusion. Truth be told, while I've seen much worse, Never Alone controls rather slow and switching between the game's two protagonists can be frustrating - especially in the final chapters of the game where the time limits are introduced. Consequently, if you are looking for a platform game with tight and responsive controls there are plenty better titles out there on Steam - the new Rayman games, Hell Yeah, Knytt Underground, the Shantae series or Odallus just to name the first few that come to mind. \n\nWith that out of our way, how about some reasons to actually give Never Alone a try? First of all, while technologically rather simple, the graphics - aesthetically - are pretty charming. That is if you like glaciers and various shades of blue, and even then Ori and his Blind Forest beat Never Alone effortlessly. Music on the other hand is enjoyable and perfectly fits the game's mood and tone.  \n\nHaving mentioned that, the game is saturated to the brim with the folklore. The characters' designs , cutscenes resembling animated paintings, unlockable insights into the native Alaskan culture and beliefs or the storyteller narrating the entire adventure in the I\u00f1upiaq language (accompanied by the subtitles of your choosing) - they make the entire game feel more like an interactive folk tale or fable. \n\nThe gameplay and challenges are surprisingly varied and ( while only about three hours long) the game stays fresh and entertaining for the entire time. The special mention goes to the final two boss battles - or, boss puzzles, to be more precise. Shame the entire experience is hampered by the, above mentioned, controls. \n\nLong story short, I believe Never Alone deserves a chance, but definitely not at the original pricetag. It feels too short and clumsy for that. On the final note : if you enjoy the folklore games, may I suggest getting familiar with the Year Walk - also a folk - inspired game available here on Steam. Only much, much darker and more evil. Also, cheaper. \n\nPolska recenzja: \n\nOgl\u0105daj\u0105c zako\u0144czenie Never Alone zda\u0142em sobie spraw\u0119 jak bardzo si\u0119 ciesz\u0119 z faktu \u017ce dorasta\u0142em w latach 90tych.

Je\u017celi wi\u0119c do czerpania rado\u015bci z gry potrzebujesz szybkiej i precyzyjnej mechaniki, jest pe\u0142no lepszych gier na Steamie \u2013 wszystkie Raymany, Hell Yeah, Knytt Underground, seria Shantae czy Odallus \u2013 to tylko kilka kt\u00f3re przychodz\u0105 na my\u015bl. \n\nNajgorsze z g\u0142owy. To mo\u017ce jednak warto da\u0107 Never Alone szans\u0119? Pierwszym argumentem za jest grafika \u2013 z estetycznego punktu widzenia potrafi by\u0107 naprawd\u0119 czaruj\u0105ca. To znaczy je\u017celi lubisz lodowce i szerok\u0105 gam\u0119 odcieni b\u0142\u0119kitu, ale nawet wtedy Ori'emu z jego \u015blepym lasem mo\u017ce skoczy\u0107. Muzyka za to \u015bwietnie wpasowuje si\u0119 w kolejne rozdzia\u0142y gry i pomaga budowa\u0107 nastr\u00f3j.\n\nSkoro ju\u017c o tym mowa: tw\u00f3rcy stawiaj\u0105 na klimat. Never Alone jest wype\u0142nione po brzegi i dok\u0142adnie nas\u0105czone g\u0119stym folklorem natywnych lud\u00f3w Alaski. Wida\u0107 to w projektach postaci, po przerywnikach filmowych stylizowanych na animowane malowid\u0142a skalne, nawet narracja prowadzona jest w j\u0119zyku I\u00f1upiaq(od pocz\u0105tku do ko\u0144ca, z napisami w jednym z 16 j\u0119zyk\u00f3w \u2013 w tym polskim). Wszystko to sprawia wra\u017cenie uczestniczenia w interaktywnej opowie\u015bci, czy mo\u017ce ba\u015bni \u2013 je\u017celi lubicie takie klimaty, b\u0119dzie to spory plus. \n\nSama rozgrywka jest ciekawa a stawiane przed graczem wyzwania zr\u00f3\u017cnicowane (cho\u0107 gra ko\u0144czy si\u0119 w mniej wi\u0119cej trzy godziny, wi\u0119c gdyby w tak kr\u00f3tkim czasie nudzi\u0142a nie by\u0142o by chyba wi\u0119kszego sensu w og\u00f3le zawraca\u0107 sobie ni\u0105 g\u0142owy. Z drugiej strony je\u017celi grali\u015bcie w Tulp\u0119...). Szczeg\u00f3lnie \u015bwietne s\u0105 dwa ostatnie pojedynki (czy raczej \u0142amig\u0142\u00f3wki umo\u017cliwiaj\u0105ce pokonanie...) z bossami. Szkoda jedynie \u017ce wspomniane wcze\u015bniej sterowanie znacz\u0105co je utrudnia. \n\nPodsumowuj\u0105c; Never Alone zas\u0142uguje \u017ceby da\u0107 jej szans\u0119, cho\u0107 zdecydowanie nie za cen\u0119 15 euro. Jest na to zdecydowanie za kr\u00f3tka i momentami irytuj\u0105ca. Jeszcze jedno: Je\u017celi lubicie gry eksploruj\u0105ce obyczaje i tradycje zerknijcie na Year Walk, dost\u0119pn\u0105 na Steamie, podobnie \u015bnie\u017cn\u0105, podobnie folkow\u0105, podobnie kr\u00f3tk\u0105 ale du\u017co, du\u017co mroczniejsz\u0105 i bardziej krwaw\u0105 gr\u0119.

You can tell that this game was made to be as true to the culture it was portraying as possible.\n\nI played this game as a local co-op and honestly can\u2019t really imagine trying to play this on my own. Given this games theme of community, companionship and togetherness, I don\u2019t think it would have been as fun to me playing on my own. \n\nThe music and narrative is great and the graphics are beautiful. I especially like that the narrative was in the native tongue and translated with subtitles, as to give it a more genuine feeling. The general glow and contrast is really nice and with all these things together it gave off a nice atmosphere.\n\nThere are puzzle elements to this game and it\u2019s at these parts especially that I can\u2019t imagine playing on my own. Me and my boyfriend had to co-ordinate and get certain timings right to be successful in some of the puzzles. Although they weren\u2019t all that difficult, they still take some planning and quick execution.\n\nAs an overall, the game itself I can\u2019t say was one of my favourites or particularly powerful to me, but I love everything that was put into this game and having those insights definitely redeemed it for me.\n\nLast of all, achievements. Unfortunately this is a game that you actually need the DLC to be able to 100%. Apart from that, it\u2019s an easy one to complete. It took us around 4 hours to get through and is a fairly enjoyable game.\n\nAll in all, this is a beautifully charming game and if you enjoy \u201cfor the experience\u201d kind of games I think this is definitely worth trying. If you want something with a deep, plot twisting, life changing story, or something with crazy mechanics or puzzles, than you are better off elsewhere.\n\n\nTL;DR : Based on a beautiful and interesting culture, a (best in) local co-op game with beautiful graphics and a short unlockable documentary on the people it\u2019s based around.

It's a decent 3 hour plus game. It passses but it is not an AAA game. It is basically a co-op/single player platformer where you try to solve various jumping puzzles in pairs. You will use a little girl and her snow fox companion. You will find that it is reminescent of games like Brothers : The Tale of Two Sons, Wolfe, The Cave and Max : The Tale of Brotherhood. Unity 3D is a common tool for games like this, there is a common style.\n\nThe main gist of Never Alone is the tale of a young Inuit girl and her snow fox trying to figure out why their village was burned down. In their quest for answers, you will meet an Owl Man who has lost his drum to little people, get lost in the stomach of a whale, run away from hungry polar bears all while avoiding ice floes and strong blizzard winds. Your Snow Fox is in tune with nature and will guide friendly Spirits to aid you in your journey. However, not every Spirit is kind and you will face Spirit People that grip you and send you to your doom. \n\nDuring your journey, you will discover that the perpetrator who burned your village is a horrible man who is able to toss fire and he burned your village down whilst searching for something. That something is oddly your magic bola which fires an infinite number of shiny blue bolas. Watch him snap the neck of your snow fox and keep on watching to see what happens after that. I'll not spoil this part for you.\n\nThe ice giant and his adze story is very interesting to playthrough and for those of you who prefer a more difficult game, Foxtales gives you the much needed challenge.\n\nConclusion? This is a must try. Remember to watch the cultural insights with interviews with actual Inuit people.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n1. Wondrous Imagination\nI love reading the different races in the game, they are so imaginative. E.g. Owl Face Man\n\n2. Simple to Pick UP\nWASD keys, L-CTRL, Q and Spacebar. I play this game with 1 hand. The only time you need to use your other hand is to aim the bola with your mouse.\n\n3. Owl Videos/Cultural Insights\nYou get to view videos of another culture that is rarely talked about. This is very interesting. THe videos about the Inuit are very high quality and are worth watching.\n\n4. Interesting Stories\nBeautiful to read about. E.g. The Owl Man, The Ice Giant and his Adze\n\n5. Wind Jumping\nI like the part where you have to jump with the wind. It's so much cooler.\n\n6. Foxtales\nLovely higher difficulty levels. The story of the Giant Rat was beautiful.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n1. Repetitive Platforms\nSome parts of the game are repeated, like a cut and paste. You jump on a ledge, move and jump on a ledge. This same sequence is repeated later in the game except with a different skin.\n\n2. Short Playtime\nFinished it in 3 hours.\n\n3.

To me, it looked so sweet and particularly interesting because I have a very big soft spot for animals. While the game does live up to these two things, being sweet and a treat for anyone who appreciates animals, Never Alone is also something much more than that.\n\nThis game is a simple 2-D platformer with a storyline that was based on very old folklore. The developers of this game really took the time to immerse themselves into the words of the people who made this folklore and created something brilliant with it. Throughout the game you are given snippets of videos showing them interviewing people about their folklore and what exactly it all means. In the end you discover that the central idea of these stories was to unite people in the belief that you must respect all forms of life no matter how big or small.\n\nThere are a few really nice challenging parts of this game that I think also make the game very worthwhile. The plotline takes and unexpected shift and gives you a whole new sense of gameplay. If you buy the DLC, you will find that it is also a great addition to the game.\n\nOverall, I think that this game is a lovely pick for anyone who is looking for something that isn't too challenging but has an interesting and thought-provoking ending. I recommend watching all of the videos as well because they help you to understand the developer's visions through the eyes of the people who inspired them.

Her friend, a happy companion fox, also cannot swim until it's convenient for the game to do so, and then is a slippery ice weasel.\nThe game will not progress until you do things the right way, specifically, the way the game's makers played it, presumably this being a game which had no QA testing, because in it's functional capacity as a platformer it is pretty darn broken. If, for example, you jump at the wrong time and land on a platform the game will not allow you to land on that platform because you jumped at the wrong time according to Game.\nIf you placed one of your characters too far away from the other, then the game won't allow your other character to complete certain jumping tasks, despite there being no obvious reason why this should be.\n\nAs a lesson in Inupiat culture, art, madness and wisdom, it's pretty darn solid. In fact, it's beautiful graphics are one of the better examples of matching mood to content that I've seen, and are culturally-appropriate. As a platformer however it's fairly simplistic, clumsy, and it did not surprise me that it was made in Unity - that being the Great Maw from whence all unpolished content which looks good ensues.\nOther beefs: There's no option to change controls, meaning the game is barely playable for left-handers. There's no real 'flow' of direction to the game, and finding out what you're meant to do is more-or-less trial-and-error most of the time. And occasionally Fox will just wander off in the opposite direction to yours, for no apparent reason. In certain areas, if you are controlling the fox instead of Nuna, you'll insta-fail. The game uses 100% of all cores on your CPU at all times.\nWhat's astonishing is that this game has been out several years - would be relatively easy to fix - but hasn't been. The new steam review system would make sure that it got the attention it deserves, if the issues were resolved.\n\nSo if you don't care about 'game', play this game - it's a good learning experience. \nIf however you're the type that gets pissed off with clumsy controls and simplistic puzzles, give this one a miss.", "timestamp_created": 1479333358, "timestamp_updated": 1479333358, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546728610992431641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26623800": {"recommendationid": "26623800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126712246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1479259939}, "language": "english", "review": "Snowy LIMBO\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1479260007, "timestamp_updated": 1689043936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26618462": {"recommendationid": "26618462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108504825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 422, "last_played": 1479244148}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a little big gem.

Surgidos de la necesidad del hombre de conocer, y darse a conocer a s\u00ed mismo, se han contado miles y miles de cuentos desde los inicios de la humanidad. Con la misi\u00f3n de transmitir valores y conocimientos, cada comunidad cre\u00f3 los suyos en base a su mitolog\u00eda o folclore. No era raro encontrar, en cada una de estas comunidades, a un sabio que se encargase de contar dichos cuentos y asegurar su supervivencia a lo largo de cientos \u2014 o incluso miles, como en este caso \u2014 de a\u00f1os.\n\nRozando este concepto se encuentra Never Alone, un trabajo que lleg\u00f3 a manos conjuntas de Upper One Games y E-Line Media durante el primer cuarto del pasado a\u00f1o, y que resulta en una suerte de cuento \u00e1rtico nacido de Kunuuksaayuka, una historia tradicional de los I\u00f1upiaq.  Explorando con acierto el folklore de estos nativos de la g\u00e9lida regi\u00f3n de Alaska, Never Alone nos lleva a vivir una aventura m\u00e1gica donde el invierno solo se ve superado por la amistad de una joven y un peque\u00f1o zorro \u00e1rtico.\n\nDe esta forma el juego nos pone en la piel de Nuna, una joven I\u00f1upiaq que ya desde joven destaca en los campos de la supervivencia y la caza. Preocupada por las incesantes ventiscas que azotan su aldea y privan de alimentos a sus habitantes, la chica decide partir en busca del origen del desastre, sola y sin m\u00e1s ayuda que sus propias manos. La joven no tarda en encontrarse en problemas, pero cuando se encuentra a escasos minutos de acabar bajo las garras de un oso polar, un peque\u00f1o zorro \u00e1rtico \u2014al que me referir\u00e9 cari\u00f1osamente como Fox\u2014 consigue distraer al oso para que la chica pueda escapar, forjando la base del t\u00edtulo: la cooperaci\u00f3n.\n\nUna vez tomemos el mando despu\u00e9s de encontrarnos con Fox el juego nos permite intercambiar el control entre \u00e9l y Nuna para cumplir un desaf\u00edo tras otro, que suelen representarse en forma de plataformas, puzzles y una original e interesante mezcla de ambos elementos. Encontramos tambi\u00e9n la opci\u00f3n de jugar de forma cooperativa, optando cada jugador por uno de los dos roles que nos ofrece el juego. Debo decir que la necesidad de cambiar de personaje de forma constante para resolver las dificultades que surgen durante el camino se traduce en un incentivo para completar el juego en su modo individual. Y, aunque un servidor no tuvo la oportunidad de probar el modo cooperativo,  si sois un poco m\u00e1s sociales que yo o, simplemente dispon\u00e9is de un segundo mando, no dud\u00e9is en probar con una partida colaborativa, aunque eso suponga no poder culpar a la CPU de las derrotas que sufr\u00e1is durante el juego.\n\nVolvamos al eje central de la jugabilidad. Como representaci\u00f3n del viaje que realizan Nuna y Fox  deberemos avanzar de forma lineal por una multitud de paisajes con el color blanco siempre como protagonista. No faltan los enormes desiertos de hielo, las cavernas rocosas o las antiguas aldeas, cuyos restos descansan bajo las incesantes nevadas. Nuestro objetivo ser\u00e1 superar los obst\u00e1culos que estos representan, resolviendo los diferentes problemas que surgen en ello y que nos obligan a parar y pensar una manera eficiente de resolverlos. Y esta resulta siempre en la colaboraci\u00f3n entre los protagonistas de la historia. Mientras que Fox es m\u00e1s \u00e1gil y puede escalar paredes o caminar por las fr\u00e1giles placas de hielo, Nuna puede agarrar objetos y utilizar su bolera para destruir obst\u00e1culos que nos impidan el paso. Otro elemento importante del juego son las constantes ventiscas \u2014 logradas con mucho acierto y con una incre\u00edble sensaci\u00f3n de realidad \u2014  que nos har\u00e1n trastabillar, e incluso caer, si no nos protegemos de ellas.\n\nPoco tardaremos en descubrir que Fox tiene una conexi\u00f3n especial con la naturaleza que le permite ver a los esp\u00edritus que la pueblan y aprovecharnos de su amabilidad (punto para \u00e9l), para con el zorro, para avanzar por los diferentes escenarios. El problema aqu\u00ed surge cuando Fox se aleja de ellos, pues estos desaparecen si no esta cerca y Nuna caer\u00e1 si se encuentra subida en las plataformas en las que se convierten estas criaturas. Es una mec\u00e1nica que me lleva a pensar, de forma inmediata, en la relaci\u00f3n entre ICO y Yorda, del cl\u00e1sico de PS2, ICO, Pues, pese a que ninguna de estas parejas pueden si quiera comunicarse verbalmente entre ellos ni tienen una sola l\u00ednea de texto en toda la aventura consiguen crear una aut\u00e9ntica sensaci\u00f3n de empat\u00eda auto impuesta por las mec\u00e1nicas del juego pero que consigue sentirse natural y cercana.\n\nLa, antes mencionada, figura del sabio o cuentacuentos aparece aqu\u00ed para ocupar ese espacio narrativo que omiten los personajes. Remarcando la sensaci\u00f3n de estar viviendo la historia de un cuento, el narrador entona dicha historia siempre con una solemne voz que nos har\u00e1 sentirnos arropados a la luz de una hoguera en medio de la tundra \u00e1rtica mientras le escuchamos hablar, absortos. Importantes, y altamente disfrutables, son los momentos en que los espacios narrativos se unen a la jugabilidad y dejas de jugar lo que est\u00e1s leyendo para vivirlo. Cabe destacar que, aunque la trama sea simple y narrada en una lejana tercera persona, contiene alg\u00fan que otro giro de gui\u00f3n, que influye sobremanera en su forma de jugar y que ponen las bases a un magn\u00edfico final que exige al jugador hacer uso de todo lo aprendido hasta el momento.\n\nEn contra de todo lo mencionado hasta ahora, y con cierto odio al redactor por tener que destacar alg\u00fan aspecto negativo de Never Alone, es que el juego tiene una duraci\u00f3n cort\u00edsima, que adem\u00e1s choca mucho con su precio. Unas tres o cuatro horas (a un precio de 15\u20ac), que pese a ser relativas a la habilidad del jugador, dif\u00edcilmente se ver\u00e1n aumentadas a causa de su escasa dificultad. Podremos alargarlas un poco m\u00e1s, eso s\u00ed, si nos centramos en buscar todos los coleccionables del juego, que encontraremos en forma de b\u00fahos. Y es algo que recomiendo encarecidamente (y os lo dice el principal detractor de los coleccionables), pues cada uno de estos b\u00fahos desbloquear\u00e1n un fragmento de v\u00eddeo, en formato documental, donde nativos  I\u00f1upiaq nos hablar\u00e1n sobre su cultura y su folclore. Algo que resulta completamente original y que sirve como un fant\u00e1stico complemento al juego y a su trama. Por otro lado tambi\u00e9n podemos alargar ese tiempo con su DLC, Foxtales, que abandona los paisajes helados para mostrarnos escenarios mas coloridos y vivos. Sin apartarse del folclore del que hace uso su versi\u00f3n original, Foxtales nos contar\u00e1 otra historia cl\u00e1sica protagonizada por Nuna y Fox, durante la que encontraremos un gran n\u00famero de puzzles, esta vez m\u00e1s elaborados y dif\u00edciles.\n\nNever Alone es el resultado de la uni\u00f3n de los videojuegos y los cuentos. Una uni\u00f3n de elementos narrativos e interactivos que te permite, no solo sentir su historia, si no vivirla de primera mano. Un precioso viaje plagado de determinaci\u00f3n, amistad y valor que, adem\u00e1s, consigue introducirnos en el folclore i\u00f1upiaq y sirve como difusi\u00f3n del mismo. Algo que sin duda es un magnifico gesto hacia \u2014  y desde \u2014  sus habitantes. La traves\u00eda de Nuna y Fox enamorar\u00e1 a cualquier jugador que se introduzca en ella y, aunque pueda pecar de ser algo breve, asegura una perfecta tarde libre de invierno, sobretodo si lo acompa\u00f1\u00e1is con una buena bebida caliente.", "timestamp_created": 1478739944, "timestamp_updated": 1478971816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26494873": {"recommendationid": "26494873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335673669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1495007602}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Very Very Pretty game good storyline (not finished yet) But the old man talking in the backround Best voice ever 8/10 \nwould defently buy only problem i had was when i tried to open it it didnt open a simple way to fix that is update ur dravers/graphics card", "timestamp_created": 1478638685, "timestamp_updated": 1478638685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457746505737304688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26494200": {"recommendationid": "26494200", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965904032", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1478639075}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game about Alaska tribes and their culture", "timestamp_created": 1478635627, "timestamp_updated": 1478635627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26465256": {"recommendationid": "26465256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054520960", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1478469417}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego que tiene una historia que contar y que est\u00e1 ligado profundamente a la cultura de los nativos de Alaska.

The problem is that the AI controlling the other player is bad. The AI will follow you wenn you need it to stay where you left it, and will stay put whey you need it to follow you. Having plattforms fade in/out depending on your AI partner being in the right spot also caused me some deaths.\nThere is also the problem that the escape sequences often require you to quickly move plattforms and jumping over them, resulting in frequent character switches and more \"Actions per Minute\" than healthy for this genre.\n\n[b]Gameplay issues[/b]\nThe game feels a lot like LIMBO, it is a very simple plattformer that mostly focuses on atmosphere. The gameplay seems to have been secondary. I sometimes teleported to edges, sometimes made Jumps I shoudn't have (felt like glitches but I couldn't reproduce them). Navigating plattforms that are moving (which happens a lot) is even less responsive. It just didn't feel very good. The fact that the wind changes constantly doesn't help to make this platformer feel more solid. The schooting mechanic input doesn't work great and shooting with a great angle can be difficult. The projectile has ballistics and is therefore very inacurate, it is often just trial and error.\n\nI hated every scriped sequence that'll eventually kill you on a timer because it is never apparent if you have to wait on the sinking ice floe and a path to safety will appear just in time, or if you should have jumped on a branch 5 seconds ago. (Playing singleplayer, e.g. having to sometimes move these plattforms to you, doesn't help here).\nI also got softlocked once in my playthrough  after a cutscene, but that is just a minor issue, but I felt like mentioning it.\n\nAgain, there is just too much wrong and the experience is all in all not good enough to reccommend this.\n\n[spoiler]Also: Every character in this game died of hypothermia.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1478414264, "timestamp_updated": 1478414264, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49751242995262146", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26448861": {"recommendationid": "26448861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079666321", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1482529920}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved this game. Granted, it's not very long, but it's fun! I love the story, and the ability to unlock videos so you can learn more about the I\u00f1upiat culture (and these videos relate to what's happening in-game). It's great being able to play through a traditional story and experience it for yourself. The characters are great too, and while there isn't any dialogue besides the narrator, you can get quite attached to Nuna and Fox.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the art-style in-game, as well as the more traditional story-teller drawings in the cutscenes. The portrayal of the spirits was beautiful, and so was the scenery. The music was also well done and fitting for each area.\n\nThe weapon in the game can be a bit tricky to aim at times, but once you realize that her free hand will point to where she's aiming, it gets much easier. It's also very interesting to use it and see the video explaining how it was traditionally used.\n\nArguably, the puzzles weren't always that hard, but for this game I didn't find that to be a mark against it. I've played puzzle gams like Ori and the Blind Forest where, though I loved it, I was sometimes pushed to wanting to throw my controller during some rushed events or puzzles. I liked being able to approach this game with a little less frustration and a bit more consistent enjoyment. The puzzles are enjoyable, and while they can sometimes be a bit of a challenge they won't cause a rage that would cut into the enjoyment of the story being told (or cause such a long stall in gameplay that the flow of the story is lost).\n\nTL;DR: Overall I would give this game a 10/10 - I really enjoyed it! I enjoyed the format that this story was told and being able to be a part of it, and I enjoyed learning about the I\u00f1upiat people. I hope more games like this get made, because this form of combining fun game play with teaching people about a culture's traditions and stories is brilliant!\n\nSide Note: The Foxtales DLC is also fun to play. Really not long at all (much shorter than the main game), but an enjoyable \"Epilogue\" type story nonetheless. You also get 5 more \"Insight\" videos looking into the I\u00f1upiat culture and the further underscoring of the theme of \"respect for all things\"", "timestamp_created": 1478403588, "timestamp_updated": 1478403932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26447053": {"recommendationid": "26447053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081780645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1478393985}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun to play, but only in Co-Op. 3 hour main story, 1 hour DLC.
