Your workers need to build homes and other necessities, plow the field, catch some fish and exploit the natural ressources that are required to make their lives more livable and safer. \n\nAfter a certain amount of failed attempts, you surely will get the hang of it and seeing your small peasant village turn into an educated bigger city full of schools, hospitals and markets will give you a satisfying feeling. Building a civilization surely ain't an easy thing! The visuals are quite charming and i liked the smaller details here and there while the soundtrack in the background is calming your senses. Available mods can add more depth to the title and also a bigger variety in buldings, which is nice for replayability.\n\nDue to the rather low price, you can basically do nothing wrong when you decide to get it.

In that sense, it will give you enough to do for 4-6-10 hours, if you're OCD about struggling to balance the resources of a colony destined to die anyway.\n\nAfter 13 hours of playing, I somehow managed to grow my town to a population of 1,634 people { 1,404 adults, 116 students and 114 children }. Only 47% of them are educated, which might explain why I've cluttered  several cemeteries with dumb stonecutters crushed by rocks...\n\nI feel like everything I like about the game eventually I end up hating:\n- I like the simplicity of it, but then I wish there were more buildings/occupations for my villagers to work in. At the moment I have about 100 laborers who just carry stuff and clean up areas where I am trying to expand. \n\n- I like the fact that there's a bunch of fruits and veggies that my farmers can cultivate, yet aside from the fruits and wheat used on alcohol, I have no idea how the rest of them influence my colony. I wish we had an indicator for how much each type of produce influences the quality of my villagers' lives.\n\n- I like the fact that I can play forever (I am currently on year 88), but I feel like it's a drag to get to the 100 and 200 years milestones necessary for two of the achievements. This is a horrible way to pad the gameplay time in order to keep people playing if they're achievements completionists.\n\n- I like the fact that I can herd sheep, cows and chickens, but this is a medieval colony management game... where's the pigs?! Give us horses and carts so that people can travel faster and carry more goods.\n\n- I like the overall look and atmosphere of the medieval village, but I wish we had more than just churches and taverns to entertain the community. I am aware that you can mod the game, but I won't bother with it since there's no long-term goal of the game.\n\n- I like the fact that the seasons change and that impacts food production, but if you have a few hundred people, you will burn through your veggies and meats super fast. I wish we had bears and boars and other wildlife to give more meat than deer do.\n\nWhat I clearly don't like:\n- Having no clear indicators of how much food each farm/orchard/fishing dock/hunter/pasture gives, I feel like stocking on food is a guessing game. \n\n- After the 50 years mark, I feel like my population gets hit by calamities too often. \n\n- Stonecutters and miners die way too often in work-related accidents. I'm surprised hunters don't die in accidents or fishermen don't drown.\n\n- We have corn and wheat, but no mills and bakeries to produce bread or cornbread.\n\n- No vineyards. Also, no difference in what you use to make alcohol (you have stuff like what, berries, cherries, plums, peaches, etc, but what's really the point?). I wish we had wine, not just ales.\n\n- Traders still bring seeds to sell, even after you've unlocked all types available in game. Sometimes this is super annoying, as you will rely on trade to balance your resources intake/outtake.\n\n - Quarries are horrible. Once you've depleted the stone in them, you're left with giant craters that render the land plot useless. I have 8 of those and they look depressing. My village is beginning to look like a Moon colony with all the craters.\nSame issue with mines.\n\n- Since we have mines, I wish we could extract gold or silver and mint coins. Makes more sense in trading than being at the mercy of however much of a specific resource each random traders wants in exchange for their goods.\n\n- My idiot villagers pop out children like crazy. It's cool that they'll replace everyone who will die of old age, but I feel like I'm a race to build more housing than anything else. Then build farms to feed them, then hope nothing wrong happens with the crops or farmers, so that I can actually collect the food they so rapidly deplete.\n\n\nSo yeah, fun game if you like to torture yourself.

The early game is where all the challenges lie. Building and sustaining your first community feels monumental as you juggle limited resources and a growing population.\n\nIt's a game that requires careful planning, balancing resources, and managing your ever-expanding village. One misstep can lead to a domino effect of \"death crosses,\" suddenly, your thriving community is on the brink of extinction.\n\nThe beauty of Banished is that it has stood the test of time, maintaining its charm and relevance even a decade later. With the addition of mods, the game's potential soars to new heights. Want a high-maintenance aquarium? There's a mod for that!\n\nWhile some may find Banished to have a steep learning curve, the satisfaction of mastering its intricacies makes it worth every moment.

After that, the gatherers/hunters realized that the new northern town barn is closer. They stopped putting food in central barn, and go to northern barn. Northern barn is at 100% capacity, they just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 throw away food like garbage in the street while famine hits the larger central town and citizens are dying like flies and have me scrambling to fix this mess.", "timestamp_created": 1698128611, "timestamp_updated": 1699611007, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148765180": {"recommendationid": "148765180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057311020", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2102, "last_played": 1698320589}, "language": "english", "review": "Holds up rather well 10 years later.", "timestamp_created": 1698114158, "timestamp_updated": 1698114158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634753704071044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148757203": {"recommendationid": "148757203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089612225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 166, "playtime_at_review": 1349, "last_played": 1700287799}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un gran city builder, puede que parezca simple pero tiene su dificultad y es mas que nada un survival.\nTienes que lograr hacer que tu colonia prospere y crezca.", "timestamp_created": 1698099104, "timestamp_updated": 1698099104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148753328": {"recommendationid": "148753328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050165402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6571, "last_played": 1698092609}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Exellent", "timestamp_created": 1698093141, "timestamp_updated": 1698093141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148752818": {"recommendationid": "148752818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030360878", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1698160769}, "language": "english", "review": "fun until half of your village dies because i forgor \ud83d\udc80", "timestamp_created": 1698092418, "timestamp_updated": 1698092418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148752256": {"recommendationid": "148752256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006698808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 17578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17578, "last_played": 1697640181}, "language": "english", "review": "A somewhat simple game that has a lot of replay value and a large modding community that adds where the game is weak.

Developed by a single indie developer, Luke Hodorowicz, it's a testament to the fact that great things can come from small studios. Let's delve into what makes \"Banished\" a compelling experience.\nPros:\n\nChallenging Gameplay: \"Banished\" presents a considerable challenge in terms of resource management and survival. The game doesn't hold your hand, making it deeply satisfying when your town flourishes.\n\nSimplicity and Depth: Despite its simplicity in design, \"Banished\" offers deep gameplay mechanics. It's easy to grasp the basics, but mastering them is a rewarding journey.\n\nBeautiful Aesthetic: The game's visuals are striking, with a rustic, medieval charm that immerses you in the world. The changing seasons and attention to detail add to the visual appeal.\n\nSocietal Dynamics: The game explores societal dynamics as your population grows and ages. Managing citizens' needs and desires adds depth to the gameplay.\n\nModding Community: \"Banished\" boasts a dedicated modding community, offering an extensive library of mods that enhance gameplay, graphics, and overall content.\n\nCons:\n\nSteep Learning Curve: The game's learning curve can be quite steep, and newcomers might find themselves struggling initially. However, this can also be seen as a pro for players who enjoy a challenge.\n\nLack of Story or Campaign: \"Banished\" is more of a sandbox experience. It lacks a structured story or campaign mode, which may disappoint players looking for a more guided experience.\n\nRepetitive Late Game: In the late game, gameplay can become somewhat repetitive as you've already established a well-functioning town. It could benefit from more late-game content or objectives.\n\nIn summary, \"Banished\" is a hidden gem in the city-building genre. Its blend of simplicity, depth, and challenge, coupled with its gorgeous aesthetics, make it an excellent choice for players who enjoy strategy and management games. While it has a steep learning curve and lacks a structured narrative, the satisfaction of watching your town thrive is well worth the investment. The vibrant modding community ensures that the game's replayability remains high.\n\n\"Banished\" es un juego de simulaci\u00f3n de construcci\u00f3n de ciudades excepcional que ofrece un enfoque refrescante en el g\u00e9nero. Desarrollado por un \u00fanico creador independiente, Luke Hodorowicz, es un testimonio de que las grandes creaciones pueden provenir de peque\u00f1os estudios. Vamos a analizar qu\u00e9 hace que \"Banished\" sea una experiencia atractiva.\n\nPros:\n\nJugabilidad Desafiante: \"Banished\" presenta un gran desaf\u00edo en t\u00e9rminos de gesti\u00f3n de recursos y supervivencia. El juego no te lleva de la mano, lo que lo hace profundamente satisfactorio cuando tu ciudad prospera.\n\nSimplicidad y Profundidad: A pesar de su dise\u00f1o simple, \"Banished\" ofrece mec\u00e1nicas de juego profundas. Es f\u00e1cil comprender los conceptos b\u00e1sicos, pero dominarlos es un viaje gratificante.\n\nEst\u00e9tica Hermosa: Los visuales del juego son impresionantes, con un encanto r\u00fastico y medieval que te sumerge en el mundo. Las estaciones cambiantes y la atenci\u00f3n al detalle a\u00f1aden atractivo visual.\n\nDin\u00e1micas Sociales: El juego explora las din\u00e1micas sociales a medida que crece y envejece tu poblaci\u00f3n. Gestionar las necesidades y deseos de los ciudadanos agrega profundidad al juego.\n\nComunidad de Mods: \"Banished\" cuenta con una dedicada comunidad de modders que ofrecen una extensa biblioteca de mods que mejoran la jugabilidad, los gr\u00e1ficos y el contenido en general.\n\nContras:\n\nCurva de Aprendizaje Pronunciada: La curva de aprendizaje del juego puede ser bastante pronunciada, y los reci\u00e9n llegados pueden encontrarse luchando inicialmente. Sin embargo, esto tambi\u00e9n puede ser visto como un punto positivo para los jugadores que disfrutan de un desaf\u00edo.\n\nFalta de Historia o Campa\u00f1a: \"Banished\" es m\u00e1s una experiencia de sandbox. Carece de una historia estructurada o un modo campa\u00f1a, lo que puede decepcionar a los jugadores que buscan una experiencia m\u00e1s guiada.\n\nRepetitividad en la Parte Tard\u00eda: En la etapa final del juego, la jugabilidad puede volverse algo repetitiva, ya que has establecido una ciudad que funciona bien. Podr\u00eda beneficiarse de m\u00e1s contenido o objetivos en la parte tard\u00eda del juego.\n\nEn resumen, \"Banished\" es una joya escondida en el g\u00e9nero de construcci\u00f3n de ciudades. Su combinaci\u00f3n de simplicidad, profundidad y desaf\u00edo, junto con su est\u00e9tica magn\u00edfica, lo convierten en una excelente elecci\u00f3n para los jugadores que disfrutan de juegos de estrategia y gesti\u00f3n. Aunque tiene una curva de aprendizaje pronunciada y carece de una narrativa estructurada, la satisfacci\u00f3n de ver prosperar tu ciudad vale la inversi\u00f3n.

(Multiple times I've watched one finally arrive from town, having done God knows what, only to stop just short of helping with harvesting a crop because they needed to go back to town to eat food!?!?!?)\n\nThese minuses don't ruin the game but they do make me wish some things were a little different.\n\nIdeally I'd like to see a system of random events (not natural disasters.) Things like unusual wildlife encounters, non-violent non-villager people encounters, differences developing within the village that must be negotiated to avoid people leaving, discoveries of abandoned villages, abandoned mines, there are a lot of possibilities that would add some immersive qualities to the game.\n\nIt would be nice to have more environmental variety. ( I know there are mods that I must check out.) More character in the rivers and lakes, caves, waterfalls, swampland, ravines, arches, tar pits, hot springs, etc...\n\nThere's probably already a thousand miles worth of code involved in this game and it's already a great game but I'm always looking for some specific gaming experiences and I thought I'd share a bit.\n", "timestamp_created": 1695331337, "timestamp_updated": 1695331337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688241481781005859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146728951": {"recommendationid": "146728951", "author": {"steamid": "76561199441760008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1306, "last_played": 1695346859}, "language": "english", "review": "Very frustrating but very addictive!

The game start is very hard (always save the moment you start a game because you might need a couple of tries to survive the first couple of winters. The early game is all about juggling limited citizens with resource and goods development. Not growing faster than your food supplies, etc. And gradually it gets easier in the mid-game, which is where a lot of reviewers say it gets too easy. But if you keep playing into the late game you can actually run out of map and be in a delicate balance of maintaining your population without growing because you're at your production limits. Trade becomes vitally important. It's a whole new kind of challenge.\n\nI love this game. I've gotten all the achievements (which is mainly being persistent). It has a good balance of enough resources to be interesting without so many that they're hard to track (and if you want more there are a bunch of mods that add things or even reimagine the game). I enjoy the challenge and the spinning plates. It's an excellent companion to a  podcast or a TTRPG show.\n\nThe graphics are pretty. I enjoy watching all the little people go about their jobs, and I enjoy the sound design. I also love that this game is basically a communist society working together to all mutually benefit, and it really set the tone for survival city builders in that regard, too. I always like seeing the story game mechanics tell in city builders.

Aqui todos os cidad\u00e3os da col\u00f4nia podem fazer qualquer fun\u00e7\u00e3o, mas voc\u00ea escolhe o que cada um vai fazer especificamente, e at\u00e9 coisas como construir uma casa pode levar tempo no come\u00e7o do jogo. Vou dar alguns exemplos de situa\u00e7\u00f5es comuns que podem acontecer se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o souber lidar com a gest\u00e3o de recursos e cadeia produtiva no jogo:\n\n[b]1. [Import\u00e2ncia da Madeira][/b] Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tiver silvicultores coletando madeira e oper\u00e1rios para mover essa madeira para os lenhadores cortarem e transformarem em lenha, que ent\u00e3o \u00e9 levada pelos mercadores ao mercado para que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o geral possa levar para suas casas, todos podem morrer de hipotermia no inverno pela falta de aquecimento.\n\nA quest\u00e3o aqui \u00e9 que voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m precisa da madeira para construir v\u00e1rias coisas no jogo, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea precisa estabelecer um balan\u00e7o entre a velocidade de expans\u00e3o e manter os colonos que j\u00e1 est\u00e3o vivos supridos.\n\n[b]2. [Import\u00e2ncia da Comida][/b] Voc\u00ea precisa de comida para que todos sobrevivam, e h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias formas de conseguir comida: agricultura, agropecu\u00e1ria, pescaria, coleta silvestre, etc. Entretanto, cada uma dessas comidas precisam ser coletadas por um cidad\u00e3o, que ent\u00e3o leva para um armaz\u00e9m. \n\nA cada ano, esses mesmos cidad\u00e3os tamb\u00e9m precisam consumir uma quantidade de comida, ent\u00e3o se voc\u00ea tiver pouca produ\u00e7\u00e3o, pode gerar uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o em que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 comida suficiente para todos, especialmente se construir casas muito rapidamente, porque os colonos ter\u00e3o filhos e isso aumenta exponencialmente o consumo, especialmente porque as crian\u00e7as n\u00e3o podem trabalhar at\u00e9 ficarem mais velhas.\n\n[b]3. [Efetividade dos Colonos][/b] Escolas, ferramentas e roupas de frio fazem com que os colonos trabalhem de forma mais efetiva (cerca de dobro de efetividade acumulada), mas cada uma delas vem com desvantagens. Escolas fazem com que as novas crian\u00e7as, que geralmente poderiam trabalhar desde os 10 anos, s\u00f3 comecem a trabalhar por volta dos 18-21, atrasando o desenvolvimento imediato da col\u00f4nia para priorizar efici\u00eancia futura. Ferramentas e roupas precisam de colonos espec\u00edficos trabalhando em toda linha de produ\u00e7\u00e3o delas. Ferreiro, oper\u00e1rios, mineradores e mercadores s\u00e3o algumas pra ferramentas, por exemplo. \n\nDois grandes problemas podem surgir aqui. O primeiro \u00e9 voc\u00ea estabelecer uma economia saud\u00e1vel usando ferramentas e colonos educados, mas n\u00e3o planejar escolas ou a linha de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ferramentas conforme a col\u00f4nia cres\u00e7a. Isso faz com que falte ferramentas e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o diminua drasticamente, afetando todas as outras cadeias produtivas, desde a madeira para aquecimento at\u00e9 a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de alimento. A col\u00f4nia ent\u00e3o entra em colapso e muitas mortes acontecem. \n\nO segundo problema \u00e9 voc\u00ea estabelecer uma col\u00f4nia t\u00e3o eficiente que os produtos come\u00e7am a ser feitos em quantidades astron\u00f4micas sem limite, o que enche os armaz\u00e9ns de ferramentas e roupas que n\u00e3o ser\u00e3o utilizadas t\u00e3o cedo e diminui o espa\u00e7o para alimentos que seriam vitais. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o pra isso seria simples: vender com um comerciante estrangeiro que vem de barco.\n\n---------\n\nEscrevi tudo isso pra mostrar como esse jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 f\u00e1cil, especialmente no come\u00e7o. Suas primeiras col\u00f4nias ir\u00e3o fracassar, e isso \u00e9 um fato. Quando voc\u00ea entende as din\u00e2micas do jogo, entretanto, ele fica muito mais gostoso e simples de jogar, porque n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo com infinitas mec\u00e2nicas. Existem mods que aumentam as cadeias de produ\u00e7\u00e3o pra quantidades absurdas se essa for sua parte favorita do jogo, e elas deixam o jogo ter uma replayabilidade insana, ent\u00e3o pelo pre\u00e7o esse jogo \u00e9 incrivelmente barato pela quantidade de horas que voc\u00ea consegue jogar e aproveitar. \n\nN\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada como Banished no mercado. O mais pr\u00f3ximo que consigo imaginar - sem ser o jogo [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538570/Patron/]Patron[/url][/u], seu clone moderno - \u00e9 [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/40950/Stronghold_HD/]Stronghold[/url][/u], mas sem os elementos de combate e com micromanagement de profiss\u00f5es.\n\n[b]Nota: 8/10 - MUITO BOM[/b]",

I really do.  I love resource management games.  I can forgive the complete lack of a story.  I can forgive the lack of framing quests and goals.  But what I cannot forgive is bad design.  For a resource management game, it's missing some fairly key things.\nSuch as:\n- a way to see in one place how much of a given resource you're forecast to be producing (they'll tell you how much you have already produced that year, but that doesn't help for things like crops that get harvested all at once.)\n- how much your citizens are forecast to consume (again, they will tell you how much they already have, but this ignores the population you are TRYING to grow)\n- the ages of all your citizens in one place (people grow old and die and need to have younger people to replace them.  A bar graph showing all the ages of the people would be immensely helpful - something to tell you if you have a rapidly ageing population and be sure you have incoming students/children to replace them)\n- A way to look at a farm or an orchard and know how much it will produce that year at 100%.  (Sometimes there's an early frost and you can't get to 100%, but that's ok, that's just part of the challenge)\n- Honestly, ANYTHING predictive would be nice.  This game makes me want to set up excel spreadsheets to fill in the lack.  There is no way to know how much food a fishery produces compared to a hunter's cabin, or how much you're cutting into production by overlapping the hunting radii.\n- On that note - when placing a building with a radius, show us the radii of other buildings of that type so we can avoid overlap.  Tell us if it's going to produce less than 100% and how much 100% IS.\n\nThat's most of my gripes.

Try to split your time between all 3 and you wont produce enough food, so everyone starves to death.\nIf by some fluke you manage to survive the first couple of years (usually with only two settlers left) then the next thing will be a fire which cannot be put out, meaning there is no food production so everyone starves. Again I looked online for how to deal with fire, but the labourers just run back and forth over the same 10 squares and don't attempt to put the fire out so the town burns to the ground around them.\n\nIn the 11 hours I've played I have started over 20 games and not been able to progress in any of them - labourers decide they can't be bothered to collect food, so everyone starves. Ask labourers to collect wood, stone or iron - everybody starves. Force them to collect food - everybody freezes, even in summer.\nFood production takes waay too long, and doesn't produce enough to feed the starting population anyway. The tutorial says to build Fishing Wharf, and yes there is in instant flow of food, but not even close to being enough to feed the population.\nBuildings take an age to go up, so each game year you are limited to 2 or 3 if you are lucky. But as you also need to gather the resources for these buildings, your pops are going to starve coz no one is collecting food.\n\nYou can't assign specific pops to buildings, you tell it how many to work in the building type and then off they go - labourers on the other hand are completely controlled by the game AI so they do what that wants them to do, rather than what you want them to do...for example, you have 10 labourers, rather than a couple being sent to gather the resources you need and others gathering food, they ALL go to gather resources or they ALL go to gather food - your pops either starve or freeze because the dumb AI cannot let them do more than one thing at a time.\n\nThis is one of the most frustrating, pointless games I have ever played - even with mods its no better, it's either freeze or starve every single time.", "timestamp_created": 1688918799, "timestamp_updated": 1688918927, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497941434383392334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141680621": {"recommendationid": "141680621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303289599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1696453162}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive.

Many people turn here to give a fresh twist to the game, and I highly recommend it! Most of the mods tweak aspects of the game's balance, update its models, and add new resources/building. My favorite mods change the models to resemble the architecture of different cultures, like Japan and Morocco.\n\nThis game wasn't exactly endless fun for me.

This is the kind of game where if it hits you just right, your first serious play session will extend deep into the night and the next day and eventually you'll find yourself leaving the simulation running for days at a time as the micromanaging becomes macromanaging and your society crawls slowly towards equilibrium.\n\nAnd thats just the base game, where I've dumped most of my hours. Mods like MegaMod add an astonishing amount of content, and I can see myself putting hundreds more hours in over the years. And that's really the thing about Banished, it's DEEP so you can't jump in every day. I've owned this game for years and only play a few times a year, with each city lasting several tens of hours.

I love it because its game play is simple and intriguing. Its easy to get into and get the hang of, and what your town grow is very rewarding. I also just love city and colony sims.

You're not putting up with a constant barrage of things like raiders, plagues, or random events at the start of the game. This makes it feel more fair and affords a level of pride you feel in yourself when you solve certain elements of the early game.\n- In addition to my previous point, there's an incredibly fast turn around time from starting over to getting through the first few hurdles of the game (the first couple of winters). This means you won't be stuck in a \"Try - Die - Repeat\" loop any longer than a handful of minutes, 30 at most if you're just learning the UI. Once you get comfy with the UI, you can go from fresh start to second winter in a few minutes, and you can experiment freely with early game strategies\n- There's a nice mid game transition, where you can begin experimenting with how to handle initial expansion, what you should do with your increasing population, and what efforts in your village you want to prioritize.\n\nThere are some negatives worth noting:\n- The UI is dated, somewhat archaic, and visual/information clarity seriously lacks at times.\n- AI is very mixed. On one hand, idle villagers whose job don't have any activity (farmers during winter) will automatically take over menial tasks such as moving things to storage and harvesting resources you've marked to be removed via the \"Remove Resources\" tool. \n- On the other hand... the AI does not handle housing, automatic pathing (in terms of building roads), or \"needs prioritization\" in a graceful way that you might come to expect from modern games. Foundation comes to mind, with how amazing the villagers self organize with housing, needs, and occupations\n- Final note about villager management and AI: While its great the farmers don't waste a ton of time during winter, there comes a time when you have the make a decision... micromanage the living hell out of everyone, or accept inefficiency. Pausing the game, converting your farmers to more productive jobs during the winter, and back to farming during the spring is not a loop many people can put up with for long. When compared to how job overflow and priorities work in a game like Kingdoms and Castles, it yet again shows its age. And, last thing to note, there doesn't appear to be any form of \"job proficiency\" that the villagers gain in Banished, which not only doesn't punish the behavior of excessive micromanagement in a way that would at least make sense, it practically enforces it as the most optimal way of playing. Your mileage may vary on how this personally affects your enjoyment of the game\n- Late game is rather non-existent. It's a matter of scaling and taking up all the available space on the map. Combine this with the fact that there is a repeatable way of surviving the early game nearly 100% of the time (IE: there's not a map seed that might force you to play one way or another - once you can solve the early game, it stays solved), the game essentially converts into a sandbox civilization simulator... a simulator that is vastly inferior to modern options.\n\nSo, final verdict: on sale, as a way to revisit the past of this unique and fun genre, I'd absolutely recommend it. It's a classic of the genre and is worth celebrating it for what it is.

The little town of Aviono, 20k food, 78 adults, around 12 children, and 15 years in. When the 16th year came around, it all went to hell. A fire started, burning one of the three storage barns stocked with food. I tried to get my little people to fight the fire with the wells nearby. They failed miserably and the other two barns caught fire, (this is about the time I realized putting all my food storages close together was a mistake).\nThe fire started to spread to the wooden houses nearby, so I paused the game and looked up how to fight the damn fire. I figured out prioritizing the fire would help, so I did it and it did the trick. After the fire was put out, I checked out the damage. All my food gone and 5-6 houses destroyed. I knew my first priority should be to get my food back up to support my ever growing population of little people.\n\nThis is where I realised I had made another mistake. Over 70% of my food was coming from potato farms, and guess what? All of my farms were right next to each other and an infestation started. Farm after farm were getting infected and loosing crops and I had no idea how to stop it. (I'm not one to go back and load and earlier save) So I paused it and looked it up, I couldn't find out how to stop it this time and I let it run it's course. Now the starvation began, and the graveyard began to fill up with little people's grave stones. It was too late to plant crops to get enough food to feed them all, so I basically gave up and watched everyone die a horrible death. I closed my eyes, mourning the loss of the little people that I had led around for so long.\n\nThen...I opened my eyes. I had three people still living! One 19 year old male and one 22 year old mother with her 6 year old male child. I had another chance to fix the broken city and save Aviono. This female was my last hope, unless I could get her with a female child, all was lost. So I set them to work tearing down the now unoccupied houses of the original Aviono, since I was almost completely out of materials. I got them to live close to eachother and waited paitently untill....success! A female child was born.\n\nLife was good again. I set my new couple to tearing down everything not needed for materials and the future growth or Aviono. In the end, I had two stone houses, one of every type of resource production buildings, a town hall, and a cemetery (to remind me of the past mistakes). I got my population back up to 16 little people, and I sat back and sighed with relief. I had saved a town.\nThen I realised that the new towns folk were all inbred children from the three survivors....", "timestamp_created": 1683819861, "timestamp_updated": 1683819861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138127127": {"recommendationid": "138127127", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969346618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1324, "last_played": 1683788734}, "language": "english", "review": "I gave this game a solid try - but at this point its not fun.

The problem is that the player doesn't know.\nBeing a survival game, resource management is core but the game only gives you vague stats and no proper ways to control.\n\nSay there is a ingame disaster, a fire in your warehouse. You cannot ask your villagers to prioritize in taking care of the danger (so they eat their food whilst on fire. At most, you can order to \"prioritize the area\" which is very vague. Will your spare builders or the nearest villager interact?), you cannot control which resources to enable/disable so the wood doesn't spread the fire the next time. You can only build a well or near a river, preventing the disaster before it appears. With this gamestyle, the player is incentivized to either consider building everything or pray and get lucky that the wrong kind of disaster does not appear.\nAnd even if you have all the buildings, you will still face issues with a barely functional village you cannot manage because this is a survival game; you're walking on a thin rope.

The game's focus on survival and resource management sets it apart from other city-building games like Sim City 4 and Cities: Skylines. In Banished, players must manage a small group of villagers and guide them to build a thriving community in a harsh and unforgiving environment.\n\nOne of the standout features of Banished is its attention to detail. The game's graphics and sound design are simple yet effective, creating a realistic and believable world. The game's mechanics are also well-designed, requiring players to carefully manage resources like food, tools, and building materials. Players must also consider factors like weather, disease, and the needs of their villagers to ensure their survival.\n\nCompared to Sim City 4 and Cities: Skylines, Banished offers a unique and more challenging gameplay experience. While Sim City 4 and Cities: Skylines focus more on building and expanding cities, Banished challenges players to survive and thrive in a harsh wilderness. This adds a new level of depth and complexity to the game, making it a great choice for fans of city-building and survival games alike.

difficult at first, so be ready that you'll fail a lot. But once you figure out how things work, the game becomes easy. The downside is that most likely, once you figure it out, the game will become pretty boring. Still worth buying though.\n\nThere is no campaign unfortunately. It's just a city-building / sandbox / survival game. You can consider achievements as a quest list though.

The game play of Banished revolves around resource management, city-building, and survival. Players must manage their resources, including food, water, and raw materials, to ensure their settlers' survival. As the settlement grows, players must construct new buildings, manage their population, and expand their resources to keep up with the growing demands of the community. One of the standout features of Banished is its emphasis on realism and attention to detail. The game's mechanics are intricately designed, and the game's world is procedural generated, offering a unique and dynamic experience for each play through. The game's graphics and sound design are also impressive, with detailed environments and atmospheric sound effects that add to the game's immersion. Additionally, Banished has a modding community that adds even more content and features to the game. Mods can range from small tweaks to the game's mechanics to complete overhauls that add new buildings, resources, and game play mechanics. However, one potential downside of Banished is its lack of depth and replay ability. Once players have mastered the game's mechanics, the game can feel repetitive, with little variation in game play from one play through to the next. Additionally, the game's difficulty can be punishing at times, leading to the failure of the player's settlement. In conclusion, Banished is an excellent city-building game with a focus on realism and attention to detail. Its procedural generated world and intricate mechanics offer a unique and dynamic experience for each play through, and its modding community adds even more content and features to the game. While it may lack depth and replay ability, those who enjoy city-building and resource management games will find a rewarding experience in Banished.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1680218328, "timestamp_updated": 1680218328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135768000": {"recommendationid": "135768000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012914401", "num_games_owned": 785, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3142, "last_played": 1689926109}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Non Cities: Skylines City Builder of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1680215363, "timestamp_updated": 1680215363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135757480": {"recommendationid": "135757480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330713726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11881, "last_played": 1694976691}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game relaxing fun and you don't get any fighting just building and feeding people , make sure you do that farms first about 6 to start with size 6 by 6 putting 1 person to work you could do bigger but your need more workers on it remember you need workers for the rest ie woodcutter, blacksmith and so on, as you build more home increase the farms", "timestamp_created": 1680202832, "timestamp_updated": 1680202832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135749673": {"recommendationid": "135749673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036738339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1683171272}, "language": "english", "review": "Banished was the first game who's development I followed closely since its inception as a Zombie survival game and the pet project of one man.

Fundamentally, you\u2019ll have to create housing and establish decent food as well as firewood production to ensure your population will make it through the winter.\n\nOnce you managed that, you\u2019ll slowly expand, establishing resource production, clothing and tool manufacturers, schools and more. You\u2019ll have to assign your people to the different jobs becoming available, making sure everything gets done while all basic requirements of your population are met.\n\nThere are only a few different resource types, making for basic production chains and very simple building. Additionally, there\u2019s a rather limited number of different buildings types serving only a couple of mechanics you\u2019ll need to keep track of. However, the early game especially features quite a steep difficulty curve, with sparse resources and even sparser work force available to perform all necessary jobs. While this lets up as you establish your town, there are some special events, such as plagues, fires or tornados thrown in from time to time in order to keep you on your toes somewhat.\n\nAfter building a trading post, the game allows you to collect a variety of produce plants and livestock types from visiting traders. While the plant types especially won\u2019t act much different from the ones you started out with, this at least gives you a bit of a goal once your town is big enough to be stable. Banished also offers Steam Workshop Support, giving you plenty of mods to expand the game\u2019s basic content.

Unlike other similar city builders, Banished boasts a unique and realistic atmosphere. Set in the middle of a harsh and unforgiving winter, players must use their resourcefulness to create a thriving, cohesive community from a handful of exiled settlers.\n\nThe gameplay in Banished is simple yet wholly immersive. Much of the challenge in Banished is in creating a comprehensive strategy for managing your resources and population efficiently, as a limited supply of resources and ever-changing weather conditions throw their fair share of curveballs. At its core, Banished requires the player to make sure that the basic needs of each citizen are taken care of, while also striving to expand their settlement's capabilities and its population.\n\nOn a technical level, Banished is simply stunning. The graphics are detailed and full of character, and the game's sound effects and music create an oppressive yet beautiful atmosphere. And while the game's loading times and technical hiccups can occasionally be tiresome, it's ultimately a minor nuisance that can quickly be forgotten in the face of spending time to manage and build one's own city.\n\nIn conclusion, Banished is an absolute must-play for any fan of city building sims. With its captivating atmosphere, incredible depth, and engaging gameplay, Banished will captivate any player for hours on end.

But due to the community workshop the game can get pretty wild. The base game in itself is solid with the overall goal being \"don't starve or freeze to death\", With other community building goals coming after you achieve some semblance of communal stability. (all stability is a lie though and you'll watch in horror as a poor harvest or lack of firewood causes a famine that kills 90% of your city leaving behind a ghost town being watched over by a handful of elderly. They'll whisper \"you should have done more\" and you'll feel bad on the inside.)\n\nThe game is hard but not without difficulty settings. Harder settings really just start you off with less people. The game in it of itself becomes easier and more enjoyable with rapid population growth, division of labor and the ability to form not just a surviving town, but a happy town. \n\nThe game starts you out with a storage barn of limited tools and food, as well as a stock pile of resources to start building houses, farms, hunters lodges, etc. It;s not overly complicated and can be enjoyable. creating a thriving town from 10 outcasts is a good feeling.\n\nThere is one more thing to note, this game is tiny. it's literally 50mb and can run on a PC from 1999. This means if you have this game in your library you can install in on any device and wait for that rare itch to develop a city. Before a week ago I haven't touched this game since 2014.

The game is built around a simple premise, but it is surprisingly complex and difficult to master. Players are tasked with managing a small community of people who have been exiled from their home, and must help them build a new life in a new place.\n\nThe game's graphics are simple, but effective, with a clean and functional interface that is easy to navigate. The gameplay is well-designed and offers a good level of challenge, with players needing to manage resources carefully and make tough decisions about how to allocate their limited supplies.\n\nThe game's sound design is also well-implemented, with a peaceful and calming soundtrack that is a great fit for the game's relaxing and contemplative gameplay. However, there are a few issues with the game that detract from the overall experience. The game can be quite slow at times, with long stretches of waiting for resources to be gathered and buildings to be constructed.\n\nAdditionally, the game can be quite punishing, with one mistake potentially leading to the death of your entire community. This can lead to a frustrating experience, especially for newcomers to the genre. The game's lack of tutorial or guidance can also be a barrier to entry, with players needing to rely on trial and error to figure out the game's mechanics.\n\nOverall, Banished is a unique and engaging game that is worth checking out for fans of the genre. While it has its flaws, the game's challenge and complexity make for a rewarding experience for those who are willing to put in the effort. I would give it a score of 6/10.\n\nPC SPECS:\nIntel Core I7 -10700K\nGigabyte RTX 3090 Gaming OC\n64GB Kingston Hyper X Fury", "timestamp_created": 1676452564, "timestamp_updated": 1676452564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132875716": {"recommendationid": "132875716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001510218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14067, "last_played": 1699042971}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly addicting.

It starts at a very challenging pace, when you have to do some micromanagement to optimise the usage of the scarce resources and especially workers. But as the time progresses, that part goes away and if you're not a chaser of games badges you'll get bored, very quickly. There are no missions or campaigns or research or politics. Economy is incredibly basic, with just a few buildings and secondary products (literally: no secondary product requires non-primary ones). Those buildings mechanics are sometimes very annoying: for example, you can't set the working area for them, and often that's a very large one that will cover a considerable amount of a smaller map. Quarry areas can't be reused after they finish their stone supply. You get tons of different crops and trees to grow; some will adapt better to the weather or give food slightly earlier, but overall there's not a huge difference from growing one or another. The existence of other towns is only present thanks to commerce. Commerce itself is very meh - can order some stuff (not all of it) overpaying it, or try to rely on what merchants bring - which seems random. Merchant boats also arrive rarely and at totally random times, they often won't accept many items for exchange and it's hard to tailor your economy for commerce. It's also not possible to convert anything into \"money\". My advice: do not buy unless you're very bored or it's in heavy discount.", "timestamp_created": 1674987011, "timestamp_updated": 1674987011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131779688": {"recommendationid": "131779688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089317640", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1577643020}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, fun", "timestamp_created": 1674971699, "timestamp_updated": 1674971699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131773669": {"recommendationid": "131773669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085453582", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7473, "last_played": 1674970750}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun Game", "timestamp_created": 1674963517, "timestamp_updated": 1674963517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131768722": {"recommendationid": "131768722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054103118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6878, "last_played": 1675025134}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game to just loose yourself in.", "timestamp_created": 1674957293, "timestamp_updated": 1674957293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131760730": {"recommendationid": "131760730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209037873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9120, "last_played": 1685366374}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game, relaxing to play once you get used to the mechanics, just wish you didnt have to expand so much to keep going, maps fill quick and space becomes an issue", "timestamp_created": 1674946975, "timestamp_updated": 1674946975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131753823": {"recommendationid": "131753823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024209036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1675033498}, "language": "english", "review": "a great game that relaxes me allot.", "timestamp_created": 1674939499, "timestamp_updated": 1674939499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131730209": {"recommendationid": "131730209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003749943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9362, "last_played": 1691701740}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game quite challenging to begin with.

The game is set in a medieval fantasy world and features a range of mechanics that require careful planning and resource management in order to thrive.\n\nOne of the standout features of Banished is its focus on realism and simulation. The game does a great job of recreating the challenges and realities of life in a small, isolated community, and players must carefully consider everything from food production and resource management to healthcare and education in order to ensure the survival and prosperity of their colony.\n\nThe game's weather system is particularly noteworthy, as it can have a significant impact on the well-being of your settlers. Severe storms, for example, can disrupt food production and make it difficult for settlers to go about their daily tasks, while harsh winters can lead to shortages of warmth and shelter. Players must therefore be proactive in preparing for such events and ensuring that their colony is well-equipped to weather the storms.\n\nAnother strength of Banished is its depth and replayability. The game features a range of different resources, buildings, and structures that can be unlocked and utilized as your colony grows, and players are given a good deal of freedom in how they choose to expand and develop their settlement. The game also includes a number of different scenarios that present unique challenges and objectives, which helps to keep things fresh and interesting even after multiple play-throughs.\n\nOne potential drawback of Banished is its difficulty. The game can be quite challenging, particularly for players who are new to city-building games or who are unfamiliar with its mechanics. The game does a good job of easing players into its systems, but it can still be overwhelming at times, particularly when your colony is hit by unexpected disasters or other unforeseen events.\n \nFun Factor: 85\nBanished is a genuinely enjoyable game to play, particularly for fans of city-building or strategy games. Its focus on realism and simulation adds a level of depth and immersion that helps to keep things interesting, and the wide range of resources and structures available for players to unlock and utilize adds a good deal of replay value.\n\nVisual & Sound Quality: 75\nThe graphics in Banished are fairly basic but are effective in conveying the game's medieval fantasy setting. The game's interface is clear and easy to navigate, and the various buildings and structures are well-detailed and look good on screen. The soundtrack is fairly minimal but is fitting for the game's setting and atmosphere.\n\nReplayability: 90\nBanished has a great deal of replay value thanks to its wide range of resources, buildings, and structures that can be unlocked and utilized as your colony grows. The game also includes a number of different scenarios that present unique challenges and objectives, which helps to keep things fresh and interesting even after multiple play-throughs.\n\nLevel of Challenge: 80\nBanished can be quite challenging, particularly for players who are new to city-building games or who are unfamiliar with its mechanics. The game does a good job of easing players into its systems, but it can still be overwhelming at times, particularly when your colony is hit by unexpected disasters or other unforeseen events. That being said, the game's challenging nature is part of its appeal, and players who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn its systems will be richly rewarded with a satisfying and rewarding gaming experience. \n\nOverall, Banished is a thoughtful and challenging city-building strategy game that offers a great deal of depth and replayability. Its focus on realism and simulation, combined with its wide range of resources and structures, make it a great choice for players who are looking for a more immersive and challenging gaming experience. While it may be a bit daunting for newcomers, those who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn its systems will be richly rewarded with a satisfying and rewarding gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1671803937, "timestamp_updated": 1672864686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129090014": {"recommendationid": "129090014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992428827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 20187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19240, "last_played": 1691246340}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game for a stupid amount of hours. it's a city builder and survival game with no enemy to raid you, you just need to keep your society alive and thriving.

Grab yourself a handful of mods (trust me). Whether it's for vastly expanded gameplay and building options or ease of use, it makes the game substantially better. Now here's where this game has a MAJOR issue. Resource distribution (food primarily). You have storage warehouses, barns, etc and then you have marketplaces. All of which citizens will pick from to get their necessities. So here's my gripe (a) you can spend literal HOURS building up a great settlement. I personally got as high as 100 citizens, but with that comes the obvious growing demand for food, heating, etc. If you make ONE miss-step you'd better be ready for a DRASTIC die off. I had tons of food throughout but as I focused on trying to build new things I've been dying to do since this is a city builder I noticed an actual decline in my food stock. So I reacted accordingly but since things like orchards take a long time to payoff the issue got continually worse (b) when someone is looking for (let's say food in this example) they'll walk toward a storage or market place and if the food isn't there that second they walk all the way back. Mind you food could be delivered seconds later or the market down the road could have some but they'll walk off and die instead (c) with the amount of storage / market places you really need to handle the expanding neighborhoods you create; and keep in mind that foresters, hunters, gatherers, herb collectors really need to be placed on the outskirts in order to maximize efficiency, it leaves you searching all these different places if you're looking for specific building resources you might need. The ultimate result for me at the moment is almost 200 hours into the game on 2 different attempts. Most recently I went from 100 citizens down to 56 in a single year! Mind you I shut down a ton of non essential buildings and focused entirely on food producers for that entire year. You simply cannot correct without absolutely demolishing your work. So now I have this city that had so much exciting things starting to happen, but it's absolutely worthless. Figure something out because the average player is not going to want to run through trial and error and waste so many hours to figure out how to get the ultimate result they desire.\n\nAll that said though, I'd still recommend this to the avid city builder because if you can deal with the extremely frustrating and time consuming failures; this game has a lot of fun offerings and a lot of long-term playability.

You start off with a small group of people and you are tasked with building a town and insuring their survival. It\u2019s not the easiest thing, but once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s a smooth ride.\nUnless you\u2019ve made the mistake of turning on disasters, the game is a pleasant little experience. Most of its playtime is just you expanding the village until you eventually encompass the whole map. The game is not a complete breeze, as you do actually need to thing economically when it comes to managing limited resources, villager mortality and the alike. Quite fitting in a city builder.\n\nExtra props go to the coding of the villagers, as they will actually automatically move to houses that are nearest to their workplaces and other similar stuff like that. This is a feature that is actually quite lacking in other, bigger city-builder/manager games.\n\n[u]Now, the game does have a few cons. [/u]\nFor starters, you very quickly go through the content. Once your through, all that\u2019s left is to expand and grow the settlement.\nThere are a few extremely rare bugs. Or so I\u2019m told, I haven\u2019t experienced anything past a single mentally ill villager that started doing a run around the world once.\nThe disasters are quite unfun, as they just spawn a tornado that kills 90% of your town and undoes hours\u2019 worth of progress without you being able to do anything about it.\n\n[u]Fortunately, most of its cons can be easily addressed. [/u]\nYour getting bored of the base game? There\u2019s mod support.\nHad some bugs? I don\u2019t believe you.\nDon\u2019t like disasters?

I can go from 5,000 units of food one year, to half of my population starving to death the next year, with no changes in food production and minimal births.

You need to play in a certain way for you to proceed. What that way is.... well that's like a mystery and you must solve it through process of elimination.\n\nI was going great guns on my first game - then realised my population was all old and dying. I did some research and it turns out... no wait for this... I didn't have enough houses. And apparently my little digital citizens don't like to procreate in busy in houses. They need to see available housing stock to go breeding.\n\nThis is not only just so secretive in its behaviour - the game gives zero indication of population housing issues - but also just quite frankly disobeys everything we've learnt about history where in poorer times people do share homes and yes they do procreate like crazy. Look at a census some time!\n\nYou can then get a tornado just because which wipes out your town, lolz.\n\nOr my latest game where it's snowy every two days and food won't grow and now they'll starve.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if the game were a bit more transparent, but it almost likes to be secretive and go \"Surprise!\"\n\nIt also has questionable pathfinding/resource management. I need to build a mine. It needs stone. So logically you build a little storage area for stone, then mine stone nearby so it goes to build the mine nearby. Logical yeah? No, they'll take the stone back to the town centre nowhere near the mine.\n\nPeople management is very fiddly. And there's no logic - for example you can't say if you're not building something, go do other labourer stuff. If your production facility is maxed out - go do building. They will sit and do nothing.\n\nIt is the sort of game where you go \"one more go...\" to see if you can master it. And I'm sure I will. But that doesn't make it a well designed game.\n\nEdit: I did do one more go. Quite a few times.  It's one of those games like a puzzle that it does make you want to scratch an itch. But it's only because the game is chaos, at the end of the day And you are trying to bring order from chaos. It has complexity, but without proper control so it make you flick switches to see if it can all work.\n\nBut at the end of the day those switches are fickle. You can have HALF your population on food production but they will starve. You can literally have thousands of units of food and you can see they are at a market metres away from a 'starving person' and they don't eat.\n\nI mean, a farmer will die of starvation in a field of food. It says it all.\n\nPlay Anno 1404 if you want complex supply chains. And importantly EVOLVING supply chains.

In fact, it has written the book on how to do it and many more current games are based on it. You have to manage several key resources quickly, and continuously for you towns people to survive. You have to manage the number of houses for them to continue having children for the next generation. And personally I love the style of the entire game.\n\ncons: personally, there are a few things that irk me in the game. You cannot earn achievements with any mod enabled. I suppose this makes sense so people cannot cheat, but very annoying as 90% of mods are cosmetics. There is a plethera of cosmetic and minor change mods that make this game from baseline gameplay to absolutely amazing. I've seen colonial styles, japanese styles, even viking remodels of all the game ellements. There are game changing mods such as removing coal from houses forcing them to continue relying on firewood that is easily replaced/regrown.\n\nI also personally dislike when games like this make things so terribly un-renewable. regardless of your oppinion on the subject, not being able to build on the old quarry ground, and the mine running dry in only 2 years is just insane to me and not at all realistic. \n\nI still will play for a long time on this game, trying to achieve all those complicated achievements (so far about 200h and 0 of them earned- LOL), as well as just enjoying building dif styles of towns with a bunch of mods making it easier and more artsy to play. \n\nI would still definately recommend buying this game, though its older, for anyone who enjoys city sims or town layout building games. This old gem ain't going anywhere for a long time :)", "timestamp_created": 1661238673, "timestamp_updated": 1661238673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121088798": {"recommendationid": "121088798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198631918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7030, "last_played": 1682123841}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1661217604, "timestamp_updated": 1661217604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121084511": {"recommendationid": "121084511", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970484999", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5176, "last_played": 1661464529}, "language": "english", "review": "just a chill city builder", "timestamp_created": 1661209969, "timestamp_updated": 1661209969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121056371": {"recommendationid": "121056371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144743072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5661, "last_played": 1643409919}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent quite a few hours enjoying this game, modding it, and then enjoying it some more.

The other three try to cram in too much information and do not offer a lot of opportunity to actually practice what is being taught.\n\n\nIt's difficult to tell what is \"wrong\" with this game, but what I am suspecting is the major \"wrong\" with it is information.  Mainly, there's a severe lack of clear information at any given moment.\n\n\nThe game tells you how to gather resources and build buildings and the like in order to get started and to survive.  But there's no central information \"hub\" by which you can monitor everything clearly.  As well, you don't get clear information with regards to what SPECIFICALLY is needed.\n\n\nFor example, you need stockpiles of stone, iron, and wood to build most things.  The game doesn't explicitly tell you what actually is iron, but you can figure it out on your own that it's the smaller, darker rocks among the stones.  The game also doesn't tell you that you need a supply of iron tools and hide clothing because the tools break from use over time, and your townspeople are apparently incapable of making fires so they freeze to death very easily.\n\n\nAre you bringing in enough food with just a fisherman's hut?  No one seems to be starving, but just to be sure, you adds some farmland.  Is this enough?  You don't know, but now you've got 6 people working on food production instead of 3 and you only have 10 people who can work.  So you can either have a surplus of food and a severe labor shortage, or take a risk that you might only need 2 people fishing to support the other 8 while they gather rocks and grubs and flowers.  There's nothing in the game that keeps track of this sort of information for you, and since this is a game and not real life, you cannot actually go visit the store and figure out what \"30 food\" actually means.  30 pounds?  30 handfuls of corn?  30 fishsticks?  \n\n\nHow many adult human people can \"30 food\" feed and for how long?  Nothing in the game clues you in in any way, so you're essentially left permanently guessing how many workers is enough in a certain job place, and how much \"income\" of food or raw materials is satisfactory.  And if you guess wrong, your settlement of 12 people is cut down to 7 as the other half have suddenly starved to death or frozen to death because you didn't think to emphasize one particular job over another, such as building a Tailor shop instead of a Blacksmith, or a Trading post instead of an extra Farm, but then the food ran out before traders could arrive.\n\n\nA whole lot of the gameplay mechanics seem to have been either offhandedly touched upon in the tutorials or are otherwise left there as a \"try this out and see\" type situation.

But what's there is so solid that it's easy to see why it has been so successful and influential.\n\nBanished is a game that throws out the core tenets of SimCity-style city builders, wherein your focus is on building infrastructure and laying down zones.  Instead, Banished focuses on micromanaging a small number of citizens to get them to collect and produce the resources that allow them to survive while directly constructing the buildings they will use.\n\nThe only real infrastructure is roads, and even those are more or less optional.  The technology level is decidedly primitive, something around low-medieval, and most buildings are focused on various aspects of survival.\n\nAs such, this is really more of a \"village builder\" than a \"city builder\", although if you keep at it you can eventually spread out over a large area and end up with hundreds or even thousands of citizens.\n\nThe core gameplay loop feels great.  You're going to cycle through building things to provide food, housing, and firewood, plus a smattering of secondary needs to keep your citizens healthy and happy and make them work more efficiently.  In the meantime, you'll have to carefully manage what jobs your citizens have, like Farmer or Woodcutter or Blacksmith, via a small spreadsheet window.  Sometimes people will die, and you'll have to rearrange your spreadsheet if you don't have somebody ready to take up their tasks.  It's pretty tricky balancing all these different things in the early going, especially if you don't have a good grasp of the systems yet.\n\nJust figuring out all of those systems and getting a sustainable town running with a few dozen people will probably consume at least a few hours of your time, but it's satisfying when you start to get it all running, and even more satisfying when it becomes a well-oiled machine.\n\nThe problem with Banished, if there is one, comes in after that point.  At a certain point (it took me starting over once and playing around 9 or 10 hours) there will be nothing left to do except repeat the same core gameplay loop.  Banished does not have a tech tree; every building is unlocked from the beginning, provided you have enough resources and can sustain using the resources and workers to run it.  The total number of buildings is fairly small, and only one of them allows you to upgrade it in any way (from a wooden house to a stone house).  So really, the only thing left to do at that point is to continue to make your city bigger and bigger.  There's not any further progression.\n\nThis is where it becomes obvious that Banished is a very small indie game.  My understanding is it was a labor of love by a single developer, and as such a developer myself, I understand how hard it can be to make even something relatively small like this.  And it's great for what it is, just don't go into it with the expectation that it has a huge amount of depth and progression to keep you engaged.\n\nAs for the audio and visuals, they are fine.  Nothing here is going to blow you away (although the weather effects and seasons are pretty cool), and it can be a bit hard to tell some of the buildings apart since they all use the same basic color palette and similar architecture.  But everything is consistent and polished nothing looks or sounds bad, and what more can you ask from a solo developer?\n\nIn short, this is absolutely a game worth buying, especially on sale.  But I'll bet most people would get enough fun out of it even at full price.  Just make sure you go in with the right expectations.

And you have to make new towns over and over until you learn to fit your play style within the extremely limited parameters that the game forces you to play within to be able to not fail.\n\nNot only that, you can make 5000 correct decisions and be an efficiency expert, but you do one thing wrong like accept an unusually large amount of nomads or split more than one animal farm off at once to expand, and youre done. Theres just no coming back to it once the snowball effect hits.\n\nTheres an absolute snowball situation where when a few people die, it sucks off your laborers and then theres no laborers to move things out of your mines/quarries and so you cant build more houses or other buildings if you dont have backup supplies, and that can prevent population growth and in the end, can cause the whole labor structure to fall out of balance and then everyone just starts dying of starvation.\n\nAlso, it would be nice if the terrain didnt dictate so many things about where I build.  Placing certain items is way too unnecessarily sensitive and in the end, causes me to lose the game due to not being able to build where I need to in weird areas, and making it hard to move things around easily after mines and quarries shut down and major labor forces have to migrate quickly.  After a mine/quarry goes out, theres just 15 people living in an area that no longer serves any purpose and now they have to walk 5x as far to get to their job, creating unnecessary problems.\n\nJust let us bulldoze quarries/mines, it is not fun in any way that it leaves giant gaps in the map.\n\nGreat idea for a game, just extremely frustrating how it actually plays out due to how shit hits the fan out of nowhere and youre done. You just have to quit after watching your 100th death despite you doing everything you can.  The game is like trying to steer a boat away from a surprise hazard, you can make a sudden correction but the change wont happen until its too late and thats it, youre fate is sealed.\n\nNot fun when your fate is sealed in a game.  Its more fun when you feel like you have more control and can do things that can fix things, but when you can see the outcome being inevitable, thats an uninstall from me and a negative review for wasting my time and money on what was supposed to be a fun game.\n\nI know there are mods, but I paid for the game and had hoped it to be fun out of the \"box\", not expecting part of my payment to be mods fixing what should be fixed without, especially since I understand nobody gets paid that mods.\n\nThis review could be changed in the future if an end game and quality of life issues are considered, but I know how things go and seems like not a lot has changed in the future.\n\nGame is good for 20-30 hours at least for me, until I started really feeling like im stuck playing in a strict process, and not feeling like im playing anymore, and instead just working.", "timestamp_created": 1659348566, "timestamp_updated": 1659433556, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57393258810043335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119857717": {"recommendationid": "119857717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352962171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1502325167}, "language": "english", "review": "Age of Empires-esk.

Obviously playing at 10x speed might make you miss something, like a merchant or villager needs, so use at your discretion.\n\n+ Even though it's challenging and you might restart a lot, the gameplay loop is actually relaxing, especially playing on slower speeds. It's a chill time listening to the bustle of workers hammering and sawing away, and watching the little villagers go about their simple lives.\n\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- Some disasters, like tornados, can completely ruin your game. This adds a good challenge but is too skewed in my opinion. If a single tornado comes through and your villagers happen to be grouped up, game over. It wouldn't be so bad if there were more ways to protect against disasters or if villagers would notice weather changes beforehand and take shelter.\n\n- Non-renewable resources such as stone and iron end up needing to be traded from the merchant boats that come to your town every now and then. This is the most efficient way of getting bulk amounts of these crucial materials later on. Unfortunately, that means a lot of your trade power goes toward basic supplies, which is not very fun or interesting.\n\n- Needs more building variety or tech-tree system that allows for upgrades to existing buildings. As it stands, you can build everything the game offers right off the start if you really want to. It focuses on efficiencies and breadth expansion rather than depth.\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nBase game completed:  N/A\nDLC completed:  N/A\nRating:  7 / 10 - Good", "timestamp_created": 1658932212, "timestamp_updated": 1658932212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119557032": {"recommendationid": "119557032", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999616398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1658485290}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't starve!  100% of the village working on food and they STILL starve?", "timestamp_created": 1658898365, "timestamp_updated": 1658898365, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119552311": {"recommendationid": "119552311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055191831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 212, "playtime_at_review": 3762, "last_played": 1700642749}, "language": "english", "review": "have been playing this game for a least 2 years now, always rewarding, a quality game.", "timestamp_created": 1658891709, "timestamp_updated": 1658891709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588375568389892578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119547765": {"recommendationid": "119547765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186933703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 6624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6230, "last_played": 1690745337}, "language": "english", "review": "Big replay factor.

The game doesn't have any real gimmicks to it that (later) additions to the genre would add. The colonists aren't beavers, robots, in prehistoric times, in the post-apocalypse, or anything else.

You should maybe stay away from the game if you're a veteran, and you're looking for a special city-builder you've never played before, though you should maybe play it if you're just looking for a no muss, no fuss resource management experience.", "timestamp_created": 1657506213, "timestamp_updated": 1657506213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513888895511627197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118605461": {"recommendationid": "118605461", "author": {"steamid": "76561199200219783", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 8247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 6973, "last_played": 1699931255}, "language": "english", "review": "addicting and keeps coming back for more!", "timestamp_created": 1657503192, "timestamp_updated": 1657503192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118520625": {"recommendationid": "118520625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071464957", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 10932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10932, "last_played": 1605230834}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy entretenido, gran comunidad", "timestamp_created": 1657384350, "timestamp_updated": 1657384350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118511316": {"recommendationid": "118511316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087307803", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5877, "last_played": 1689575146}, "language": "english", "review": "veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud\n", "timestamp_created": 1657373341, "timestamp_updated": 1657373341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44425809383392334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118488144": {"recommendationid": "118488144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019697043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4356, "last_played": 1657409481}, "language": "english", "review": "fun\n", "timestamp_created": 1657336922, "timestamp_updated": 1657336922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118488028": {"recommendationid": "118488028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198812399003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1676753650}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a good game", "timestamp_created": 1657336745, "timestamp_updated": 1657336745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118483579": {"recommendationid": "118483579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051650604", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "playtime_at_review": 577, "last_played": 1700123141}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game.

The game crashes when you load a save file (while already in a game), about 40% of the time when you open the map (how? how did somebody screw up THIS badly?), and finally - just about whenever it feels like. And when the game freezes, you can't alt-tab to anything else.  All you can do is restart your computer.  This happens multiple times per day.  And this game has had these problems for YEARS.  This game is abandoned and won't get fixed.  Buy a better city game.  And don't even get me started on how you can literally have 70% of your ENTIRE POPULATION on farms and catching fish and picking fruit, and yet you'll still starve. \n\nOh, and there's no way to prioritise things.  You know Oxygen Not Included? You know how you can ramp up the priority of something and watch your little dupes build or operate or dig it?  Nope.  You have something that CLAIMS to be something that ups the priority of any task in its square, but I've hammered that over buildings and resources already flagged to be built/collected, and watched my 10 labourers ignore it for almost an entire in-game year.  Good luck building farms while you're starving, watching your food storage number go down FAST while your stupid villagers do anything BUT save themselves.  This game is STUPID when it comes to food.  Like, real stupid.  Food production is 100% your priority, and not even having the majority of your population devoted to food will be enough to save you.\n\nBecause a famine is inevitable.  Your villagers all eat food, and if you expand too fast they'll grow beyond their means to provide for themselves.  Like me, you could have 70% (SEVENTY PERCENT) of your entire village toiling away under the hot summer sun on farms and fisheries and orchards, and I guarantee you this somehow still won't be enough.  And then a fire hits and your entire village burns down despite you building WELLS every 10 feet.  And then you get hit by a plague that infects the entire village because one villager glitched out and wandered around town infecting everyone instead of going to the hospital.  And then 2/3 of the town dies because the game doesn't warn you that if a lot of people are BORN around the same time, they'll DIE around the same time - and you created a population bubble by sinfully building 3 houses one year instead of the usual 1 or 2.  And god help you when nomads show up and push that bubble to the breaking point.  Hope you have literally 50,000 units of food stored, because you're going to need them.  For reference: you start the game with just 1 or 2 thousand units of food, and that lasts you long enough to get a food source and set up some houses.  I cannot emphasise enough how obsessed this game is with food and how easy it is to reach a tipping point where not even OVER SEVENTY PERCENT of your entire population devoted to food production will fix.\n\nAnd bear in mind: this is AFTER I downloaded a mod that makes fields twice as productive.  How stupid do you think your vanilla game is going to be?\n\nThis game is a huge mess.  I have no idea how this game costs as much as Rimworld or other (better) sim games.  You are being ROBBED.

It is, then, a very simple game mechanics wise but it is very difficult, especially early game. \n\nAll these characteristics makes Banished relaxing and enjoyable. It is more like an AFK game (for me or my playstyle) than a strategic game because after you settle in the land and learn how the mechanics works, you are pretty much safe against mistakes and it is only a matter of hoarding resources to expand the village. \n\nThe worse thing about Banished is that the game doesn\u2019t tell you how things work (like a 7x7 farm is the best way to optimize a 1-person farm), although it doesn\u2019t spoil the enjoyment, since we live in a world where information is right there, so a quick search fort community tutorial got me all the information a needed.  \n\nIf you are looking for a simple village management, I recommend Banished, it is not an expansive game and it delivers what it proposes to do.

Bro. Look, I really want to enjoy this game. I have had fun with it here and there, but for fucks sake, the AI just pissed me off to the point that I am uninstalling.

Yeah, it just died off completely because the blacksmiths were out FUCKING LOLLYGAGGING instead of doing their jobs. One blacksmith walked by a pile of iron and loads of stacked wood so he could go chop a tree. Like dude.

I planned out an impressive society, a stable society. But they just HAD to procreate like rabbits, forcing a population boom that killed them.\n\nI retain my suggestion: it is not really a bad game.

Today, I will tell you about Banished.\n\nSimple review details - I rank games on an out of 10 basis, granting up to 3 points in 3 categories, as well as a last, single point from my own self, depending on my experience with it.\n\nGameplay\n\nBanished is a GAME. What kind of game, you may ask? Well, it is a\u2026 A medieval city management game that has no ending. You, the player, are presented with a start menu. You, the player, click on the button that initiates the game, and, after a few selections - pertaining to size and difficulty - the game begins.\n\nA big area, square, is relegated for the city. And\u2026 That\u2019s everything. From that point onward, the player, you, must give out commands to their citizens, who can take up a multitude of jobs, from being a simple laborer to being a teacher, or a leather-worker, or a doctor. However, there comes the first issue.\n\nThe citizens are, much like real people, retarded. They have some kind of AI, but it is exclusively Artificial, and not intelligent, not one bit. They will use roads, if there are roads, so as to move faster, however, their approach to anything will not attempt to be optimal. Give them the command to gather resources from a certain area? They will travel to the furthest possible point of the designated area, and gather the resources from that location, instead of first gathering resources from the nearest area.\n\nGod, whether existent or not, forbid that you, the player, decide to designate ANOTHER area for resource exploitation, before the first area is fully drained. The idiotic citizens of the city, no matter how well educated, will behave like lemmings. As in, they will do stupid things, and everything will fall apart.\n\nIgnoring the stupidity of the citizens and the utter lack of control over them that you, the player, have, Banished is a neat game about city planning and management. The starting make-up of the city depends on the difficulty, but, unless you are a casual, 5 minute per day player, you ought to get on with the most difficult start ever - a cart with barely any food and 4 families.\n\nDirect your, the player\u2019s, citizens to gather resources. Tell them where to build what. Observe as they do so, and then find yourself wondering\u2026 Why? Only to then find out that the answer is simple. If not, then we die from the cold, or we are just unhappy and work far less efficiently, or we become so unhealthy we neither work well, nor do we live all that long. Leather-working? For clothing, to keep people warm while they\u2019re working. Smithing? For tools, to exponentially increase the productivity of the people. Houses? For housing, to exponentially increase the production of people.\n\nEverything in this game is reminiscent of that other game - Factorio - and it is almost all about efficiency. Build up a city, in accordance with what your citizens require - be it food, religion, or even alcohol - but do it in an efficient way, otherwise you will starve, even though you have food. You will find yourself being cold, even though you have firewood - the issue will be that it is simply too far, and the idiots, that are your, the player\u2019s, citizens, cannot understand that they need to go on a brisk, one hour walk, to reach the barn, and then they need to lug around twenty kilos of firewood, for another brisk, one hour walk, so as to keep themselves warm in the winter.\n\nThis game is great in the sense that it appears splendidly well suited for the so-called practice of 'map-painting', or, rather, simply the activity of city planning. In a sense, the player, knowing that there will be zero efficiency unless they, themselves, set out to create that efficiency, is urged, by the game, to get to work. The simplest means of describing this is that, as soon as the player gets to playing, they can start laying down the foundations of their city. In fact, if the player has enough knowledge of the game, they can just jump at the opportunity and get to planning out the entire city. The existence of a button that allows the player to postpone building structures, yet still place them on the map, is really pleasant.\n\nIt is one of the great things, I say, about Banished, this ability to just create a layout. Actual, proper planning, all the while the game is paused, and nothing is actually happening. The issue is, that\u2026 Well, until the player can get to that point, they need to spend a long, LONG time playing the game in the usual manner - which involves just slapping things down as they become necessary and being reactive in your, the player's, approach to playing the game, waiting for your food or tools or clothes or health or happiness to take a hit, which is when you, the player, will figure out that you need to place the appropriate building.\n\nIt is fun for the first\u2026 Thirty minutes, to maybe an hour, but then it becomes a little tedious. The player sees the growth of their city, and it is a very gradual growth, but it is one nonetheless. It is satisfying, knowing that, at the beginning, there was just a cart of stuff, and now there's a whole square, but\u2026 Well, this need for optimization bothers the player. After all, our human brains are manufactured in such a manner that they seek the most optimal approach to everything, as that means we utilize less energy, and the brain is made to conserve energy\u2026 So the player feels as though stuff COULD be more efficient, but, well, the means of making it more efficient really feels as though it's the exact opposite of satisfying, and much less, efficient. \n\n1/3\n\nRead the rest of this review (as Steam limits how long they can be) on my website:\nhttps://gemsimov.com/game-reviews/f/banished---a-review?blogcategory=Game+Reviews", "timestamp_created": 1654256050, "timestamp_updated": 1654256050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116385750": {"recommendationid": "116385750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125119563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4252, "last_played": 1689531353}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1654190258, "timestamp_updated": 1654190258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116383125": {"recommendationid": "116383125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052740071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1654186158}, "language": "english", "review": "game is very counter intuitive.", "timestamp_created": 1654186280, "timestamp_updated": 1654186280, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116365851": {"recommendationid": "116365851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221753216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2206, "last_played": 1687882940}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really fun game to play.", "timestamp_created": 1654151656, "timestamp_updated": 1654151656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116365039": {"recommendationid": "116365039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274503352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1688508812}, "language": "english", "review": "fun good sim", "timestamp_created": 1654149455, "timestamp_updated": 1654149455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116359190": {"recommendationid": "116359190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967376303", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31053, "last_played": 1697664458}, "language": "english", "review": "I have enjoyed Banished for many years.

You can learn tricks like deconstructing a house to kick two of the same gender people living in it out.  But you shouldn't need to do this, the game should know that you want a male and a female living together to produce children, especially if you are on Adam & Eve start.  But it doesn't know.  You have to know the trick and see it by clicking on each house individually, sooner the better.\n  It is also difficult to min-max in this game.  ie how big should you make your crop field?  Who fucking knows?  Sometimes one colonist can cover a pretty big field by him/herself, but when does it jump to 2 colonists max work?  What size field?  Want to know?  You have to look it up to figure it out because you don't want to have a guy plant like 1 tree and the other guy plant 49 trees (or produce way too much food and waste work time.)  \n  Stupid things can happen and it will ruin you sometimes.  For example, my educated gatherer starting colonist ate poison berries one day and just died.  Like what...?  Did they commit suicide, like that makes absolutely no sense.  How can you be educated and then go do that dude.  I like when bad things happen that also make sense.  Random fire?  fine it doesn't really give any reason, you don't do anything to cause it to happen but alright.  Do fires happen more often at higher weather temperatures or when you build wooden houses instead of stone?  I don't know lol it's probably just random, nothing specifies it so you have to just assume.  \n  There is no taking direct control of your colonists which is a real bummer for me.  The best you can do is force heighten the priority on the construction of anything such as a road or building.  But that's it.  And even that is super janky.  You can't que things up unless you know what you're doing.  No way to see builder que.  Builders will sometimes prioritize GATHERING RESOURCES instead of BUILDING even if it shows they are working on the construction of a building (3/3 builders) so they basically are invisible labourers.  You must figure out when this happens to fix it ASAP especially during the creation of a new colony, as not getting buildings up fast can ruin a colony easily.  And that's a pretty stupid way to have a pilgrimage fail.  Imagine the report.  The builders felt like gathering wood instead of making the fishing dock so it looks like they all immediately starved to death as soon as they ran out of potatoes sir.  They had the resources...  Why didn't they just finish construction?  \nAfter 152 hours I still don't really know how the que system works.  It seems that builders will gather instead of build if you que the removal of resources after the que of the build.  And that's just bad.  It shouldn't be happening and it happens all of the time.  I would let it slide if they were uneducated but it doesn't matter.\n  If you play with Colonial Charter mod (the dev's mod that they released) your game probably will randomly crash.  Leave it open too long and it will crash unlike any other steam game I have in my library.  Hate to do this but compare it to Rimworld.  I can play over 300+ mods made by random people and if you have some sense about it then it will work fine with 0 crashes.  This game is so janky that you can't even get it to run right with 1 mod active that the DEVS MADE which is ridiculous.  I don't ever have problems with games crashing so I am positive that it's the game and not my pc.\n  I know I have lots of hours on this game.  It can be fun but I would not recommend this game to people.  It's like you have to figure out how the game works to have fun with it.  You have to know that eating only one kind of food is unhealthy in this game.  You have to know how to get leather to make hides.  The animal pens were always exponentially stupid and a complete waste of a colonist's time. which is sad bc the animals look really cool.  You're 20x better off making one gatherer  than having a pig pen or chicken coop.  Dev mod makes things extremely unbalanced and that is kind of an important thing.  Basically if you build the wrong building or make your farm too big or pen too small or just some stupid thing it can make your colony fail in such an underwhelming way.  If you make a problem there is usually no way to redeem yourself except save scumming.  You fucked up.  Learn this dumb game mechanic to not fuck up and die next time.  \nAnd yea I have made lots of prospering villages but never can really decide what their specialty is.  I have to pick from pretty similar starts that get boring after a while and it's always make a trading place and you get what you get.  I feel like the game doesn't let me do what I want to do really.  small example is that you can only grow specific trees in certain climates.  So which climates are applicable to which trees?????  No way of knowing.  \nI want to like and recommend this game but it's just not good enough.
