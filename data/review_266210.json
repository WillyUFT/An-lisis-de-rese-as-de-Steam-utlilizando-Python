I believe I bypassed this by straight up copying one of the files in one folder and pasting it into the other.\n\nThe Plus Edition the definitive way to play the game, but I feel that the base game is easier since scaling is more busted and you can traverse mountains and water in 1 turn with certain builds/classes.\nIf you have to pick one, just go with the Plus Edition, but \n\nI just wish that I could get access to all the music tracks that they have as another DLC or music list somewhere, since I often find myself whistling them when walking on my own.\nThe music is all royalty free, but the quality and range of music is great in my opinion.\n\nGreat game, sufficient story to get invested in with a great soundtrack to suit every emotion.\nStrongly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1700703440, "timestamp_updated": 1700703440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150296878": {"recommendationid": "150296878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044240112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 631, "playtime_at_review": 3057, "last_played": 1700342532}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.", "timestamp_created": 1700247684, "timestamp_updated": 1700247684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149975975": {"recommendationid": "149975975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106579624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 151, "playtime_at_review": 4016, "last_played": 1699728316}, "language": "english", "review": "SO GOOD.\n\nI wish there were more games along this vein.\n\nThe story can get so deep.

Each class has their pros and cons; at first glance, the minor differences in each class seem to mean little, until you actually try the class out and realize that it actually makes a surprising difference in how the game is played. Compounded with the randomness of your circumstances with each run and the game continues to provide a (reasonably) fresh experience over an extended period of time. \n\nThere is a surprising amount of customisability afforded to the player; you can retrieve items from your vault (that you have accumulated over past runs) and allocate perks to your character to improve them in small but impactful ways.\n\nThe (important / hireable) characters you encounter don't get more than a handful of scenes to flesh out their characters, but they do inject life into the game. \n\nI think the best part of the game is its music. Each region / big boss comes with its own piece, and even after hours of gameplay and listening to the same songs over and over, I still find them pleasant to listen to.\n\nThe story is not particularly deep (and upon further inspection is actually kind of stupid) but I still enjoyed how the plot subverted expectations in ways I did not think possible. You are lead to believe that the big boss of the game is the demon lord (who, to be fair, literally chases you to the ends of the earth to kill you). However, this is not the case; as you play the game (or browse the internet), you would find out that the demon lord is not actually the hardest / final boss you can fight. \n\nPersonally I found the game quite enjoyable, and more than worth its price.", "timestamp_created": 1696666857, "timestamp_updated": 1696666857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147505321": {"recommendationid": "147505321", "author": {"steamid": "76561199476411790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1697935510}, "language": "english", "review": "I really loved that game.

The gameplay mechanics are relatively straightforward, with players needing to gather resources, upgrade their equipment, and manage their health and stamina as they progress.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of One Way Heroics is the way the game world is randomly generated each time players begin a new game. This means that every playthrough will be different, and players will need to adapt their strategies accordingly.\n\nThe game's graphics are simplistic, but they work well in the context of the game. The game also features a fantastic soundtrack that really helps to set the mood and create a sense of urgency and danger.\n\nOverall, One Way Heroics is an excellent example of a roguelike game done right.

Having to run away from a constantly encroaching screen edge, while still taking on typical heroic tasks such as slaying monsters, obtaining treasure, and in theory talking to NPCs sounded bizarre and challenging. The question is whether OW is heading the right direction, or if it's going against the flow of traffic and gets run over. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \nAs already mentioned, the objective of OW is to avoid the instant death effect caused by the black edge of the screen. This isn't a real-time hazard, so you aren't actively weaving through obstacles like a shoot-em-up. Instead it's turn-based, so you have to plan ahead, choosing a route and moving square by square, dealing with different barriers such as enemies, mountains, etc. The game is a rogue like though, so death is expected. \n\nEach time you die, you'll lose all of the items you acquired, though you can place a few into the dimensional vault for the next run. You'll also earn heroic points for how you performed during the run, which can be used to unlock new perks, classes, and expand the size of your dimensional vault. Unfortunately, you'll always start off as a level 1 noob, no matter which perks or classes you select for them. Additionally, unless you put it into the vault, your funds and starting gear is going to be weak sauce. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2937194404\n[h1]Controls[/h1] \nPart of the reason for my large gap in first trying OW and reviewing it stems from not having a compatible controller at the time. Therefore, I was making do with a keyboard, which isn't my first choice for most games. One downside to the game's design, no matter how you control it, is how often you'll want to move diagonally for optimal travel. It works alright at least some of the time, but when it really matters, I have to be very careful and selective with each movement. \n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1] \nLike many RPGs, the once peaceful land must deal with a great evil. However, this one is more meta than normal, but no less harrowing. The very edge of the screen is eradicating everything as it sweeps from left to right, and only by persevering through several deaths and attempts to build up strength will you be able to fend it off. If you clear the game multiple times, with several classes and allies, you'll uncover more of the game's lore. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2937194796\n[h1]Visuals[/h1] \nThe game makes use of basic pixel graphics, and they do the job.\u00a0Unfortunately, with everything so small on the screen, you spend more time looking for upcoming things of interest than characters or enemies. To make the tactics of this turn-based system work everything is built on a grid system, making environments have a flat, bland look to them. Something that really drains my interest in playing further is the lack of enemy variety; skeletons, birds, goblins, lizards, etc. How can you tell which ones are powerful? They've got a triangle over their head, \u201cOh no, we're doomed! That bat has one of the Triforce pieces!\u201d \n\n\n[h1]Sound Design[/h1] \nChecking on YouTube, I was pretty surprised by how many tracks there are for OW. I suppose the idea was that with no set place for any area type, such as desert, grasslands, or whatever else, multiple themes should be made that can be interchanged freely, \u201cPlay the second theme for grasslands this time.\u201d With the rate you'll progress to the right, you often won't stay in any place for too long, unless you're managing your inventory or bashing through a mob of enemies. However, each song is on the short side, which doesn't help with becoming too repetitive from looping. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2937194654\n[h1]Pros[/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f You can achieve specific goals if someone has a helpful world seed to share. \n\ud83c\udf1f It's a unique idea for a game.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1] \n\u274c The mini-map helps you avoid mountains or bodies of water (and lava), but unless you've used an item, doesn't tell you about upcoming forts or NPCs. It's hard to make progress or prepare well when you're ill-informed. \n\u274c Activities such as wandering towns, conversing with locals, etc. are absent from OW. These often aren't the highlights of an RPG, but they help build the world and set the tone. \n\u274c I already have enough factors to keep in mind without an energy system to mess with. Missing my attacks so many times also ticks me off. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d The game will announce when you're approaching certain thresholds and nearing the demon lord. Fighting enemies and increasing your level is one of the main ways to prepare for the fight. \n\ud83d\udd0d As long as you're not completely trapped against a wall or mountain range, you can push the limits of being near the darkness a good amount. Just escape when you absolutely have to. \n\ud83d\udd0d Money didn't seem that useful, as I didn't find anywhere to spend it. If you find a place that sells healing items, bulk up, as they're helpful for fighting the demon lord. \n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] \nTo this day, I don't think I've seen another game quite like OW, but there's a reason it's not generating copy-cats. Though it's unique and works well enough to compliment the developers' premise, it takes out much of what makes the two types of games it's based off work well. As an RPG, the combat is stripped down to a bare minimum, with a scant amount of options available. You lose the scope and freedom to explore a fleshed-out world and to learn more about it, its inhabitants, and even the monsters you fight. There's no way to develop lore about specific towns and locations with a game based on randomly generated worlds. It's possible to gain allies, but they're basically just extra attacks, not characters. Buried deep under several playthroughs may be a story, yet with no developed world or characters to care about, what's the point or value? \n\nLooking at the rogue like side, it has the general cycle down, as you get stronger and make more progress over time. However, much of the challenge is learning good routes to take and what random equipment you could find is worth a darn. The lack of more clear landmarks to reference doesn't help with navigating either. Plus, rogue likes often end after you beat the big bad or clear the final dungeon. In OW, you'd be expected to keep replaying with various classes, earning specific epilogues by meeting nitpicky requirements during the run. There's really no incentive to keep playing after beating the demon lord once except for the sake of playing the game more or unlocking achievements. It's pretty cheap, but I don't think it's really worth it. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]PC Specs[/th]\n[th]Performance[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Ryzen 2700\nRTX 2070\n16GB RAM\nADATA SSD\n1920x1080\n[/td]\n[td]The game ran without incident on default settings.\n\ud83d\udc96 - OW is healthy\n\n\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1677166483, "timestamp_updated": 1677166483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495647519826889038", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133106232": {"recommendationid": "133106232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987412456", "num_games_owned": 804, "num_reviews": 212, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 775, "last_played": 1676628183}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Nippon Roguelike i like.", "timestamp_created": 1676732722, "timestamp_updated": 1676732722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131825123": {"recommendationid": "131825123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352160021", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1693870401}, "language": "english", "review": "Roguelike and ARPG.

Addicting gameplay loop, amazing music, surprisingly deep amount of freedom / flexibility to play how you want. [/b]\n\nYou know when you can tell a game you're playing is a passion project? One Way Heroics is a clear example of that. It's also one of my favorite games of all time for many, many reasons.\n\nThis is a game presented in a simple package - move right, don't die, don't get swallowed by the screen scroll. In reality, One Way Heroics is much deeper than that. Even though you want to go in \"One Way,\" you're really free to play however you want. The classes give you freedom to play how you want - you can go for a pure strength build with the Knight, play with magic as a Force User, hoard items as an Adventurer, or rely on your party with a Bard (and this isn't even half of the classes in the game). There's no class-locked weapons, so you can also wield whatever you want. Want to kill NPCs? You can even do that too (with consequences, of course)! There's even different ways to win the game... but I'll leave that for you to explore!\n\nEvery run, win or lose, also feeds into future runs - it's a roguelite, after all! This game's implementation of the roguelite formula is really cool. Aside from your standard class / perk unlocks, there's also a \"Dimensional Vault\" that lets you store items in-between runs. The obvious use for this is to carry powerful items over to your next run, but you don't have to use it (and you get bonus score if you don't use the vault)! I personally use it as a \"trophy case\" for storing the many unique items you find in the game. I'm also currently carrying a set of armor across multiple runs and stacking enchantments on it to make the best piece of armor ever. There's a lot of cool stuff you can do here!\n\nOne Way Heroics is also a pretty funny game and it doesn't really take itself too seriously, which fits well with the overall simple style of the game. The music is also stellar, and I'd argue the soundtrack itself is worth the full asking price of the game. \n\nI've played 50 hours of this game so far and I think I can see myself playing at least 50 more hours - I still need to unlock some hidden classes, master the harder difficulties, and try winning in different ways. There's also some online components to the game - every run is a seed and ANYONE else playing online can see progress from other players asynchronously! There's daily and weekly runs in the game as well (as well as daily runs with unique gameplay modifiers)!\n\nOf course, I have some criticisms. I wish there was more item variety across the board - after playing a while I tend to see the same stuff over and over. There's also been some moments where I felt the game was a little unfair - strong enemies spawning too early, for example. I think I just need to shift my strategy on consumable items I keep around for emergencies, though. Additionally, the game's QoL is apparently really bad if you don't have the Plus DLC, but I've never played it without Plus.\n\nAll in all, there's just so much in this game to play around with and it feels like the developers really cared about the fun factor when making it. Please get this game, ESPECIALLY if it's on sale - if you like roguelites, the Mystery Dungeon series, or fast paced RPGs, you will not regret it!\n\n[i] As a personal note - I really want to see this game's community revived in some form. I've been buying the game for whoever I can and I hope I can contribute to the community in some significant way. Maybe I'll do weekly streams of it where everyone can play together?

It seems simple at first, but the player constantly makes choices that dictates the character's future - including and especially from the beginning. The game is kept fresh with regular challenges, a story that evolves with each run you complete, and constant decision-making on the part of the player.\nSomehow, the game can get you connected with the characters, despite the fact that, by nature of constantly restarting the game, you are constantly back at \"step one\" in learning who the characters are. Perhaps my investment in the characters is derived from how rare they can be to encounter - running into a recruitable character with enough charisma to recruit them is amazing, and running into them without the means to recruit them (either in charisma or in [spoiler]the ability to break them out of what amounts to a stone death trap[/spoiler]) is somehow both disheartening (because you can't recruit the character) and encouraging (because restarting will eventually give you another shot).\nSeed-based world generation means that you (and your friends!) can play and replay the same map as many times as you want. For what is basically a mystery dungeon game, this is neat, as you can use your accumulated knowledge to make movement decisions that you otherwise wouldn't without the foresight. Alternatively, if you want a whole new seed to play on, it's as simple as generating a new random world to save. The game can be played how you want - if you want to try a single seed for 4 hours in a single day, go for it! If you want to make 10 minutes of progress a day, you can do that too. Want to beat easy mode in under 20 minutes? Unlock [spoiler]hero[/spoiler], stack [spoiler]the unarmed damage upgrade[/spoiler] at the start of the game, and you have a quick and easy run.\n\nOverall, One Way Heroics is a fun experience. Expect to die, [i]a lot[/i], but with so much replay value, you can find yourself playing again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1640672052, "timestamp_updated": 1640672052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106566064": {"recommendationid": "106566064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039608940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5933, "last_played": 1698112089}, "language": "english", "review": "So there I was, in the tundra, starving to death. Having just dealt with a horde of bears and skeletons, my health was in the single digits. My energy was 0%. I was surely to die in my next encounter. A few hours and kilometres pass, and there were no villages or monsters in sight.\n\nBut as luck would have it, a rabbit appeared. I smacked it dead with my sword, and consumed its flesh in the cold winter night. Its meat was rancid and I was poisoned, but it filled the stomach and restored some health. Two steps later, a member of the One Way Heroics PETA organization stood before me. She knows what I have done. That horrifying midi piano music played, and she began shooting arrows at my general direction. Still low on health, I had no choice but to stop time and bash her head in, killing her instantly.\n\nAfter the encounter, I found a tavern. I was already on a bounty list, but they didn't recognize me yet. I walked over to the chef for some food, and I managed to restore some of my life and fill my hunger. I decided to buy take out. My inventory was full, so I had to throw away something. But instead of politely dropping an item, I accidentally threw a dagger. Directly at the chef that just fed me. The entire tavern--the guard, the merchants, the fortune teller, and even the save receptionist--became hostile to my presence. I had no choice but to kill them all to preserve my own hide.\n\nAs I was slaughtering the people of the tavern, a group of polar bears surrounded the building. The big one started to claw into the walls with each turn while I struggled to murder the people of the tavern. After I killed the last of the people, I now had to deal with the roided polar bears that approached me. But before I could land the first blow, the Demon Lord appears. In a panic, I stopped time yet again to equip my staff and repeatedly barraged the bears with flames. Their meat burned and became grilled, and I consumed their cooked flesh as I turned their bodies into sweet, nutritious, BBQ. The leftover meat that wasn't cooked I gathered into my inventory, which I then grilled using the portable BBQ set in my inventory, and immediately consumed.\n\nMy health restored, my energy now at max, 2 more roided bears in front of me, and the Demon Lord behind me. I can survive this encounter. I had confidence that I can even defeat the Demon Lord as well. I grilled the remaining bears and brought out my secret weapon: the Holy Dagger. It had one durability left. So I threw it at the Demon Lord to free some space for grilled meat, and break his many barriers.\n\n... But it missed. And ended up hitting a dragon. And that dragon was, to put it lightly, pissed about having a dagger thrown at it. It took a deep breath and blasted both myself and the Demon Lord with a beam of fire. Again in a situation where I cannot possibly survive another turn, I decided to stop time and run away while I could, eating some grilled meat to shrug off the damage I've taken.\n\nAfter some distance of running, the Demon Lord left, and the dragon eventually stopped being pissed. Then I walked 10000 km to the right and finished my run.\n\nIn short, 10/10 it's okay.

This 'tiny-in-file-size-but-big-in-replayability' game is a rogue-lite: rogue, meaning misbehaved, lite meaning only somewhat.\n\nRogue-lite games are games built around two core concepts 1) that each session is a self-contained episode and 2) some progress from a session which previously ended in your death will carry over into your next session. Typically, these unlocks can be character classes, weapons, equipment, or character upgrades. Games like [i]The Binding of Isaac[/i] are considered Rogue-lites.\n\nThe core concept of [b]One Way Heroics[/b] is that you are ever-marching onwards to your inevitable death. A wave of death edges ever closer to you in real time as you move. Advance far enough to the right, the screen will scroll. But retreat too far back, and you'll find that the screen only scrolls one way: forwards.\n\nThis game does work on both controllers and keyboards. I found I enjoyed this most when played on a controller/gamepad -- the cheerful 16-bit artwork makes it feel like a long-lost classic from the days when NetHack was still ASCII and when the MegaDrive was king.\n\nCompared to the cheesecake that is Nethack, [b]One Way Heroics[/b] is M&Ms. You always tell yourself you can control your portions, but by the time you check your watch after starting, you've eaten the entire childrens' haul from halloween and it's 4AM already.", "timestamp_created": 1638940816, "timestamp_updated": 1638940816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105192829": {"recommendationid": "105192829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208078171", "num_games_owned": 711, "num_reviews": 538, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1556212934}, "language": "english", "review": "Kind of boring and didn't really like the flow of it.", "timestamp_created": 1638599637, "timestamp_updated": 1638599637, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477202802896499634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104462269": {"recommendationid": "104462269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105785707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 309, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1638320846}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very well polished, and so cheap that you will probably buy it without even noticing.\nI don't really have anything bad to say about it except that it's so minimalist and generic that...I don't really see the point, unless you're a 8-bit fetishist or something.

You must go east as the darkness approaches from the west. It is a roguelike RPG where you can pick from classes and talents but ultimately at the end of the day the goal is always the same, save the world. With lots of endings and options to choose from, it makes a good attempt at rewarding hard labor, especially with unlockables and secrets that really flesh out what appears as a deceptively small box of a game. \n\nQuite frankly, I think it's a shame this game is so obviously limited in scope. I feel this game with a full production from a larger company, with a larger budget and resources to get there, would make for an amazing experience even in modern gaming. I ultimately rushed through finishing this as I love the charm and had a great time, but even a few hours in you have a good idea of just what you're gonna get out of this. While that's not particularly a bad thing, it does mean that I wish there was more to it, as it has many great ideas from mechanics to the very scope of the game's setting and the characters that inhabit it.\n\nIf there is anything this game surprised me with, it's just how invested I got into the endings. Normally endings are just a matter of doing X before Y, but this game, albeit it short and simple, had characters and twists that genuinely entranced me, and I would be lying if I didn't tear at least a little at some of the endings. While I could say more, I will simply leave this one up to you to discover, as I feel the narrative of this charming little game is fully worth the exploration. \n\nAll and all that about sums up my experience with One Way Heroics. I first played this game in 2015, and just now game back to finish it in my everlasting pursuit to clean up my library. While I may be moving on to something new, I'm sure there's an adventurer or two who can set up shop and take back the world in my place.

Also it's nice to see a game where the boss isnt immune to everything, so you can get creative.\n\n\n\nAfter spending FAR longer playing the base game, I can say that it is certainly a quality game and well worth playing despite it's age. The randomly generated biomes, loot around the world, locations of towns, and just a  merchant chilling in a field really make the runs different (for better or worse) And most importantly, the game works. Over 200hrs without a crash, making the bonus for completing a run without saving possible to do. Alt tabbing in and out of fullscreen to my heart's desire with no problem. (On dx11, I tried dx9 and crashed immediately.\n\nThe game makes you swap around weapons and armor as repairing is extremely limited, unless you jerry rig your gear which then makes it break faster. Managing your inventory, the durability of your gear, weight of a weapon vs. it's power, and the 5 times you can stop time can all make the game stressful. Each decision can make or break you. \n\nUnfortunately, some decisions aren't yours to make as the game does have it's flaws. The map and health bars are very much in the way of the game, and the off screen detection arrows are done quite poorly. The text of your active effects can block your map (using area map and detection always does). These are changed in the DLC but in my opinion, you shouldn't have to buy dlc for a HUD adjustment option. \nFurthermore, the generation of buildings and their doors is infuriating. Their are occasions when, by the time you see the location of the door, it's too late to go in, missing out on a merchant that could've helped you. Or, more frustrating, when the doors are facing mountains and you have to bust your way through. Even if you're an Adventurerer or Hunter class, you're not climbing those mountains quickly unless it's leveled up enough. In that case, good luck getting through with a dagger or bow.\nAnd then, there are the NPCs in the towns. They are not safe from monsters. There are \"guards\" at each village and town mostly, and they will threaten you if you do anything. But any monster can go into a town and murder every NPC and these guards will do nothing unless they are within 1 tile of the enemy and only if the enemy targets them. The random spawning of NPCs that can be your companions are also unsafe from the world's monsters, as you get the \"to the > you can sense a kindred spirit\" just to see that they die 3 turns later with absolutely nothing you can do about it.\n\nJust a few flaws, but far too annoying to go unspoken. It's a good idea to start with the base game before just playing the Plus DLC.

For a sale price of $1 or $2.98 for it and it's massive expansion DLC, it's value you'll seldom find on Steam. If you like roguelikes or tactical fantasy games, BUY IT.[/b]\n\n[i]I bought this game during the Halloween sale because it was only $1..[/i] I've had this wishlisted for years and for some reason never got around to playing it until it dropped on my Nindie Switch. Bought on that console and freaking LOVED it \n\nthough Devs.. \n\n[b]if you are reading this the fonts on the Switch aren't legible. Really need to increase the text so we can enjoy this game on that system because as it stands its near unplayable. [h2]Please fix![/h2][/b]\n\nGot a little derailed my bad. So yea, I finally bought it on PC after enjoying it on the Switch. I guess the fact that I struggle to read the text on the Switch made me want to try it on PC so I could fully enjoy the game then found it on sale. Rest is history. \n\n[h2]Gameplay is superb.[/h2]\n\nAt first, you might not appreciate the game right away. It feels and looks like something out of RPGMaker. In fact it could be, who knows. There's also a bit of confusion to be had when after making your toon, finding a world to play in. Your first run will mostly likely end terribly but it's at that point you'll start to see the beauty. \n\n[h2]Getting ranked on each run.[/h2]\n\nInsanely fun and offers a bunch of replay value trying to beat your previous runs and get those 'S' ranks on all the categories. \n\n[h2]Upgrades. Lots of upgrades.[/h2]\n\nAfter you die, depending on how you did gives you points to use to unlock new classes, storage space, abilities and more. Gold coins will drop (a separate currency) which you can use to upgrade things in the actual game world itself. \n\n[h2]Replays.[/h2]\n\nYou can save videos of your runs to re-watch later which I thought was super neat. You can also post your stats and replays instantly to Twitter via in-game for those who like to share there stats with the world. \n\n[h2]Worlds to explore.[/h2]\n\nEvery new run you can pick a new world to play in. Some are basic, some advanced and some can be played with other people around the world. Up to you on how you want to die to play. I mean..try to play :)\n\nArtwork both static images and pixel art are above average and look great. The sprites are mostly adorable and pleasant to view. \n\n[b]However, this game isn't without faults. Let me throw those out.[/b]\n\n1. Resolution is garbage. At default this game is something like 800x600. It's tiny. They allow you to change it up to full screen using configurations outside the game but the problem is, it just stretches the 800x600 to fit. What happens is you have 2 large black rectangles on each side of your screen (dead space) and the game itself is noticeably worse looking. Even then, text and things can be hard to read.. It's 100% worse on the Nintendo Switch though, it's nearly unplayable. \n\n2. Default controls are bad. Playing with a controller is much much much better than kb+m. \n\n3.Navigating the menu's is cumbersome, especially while playing. It can be quite confusing those first few runs trying to figure out the menu's and where everything is or re-binding hotkey's. Over time you'll figure it out and it's not terrible but definitely leaves a lot to be desired. \n\n4. Music while what little there is is serviceable but I do wish there was more as it becomes quite repetitive. After only a couple runs I muted it and turned on Spotify lol\n\nMight be forgetting something but those are my main gripes with it. Overall this game is a solid roguelike and for the price it's a steal if you are into these type of games. I can tell I'll be putting many many hours into this title both on PC and on the go with my Switch. \n\n[h2]It's charming, hard as nails yet insanely fun and rewarding.

You generally have lots of breathing space and just can't grind endlessly in one place. The left-hand side of the screen is more of a factor when you find a building; as you need to reach the building, and get to its door, and do everything inside, and get out before the door drops off the screen. This can be less than enjoyable when buildings aren't always highlighted on your map and the game's randomness can make the door location very inconvenient.\n\nWhy I would recommend the game is that it offers quite a bit of progression in improving your starting character; and the game's presentation and design has quite a few commendable ideas.

Its story and gameplay is pretty simple but with how the levels are made and the different variations of each character, it allows for hours and hours of simplistic, fun gameplay for the beginner and seasoned veteran of rpgs.", "timestamp_created": 1585798455, "timestamp_updated": 1585798455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65906425": {"recommendationid": "65906425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038179737", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 979, "last_played": 1478453004}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, I have way more hours on the non-Steam version tho", "timestamp_created": 1585282980, "timestamp_updated": 1585282980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477298170328140259", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65705548": {"recommendationid": "65705548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062686283", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1547, "last_played": 1700526327}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty unique take on the roquelike formula.", "timestamp_created": 1585054733, "timestamp_updated": 1585054733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65678631": {"recommendationid": "65678631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878492935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 7939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3323, "last_played": 1597743751}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of content.", "timestamp_created": 1585021496, "timestamp_updated": 1585021496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65248325": {"recommendationid": "65248325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056282672", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1568, "last_played": 1650683014}, "language": "english", "review": "for a 3 dollar game, it's got way more content than it has any business having.

The base objective for winning is to defeat the Demon Lord, who will generally pop up to fight you after certain amounts of time has elapsed and retreat in a bit if neither is dead. There's a couple of other winning conditions available, but it's definitely a spoiler. The Plus DLC adds some alternate campaigns to fighting the Demon Lord, which increases the winning conditions even more.\nThere's a simplistic hunger system(energy, but you can't die from not eating, just severely weakened at 0 energy), weight/inventory management, and of course tile-based turn based combat.\n\nOn the topic of the DLC, One Way Heroics is like the base game, with OWH+ acting as an expansion pack. OWH on it's own is a pretty completed game, but the DLC adds some balance changes, new events and companions, and a few new playable classes. It also adds a \"true\" ending to the game.\n\nThere's a bit of interactivity in the game with other players, as you progress in a world seed, you can leave brief preset messages as some of your current stats are shown to the other players on a side bar. You cannot interact with any other players as each session takes place in its own instance, but when a player dies, a NPC ghost may show up in the other players' session, and talking to them will drop a copy of an item from the fallen player's inventory on death.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the game is fairly simplistic, all action can basically be boiled down to four main points, 1. Attacking, 2. Talking/Interacting with items/NPCs, 3. Movement. 4. Using items. The talking/interacting is incredibly simple, in fact, attacking is the same button as talk. You can't normally attack townspeople if you're in talking range if you aren't already a criminal. That said, your class, item usage, and equipment management can let you play in a couple different ways. Class skills and the classes in general are more diverse in the DLC, and were pretty similar in the base game last I played.\nIn addition, the game runs very smoothly, turn transitions can happen near instantaneously, which honestly spoiled me on my experience compared to Mystery Chronicles: OWH. The fluidity of the game in the original OWH(+) was just too good.\n\nAnother note, for a roguelike, I feel the game is pretty fair. You very, very rarely die random unpreventable deaths if you're properly prepared (like actually bothering to wear decent armor, or not walking around without paying attention). Some progress for unlocks carries over between sessions, and you can even bring along inventory items/equipment into a vault from one run into another upon completion/death, or just for collection purposes. You can even save the game on an adventure, with a second separate save system in place if you need to close the game so you can play it later. That said, I've never saved in the game before, so I'm not too sure how they work.\n\nThe game has 4 difficulty levels going from Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard. There's also a special modifier called \"Maniac Mode\", which turns the game into a strictly turnbased game. Without Maniac Mode on, you can reliably get several turns in before an opponent if you have a high enough Agility stat. Easy mode (Walk in the Park) forces you to fight the Demon Lord in a way unlike the other difficulties, as the Demon Lord will NEVER run away on Easy mode, essentially forcing a fight to the death.\nThere's a hidden epilogue available in the DLC if you manage to get a certain alternate win condition on Easy mode that isn't in the base game.\n\nThe music in the game is pretty good, I've had a couple hours on the game with just the main menu theme open. Probably because the OST is freeware, this has allowed the creator to include a wide variety of tracks in the game, with even more in the DLC. I believe there's over a hundred tracks in just the base game. The sound effects are pretty simplistic, nothing too special about them.\n\nThe graphics are mostly pixel graphics, with drawn portraits for certain important characters. Everything in game is easily distinguishable at a glance from the graphics. Some people may not feel the drawn portraits are especially pretty and a bit \"sketchy\", but I think they're quite charming, as are the characters they depict.\n\nWith how often the game goes on sale, I would definitely recommend people to pick up the game and give it a shot. Definitely get the DLC if you enjoyed the game, but I wouldn't tell you to grab it without trying the base game itself first, as the additions aren't drastic enough to turn it into an entirely different game.

It seemingly looks like a JRPG but isn't one of those. You are moving from left to right beating up enemies and discovering loot for around 1-2 hours until you will meet the endboss. Tactical combat is the focus of this game. Turns take place simultaneously, meaning that whenever you perform an action so does the enemy at the same time. Executing an action will also impel the left side of the screen to move towards the right. \n\nThe screen scrolling mechanism is not a cheap gimmick but actually significant and refreshing. Once you fall out of the screen it will be game over. There is a fair amount of risk assessment involved, do you want to go through that mountain pass and taking the risk being blocked by enemies where the screen will catch up with you? Do you really want to explore that dungeon? You might get stuck in there long enough for the screen to catch up with you. The screen scrolling also prevents you from grinding to high levels by staying in one specific spot and forces you to move forward and using your skills. \n\nLevels are randomly generated which contributes a lot to the replayablity and music is outstanding. My only gripe with the game is that a lot of content is hidden from plain sight, you'll need at least finish the game once before unlocking rogue-like features like item transfering, character unlocks and minor story-like quests. The DLC is highly recommended since it adds a lot of content to the game.

When those mechanics click this game becomes more than the sum of its parts, please don't take it at face value like I did.\n\nThe story while sparse is again more detailed than it might appear at first. Characters reveal more about who they are as you journey across the land and even those that might seem tropey at first evolve in one way or another. But what is truly brilliant is that this isn't done through heavily scripted cutscenes or lengthy text walls but through a clever mix of:\nDialog that hints at the character's backstory, while allowing the player to fill in the blanks.\nGameplay, this is nuanced and difficult to explain in full so i\u2019ll try and keep this short. \nAs you travel many kilometers across the land, constantly dogged by a world spanning darkness, fighting powerful enemies and interacting with townsfolk, companions become a consistent comfort. \nThe battle system furthers this with an ingenious though small detail, facing enemies head on will never result in your companion taking damage. But if an enemy attacks at your exposed back or side, they take the hit instead. \nThe damage is split 50/50 from the side but from the rear your companion will take the full brunt of any attack. This can imprint a pretty primal message into the player; \nYour companions have your back, they are willing not only to fight at your side but also to die for your sake, they will allow you to use them as a shield. \nI've never seen a feature like that in a game before.\n\nPhew, that was a lengthy paragraph but I think it's a feature worth mentioning in full. \n\nGameplay is turn based but by no means slow. \nThe game's world is split into hundreds of invisible squares, your character taking up one of these spaces. With any given weapon you can attack in a 3 by 3 circle around you, unlike most rpgs one hit is usually all you need to eliminate an enemy, but depending on the class one-two hits may be all that's needed to end you. \nAs you progress enemies will get tougher and friendly npcs more uncommon. This creates an engaging risk and reward dynamic, a dungeon could provide great gear and xp needed for later areas, but with such a tight health bar I found myself either avoiding encounters or tiptoeing through dungeons, making use of corridors or bottlenecks to funnel enemies avoid getting surrounded. Likewise as you go on the stakes continue to rise, with enemies getting tougher and your gear getting damaged. \n\nThat's by no means everything but maybe it will inspire interest :) \nThe classes are often different enough to create different playstyles and experiences.\n\nI adore the music, it's reminiscent of older final fantasy titles while maintaining its own identity and substance. \n\nIn conclusion this game is a miniature marvel and well worth your time and money. Compared to most other rpgs it doesn't waste your time and for just over 2 bucks you really can't go wrong, I'd say go for it it full price and definitely look at the dlc - it enhances the base experience in many ways.", "timestamp_created": 1546557815, "timestamp_updated": 1546557815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522008240222930908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47815030": {"recommendationid": "47815030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296872531", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1251, "last_played": 1656812662}, "language": "english", "review": "Skip to  the bottom if TLDR\n\nMusic: 9.0\nAfter booting up this game.

So addicting it kept me from playing the game for a solid 10 minutes.\n\nGame Play: 8.5\nAs far as Rogue-likes go, this game, I love how easy it is switch your play-style on the fly. You can choose the Walk in the Park mode to give you 400 KM to grab loot and level up or choose the harder setting with the final boss, popping up at you randomly.  I can sprint past locations or take my time and try to get a little loot here and there. There's also the Lessons to Learn from tips you can see if you die. They rank you on how well you did and that ranking currency goes towards buying more game play options. You can beat a run in a little less than 30 minutes. Each run will be different. As you play more you'll unlock different character classes and you'll be able to mix and match their perks you unlock as well.\n\nStory/Characters: 8.5\nThe townspeople usually fall into a handful of different jobs and dialogues. However, the rare heroes that you find along the way do spice up your journey. Once you recruit them, they'll have some pretty memorable dialogue with your character. I like how the character silhouettes get filled-in each time, you discover a new character.\n\nOverall: 8.8\nI loved this game for its simplicity.

Though it has a developing story and unlockable elements, unlocked by helping certain npcs, defeating the evil demon king and preventing the everso swallowing darkness.\n\nInto Detail:\nEvery two steps/actions/turns (except \"free actions\") you take the darkness moves one space. This way the game gets it's own dynamic and urgency of decision-making. Will you go into that fortress and try to loot it? You may need to crush a wall in time, because the exit will be swallowed by the darkness once you got the chest. Once the darkness reaches you it's instant game over.\n\nThere are classes and perks to unlock, some perks will give you a boost, while others can be chosen to increase the difficulty. The DLC let's you expand the starting castle (+ new stuff like 2 classes), which is a nice little twist on unlocking new content - just remember it will only be there every playthrough for a couple of turns before it gets swallowed by darkness. Nothing lasts forever...\n\nThe NPCs are quite interesting and have some interesting backstory, though due to the rogue like element those stories are thin - which doenst make them less interesting.\n\nPersonal note:\nI really appreciate the graphics and I am quite intrigued by the story, the setting - overall the game!

So you can't ever fall asleep you just keep walking and eating things to give you energy until you get strong enough to kill some dude.[/b]\n\n[h1][b] Gameplay [/b][/h1]\n[b]Simple is sometimes better, but unlike many other streamlined games this one manages to maintain some level of depth.[/b] \n\nAlthough it's rather easy to hit things with basic attacks and moving around can be done by all but the most braindead, somehow this game manages to have more depth than many other 'hard' games. This is a kind of game with a gimmick I've never seen before and one that fits immensely well with procedural generation and rogue-lite elements. And although it can be pretty hard from time to time, it's very doable and almost never cheap shots you.\n\nThere are a lot of games out there that claim to be hard as a sort of selling point, but more often than not they're just using cheap tactics to kill you off. Darkest dungeon is one of those games where it doesn't respect your time and pushes you through a slog of mud for the sake of extending playtime. Dead cells is another game that does this, but many overlook it due to it's surface level combat and movement mechanics. And while both those games feel great, it's just skin deep. This game is much closer to Xcom levels of tactics where you aren't pigeonholed into certain builds.\n\nOne way heroics has a very wide variety of combat tactics and styles ranging from just running up and slapping everything to death to taking everything turn by turn and resorting to throwing your items at enemies just because you can. It also largely benefits players who are more thoughtful about how to approach a situation over those meatheads who rush in and spam buttons. I adore this. Though you can still occassionally just spam attack and win against enemies depening on your gear.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1471022397\n\nAnd to make things even better there's a lot of stuff to do. It's super odd considering that this game is literally pushing along a path that feels narrow, yet it's also non-linear. See a dungeon? You can go inside it if you want. And you can even bash down the walls. But be careful! The ever looming threat of the wall means if you get stuck inside you might lose! And I must say that I'm very surprised with how aware the game is because every single character gets an ability that stops time for a few turns. Careful use of this ability adds another layer of thought to it all since it could mean the difference between a game over and a victory.\n\nI'm not really sure I think ANYTHING in this game is bad. I suppose the game isn't too careful with monster scaling. I vaguely remember that my very first game I walked out of the castle into volcano lands. A bear then walked up to me and killed me. Frustrating for me, but then I just made a new world and it was grasslands. At that point the game showed me what it could be.\n\nThings to note, there is item durability for weapons and armor so if you don't like those things it could be a non-selling point for ya. There are also shops, foreign lands, class customization, rogue-lite elements (after death progression), scoring, a system for you to build your starter castle(a bit), unlocks galore and you can even change your sprite/portrait if you like! I showed this in the opening .gif of a portrait a friend made and a sprite I made.\n\n[h1][b] Graphics [/b][/h1]\n[b]It's pixel art.[/b]\n\nFor the most part it's pixel art. There are a few full character portraits, but I honestly rate those kinda meh quality. The art style is nice though for sure. The clouds passing overhead is a nice touch and adds a constrast of something moving to the otherwise motionless land. There could definitely be more too like wavey grass, snow, rain (NEEDS RAIN AND MAYBE THUNDERSTORMS), breezy trees, different types of trees and really a lot more.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1471028358\n\nWith that said, even in it's 'basicness' it's still good. Not amazing, but good. I do very much enjoy most of the character portraits especially the C knight. And as I said I like having the ability to do customer sprites/portraits. I almost always play with them changed.\n\n[h1][b] Sound [/b][/h1]\n[b]It's rather average.[/b]\n\nThe music is a least a tiny bit memorable, but really nothing I'd write home about. The sounds are all very fitting. Slashing for slashing. Thrust for spears and like crashing smash for slamming with axes. Mostly fits. Just not really the big focus of the game though. I do enjoy it enough and listen to it when I play.\n\n[h1][b] Story [/b][/h1]\n[b]Strangley enjoyable.[/b] \n\nI would've liked it if I could have done more with [spoiler] the demon lord[/spoiler] but really there's a lot here that may take you by surprise. Following in line with it's unique approach, the story is unique as well. Unfortunately a lot of it is spoiler heavy so I can't say too much. It's a non-standard story and that's really all I can say. Though I am not going to hype you up about it because it's not extensive. I'm actually very much NOT A FAN of most anime oriented stories and prefer western stories, but I like the art style of anime. With one way heroics the story is more tolerable, albeit still presented in a way that I'm not enthused about. \n\nThere are many endings to the game including one where you don't technically win or lose. They're based on who you pick up for your limited space party. Weirdly enough I didn't experience any of the other character's stories until I beat the game like 3 or 4 times. I didn't even know they existed for a while nor did I know of any of the hidden endings. So here I'll tell you that there are a lot of different endings and there are some characters you can find along the way who also have stories to go with them. Now ya know.\n\n[h1][b] The Company [/b][/h1]\n[b]Not much to say.[/b] \n\nI don't know much about them except that they tried to release I guess a sequel to this game, but it didn't do too well. I'd like to play it A LOT, but I seen the reviews for it and they're disappointing to say the least. Seems odd to try and release a sequel that's so much like the original, but what do I know? Anyway I'm neutral towards them.\n\n[h1] In Conclusion [/h1] \nThis is a game for thinkers and explorers.

Its got charm, depth and for its price its an absolute steal.\nBest played with the expansion (One Way Heroics Plus).\nYou can pick both up stupidly cheap on a sale.\n\nThis is the sort of game where its just fun to be playing it and you don't really have to achieve anything.\nThat being said there are still plenty of things to aim for, new classes to unlock, secrets to find and challenges to complete.\nMost fun in short bursts, do a run or two then leave it and come back later.\n\nDying can be frustrating but you are never left feeling that there was no other options or that you exhausted all possibilities. It doesn't really suffer the from the \"run doomed because bad RNG\" problems that some similar games have, but at harder difficulties it doesn't go easy on you either and you will be running from some fights just to survive.\nSome runs will have you near death constantly making use of everything you find on the spot yet getting you further than you have before, where as others may have you overburdened with good stuff trying to decide what to hold onto then blowing it all on a desperate fight with a miniboss and regretting it later.\nIt's best played at harder difficulties though, the moments where you are trying to minmax every turn just to survive are where the game shines the most.\n\nEven though it is pretty basic looking, it has quality where it counts. \nAttacks, items and spells are well animated, sound impactful and are always satisfying to use. \nEquipment and skills are also well balanced and offer interesting choices and trade offs, for example swords combo more but do less damage than axes which are heavier and have less accuracy but can also chop through walls and chests, spears hit at range and pierce through walls/enemies and while they are not as durable they tend to be lighter.\nHeavy armor can be better defensively but may also slow you down and the weight reduces precious inventory space compared with light armor which may also offer evasion, better spell defense or extra bow range etc.\nClasses have variation within themselves and can be played differently depending on what perks you choose, equipment you find, skills you pick up, companions you meet etc.\nTake the Hunter for example, primarily a ranged character who uses bows. You can go for the classic glass cannon who uses the range attacks to kill stuff before it reaches you but will die quickly in a melee, you can make a more durable and agile spear/shield user who uses combo hits with hit and run tactics or you can mix it up wielding a heavy axe in one hand and throwing arrows and items with the other, weakening enemies before they reach you then finishing them off with a big axe hit while using your speed to make sure you don't get flanked. You can even try some more experimental stuff like focusing on Vitality so that you regenerate more life while you are kiting which lets you save precious healing items for when you really need them. You may choose to focus on one thing and end up doing something else just because thats what this run gave you and discover a better build as a result.\n\nIts one of the better \"rogue\" style games and if that's what your looking for you can't really go wrong with this.", "timestamp_created": 1532491302, "timestamp_updated": 1532491302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43680985": {"recommendationid": "43680985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121963747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4740, "last_played": 1571404694}, "language": "english", "review": "considering i spent 80hours getting the epilogues and stuff all that time spent was amazing the experience i had and the music together with it created a magnificent experience that i just really love and would come back to at any other time when im bored of all these complicated games and just want to play one game that brings much more content than almost any other game its amazing and therefore i reccomend to buy this together with the DLC which unlocks even more features and especially for that small price", "timestamp_created": 1532269527, "timestamp_updated": 1532269527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533037304878234863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43592604": {"recommendationid": "43592604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076629909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1068, "last_played": 1614304251}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game for the price in my opinion.

This feature makes you prioritise where to move, which buildings to enter (since you can get caught in them if you're not careful), when to fight enemies or if it's better to just run away. \n\nAnd it works. Even though the game is turn-based and you can take all the time in the world to decide how to approach the different situations you just can't do everything and this actually makes the gaming experience lighter than your typical old-school roguelike games. One Way Heroics is closer to rogue-like than rogue-lite but it truly bends the boundaries here and I hope it gives fresh ideas to other devs aswell.\n\nDuring you first couple of hours the plot might feel vague and the gameplay a bit shallow but this is a game which rewards many tries and many playthroughs, and opens up bit by bit to keep some surprises in its sleeves.

Now there is more beyond that but let's not get into spoilers. That's all you need to know to start off. Music is fantastic and sets the tone, while the sound effects give everything weight. The graphics meanwhile evoke a 16-bit feel to them, while at the same time not feeling completely retro.\n\nBut like a lot of games, what you mainly come here for is the gameplay. Staring off with the base two classes, you can unlock five more. Each class plays differently, from the defensive oriented Knight, to the powerful Pirate, the magic of the Force User, etc. Each time you can name the hero, choose a gender, and choose multiple starting perks that you can unlock as you play, most of which are stat bonuses and others give bonuses to kills or even add an animal companiion.\n\nIn addition to all of this, you never truly wind up playing the same map twice unless you want to. Essentially any comination of letters and numbers, even pure gibberish, can result in maps. There are ones set up for daily challenges, specific ones people have found for achievements, or you can just make up your own. I've explored areas named after my wife Susan, and one named after the classic film \"Aliens\". Note that nothing thematically changes, but its just cool that you can put in whatever and get a unique area. \n\nWhen you complete a map, either by dying or winning, you get a ranking based on how well you did, and get \"Hero Points\" for your efforts. These can be used to unlock classes, additional perks, expand your storage to hold more items over between runs, and more. Those of us obsessed with unlocking everything will have a field day.\n\nOh yes, and there are multiple difficuly settings. So if you find its getting too easy then crank it up. Oh and once you \"beat\" the game, you're not really done since there are multiple endings, and you find there are multiple ways to succeed. I won't say anymore; go find out yourself, trust me. And get the expansion while you are at it because its more of teh same and that is always good.\n\nWell, from here, only way to go. The \"add to cart\" button.

If you do though, starting back up in the same world or a new one is pretty easy and rewarding.  I'm reluctant to call it a rogue-like since it really isn't like rogue, and beyond that, these days who's actually played rogue?\n\nMusic is pretty solid, and the art style is fine/cute.  Never had a problem with any of the translation in game.\n\nAnyway, the usual stuff.  A smattering of different classes, equipment, enemies, terrain/environments.  The big thing that sets OWH apart is that the game features a crawling 'darkness' that is sweeping across the land - from the left side of the screen to the right.  Since the game is turn based it only moves when you move, and depending on some settings, the speed can be mixed up.  Think of it as playing 'The Neverending Story' with The Nothing creeping up on your heels... if you know the movie anyway.  Darkness catches you - you die.  Makes for some interesting gameplay because you have to prioritize your actions, fight monsters to level up, go digging for loot, all while trying to keep pace and stay ahead of the darkness.  One major positive for me is that the game tends to 'play fair' with a lot of items and status effects.  It doesn't fall into the \"but that character is a boss/powerful!  X is useless!\" kind of stuff.\n\nReally easy game to sink quite a bit of time into, and it's rewarding as well.  While each individual character will either succeed at their quest or die trying, there are elements in the game that allow you to carry items forward to new characters, or to progress in different ways; unlocking other classes, starting options, etc.\n\nBest of all?  It's a really cheap title, so it oozes value for money.  If it doesn't wind up being your jam, I suppose you could always refund it, but you won't need to get that much playtime out of it to justify the purchase anyway.\n\n\nFor the negatives:\n- It is a highly repetitious game, so if you're not into that, this game is definitely not for you.\n- Even after playing the game a lot to figure/find out all the story elements, it's nothing to write home about.\n- The random nature begets replayability, but the way this is fashion can result in you getting totally and completely unfairly screwed.  Doesn't happen that often, but something to be wary of.\n- No full screen/widescreen if that bothers you.\n\nAll in all, this one is a keeper for me.  I still come back and play games of it from time to time because it's really easy to just crack one off, and it still manages to be fun.", "timestamp_created": 1511425898, "timestamp_updated": 1511425898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36938277": {"recommendationid": "36938277", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970743304", "num_games_owned": 1037, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1586, "last_played": 1511488428}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth every penny.

Greatly recommend it. Here's a bit of a breakdown:\n\n*Graphics: It's your standard basic NES/SNES overworld view with some portraits that arent great but are good enough. Portraits seem to be the extent of the artwork. It's not meant to be beautiful, but it doesnt really take much away from the game itself. \n*Music: It's fantastic and it's worth the time looking for it and downloading it (don't worry, it's free, hence it couldnt be packaged into a DLC, which I would've gladly spent money on). No, really. The music is beautiful and outstanding, reminescing of SNES era. Especially the game recap/clear data tune and the loading screen. \n*Battle system: Simple hack and keep moving. Simple item usage. Simple magic using if you can get to it. A bit bothersome to get to the menus to cast magic or skills, but hack slash is a click away. \n*Gameplay: Controls are very easy, mechanics are simple, objective is clear from the get-go. Menus are a bit cumbersome as mentioned previously. Other than that, it has some neat mechanics like the dimension vault where you can store some valuables to use at your next rebirth. Perks are nice to have, and all classes have a plus and minus, they feel fairly balanced. I can axe walls with my mage, or cast fire with my pirate. It's a joy to play. \nDifficulty: Up to you. It has several modes you can play, and though I've only been playing on the Easy mode, I haven't found it too bad. I still die if I'm not careful, but not like I am struggling to survive... except when all of my weapons break at the 375km mark and the evil lord is about to show up. Without the dimensional vault, it can be slightly challenging, but MUCH easier if you do use it to store valuable weapons and equipment. \n*Story(?): Well, it's very simple really. Run from the darkness before it gets you. I've read the more you play the more you get to know what's going on (what's the darkness? Why are you the hero? Who's the evil lord? Why at 402km?). I'm not there yet, but it doesnt bother me not having 200 tomes of history shoved down my throat as I am just trying to get by. And get by you must, or darkness will get you. \n*Replayability: I havent beat every single aspect, but I aint even mad when I do die because I wanted that treasure and my weapon breaks in the middle of a dungeon and darkness gets me.

In a game like Mario or Castlevania where you normally get to explore or measure your movements, scrolling forces you to think on your feet and act under duress. As tends to happen in this eclectic genre, someone took that concept and applied it to the traditional roguelike formula. But rather than simply turn a stressful game design into a pressure-cooker, One Way Heroics expands on every aspect to produce something unique, engaging, and addictive.\n\nThe Land of Generic Fantasy is in peril, and the evil Demon Lord is to blame. For any other game this would get an eyeroll from me but here the drama plays out over dimensions, not continents. Each world is threatened by an inexorable wall of darkness that moves ever rightward, consuming all in its path. Only by defeating the Demon Lord  can the darkness be stopped, at least in that particular dimension. With little time to prepare, you must scour the land for equipment and allies before running afoul of your nemesis in a climactic final encounter.\n\nDon\u2019t let the ceaseless march of oblivion put you off, because this is a traditional roguelike at heart and that means everything is turn-based. You can sit there as long as you want, staring at the unmoving void or frozen enemies, all waiting for you to take your damn turn so they can get back to terrorizing the land. That time will be invaluable for planning your moves, especially if you get cornered in a dungeon being consumed by the darkness or end up stuck behind a mountain range. It\u2019ll also give you time to use your special abilities or consumables you\u2019re inevitably going to hoard your first few runs.\n\nOnce you get a feel for the game, staying several steps ahead of the murderwall will be of little concern to you. Instead, you\u2019re going to have to come to grips with the off-beat progression system this game has. If you\u2019re coming off other traditional roguelikes you may be expecting a fair spread of weapons, armors, and consumables spread across the land for you. On good days that\u2019ll be the case but One Way Heroics has no qualms with denying you any of those, even simple foodstuffs necessary to keep your heroic avatar chugging along. New gear is extremely sparse, food items need to be bought if you hope to keep a reserve of them, and enemies rarely drop anything besides some modest coin. Even treasure chests hidden away in dungeons or lakes must be bashed or lockpicked open, and so are worthless without a special skill or plenty of time to get through their unexpected defenses.\n\nThe game\u2019s uneven power curve will keep this from appearing much of a problem for awhile, but soon enough you\u2019ll run across a minotaur or a golem or just a really beefy bandit who explodes you in a hit or two. I\u2019m sure your first few deaths will be quite sudden, and the game is nice enough to advise you post-mortem about how to improve your chances. You\u2019ve got some powerful innate abilities to overcome tough monsters and tight spots with the darkness, and you\u2019ll need to use them freely to get through the sudden difficulty spikes. The bright side of the difficulty curve is that it\u2019s still easy to learn and overcome, and once you start sticking it to the Demon Lord the real fun can begin.\n\nOne Way Heroics does more than stick a pursuer onto the roguelike formula. The dimensions your adventures play out in aren\u2019t just called that for kicks, they can have wildly different topography, unique landmarks and treasures, or powerful house rules like no leveling up or no item drops. Every time you start a game you can pick a new random dimension, a specified dimension, a dimension you failed to conquer before, or one of three daily challenge dimensions featuring those wild house rules. And this is on top of the numerous character classes and unlockable perks which can start you off with handy stat boosts, extra skills, or even a pet. Plus there\u2019s the dimensional vault which lets you carry over helpful items from one world to the next.\n\nIt\u2019s the simple fun of running riot over a fantasy world in short sessions, mixed with an expansive backend full of unlocks and game modes, that makes One Way Heroics special. That key one-more-round appeal is here in full force, taunting you to try again every time you get crushed by a skeleton or devoured by the darkness. There\u2019s something to be said for the unique presentation as well, a veritable circus design of windows, text panels, indicators, and progress bars. It can be daunting and downright ugly at first, but after awhile even that starts to feel comfortable and familiar.\n\nThe graphics are certainly not a strong point of the game, featuring basic RPG tiles, tiny sprites, and a disappointingly bland palette. Nor is the sound design of much note, though it succeeds in capturing that JRPG upbeat heroism as you travel from fields to deserts to tundra. But it fortunately lives in a genre dominated by ASCII art and silent combat, and besides none of this stops the game from just being flat-out fun. One Way Heroics starts out with a bold gimmick and builds it into a vast and entertaining experience, one that gets deep hooks into you once you learn how it all works.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The premise is simple: move to the right else you will fall prey to an encroaching \"Darkness\", find loot, wreck face. It is turn-based, where each move and action -- such as equipping a different weapon, using an item, activating a skill, or attacking -- takes one turn, during which the Darkness also moves to the right and monsters are free to move and take action too. Explore the land and vanguish enemies there, but watch out for cute animals! Explore dungeons and vanguish the tougher enemies there, then break the treasure chests for loot, but make sure there is a way out or else you will be trapped against a wall by the Darkness (or perhaps you can break the wall...?)!\n\nLike all rogue-likes, each run is different and death is permanent. Whether you win or lose, you earn hero points which can be spent unlocking new classes and perks, or expanding your \"Dimensional Vault\" -- in which you can store one item from each run to use in future. There are several difficulties, and you can further challenge yourself by assigning a whacky loadout of perks (or none!) at the beginning of a run. You can even play with others in the same \"dimension\" (i.e., seed-generated world).\n\nNot gonna lie: the UI takes some getting used to, and it can be really frustrating losing in such a (remedially!) simple-seeming game, at first. But then you become comfortable with the UI, and realize that although the game itself is simple to learn, there is a lot of room for polish and finesse in your gameplay. Accumulating these small advantages and converting them into a win is very satisfying. In addition, the game itself, though challenging, is [i]relaxing[/i] to play, probably due to its turn-based nature and excellent sound track.\n\nWatch some let's play videos.

Essentially a rouge-like, but very unique, It's an action RPG with very lite turn-based elements. The whole goal is to keep moving right as the entire world is engulfed by this black wall of death. Fighting monsters along the way, leveling up, finding new gear, and eventually battling the demon lord.\n\nYou start each run by picking a character class and up to 3 starting skills. You then get to choose from a list of worlds to join. Some are harder or offer different challanges, you can join up with other players or even use the random seed generator. Playing the game at first might seem weird, but it is fun. The game and enemies don't move until you move, attack, or use an item. Although, I still consider this an action RPG because of how fluent you can move, it almost does have a real-time feel to it. It seems like the whole turn-based element is only there because it has an in-depth system with skills and inventory management. It actually makes the game more interesting because you can play it at your own pace. \n\nLike mentioned, every time you move so does the black fog destroying everything in it's path, forcing you to always move right. This adds a lot of strategy. Knowing when to fight monsters or maneuvering around obstacles and terrain to pick up items, all while managing a hunger meter and conserving energy. Along the way you'll encounter several NPC's. Being able to buy, recruit, identify items, or save your game among other things, but even they are not safe from the death mist. Leveling up is simple and automatic to specific character class, but you are given opportunites to trade stats at certain points. You can also upgrade weapons and armor, and use various scrolls, abilties, and a wide array of items. After a certain distance traveled you will face the demon lord. Prioratizing a well built character is key to survival, and when playing on harder difficulties there is no telling when the boss will show up.\n\nWhen you win or die you will be rated based on your performance with a quick recap of your entire playthrough. You get points to spend on more skills and characters. You also get a vault to store some of your best items to help better your next run. The vault is universal for every playthrough, but taking an item out is only for that specific run. This is a good way to level up weapons and armor by playing multiple times, as long as you don't allow the durability to break. Another cool thing after winning, is you can see other players stats and progress that also beat the same world, even when using a random level seed.\n\nWhat I originally considered a hidden gem has turned into one of my favorite rouge-like ARPG's. The game even has a deluxe dlc which adds tons more content, similar to how much Binding of Issac Rebirth added. Even though it has a very Japanese feel to it with the story, the gameplay is superb.

Heck, I'd pay just for the music!  I started playing this years ago, and still enjoy playing it to this day.  The basic premise is that your character is fleeing a world consuming darkness and looking for a way to stop said darkness.  This is hard to learn at first.  As you progress, the story continues to deepen with each milestone until you uncover a complex and engrossing plot.  Eventually when the player has mastered the movement and the rhythm of the game, then the real interesting parts start.  Classes unlock, you learn how to survive with different classes and play styles.\n\nYou will die.  You will die often.  You will die stupidly, wondering why you did something that dumb.  You will learn, and then you will start to win.  Each victory brings you closer to uncovering what's really going on, and each death can contribute to your survival later on.  Many hours later you'll probably look at the clock and wonder where your day just went.\n\nDo yourself a great favor and get the plus version of this game.

If you are consumed by the darkness your run immediately ends, resulting in a forced sidescroller type game. It's actually quite intuitive, and the game teaches you to adapt very quickly. Expect to fail a lot in the beginning.\n\nThe system is subtlely brilliant in that it requires you to play in a number of different ways. Even if you make mistakes or a bad situation RNGs itself upon you, you can use your resources to play your way out. And if you do make a mistake that is actually fatal, it will definitely feel deserved. \"Bad luck\" is more often the result of ill preparation and poor management.\n\nTo make the game more interesting, there are various objectives and classes to choose from that vary the play experience. Additionally, you can choose from different 'perks' in order to build your character how you choose, or to even make the game more difficult for yourself. \n\nEach of the ally NPCs in the game are charming to look at and have their own unique personalities and dialogue. I won't spoil any of it, but the bonding process and backstory of the game that slowly comes to light through them is a delightful experience that adds a lot of color to the game. The art is handdrawn from the looks of it, and is pretty refreshing to be honest. Sprites are mostly what you'd see in RPG maker games, seeing as how the original engine is based off of Wolf.\n\nI won't say it's impossible to get random'd (darn teleport pills), but the decision making in the long run is what makes the experience. If you want a challenge, try tougher win conditions on harder difficulties! There are many ways to customize your run, so you can adjust the edge as much as you like.\n\n\nThe least satisfying thing about the game is probably the content. This is remedied quite a bit with the Plus Edition DLC, which I STRONGLY recommend for the sake of balance and expansion. If you are playing vanilla and you don't think it's enough, I definitely think Plus is the way the game is meant to be played. Of course, this means shilling out more $$$ for a more complete game. However, purchasing Plus not only supports the localization, but the original developer of the game as well.\n\n\nThis is a really quick RPG roguelike experience with an easy to understand system, but it comes with a surprising amount of depth that's fun to explore. Daily worlds make completionist goals much easier, and adds a bit of fun to the game by comparing your runs with other participants in Online mode. \n\nAt the very least, I would recommend giving this indie classic a fair try. If you can get your hands on Plus, the game is priceless.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499232442, "timestamp_updated": 1499232442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718588411808013916", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33146168": {"recommendationid": "33146168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095061579", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1602092108}, "language": "english", "review": "A really fun game that has more content than most expensive game.

Seriously game devs as a joke you should put a Game Over for anyone who just sits at a Goddess Alter for 10 minutes, listening to the relaxing music. \n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. Move right so as to avoid getting swallowed by the darkness, which is advancing from the left. It seems simple enough but you can actually end up in situations where you get stuck having to go over mountains or through water which in turn could result in a game over as the darkness gets you where it wants you (or an enemy takes you out). As you move to the right you'll fight enemies, find items scattered about (I wonder who left all these goodies for us players to find), you'll find killer wolves that want you dead, you'll find towns that offer a moment of peace, oh and you'll find the Demon Lord who wants you dead. You're ultimate goal is to prepare for a fight with the Demon Lord who is master of the darkness consuming the world. \n\nThe game also uses seeds to generate the worlds you play in.

Wash, rinse repeat. That is how the general gist of this game progresses. There isn't a whole lot of depth to the game, there aren't many weapons, aren't many variations of enemies, no characters you really connect with, the map areas are general generic type fanatasy locales, and no real story line (other than to stop The Darkness) which is stated in the opening 3 seconds of the game. However this game has something going for it... charm.\n\nIf that sounds silly just run with it for a moment. There is very little to do, or really unlock that can't be done easily. Unlike the game that drew me to this (Faster Than Light) you can unlock everything in nearly 5 hours, the remainder of the time will be playing with these unlocks. However the goofy commentary from the few NPC's you do find are enough to distract momentarily from the humdrum of walking to your right. That is where this game gets its charm from. The constant breaks in the basic mechanics of the game for a fun, light hearted gab between pixelated characters.\n\nFinding all the secret endings and characters endings will be what make you come back to this. The small morsels of charm that you get are what will make you enjoy coming back to it. However, don't expect to be able to play this for long periods of time. I found that the game is best when played a few run throughs at a time. Any longer than that and the charm kinda wears off and the simplistic nature of the game robs from its potential.\n\nAdditional peripheries were pretty decent as well.

You attack monster by running into them, and your stats determine how much damage you do, and how much damage they do to you.\n\nThis is pretty standard for a roguelike, but One Way adds in a twist: every time you move, the screen moves a little to the right. If you get caught on the left edge of the screen, you die, so you always need to keep moving forward. Not only this add to the difficulty, it also ensures that every run moves at a good pace: there's no time to loot or backtrack when everything in the world is disappearing on the left side of the screen.\n\nOne Way Heroics uses permadeath, so if you die, it\u2019s game over. Fortunately, a successful run in the default mode only takes about 20 minutes to complete, so even if you die right at the end, you (usually) don't feel like you've lost a lot of time. You also have the option to keep a few pieces of equipment from previous runs, so if you die right after finding a great piece of equipment, you can carry it over to the next game. The difficulty is also balanced very well. I was able to beat the game after only two or three attempts at the easiest difficulty, but there are several difficulty levels above that, with each one being significantly harder than the last.\n\nOverall, One Way Heroics is a solid game. The different difficulty levels offer challenges to players of all skill levels, and the randomly generated worlds keep every run feeling fresh.

It's the only way the original creator gets money. More details near the end of the review.[/b]\n\nFor something that seems like it'd be a small, simple little game, One Way Heroics has a [u]lot[/u] of staying power, especially for its low price. After 100 hours of playtime, I'm still undertaking new challenges, discovering new things, and polishing my survival skills. There's also quite a bit more story than you'd expect from the game's description; each recruitable party member has their own backstory they'll slowly share as you progress through a run with them, and each has their own unique ending (and a few have more than one). As you do more things and undertake harder runs, you'll also learn more about the world, such as the true nature of the Darkness enveloping everything, and even how it affects the land after it has done so. Resultingly, there's even more endings based on how you go about stopping the Darkness, and generally, the more difficult of a run you complete, the better the endings you get tend to be, ranging from \"We stopped the Darkness... but at what cost, and what's really going on?\" up to [spoiler]effectively becoming a demigod with the power to truely change the fate of the world and its inhabitants[/spoiler].\n\nIt can be fairly hard to \"win\" a run early on, though it won't be long before you've polished your skills and learned enough tricks that the Demon Lord isn't terribly hard to defeat. If you're having trouble, I've found that the easiest difficulty isn't always the easiest place to get your first victory, as unlike other difficulties, you can't just run from the Demon Lord if things aren't going well. Unlocking more perks and classes also helps a lot, and one of the easiest builds is available early on. (If you feel you need the help, it's: [spoiler]Grab a ton of Pro-Wrestler on the Swordsmaster, and punch everything to death.[/spoiler])\n\nThe One Way Heroics Plus DLC is along the lines of an expansion pack; adding more classes, perks, party memebers, items, more challenging runs, and essentially just more of everything, like any good expansion pack should. As stated earlier, it's also the only time the game's creator earns money from the game, as the Japanese version of the base game is actually free, and the price for it on Steam only exists to pay the translators (who have done a very fine job, by the way. I've yet to find any issues in the game's translation). Eventually, when the game became really popular, the creator added the paid One Way Heroics expanion, both to update the game and to have a way to earn money off his creation. So I strongly recommend buying the OWH+ DLC, even if you haven't played before. Even with the added cost, the game's still an incredible value; almost criminally so when it's on sale.\n\nAll in all, the game is a hidden gem that's far better than the price point would suggest. As cheap as it is, there's no go reason not to grab it, and makes a great choice for using that last bit of cash in your Steam Wallet, or funds you've gotten from selling trading cards from other games.", "timestamp_created": 1480403105, "timestamp_updated": 1480403105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28026727": {"recommendationid": "28026727", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996401077", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1460855135}, "language": "english", "review": "I adore this game, so much so i've bought it dozens of times for people on my friends list.

Force users generally have to prepare a few turns in advance to avoid taking unnecessary but have unmatched power and can annihilate most targets in a single hit, heroes have little difficulty charging straight in head 1st as long as they don't get surrounded and pirates tear through most walls with ease and can swim through lakes effortlessly, making their own paths. You'll have to play a bit to unlock them all, but sooner or later you'll probably settle on a favourite - for me it'd be the force user. But I've played them all a fair bit.\n\nThere's also numerous endings and rewards depending on how you complete each run and who as. Maps are procedurally generated based on a seed and there is a variety of unique classes to play and companions to find to keep each run feeling different for quite a long time.\n\nControls are re-mappable and parts of the UI can be re-positioned too, among other gameplay control behaviour settings under options on the main menu. Partial mod support allowing replacement of class-specific images to whatever you want.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\nGameplay is turn-based but fluid (e.g. if you hold right you'll just keep running with the turns merging together) with an advancing wall of doom (the darkness) from the left side of the screen. The goal per run is simple - defeat a boss such as the demon lord when it turns up or reach the end of the dimension.\n\nThis fluid turn based nature means you can rush along avoiding enemies and then suddenly take it slow when they get close enough to be a threat to minimise the damage you take by ensuring you get the 1st hit...or if you're playing the hero class, probably just continue charging straight into them in most cases!\nIf it's too slow for you, there's even an acceleration key to speed up animations and make turns move even faster.\n\nThe advancing darkness will speed up to keep a maximum distance if you push against the right side of the screen and will just as happily kill your enemies (and friendly NPCs/following allies) as it will you - even the demon lord will retreat from it!\n\nFriendly NPCs will turn on you if you commit crimes (primarily murder, but some will hunt you down for killing endangered animals too) in front of them and if you aren't charismatic enough to offset your bounty then future NPCs that are normally friendly will attack on sight too.\n\nEach individual run can be short or long depending on what you aim for but there are save options so that you can quit and come back later when necessary as well so it can played whenever without needing to set aside a minimum amount of time.\n\nThe game is primarily single-player, but there is optional (can be disabled in the menu) online community interaction in the form of ghosts (when other players die in that dimension one of their items will be available via their ghost) and an event log for the current dimension showing where everyone is, including some manual interaction options if desired - this works with all seeds but there's a set of campaign seeds that change on a regular basis as part of the online features as well.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nWell, see the screenshots/video on the store page - there's not much to say other than that. There's nothing impressive here, but they're certainly not bad either.\n\n[b]Music:[/b]\nPlenty of good tracks with quite a variety too, changing with the different areas mostly - they're all available for free online, but they're spread out quite a bit. One of the optional castle characters in the DLC allows you to pick a track for the 1st area of each game.\n\n[b]OWH+ DLC:[/b]\nThe OWH+ DLC adds:[list]\n[*]3 new classes - Force Knight, Ninja and Tourist.\n[list][*]The tourist is a very weak class that comes with their own special run completion method.[/list]\n[*]A castle upgrade feature to improve the starting area with numerous benefits.\n[list][*]The castle also includes access to some new unique campaign options and to a new special terrain with new bosses and endings/rewards for all classes.[/list]\n[*]Numerous UI improvements including hotkey assignments for using items\n[*]Lots of new items, NPCs, skills/force powers, etc\n[/list]\nThe base game is still available with the DLC installed and the saves are separate, OWH saves can be imported into OWH+ with a few caveats that the game informs you of.\n\nFinally, there are some balance changes - both buffs and nerfs (in some cases to the same feature but in different scenarios just to make it harder to abuse said feature)\n\n[b]Value for money:[/b]\nWell, the base game is a steal even at full price for the amount of content included, and with regular 75-80% deals you don't get much better value for money without being completely free.\nThe DLC is lower value for money than the base game but is still more than worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1480021819, "timestamp_updated": 1669151512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27264954": {"recommendationid": "27264954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322297274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1672, "last_played": 1485431681}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game. \nit's worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1480011048, "timestamp_updated": 1480011048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27256932": {"recommendationid": "27256932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020270543", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 800, "last_played": 1604105864}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice game to pass the time!", "timestamp_created": 1480009616, "timestamp_updated": 1511819345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27238285": {"recommendationid": "27238285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061938080", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1368, "last_played": 1613755233}, "language": "english", "review": "Achieves a surprising amount of depth with very little complexity.

Featuring some simple but readable graphics, it's also not too difficult. With a lot of replayability through multiple endings, multiple difficulties, classes, and challenges, it's a simple game that'll provide a lot of hours of gameplay.\n\nThe art is a bit anime but it's pretty toned down. I don't think anybody will really strongly hate it. \n\nFor gameplay, it's a pretty well balanced game. Obviously as a roguelike theres a degree of inventory management and there aren't many instances where I felt like the game deprived me of a resource leading to me losing only because of RNG. All the classes are unique enough to give each a different playstyle, a pirate has different strategies than a swordmaster, a hero can take on enemies differently than a bard will. \n\nThere's also a surprisingly deeper story to the demon lord and the darkness, it really never is the highlight of the game over saving the world, but there are some more hidden endings.\n\nI'd strongly recommend anybody who enjoys roguelikes or even wants to get started to try OWH. It provides a perfect mix of difficulty for people who want something to ease into playing roguelikes, and people who are masochistic enough to seriously enjoy the hardest difficulty. And with how low the price is, it's really not a tough choice to just pick it up.\n\nThe expansion OWH+ is also recommended as it effectively triples content through new npcs to meet, more endings, new items, rebalancing, a new postgame mechanic(Which is more just more QoL stuff), and improving QoL/UI.\n", "timestamp_created": 1479981624, "timestamp_updated": 1479981624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48888888955116272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27065485": {"recommendationid": "27065485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004253070", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 4282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4156, "last_played": 1561725774}, "language": "english", "review": "Good roguelike game, with cheap price and high replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1479973809, "timestamp_updated": 1479973809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27057813": {"recommendationid": "27057813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972337172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 349, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1562133250}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I felt that this encouraged repeated playthroughs without being frustrating -- I usually got a decent sense of advancement/accomplishment from a session.\n\nThe standard price is, what, under $5?

I'll elabore below.\n\nI'll start with the bad things i saw on my first minutes.\n\n[h1] Negative [/h1]\n\n[h1] - [/h1]   [b] UI [/b]: At first you will be overwhelmed by the UI, lots of stuff you don't know of, and weird position (I'm still not used to having a map in middle of the screen).\n[h1] - [/h1] [b] Everything looks so small [/b]: The graphics are distant, but you'll accustom to it pretty easily. F4 (window size) will be your friend here.\n[h1] - [/h1] [b] \"Chatbox* [/b]: System info can be hard to see (the thing that looks like a chatbox) and you can't (or i haven't seen/found such feature) really scroll it up in case you missed something.\n\nAfter my first few minutes, i was able to withstand the things i was concerned from. All thanks to these pros.\n\n[h1] Positive [/h1]\n\n[h1] + [/h1] [b] Soundtrack [/b]: The music is amazing. Each area has its own music and you'll be used to hear them pretty often, but the thing that i enjoyed the most, was event music.\nEach event has a different soundtrack, and that adds a nice variety to your ears.\n\nI'm just talking about design here, but the quality of the soundtrack is also amazing.\nArea music matches pretty well with the environment.\nEvent music matches with the element of surprice and the feelings you may have while thinking your next move.\nLore (game over / special characters / victory / etc) music is nice, you won't feel that it's out of place or that it affects negatively to what's going on.\n\n[h1] + [/h1] [b] Story [/b]: This one can be subjective. I love with all my heart the genre of medieval fantasy. You'll find a few clich\u00e9s, but there is also room for nice plot in between. I won't say which kind of plot, but it was worth it, even tho i kinda like all medieval fantasy plots.\n\n[h1] + [/h1] [b] Replayability [/b]: I'm pretty serious with this one. I make sure to not buy any game that can't offer a good replayability.\n\n[h1] Please understand that after this point, i'll tell some stuff that even tho it's not a spoiler, it counts as stuff that is nice to see for yourself. You don't have to see all the game features in order to see if you'll enjoy it.\nAfter this point i suggest you to try a demo or buy it and play it for as long as you can refund it in case you don't like it. [/h1]\n\nFollowing the replayability...\nYou have different classes, each with unique skills, strenghts and weaknesses. At easy difficulties it isn't that big of a deal, but if you want to beat the game on the harder difficulties, you'll have to make good use of each class' strenghts.\n\nAfter beating the game, next time you pick a class, you'll see a medal based on the difficulty on the class that you beated the game with.\nA nice replayability factor is to complete the game on every difficulty with each class. And...\n\n[h1] + [/h1] [b] Randomness [/b]:\nAs long as you keep playing on different realms, you won't have the same experience.\n\nIn case you are not that hardcore of a player, you can still repeat the last realm you played, and thus, having another try on the same encounter/environment.\nStill, some stuff will be randomized, like items, monsters, treasure and such, so it won't be that boring, you almost won't feel like doing exactly the same.\n\nThis is getting too long, and i can't leave my games waiting for too long. So i'll jump to something i found average.\n\n[h1] Bipolar [/h1]\n\n[h1] +/- [/h1] [b] Save system [/b]:\nYou'll either love it or hate it. But you'll have options either way, remember that.\n\nThere are three ways to save your adventure (which can turn out to be some pretty long and hardcore expeditions).\n\n1. Find a save attendant.\nA young elf will offer a save feature when you find her. I won't say much more, that's up to you. But you'll be able to find her pretty often.\n\n2. Save stone.\nA crystal used to save the game. Save attendants sell it, but you can find one in your adventures if you are lucky.\n\n3. Goddess gift.\nOnce in a while, a goddess will offer a save option at the cost of 5 levels.\n\nDid you see what's so different here?\nAll saving methods include finding something. This is not a game you can start and leave every 8 minutes. So no gaming at work i guess.\n\nPersonally, i love this feature. I like to have to save some money for save crystals and use them wisely. As i said, you'll either love or hate this.\n\n[h1] +/- [/h1] [b] Load system [/b]:\nThe game allows you to save > try > fail > load > try again. It's kinda expensive to do it often, but you can.\n\nI don't like this, and i'm not the kind of person that can avoid to use an advantage when i see it. That's why i like unfair traps and the lack of Easy/Normal difficulties.\nEven tho i never play on Easy... If i struggle a lot on normal, i'll consider it.\n\nHowever, this system is also good in case you are not a hardcore player and you get too frustrated by dying because of a single mistake. (Like unequipping a shield and forgetting to equip it for the tough encounter.)\n\nThat's all, i need to go back and play more games.

Whatever, it's not important.\nThis game, One Way Heroics, is exactly that. I play it on and off, and every time I play it, it's just as good as the last. It's fun, it's lighthearted, it's frustrating, and it's a game that's worth every penny that I paid for. Hell, I've paid for it multiple times, like I said, this is my third account with the game. Not to mention every time I've bought it for my friends. It generates the world as you go along, so even though there are similarities, no two playthroughs are the same, unless you play on the same seed as your friend, or you retry a seed.\n\nIt's challenging. I had to grind up a lot of gear to be able to beat the boss, it took me a while to be able to do that, but in the end it was satisfying. Then, when I finished that, I went ahead and beat the boss on the harder difficulties. Then when I finished that, I played the second campaign.\n\nWAIT, YOU SAID THERE'S A SECOND CAMPAIGN???\n\nDamn right I did. It's in the DLC.\n\nWTF DLC THIS IS 2016 I DONT WANT MICROTRANSACTIONS!!1!\n\nI will break your fucking jaw if you open your mouth again.\nThe DLC is 7.79CDN and that's more expensive than the base game. You know why? Because the DLC has more content than the base game, imo. It has a new class, you can customize your castle, there is the new campaing, new biomes and dungeons, etc. It's just incredible how much content there is in it, and it's safe to say that the DLC kept me even more busy, figuring out everything.\n\nBut that's not all, at least like four times a ear, the game goes on sale, along with the DLC for like 75-80% off. At a dollar, you really can't go wrong.\n\nHonestly, this game is the game you're looking for. It has your oldschool JRPG graphics, a unique take on the sidescroller, amazing soundtrack, a kinda generic and dull story, but it gets made up by the sheer amount of gameplay in this game.\n\nSo shut up and buy the game already.

I was blown away by the in depth story and the diffrent charecters that you could encounter, and did I mention the soundtrack? They would make a fortune off that alone if AGM Playism put it up for sale (I don't know if they are selling it on like I-tunes or something of the like. I'm mainly refering to a steam realease). This game will surprise you in how much charecter it has, but I must recomend you play on AT LEAST afternoon stroll to get the full experience. Party members are mvery importent, and each have there own story to learn, but are mostly locked on walk in the park. And the multiplayer feature can be interesting for long runs. \nBut to shorten up the message in a recomendation:\nShould you buy the game? \nYes. Its very cheap for the ammount of good content you are getting.\nShould you buy the + DLC?\nYes. It not only improves the orriginal gameplay, it also adds in one of my favorite Party members that you can gain.\nShould you buy the Sequal!?\nWoah, don't get ahead of yourself. I just found out about it today and haven't gotten to play it yet! So I have no idea yet! But other reveiws I read said new players should at least play the original first, so thats all I have on that topic right now.\nBut as I said before, I am but a lowly gamer on this wide earth.

The main thing which set its apart than other roguelikes is the side-scroller aspect -- the world is constantly moving to the right, and you lose if you don't move along. \n\nThere are also some important aspects which are a bit anti-roguelike. One is that there are \"save crystals\" which can be used to save your game, but they felt more like an option for casual players -- the game seems balanced for permadeath play. Another aspect is that, after your game ends, you can store some of your items in the \"dimensional vault\", and use them in your next games -- this goes a bit against the traditional roguelike style, where your every game starts exactly the same as your first -- and when you win, you know that you won because you have learned the skills, not because the game became easier. However, I don't see it as a problem in the case of this game.\n\nOne problem I have with this game is that it does not run in Linux -- I run it via Wine, but this is inconvenient, and I lose music, which is apparently good.\n\nIn my opinion, it is far from the best games in the roguelike genre, but I still recommend playing it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1472750616, "timestamp_updated": 1472750616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598847746849060059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25207645": {"recommendationid": "25207645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227786820", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1468658705}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a game that you could play everyday (for me atleast) but when i do feel like playing it makes time run by quiclky.

Defeat the demon lord and save the world! One Way Heroics does a fantastic job of being minimalist, akin to that of Thomas Was Alone and Element4l. OWH is elegant, quick, and easy to understand without any unnecessary fluff or flashiness. It incorporates both good storytelling and solid gameplay without being boring or overwhelming in a great way. This game is another gem among the rough of indie games.

I also plan to check out more rogue-like games due to how much I enjoyed this one. The music is solid, the gameplay is an exciting challenge, and the pacing is excellent, with the incoming shrouding darkness that stalks you throughout your journey (or several) putting a great deal of pressure on you to keep moving forward, but still giving you plenty of time to explore to your heart's content, powering up your character to prepare for your epic battle with the demon lord, the game's big boss. And the game gives you many ways to do so. \n\nYou can go all around the map killing everything you see to level up as much as possible in the limited time you're given before the demon lord strikes. The second difficulty ensures that the demon lord can show up any time, which really amps up the intensity.\n\nYou can explore dungeons to loot rare items while taking out whatever lurks within.\n\nYou can stop at various buildings in the areas you visit to save your game, sell items, buy better items, and talk to NPC's. \n\nAnd much more.\n\nDepending on quality of your build, you will die often when you first start playing, especially if you aren't used to playing these types of games. However, you'll notice yourself becoming increasingly better every time, and when you finally accomplish that perfect run you've been planning after several failed attempts, it's extremely satisfying. And really, just experimenting with different builds is fun even when you die, because frustration is infrequent. You learn from each and every death and the game is rarely every cheap. You can see all of the enemies coming towards you at all times, giving you plenty of time to prepare your next move. Plus, with a reasonable agility level, avoiding enemies altogether is a relative breeze.\n\nOne of the best things about dying in One Way Heroics is that it doesn't feel like the end. There are brief descriptive endings for every death you experience, plus every time you die, you're given the option to read advice, transfer items to a new run if you want to start fresh, unlock new classes to play with, and plenty more. Exploration rewards you with more items, many of which you don't know the details of until after your run ends, whether by victory or death, but there's an item you can pick up that allows you to see all your inventory details on the spot, which really comes in handy. \n\nOverall, One Way Heroics is one of those rare indie JRPG's where everything just clicks. It has very little in the way of flaws, it has tons of replay value, and there's almost always ways to freshen up your experience, with multiple updates and campaign variations keeping things interesting even after multiple hours of play. It's a great game with plenty to offer even to the most seasoned Japanese role playing game vets, and a shining example of indie development at its very best.

The game uses a Shiren the Wanderer style vault to twink items between characters, but its usage is extremely limited.  It also features some interesting online features in that you can display a comment to other players which will show up along with some basic stats as to how you're doing, in the upper left corner (if you're playing a dimension shared with others).  You'll also run across the ghosts of dead players in these dimensions.\n\nThe game's aesthetic strongly reminds me of Elona, for some reason, even though the two games are alike only in that they're Japanese turn-based games that are roguelikes in a very loose sense of the word.  This isn't a bad thing; the way dialogue is written, the cheesy midi music, it's all got that uniquely Japanese indie feel to it that's ever so slightly jank, but adorable at the same time.

If the mist catches up to you, or you die then it's completely game over and you start again while given the option to retain some of the items from this run, unlocking various new features classes and goodies along the way.\n\nThe game, at first, gives you a constant drive to play. The classes seem interesting and relatively varied and unlocking new skills, classes, and goodies in general is a fun. The interface and visuals are basic but well fleshed out and feel great, giving a bit of nostalgia to the 8-bit era of games like Dragon [strike]Quest[/strike] [i]Warrior[/i]. However, the issues with the game become apparent after the honeymoon period wears off.\n\nThe first of two major issues is the most unique aspect of the game - the darkness. The darkness was undoubtedly designed to create a sort of pacing and pressure, and at first it does. But once you become accustomed to the pacing of the game all it really does is discourage exploration. So long as you don't explore you'll never run into any problems with the darkness. But I happen to enjoy exploring!\n\nThe second is in the balance of the game. I think the best way to illustrate this is with one particularly absurd example. The main villain in the game is the demon lord. He'll occasionally fly in and you're supposed to wack at him a bit, constantly denting his hp a bit, until he flies away only to come back again. Rince, wash, repeat, until he's dead and the credits roll. One major strength of his is in shields - each time he appears, he has up to 45 layers of shields that need to be removed before you can even start damaging him. With a mellee class that might do just a few hits per turn at most while he's pounding on you with all he has - this is a big problem. For a mage class? Well for some reason their attacks go right through the shields. On the hardest difficultly level in the game, I defeated him the first time he appeared by just zapping him a few time with the weakest attack the mage has boosted by a pretty generic staff and beat him the first time he appeared - achieving consistent victory on the max difficulty in about 15 minutes. Pretty anticlimatic for a roguelike. \n\nThis isn't a game you'll be spending hundreds and probably not even tens of hours on, but for a fun 10 or 20 hour romp it's an enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1464517855, "timestamp_updated": 1464517855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23255765": {"recommendationid": "23255765", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999655301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1648658633}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1464452951, "timestamp_updated": 1464452951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441513746976852417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23223259": {"recommendationid": "23223259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089425565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1542397709}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1464290873, "timestamp_updated": 1464290873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46190759539604187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23217538": {"recommendationid": "23217538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288347016", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1044, "last_played": 1675657388}, "language": "english", "review": "I have had so much fun just choosing classes going into randomized generated worlds and seeing how far my perks and class can take me.

I realize this is a rogue like also. In my personal opinion this game feels like it fails both genres.\n\nWhen playing an RPG there needs to be a sense of exploration/story. However, this game really punishes you for exploring. You will come across tons of little enemy houses with treasure in them, but most of the time it is impossible to kill the swarm of enemies inside and unlock a box before the area gets swallowed by the black edge of the screen. Furthermore, the character progression just isn't there. I get that one of the man features of rogue likes is permadeath, but the perks you can buy and upgrade a new character with don't make you feel stronger. You can unlock different classes of hero but they don't feel any different.  \n\nThe controls suck for the combat style. It's both live action and turn based. You pretty much walk around the map, but when you come across enemies you must take it slow and be very deliberate about facing the right direction before initiating any action, otherwise you swing at air and waste a turn. The controls just felt very clunky and took away from the immersion. I feel like pure turn based combat would have been better.\n\nMy final verdict is 5/10.

Normally this isn't really a problem, you can easily outrun the slowly-progressing darkness.\nIn case of emergency you can use your Awakening ability up to 5 times, which stops the time for 3 turns so you can get yourself out of trouble.\n\nUsually whenever you die, it is because you weren't careful, you will learn from most deaths.\nMost of the time there are ways to save yourself, but you just didn't try or think of everything or were too cocky, though of course there are also times when the game really seems to hate you.\n\nThere are multiple endings depending on how you beat the game and which NPC you have with you.\nMoreover when you beat the game you can store some items in your vault, which you can choose to use at the beginning of each run.\n\nLastly, it's a single-player game, but while playing the game online it will show you details about other players who are in the same dimension and occasionally you will meet ghosts of other fallen players who will drop one of their items and give you experience.\nFurthermore after clearing a dimension it will show you the characters of everyone who completed it as well.\n\nFor the price, especially when it's on sale, it's a steal.\nI definitely also recommend buying [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/352840/]OWH+[/url] if you already enjoyed the base game, it adds a lot of new content.", "timestamp_created": 1463392595, "timestamp_updated": 1463392595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4294967295, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602128684520721436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23013044": {"recommendationid": "23013044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293251169", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6664, "last_played": 1695153739}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1463366004, "timestamp_updated": 1694824013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22981978": {"recommendationid": "22981978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043874641", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1463243598}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Laaaaaaame.", "timestamp_created": 1463248963, "timestamp_updated": 1463248963, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.288152575492858887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22981299": {"recommendationid": "22981299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137994806", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1221, "last_played": 1485190004}, "language": "english", "review": "So...i really reccomend this game if you like rpg, this is nicely done, it has epic comic scenes, great soundtracks, lot of characters, and A LOT of different sotories, really well done on this one! \n\none of my Fav. games soo far!", "timestamp_created": 1463247140, "timestamp_updated": 1463247140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481702744960784912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22969685": {"recommendationid": "22969685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100570588", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1184, "last_played": 1453271214}, "language": "english", "review": "Iris is qt3.14\n\nSeriously though, this is a cute little time-killer sidescrolling roguelite with a mechanic that forces you to move forward or be swallowed by the encroaching darkness coming from the left side of the screen.

But this game at base price costs about as much as a cup of coffee from a mid-market coffee chain. I've played it for twenty hours, and it still feels like I'm scratching the surface; after each run, I feel like I learned something about how the game works, about what it wants from me and how to succeed. It's a good feeling. The game is fair but challenging, and for those of us for whom that isn't enough, offers a highly modular difficulty system (base difficulty plus class plus perks, all of different usefulness) to challenge yourself with. There's incremental progress and upgrades to unlock if you'd rather have a barometer of progress other than your own growing skill at the game, which is difficult to quantify, but grinding for these things isn't really an issue -- classes and perks are pretty cheap, at least for the useful ones, and everything else is bonus stuff.\n\nIf you buy the expansion, you're basically getting a game that has double or triple the content of the base game, and also includes a whole bunch of quality of life UI upgrades and balance changes. A lot of the things added are very simple and unobtrusive but satisfying -- things like turning to face the enemies automatically, a little screen to track all of the things you've achieved as each class, more dimensions to facilitate the psuedo-multiplayer. Other additions are bigger -- new classes, new allies, new npcs, new bosses and objectives and missions. While the price of the dlc is triple that of the base game, it's absolutely worth it -- even more so if you can get it on sale. The hours of gameplay/$ ratio is excellent.\n\nIt's also in the class of games that are easy to play while doing something else, like holding a skype conversation or queuing for a match in some other game.

There is a constant threat, the darkness, consuming the world. There's only... a 'few' ways to resolve and save what is left of this world.\n\nOne Way Heroics has a constant threat; the swallowing darkness from the west, and thus one can travel only eastwards or risk being consumed themselves. There will be many opportunity costs because of this. One can only explore only so much north-side and south-side in such a time-frame that you may miss a dungeon, or a town, or even rare holy loot; or unfortunately encounter a powerful foe that will devour your lifepoints in a single blow. Unable to fully loot everything because of a weight limit, you will have to take a limited amount of supplies and equipment and give up what is necessary for survival or end up blowing your own self up because someone lit up explosives in your inventory. \n\nIt comes along with many classes starting with the sharp Swordsmaster and agile Hunter, to the charming Bard and sexy Hero... to a traveling Tourist [i](DLC)[/i]? Each a journey without rest and different abilities for each class.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, you choose the difficulty before you start your adventure; from [i]A Simple Walk In The Park (Easy)[/i] and [i]An Afternoon Stroll (Normal)[/i], to a [i]Grueling Campaign (Insane)[/i]. As time goes on and as the darkness consumes more of the world; foes will be buffed and be stronger in level. It can be tough understanding every little mechanic there is, but after a few Walk in The Parks, you'll get a solid grasp on what and what not to do.\n\nIn terms of the game-play time, you can probably expect each normal journey to take thirty minutes to an hour (or an unfortunate eight minutes if you get caught off-guard), depending on how much you're willing to balance exploring and fighting. There are save points for each journey if you're slightly lucky to encounter them in towns, so don't worry if you end up having to sleep for yourself in the real world. Don't worry, that darkness won't eat you.\n\nThe DLC (OWH+) is not strictly necessary, but it does change and add more content to the game as it should.

As time, placements, and generally the whole landscape. You too can already learn the many ways of becoming heroic.\n\nThere is also a _Afterdeath_ Screen where you can save, trade, expend, repair, and increase your items you collected in your traveling of the worlds. Hell you can even gain items you can't get in certain campaings. But if you complete it , you gain special other perks, even endings you can get if you finally get them! \n\nGame has perks in it... PERKS! Even Debuffs that make your heroic level skyrocket, but not for the faint of heart. As the Debuffs increase levels, yes, but make your game FAR more Harder and more time pinching then the other easy pickings. Even if you think you got a nice going class you like and you unlock another and gain them the right set for them. You want to try to get more classes. \n\nThe DLC does that for you, it adds 4 more classes, ON TOP with more perks, settings, increase in more items, drops, enemies. Even more campaigns you can do in your [spoiler] Castle Renavations and also other main / side quests! [/spoiler] More toys to find. Even going beyond the limit. The world never ends. \n\nThe Pros\n[list]\n    [*] Rouge Like - Infinite Possiblities\n    [*] Low Price \n    [*] Trading Cards\n    [*] Retro Gameplay with innovative tactics.\n    [*] Weekly Updates / New Campaigns \n    [*] Great for Game Stuffers and Collectors!\n    [*] Great storyline - Mini Campaigns with Plots and Events\n    [*] Great Quick Game for short players - Walk in the Park if you have a break in your schedule!\n[/list]\n\nThe Cons\n\n[list]\n    [*] Time Waster - Somewhat good too. \n    [*] Slightly challenging to a new RPG Player if not prepared - [spoiler] Be Fairly Warned - If going for harder campaigns and doing it for cheevies, I suggest trying to use Hero / Knight Classes to survive if not, Bet your heroic tush goodbye! [spoiler/]\n    [*] No Multiplayer Base - But What you expect? I said *Co-op* but it's your Allies you make in game.\n    [*] Options and HUD UI a bit ... Cluttered but I let it slide as it trying to keep all your info in the game as you travel without the need of constant back tracking.\n[/list]\n\nAll in All A very great game, I love it, I play it, I am Addictted to it.\n\nIn my score I give it 9.2 / 10 Review\n\n9.5/10 - Gameplay\n9.0/10 - Music / OST\n9.0/10 - Graphics\n8.5/10 - Storyline\n10/10  - Creativity and Originality", "timestamp_created": 1458859629, "timestamp_updated": 1458859806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21995621": {"recommendationid": "21995621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267727968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1692122468}, "language": "english", "review": "The game plays very similarly to the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series of games, except instead of the \"dungeon\" being comprised of a lot of hallways and rooms, it's an expansive, randomly generated world, with dungeons to explore and towns to stop at.

The reason I don't recommend it is because One Way Heroics is still an incomplete game, with the expansion and all.\n\nThe review:\n\nAfter 70 hours playtime, I can't recommend One Way Heroics.  Without the expansion (One Way Heroics Plus, $6.49), this game is borderline unplayable.  The expansion brings in much needed UI updates, gameplay tweaks, more items and more characters.  And a ton of bug fixes.\n\nProblem is, most of that stuff should have been patched in to the base game.  Or, more realistically, put in to the game before it ever released.  Especially since, even with all that, it still feels like a beta version.  Very late in the beta process, but still not quite ready for release.  Somewhere in the polishing phase.  Bugs are still being squashed to this day, and I experienced plenty in my time with the game. \n\nOnce you take all the things from OWH+, and subtract them out since they should have been included in the main game prior to release, you're left with just the new classes and the castle expansions.  And they aren't worth $6.49 by themselves.  The classes are easy to gloss over, and none of the castle expansions have a huge impact on your game.  You can easily do without both.\n\nWith a bit of a shallow story, one that was also poorly translated, the gameplay is what keeps you coming back.

The system for gear statistics is pretty straightforward, as is the story-telling, as is leveling up. There are no skill trees or any choice of what stat you level up, but I promise you it won't matter.\nThat being said, the simplicity is nice. It allows you to play the game casually without taking away that constant strive some players have for better gear or \"the perfect run\".\n\nThe combat is also quite simple. You have a basic attack you will use most of the time, as well as a few abilities learned from leveling or NPC's. It's quick, with you likely not spending more than 5 seconds on most enemies besides bosses. It keeps the game moving, which is nice because in a roguelike its important not to drag things out. This also allows you to keep the game short if that's what you want. Personally my average session is maybe 2 hours long, but if you insist on going as far as 2000km (which isn't neccessary to win), it's a bit closer to 4 or 5 hours. Optional saves make those long games far less daunting.\n\nAs I said, this game can work for casual players, but it does not leave the more dedicated players with nothing to do. 170 hours as I'm writing this review and there is still more to do. The game has a few interesting objectives woven into it to DRASTICALLY increase replay value, such as daily campaigns that change up the rules of the procedurally generated worlds you play in, multiple bosses to defeat, 4-5 different difficulties and 4 different ways to \"win\" a playthrough. Also it has one particular aspect I love to see in roguelikes; you can transfer a limited amount of gear from one playthrough to another. This helps you to continue your quest for the absolute best gear by allowing you to keep enchanting gear instead of losing everything at the end of a playthrough. But it's not at all essential for beating the game if that's too easy for you ;)\n\nAs for the \"One Way Heroics Plus\" expansion (without going into detail), it's not neccessary for enjoying the game. It's the icing on top of the cake, and the odds are you will want it at some point or another, so I suggest buying it right off the bat to really enhance the game.\n\nWhether you are looking for a game to waste a few hours on, or one to get really sucked into, you just can't go wrong with One Way Heroics.", "timestamp_created": 1457153369, "timestamp_updated": 1457153383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543859660625457764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21630991": {"recommendationid": "21630991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277011659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1454968163}, "language": "english", "review": "SImple concept, but they do it very well.

I've had way more enjoyment from this game than 89 cents has any right to give! The fast-paced gameplay gives all of the satisfaction of a Final Fantasy game without all of the lengthy cutscenes. As such, it is great fun in 20 minute chunks or 2 hour marathons.\n\nOne Way Heroics is a Roguelike adventure game that takes place in a fantasy world that is being consumed by darkness. Our brave hero must quickly travel ---> and defeat the Demon Lord in order to stop the darkness from consuming the entire world!  The constant pressure of the dark wall of doom closing in behind you forces you to plan ahead and takes a bit of getting used to. Labyrinthine dungeons are there for the plundering, but if you spend too much time looting you may find yourself without an escape route! \n\nDon't let the word \"roguelike\" scare you off! The game has a save system, so if you really want to continue your adventure after getting eaten by that dragon, you can restart from the last time you saved. Keep an eye out for villages to save at! Also, there is an \"emergency save\" feature that allows you to save anywhere provided it has been at least 5 (in-game) days since your last save. Of course, you get a higher end-game score if you clear the game without dying, and with minimal saving.\n\nIn the beginning, you can choose between two classes, and more can be unlocked as you earn hero points (awarded at the end of each run). Each class has a trait unique to them that offers its own style, from the straightforward Swordmaster: master of slashy stuff, to the Force User: a squishy mage-type character.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the game has a surprising amount of depth to it. I'm still discovering new stuff and I have been playing for quite a while already. There is a dark brotherhood, NPCs to befriend, an adorable fairy guide, witty dialogue, and some interesting sidequests you can find. The DLC is well-worth the cost, almost doubling the amount of content in the game.\n\nGive this game a go, at a price like this you'd be hard pressed to find a better value.", "timestamp_created": 1454030486, "timestamp_updated": 1454030486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20797075": {"recommendationid": "20797075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054736735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1631, "last_played": 1595605553}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool game, once again, if your nostalgic about good old RPG and u enjoyed recent rogue games, try this one !", "timestamp_created": 1453947180, "timestamp_updated": 1453947180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20754503": {"recommendationid": "20754503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154600307", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1429250485}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth for the soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1453756195, "timestamp_updated": 1453756195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511694014072418213", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20744071": {"recommendationid": "20744071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107814047", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1562121516}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a little skeptical when I first looked at it but after playing it a few times and understanding the mechanics I soon came to really enjoy the game, It's pretty simple but fun.

Do you risk going into the dungeon to check those chests when the dimensional void is approaching? Your skills, items, and abilities all factor into that being a good decision. However,  you also need to get stronger as the game gets harder the further you go so going in unprepared may be the best call. The game has saving (unless a certain mode is activated), but  it is limited based on an item you purchase or rare totems that cost exp. The risk is real and gives this little game alot of depth. Its also not too intense as nothing happens unless your character is moving. \n\nThis game has an amazing soundtrack and alot of the best tracks are not even on Youtube. This  is almost like a Touhou or Cave Story where the music is as much as a selling point as the gameplay. \n\nThere is no reason to at least try this game as it is often just a dollar.

You will have to defeat enemies Quickly.\nCon (As the only one i can really think of as of writing this review)\n- Slow Start: the Game is tough, While it's nice that the first two classes you start with are easy to play, the Classes you unlock will take a bit of practice to get used to making it a tad difficult to unlock early achievements.\n\nOtherwise One Way Heroics is a fast paced RPG that looks generic but should Not be Overlooekd just becasue of that.

GOOD LUCK!\n\nSo begins your slow and painful descent into hell. \n\nAt the 1st gate of hell you pick your class, name, and perks (assuming you even have any). At first you'll wonder why you only get two classes, and thats because without any foundation the others will either be piss easy to play (IM LOOKING AT YOU PIRATE <3) or even harder to get going than your beginner classes (coughForceUsercough).\n\nAt the 2nd circle of hell you wander around on \"Walk in the Park\" mode (easy mode) and you get the gist of the game....while simultaneously wondering why the fabled final boss meets you at a predetermined point or why they even want to kill you (I still dont remember signing up for this ***....Was I Voluntold?). You also realize multiplayer is a lie, as ghosts of people who may have died in that world you signed up to plop into dont seriously help when you're being swarmed by Zubats when night falls on the open plains.\n\nAt the 3rd circle of hell you die because an imp threw a rock too hard at your skull....or a skeleton was spawned in and one shot you with its nifty sword....or you got trapped in the damn DESERT and harpies ended up swarming your soon-to-be carcass. You die, get a crappy score, get some really lame advice and useless critiques from Navi the Fairy, maybe even some halfway tips, and you start over because you refuse to take your beating lying down.\n\nAt the 4th circle of hell you beat the game once and get an ending that leaves too many things open. So you start again, probably on a higher difficulty because you havent learned your lesson from being nearly incinerated and eaten by wild dingos. This was a mistake, as now you have to deal with your old AND new anus being torn asunder because enemies are hitting like speeding bullet trains and you just left the Shire. \n\nAt the 5th circle of hell you start getting more endings because you keep beating the game, but now with some of those elusive bonus companions at your side. You meet Elodie after you beat Long Live the Queen (she clearly took nothing but combat classes this time), Azir-Finally here-Emperor Pigeon, Alphonse Elric, an edgy Male Gunner from DFO, a defenseless Loli, a nurse that's crying because you chewed her out for being a dog girl instead of a cat girl, and money grubbing panty mercenary who doesnt actually care about panties. Their endings flesh out their characters, but you still dont know what the hell is going on (or why the left side of the screen continues to devour the game like its stocking up for hibernation every time you start the game again).\n\nAt the 6th circle of hell you decide to just ignore the final boss and journey until the game makes you stop. This results in many a death and many late nights wondering why the fuck you bought this game. Eventually you reach the end of the world (cause the world really is flat guys, school lied to you) and you finally understand that this game is just dicking with you over and over until you get it right.\n\nAt the 7th circle of hell you attempt to fix the left side of the screen, only to be eaten and or incinerated by it......now everything becomes clear to you and you know what you need to do.\n\nAt the 8th circle of hell you get some Cheesy Puffs, some Dew, and prepare your quad-anuses (btw you should have a minimum of 4 now) for tons of save scumming because of all of the save crystals you hoarded in your Dimensional Vault between worlds; clears or deaths. You finally beat the game and you throw yourself into the next circle of hell because nothing matters anymore.\n\nAt the 9th circle of hell you melt your computer because now you have to buy the DLC and experiance being Anakin Skywalker, Naruto, and some random tourist to Disney World to get all the achievements in the game.\nTime and time again you are going to want to chuck your keyboard/laptop wondering what new ways the game can come up with to cheapshot you and why you just took 600 damage because a bear decided to fuck your shit up. This game (on higher difficulties) will tear you a new one and laugh as you try to tape your anus back together. On lower difficulties.....itll only happen 1 or 2 times because you'll pick up enough situational awareness to not get your eyes torn out of their sockets while you were exploring or trying to reach that one item tucked inbetween 30 tiles of mountain when all you know how to do is dash around like Sanic the fucking Hedgehog, trying to figure out how many items you can get before the left side of the screen eats you again.. Eventually you realize that you spent over 60 hours on a game where all you do is go right and try to survive when you suddenly dont get any food for 700 kms, or you get 4 consecutive corrupted lands and the fucking wolfmen and dragonkin swarm your position after all your weapons snap in half from all the fighting, or you blow up because you got set on fire and forgot to chuck that Elzite bomb you got 2 minutes into a run.\n\nAs you enter the Nth Circle of hell you realize that this was all only worth it if you can somehow make and achieve some sort of goal. You didnt, and you laugh as you realize this game has seared your soul and you will never be the same again.\n\n10/10 would auto-pilot into a lava tile again.", "timestamp_created": 1450841202, "timestamp_updated": 1450841202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652003645896911621", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19837164": {"recommendationid": "19837164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018852321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1451456016}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome to the world of One Way Heroics.\nYou can play as multiple characters while you travel to the right side of the map at all times for a great darkness follows and swallows the world behind you.

What caught my attention to the game was the mult-world system, where there are infinite world seeds to add infinite possibility to the game, which also meant a lot of replay value. Secondly, the graphics and classes reminded me of my old favorites, the Final Fantasy games. After buying the game and DLC on a good whim, and trying it out for the first time, I immediately loved it. The encroaching darness actually made it a lot of fun because it added a sense of hurry and a feeling of loss when you couldn't reach that item or town in time, but it also wasn't too fast as to ruin the focus of the gameplay so I don't mind the rush because it still gives ample opportunity to do what you want while constaly reminding you to keep moving. Lastly, the dimentional storage system made it so that playing it again and again wasn't such a drag for unlocking new things because you can store and take items from the storage throughout multiple playthroughs making it a bit easier than doing it from scratch (although its a fun challenge playing hard difficulties without using the stoage).\n\n          So as for final thoughts on the game; I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes old school RPG's with a twist. Also if you're looking for a game with great replay value, I'd say this game is up there with 'Binding of Isaac: Rebrith/Afterbirth' for a fraction of the price.

Anyways, enough ranting about how fun it is, here's my pros and cons.\n\n\nPROS: Massive replay value. There is a lot of hidden content, and a lot more to the game than what you see on your first clear.\n\nMultiple classes for your own style of adventuring. While this may not seem huge, the differences in classes are a lot more diverse than what you think. Join up with a party of a few people, or go completely ham solo with a knight. Choice is yours\n\nGreat soundtrack. Honestly, i really enjoy the music in this game. It's something i can sit down to, and not mute the game for my own music.\n\nDifficulty. This game can throw some suprising difficulty at the most unexpected places. I've died at some very unexpected places. There is a lot of strategy into this game.

Kill things. Collect utility items. Find good gear, hopefully. Carefully contemplate your options as a cabal of imps breathe down your neck. Probably get killed, or more likely kill yourself in a nearsighted blunder. Every once in a blue moon, reach the the Big Bad only to lose your head to a casually-flung fireball. Every once in a hundred blue moons or so, actually kill the guy. It's simpler than, say, Nethack, but bears more depth than grandaddy Rogue.\n\nIn true roguelike spirit, there is a leveling system, but progression is heavily biased towards gear, and by extension very random.\n\nThe advancing wall of doom is a unique spin on the roguelike formula, forcing you to budget your actual turns. Can you make it back to the entrance of the dungeon? You can easily kill the enemy harassing you, but do you have time? It creates a real sense of urgency without imposing actual time limits. You have plenty of time to think... about the 8 turns you have remaining before the darkness consumes you.\n\nAnother unique mechanic is the final boss periodically shows up and harasses you before running away. It's a double-edged sword; this gives you an opportunity to slay him early, if you got lucky enough or twinked over powerful items from your vault. At the same time, you have to know not just when, but HOW to run. The game does warn you when he'll be showing up soon, so you always get a chance to put your pants back on.\n\nAnd unlike your average roguelike, it's controller-friendly, being largely driven by graphical menus as opposed to keystroke commands.\n\nIf you like very unusual games, buy it. If you enjoy a proper roguelike, buy it. Hell, it's dirt cheap even without a sale.

You play as a custom character on a trek to defeat the Demon Lord, a powerful entity that imperils the world with the motivation toward total destruction. Before meeting the tendrils of corruption, the player must endure a certain distance-decided when choosing the various game settings-while destroying hostile creatures.[/h1]\n\nHere are a few items of interest within [i]OWH[/i]:\n\nGameplay - Aside from other roguelikes, this title\u2019s complexity is derived from its tactical display rather than gameplay, as [i]One Way Heroics[/i] utilizes a turn-based approach to combat and item usage. Each in-game action made by the hero utilizes said turns, which advances the daunting foe. The term \u2018turn-based strategy\u2019 does not entirely cover this game\u2019s spectrum, however, as [i]every[/i] action, whether it be equipping a new weapon or item, or consuming a potion to gain back energy, summons evil one turn closer to the player\u2019s character. Adding to the ominous theme, the darkness swallows the lands you have passed through, and the notification of non-player character deaths can be heard as they disappear into mist. Controls are rather simple on both keyboard and controller, but can be adjusted in the case that they feel awkward. Equipment can be modified within the menus to alter the method of play by adding boons to weapons and armor, but, as stated, this increases danger; these items are gained either as loot from defeated enemies or may be distributed throughout the map. With a high enough Charisma score, the player may also gain discounts from various shops and recruit non-player individuals to the party that will assist in combatting foes and leveling up. \n\nCharacter Creation & Upgrades - Characters comprise of several customizable components, such as name, class, avatar, and perk and statistical preferences chosen by the player; perks may also grant players companions or other game modifications such as quicker swimming or improved unarmed damage. These adjustments allow the player to modify how they would like to play according to the class. Additional equipment may alter damage totals to enemies or reduce them toward the player\u2019s character. Levelling up in [i]OWH[/i] operates in a similar way to other titles, as it improves the character\u2019s base statistics depending on which class was chosen.\n\nUnlockables - Depending on how far the player\u2019s character progresses in the campaign, a number of Hero Points are rewarded to the player to purchase game augments. These modifications increase the amount of content usable by the player, such as said hero classes, perks-with selections for both combat and other skills-, and expanding what\u2019s known as the Dimensional Vault: an item-storage system in which adventurers may donate a number of items from preceding generations to the next living hero. This expands play so that the entire game is not just an uphill battle with no reward when so close to the resolve, but rather contains encouragement toward progression.\n\nTL:DR - [i]One Way Heroics[/i] is a fun, simple, and rewarding title with incentive to advance toward the Demon Lord time and time again. There is a great amount of challenge involved in this title, but does not evoke frustration due to its Hero Point system. Though the accolade of defeating the ultimate evil may not be reached every time, the journey is a fantastic ride filled with choice, vicious battle, and sacrifice. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys roguelikes and simple roleplaying mechanics. This game has a great deal of replayability, and I hope you enjoy upon purchase.

There's 8 classes (only a couple in the beginning), but 24 sprites to choose fun. The worlds are randomly generated and filled with a lot of content that take a long time to go through, finding almost a new thing everytime. After a long time, my brother and I went through every NPC, companion, items, and weapons you could go through, but it never got boring because it's so different (yet the same) every time! I just recently got the DLC One Way Heroics Plus and it has about 3x the content now comparing it to the original, much more aesthetics and features that got me into it again. The music that is seen throughout the different biomes, towns, and bosses is also really good enough that I put them on my phone because you can find them online for free.

I actually REALLY like the game and the simplicity of combat but boy oh howdy is it a very shallow experience. Aside from tiny modifiers and higher difficulties this is a very easy game to beat once you figure out how not to die to the moving wall of darkness.\n\nThere are 2 types of rogue like games. The first type you actually progress your character accross playthroughs (Dead Rising, Rogue Legacy) where you get your sense of accomplishment despite not beating the game.\n\nThe other type consists of losing literally everything stat and possession and see if you roll the dice better this time around. Thats much harder to remain satisfying since from a stat angle you can't tell who has 80 hours of play time and who has 5 hours. So why invest the additional 75 hours?\n\nThis game is the latter, sure certain games can pull it off like Faster then Light because you unlock ways that alter the game in a dramatic way that getting those unlocks feels worth it even if you lose. This game has a few different classes but they control and play almost identically and their bonuses would only be noticed if this game was in the former catagory. It wouldn't be hard either, you remove weapon degredation (since you can save items between playthroughs) and allow perminent base stat increases using the levels you gain in playthrough as currency. Make this playthrough harder so that future ones will be easier sort of deal, they already have something like that but it only applies to the current playthrough\n\nTL:DR this game is very much worth if you're buying it for literal cents on the dollar.

One of my favorite aspects of a randomly generated world is the fact that you're not going to see everything the first play through... Or the second play through... Or even the twenty-second! I still have not figured out how to recruit other party members during the journey, but I'm fine with that because I've been so preoccupied with discovering all the other things you can do with different classes.\n\nSpeaking of classes, I normally hate class systems in an RPG. When you have to devote to one for the entire game and you're not even sure if it's your favorite because you haven't got to try the others yet. But in One Way Heroics, many runs are fairly short, so you can try every class that you like. Get a feel for all of them. Then play the one you feel like playing based on your mood. It's kind of like a fighter game in that aspect; you pick a character based on the kind of match you expect to have.\n\nAnother great thing about the classes in One Way Heroics is the fact that they all have something unique and interesting to bring to the table. Each has a special skills, and each has regular skills that they perform better or with a bonus. It's balanced pretty well and it makes picking a favorite for your style of play easy.\n\nThe variety of items is the last good point I'd like to touch on. One thing I almost always start out with is increased inventory ability, because I love picking up as many items as I can and using them effectively. One Way Heroics exhibits great balance between character stats and the necessity for equipment. You can make your character strong, sure, but if you don't find a rare and powerful weapon or some really good armor, you're going to be running from the demon lord many times before you can hope to fight him.\n\nThe one down side to this game I'll mention is the character design. The artwork is a little sloppy looking, though charming in it's own way, and the character dialog, while funny at first, is a little lacking in terms of variety. Well. during gameplay anyway--Dialog is actually pretty good during cut scenes, as I am hit with something new almost every new game and end game. Finally characters feel a little flat. Even though the after story of you and the fairy continuing your journey after the world is saved is rather touching, it feels awkward because I don't really feel connected to the characters. They're too generic, but then, maybe that was intended.\n\nAll in all, great game. 9/10\n\n(This is my first review, so I haven't developed any kind of coherent style.)", "timestamp_created": 1447372490, "timestamp_updated": 1447372490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19034932": {"recommendationid": "19034932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115791181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8427, "last_played": 1632222614}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is better than many others for more money.

The graphics, by today's standards, aren't the super realistic HD sculptures that a lot of people have come to expect from video games. Instead, the graphics are more of a 16-bit sprites with beautiful choices of color palettes throughout the game. It is very easy to tell when you traverse through different environments, desolate deserts, cold artic tundra, lush beautiful forests and plains. The guards, townsfolk, and inhabitants of the world are just as carefully designed and all look unique. \n\nProbably one of the biggest things that makes this game so great is the gameplay. Imagine a Japanese Style Action RPG with a lot of Rogue like aspects that do nothing, but add to replay value of the game. Everything can be randomized, and like most Rogue Likes perma death is a real thing. About the only thing that you can save, aside from the game, is your character's inventory, or rather a select few items to continue playing with. You get a super awesome sword that when roots your enemies and burns them to death, and you don't really want to let it go? Well there's something called a deminisonal vault that you can use to keep that sword through multiple playthroughs. \n\nSpeaking of that deminisonal vault, the way you get it, and use it is through things called Hero Points. You acquire Hero Points by either completing a full run of the game, or dying. If you die, by some random Dragon Knight in a structure you were checking for loot, drowning in water, or trying to climb to the point of exhaustion and just collapsing. There's also one other very unique way of dying. In this game, you visit a town and you can't revist it, you can't go back the way you came at all. This is because the Dark Lord (boss of the game) is spreading darkness throughout the realm, you touch the darkness and you die. Well the screen scrolls to the right, just like an old school platformer, but instead of being able to go back you can't because of the darkness, if you try, you die. This adds for a significant amount of challenge, you can easily get stuck in areas of the game because of mountains, walls, or whatever other obstacle that impedes your travel, and the darkness catches up and you die. Actually, every action you take, wether it's attacking an enemy, moving, using an item, casting a spell, or whatever moves the darkness closer towards you. \n\nThe Plot is a throw a way plot you are X hero out to slay the Dark Lord and stop the spread of the darkness throughout the world. There's other campaigns that you can do that are fixed maps that have their own story as well, but it follows the same formula. \n\nProbably one of the coolest things about the game is Character Creation. At the beginning of the game you start with two classes, a Swordmaster Class and a Knight Class. You can chose what your sprite looks like, and also give your character perks to help with his stats, or whatever skills you have for the class. You start with three perk slots, but as you play you can unlock up to five perks. This alone gives the game that massive replay value, just to see how every other class works, in a completely different world every single time.\n\nAs you play through the game, and earn Hero Points,  you also gain new classes to run through the game with, each class, plays very differently from the other.

Now for the breakdown\n\nMusic\n The music is never really downbeat, though there are times when it's calmed down.\n It tends to pick up to a rousing adventure theme when combat really begins to happen\n The music in towns is really calming, to the point that I've just sat in towns listening to the music playing\n\n I tend to reccomend listening to the music of any game prior to purchase though, and there's an awesome playlist on youtube containing all of the music from the game.\n\nInterface\n The interface in the base game is kind of unintuitive, with the keys being used as follows: R T W A S D Ctrl Shift\n\n There might have been more, but either never needed them, or they just didn't come up.\n\n The intro menu here is really simple, but the opportunity to rerun a map you like just because you remember its seed is awesome, but there's not much that's all that interesting in the intro menu.\n\n The in-game menus are interesting, but I do have just one issue in that you can \"use\" a bomb, by which I mean it will just explode on you. I don't know why this is an option but I accidently use the bomb instead of throwing it more often than I'd like to admit. But beyond the occasional issue with that, the menus are easy to understand, just getting into it the first time is a bit interesting.\n\n\n The interface in the expansion is much more compact with the numbers on the keyboard being used for quick acess inventory slots. The rest of the keys are: Z X C V Shift Ctrl W A S D or the arrows\n\nThe expansion makes the menus even easier to use, as well as picking up dropped items.\n\n\nGameplay\n It's a Turn based roguelike with the opportunity to overcome every map that I've come across, though it may take several attempts to do so.\n\nThe combat is really intuitive, where the combination of shift and direction makes aiming easy, and there's only one attack button, which allows you to really take advantage of the turn-based global interaction.\n\nIt is possible to get all pooped on by the spawning of the enemies, or even by travelling to the wrong bit of the map and getting stuck behind a wall of mountains, but so far, I've had only a couple of instances where this happened. \n\nMy complaints here are really just twofold, with the first one being the bomb issue. There's a number of games I lost because of that, but it's my fault. The other is how slow the game can be on the longer runs, but the expansion allows the speeding up of movement so I no longer have this issue.\n\nStory\nNope. not telling you. If you want to find out, do so yourself.\nIt is a compelling story found out through gameplay if done correctly though.\n\n\nReally, as a quick sum up of all that: the game is really well put together and the expansion just tightens some controls and adds to the game as a whole. I spent $7 on this and as you can see I've put in 40-ish hours into it. I love it, and it's something that, if you like the gameplay, you'll love the game. If you don't like the aesthetics and or the gameplay, you won't really feel bad about it because you've probably spent more money on worse games.\n\nEnjoy!

Just like any other, YOU WILL DIE the first few times you try. However, you will eventually get the hang of it, and be able to survive just about any situation. For example: I recently got the plus version, and in it they added a couple new biomes and new items. One new biome is an ocean area, where there is a very large area of water. Water takes 5 times as long to navigate as dry land, and this is a major issue with the darkness chasing you. What made the area worse is that the Demon Lord (powerful boss) spawned for me right after I found the ocean. I fought for a while, before I realized I was screwed if I kept fighting. I was trapped between a very powerful enemy and an ocean that would cause my death. Luckily, I found an item that proved highly useful. Its called Magic Bridge. It forms a bridge that extends to 15 tiles in front of you. I used it over the ocean, and managed to run away for a little while, and heal. However, the bridge wasnt long enough to make it all the way over. So I was trapped once again. However, through strategic item, skill, and using my followers as bodyguards, I was able to get him down to about 10% hp. However, I couldnt survive another hit. I thought to myself \"How can I possibly survive?\" I was skimming my skills, and I noticed I had one more awakening left. Awakening is a skill that freezes time for 3 turns. However, you can only use it 5 times a playthrough. I used it. And on the last turn of the awakening, I managed to finish him off. It was the single most intense moment of my One Way Heroics life.\n\nI highly advise that you get this game, and the Plus version. Easily worth the money.

You like JRPGs? Buy this game. You like persistant unlockables? Buy this game. You like random levels? Buy this game. This is one of my favorite games out there. Its fun to sit and play for 15 mins - or 4 hours straight.\n\nAlso - be happy knowing you're supporting 16-bit style WITHOUT USING RPGMaker. This game runs its own engine.\nThat in and of itself its worth it.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nAt first glance, One Way Heroics looks like it was made on RPGMaker. It wasn't. Its a completely custom engine, from someone in Japan.\n\nAnd, boy is it unique. Seriously. Yes, its an RPG. Yes, it is done in 16 bit style. But that is about the only thing that makes it anything like the RPGs back then.\n\nThe description on the store page really doesn't do it justice. It explains the base game. But it doesn't explain how incredibly addicting it is to go just \"one more run\". \n\nSee, there's a bunch of dimensions - and they are slowly being swallowed up by the darkness. Meaning you can't go left for too long, as the darkness slowly advances from left to right across the screen every step you take. You are slightly faster than it, though. \n\nThe game is turn based, so like Rogue, everything only moves when you do. Its like Rogue too, in that all you have to do is hit the attack key near an enemy  You are trying to defeat the Demon Lord who's causing the darkness, but its going to be quite a few playthroughs even on the easiest mode to beat him for the first time.\n\nYou will die. A lot. No biggie though as it has permanent unlockables. A \"vault\" which you can upgrade to store items in. Perks to make your char stronger. And you can either choose to adventure in a completely randomly generated realm, or you can choose one of the \"online\" realms, 1 of which is random, and the others of which have \"specials\" (a certain character is there, darkness, better items, more XP etc). The online realms change every 24 hours. There isnt multiplayer as such, however in the online realms, theres a constant scroll of a pic and brief info about each other person playing. You can also set 1 of about 20 \"online messages\". One of the nicest features of online is you can also encounter the \"ghost\" of another player in your game at the spot where they died. They help you by giving you an item they were carrying and some of their XP.\n\nTheres also 5 game modes, eacxh slightly harder than the last, but with better items and more story. \n\nOh did I mention that? Theres a story too. Each companion which you can find (and theres quite a few) has a story associated with them you can learn by talking to them. Oh, and both enemies and companions can have \"prefixes\". Some make them stronger, both enemies and companions. Some change dialogue with companions. (Really, EVERYONE needs to see Naughty Queen Frieda)...\n\nThe base game is I think around $4. Its totally worth it. There's also DLC, which is totally worth it as well, if you like the base game.

It's a simple game with an interesting concept. You can only move in one direction, hence the title. If you are caught on the far left side of the screen, you can die. So you always have to move forward. Each move causes the screen to move, so the more time you waste in one position, the less time you have to escape the left side of the screen. It sounds weird but you'll understand when you get into the game. Now, the game is simple, you buy equipment, level up, and defeat enemies. It's pretty difficult to fight the first boss at first, but at least you can transfer items from your first playthrough to the next one, making it easier. You can also receruit party members if your charisma is high enough.

While it does feature proper randomization and varied starting options, I can't say I find it an enjoyable roguelike. \n\nFirst of all, interface is bad, no mouse support, and various dialogues during each run start / end repeat every time without ability to skip them. Also, it was obviously designed for Japanese language, the information is crammed in too tightly, and those dialogues I mentioned are like something out of a jRPG/visual novel but, you know, this is a roguelike with many retries necesseary to achieve something, so you'll see those pop up every now and then, forcing you to rapidly skim trough same lines every time!\n\nNext, it's... I can't really say it has that much tactical depth. I mean, there are special abilities which are not very convinient to use due to interface, some of them cost stats, some can be used just few times, but due to the price you pay to use them they are only handy in extreme situations. Same with items, they run out of durability and break, so you have to spare better ones, but even then there's no depth beyond \"know when it's right time to use this\".\n\nAlso, can't say I enjoyed either visuals or audio. Guess I'm just not weaboo enough to enjoy Japanese style. Although if you are into this sort of thing, you should probably enjoy it.\n\nFinally while it has some nice simple ideas, the balance is pretty shit. Like charisma is near-useless except for getting extremely rare companions, meanwhile other stats are essential for survival. While unfairness is a common thing in random roguelikes, having one of the essential stats useless outside of daily events and extremely rare occurences is just plain wrong.\n\nAll in all, this might be a pretty good simple timekiller for a weaboo, you might even enjoy the extra challenges the game offers, but for anyone not used to Japanese game design practices and aesthetics this might prove rather dull.", "timestamp_created": 1442240570, "timestamp_updated": 1455893475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505510389804840088", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18008211": {"recommendationid": "18008211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045523714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1510817861}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game, YOU will love this game so much.

For his head, much like every other part of his body except for his massive beefcake arms, was puny and weak.

Yes.\nIs it fun? Yes.\nShould you buy it? Yes, especially when on sale.\nIs the OWH+ DLC worth it? Yes, every steam penny you spend on it.\n\nNow for the unnecessarily long analysis portion:\n\nOne Way Heroics is a Roguelike with large amounts of Turn-Based RPG elements. Your character grows stronger as they defeat enemies, you can equip a variety of different weapons, there are multiple character classes, and there are even quests in the game which require recruiting certain characters or speaking with a specific person (OWH+ has quests to unlock extra character classes and a quest to return a little girl to her father).\n\nSome other mechanics the game runs on include:\n\n- Everything moves on a grid\n- You have a stamina bar that allows you to climb mountains, swim in water, and use special attacks\n- You also have an energy meter which is refilled by eating food, it also provides energy for force attacks\n- Every recruitable character has affinity that goes up as you travel with them or do specific things on the way such as eat a specific kind of food or kill enemies\n- The recruitable characters can also be levelled up\n- Weapons can be given extra attributes via scrolls or other such objects\n- Most items have weight (arrows and gemstones don't) and if you exceed the weight limit, you can't move\n- You can unlock various perks that help you along the way\n- You can find goddess statues throughout the world which give you special boosts for the cost of levels\n- The Awakening ability, which allows you to take five consecutive actions without anything else moving\n- The Dimensional Vault which lets you store items from a run and take them out again for a different run\n- Your weapons and armor will break after a certain number of hits, given or recieved\n\nMechanics specific to OWH+\n\n- Food can go bad as time goes on\n- You level up upon reaching a new area\n- You can add extra parts to the starting castle with Dimensional Gold Coins you find in each run, you can also place special NPCs in these extra parts\n- Extra perks that make the game harder but greatly improve your rank and score\n- Tons of extra items that aren't in the regular version\n\nThe biggest and most important game mechanic however, is the darkness. The darkness is always on the left side of the screen, and if you get swallowed by it, you die. Every time you do something, be it moving, attacking, equipping an item, or even talking to someone, the darkness moves forward.

Buy it. Longer version:\n\nPlot\n\nThe setting itself is quite simple. You are the hero, saving the world from darkness that's devouring everything. And to do that you have to kill Demon Lord, who's somewhere over there ------>  \nThat's basically it, but there is so much more, if you care to search for it. Game is filled with alternative endings, hidden classes, party members... Well, you get the point. It actually makes me really sad that only 4,6% of players have invested time to complete the game in some other way, than beating the Demon Lord, as they are missing out on great plot, that's just hidden within seemingly generic RPG storyline.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs you embark to find the Demon Lord somewhere over that ------> way in randomly generated world, the said darkness is chasing you, destroying villages, killing the monsters and, most important of all, keeping you from stopping.  On your way you'll encounter multitude of different terrain types, villages, dungeons, enemies, merchants, friends, (friendly) ghosts of other players and so on. The further you go, the harder game becomes.\nCombat is very much in retro RPG style. You act ---> your party members act ----> enemies act. Extra agility can get you (or enemies) multiple moves in a row. There are status ailments, buffs, critical hits and plenty other things involved as well.\n\nDifficulty\n\nThe game lets you pick the difficulty setting from Walk in a park, Afternoon Stroll, Grueling Campaign or Inhumane odysseu, but even the Walk in a park isn't exactly a cakewalk for newcomer, while Inhumane Odysseu often catches even experienced players by surprise. You also choose your class, perks, and wether you'd like to start with some items from your previous misadventures, so game lets you have very much control over the level of difficulty.\n\nOverall\n\nI enjoyed this game immensely. When i got it for around 0,60\u20ac, I felt like I was robbing the developer, because this game is a rare gem that has great potential. So I was just happy to pay the 5-ish \u20ac for the new DLC, as I felt I had finally paid him back.\nThe game is addictive (albeit a bit repetitive), and easily triggers the \"ONE MORE RUN\" -feeling, that made me waste many evenings while trying to overcome hardest ordeals the game had to throw at me.", "timestamp_created": 1440713831, "timestamp_updated": 1440844606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836703002452850342", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17733189": {"recommendationid": "17733189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013359889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3320, "last_played": 1442420752}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic roguelike that at first glance seems very simple with not much content, but if you keep playing you'll find there is actually a ton of content and a large amount of depth.

However what if you don't want to fight the demonlord? Befriend him, and take him to fight to the true boss[spoiler] The ever growing darkness you had run from the whole time![/spoiler]\n\n[b]Gear/Items galor[/b]\nProgressing through the world will net you countless weapons and armor. But the fun doesn't end there! You will occasionaly find scrolls that can enchant your weapon/armor to make them stronger,ignite enemies, confuse enemies, and root them in place. Really like your weapon? Store it in the vault to use it in your next run to get an upper hand earlier. \n\n[b]Allies/Quests[/b]\nThrough out your time playing, you will come across allies that can help you in various ways and interact with other characters that might have otherwise attacked you if you didn't have them with you. You might find allies that only fight others might have unique abilities to help you get good items and others... are a little bit unique in thier own way. Some of the allies you come across have quests that they ask you to help them with and reward you for completing it often with strong gear you cant get else where.\n\n[b]Countless Unlocks[/b]\nAchivements for death can be used to unlock perks, classes faster, or extra vaultspace which in turn makes you upcoming runs easier or allow you to do things you couldn't without them. Get extra gold at the start to make use of the random shop/fortune teller that spawns at the start. Possibly get extra Charm to get an ally ealier to help you. Bring a loyal pet to assist you in fights that levels beside you. The amount of things you can discover and unlock are insane.\n\nNow, with that out of the way. There are infact some flaws to the game that might be a turn off to some people and here are a few i have noticed.\n\n[h1]Turn offs for some[/h1]\n[b]Grindy Gameplay[/b]\nYou are not going to be that strong from the very start, and it will take quite a few runs to get up to a good standing. Some runs can last up to an hour in length just to complete. Even some areas can't be accessed without the proper items(However this can be avoided by killing the npc/breaking down the door!)\n\n[b]Repetitive Gameplay[/b]\nAs you might have noticed all you pretty much do is move right, and that restricts you to explores all of the map sometimes. With the only way to unlock perks/extra vaultspace is by building up enough points from winning/losing a run. the first 30~40 minutes of the game are going to be fighting only the first boss due to it being to hard/impossible to fight the other boss/achieve the other ending.\n\n[b]Easy/Hard Difficulty[/b]\nSome parts of the game are extremely easy and don't take much effort to complete where others can take hours to achieve and sometimes go wasted when you die and forget to save.

All in all, it's worth the low cost, but bear in mind that it can be a bit repetitive after awhile.\n\nHave not tried the new expansion yet.", "timestamp_created": 1440069378, "timestamp_updated": 1440297344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537275075912475586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17627660": {"recommendationid": "17627660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075864634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1440277339}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1440068965, "timestamp_updated": 1440068965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17626403": {"recommendationid": "17626403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043200509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1467585124}, "language": "english", "review": "Very hard to get used to the controls for some reason, but once you do the game is amazing, i suggest playing it while watching a walk-through for it so that you can better understand the world you've entered. The game itself isn't inherently hard, but you have so little to work with that it takes getting used to. Warning to new players to stay away from Golems, they have set spawn locations per world and they are nasty with or without an axe (which does more damage to them).\n\nCharacters can be unlocked with points rewarded for your progress after each death or by completeing a certain feat. You can use these points to get a vault and add space to said vault. The Vault NPC is in the set spawn for each character. I recommend always keeping a Key of Seals in the Vault if you manage to come across one. Keys of Seals are used on Temples and can give you Holy Artifacts. My first holy artifact was an Axe that crushed everything before me. By the time it had worn down i found another temple and another key of seals, and got a Holy Spear and Holy Chest Armor. Made it the last 80 km to the Demon Loard and killed him with no struggle. \n\nI've only gotten 2.8 hrs of playtime in the time of this review, but i could easily put 200 hours into it. It's cheap for it's value of entertainment, and if you end up in a poor spawn you can always just continue again. \n\nMore tips\n-Always buy from a Chef When/If you reach a town. They seem pricey but in actuality they are cheap and extremely valuable.\n-This game is about Trade-offs, you may end up choosing things that are detrimental to the world you spawn on.\n-More expensive is not always better, especially when you do not have a high enough Item-Appraisal to know what you are buying.\n-Randomly Generated worlds always have their problems, the largest map wrecker in this game is large mountain walls that you have to climb. They take a great deal of turns to climb and eat your stamina, if you find yourself having to climb mountains frequently you will die, and you may want to explore a different route or a new world entirely.\n-Chests in the water are also death-traps but if you can manage it, they may offer useful loot.\n-Teleportation Pills will save you from Bandits, Bears, or Golems.\n-Axes will destroy walls and chests with ease for better dungeon navigation.\n-Bows and Lances will help you kill your enemies from a distance, very beginner friendly weapons, unless you have no arrows. \n\nNegatives about this game - \n\nThe loss of your character after completeing the game is without a doubt a loss, but the ability to save his gear makes up for it, despite the fact it is battered and will probably have to be repaired despite my deep loathing of the brittle debuff.", "timestamp_created": 1440060479, "timestamp_updated": 1440060479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530386745929718018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17625603": {"recommendationid": "17625603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044766303", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1440131163}, "language": "english", "review": "Started game.

Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Cutesy? Yes. Frustrating? Perhaps. Addictive? Most definitely.\n\nOne Way Heroics is a nice little game created in Wolf RPG Editor. When I first played it, I was excited. Games like this always caught my eye and the dialogue the characters/NPC's have only made it more fun. A tad bit silly, but nonetheless still great. So, I started it up and was ready to play. I thought it would be rather simple. It looked easy enough to do; Avoid the darkness consuming the world. In other words, avoid getting scrolled off the screen. I fought monsters along the way. It was very tedious, sure, but entertaining. Then, finally, I encountered the boss, the Demon Lord. I swear, I have never been defeated so quickly by a boss in my entire lifetime. \n\nEager to defeat him, I retried. And thus started the endless cycle of trying to successfully defeat the Demon Lord.\n\nThis game is a bundle of joy, frustration, and addiction. You are provided with numerous classes to choose from and to defeat the Demon Lord with. Each world is randomly generated so there are always new surprises to look forward to. You are also given opportunities to save here and there, so if you are absolutely certain this particular world is suitable for you to achieve your goals, then save at a save point and viola! No need to worry about losing your progress. There are also a number of skills you can obtain, as well as weapons, armor, items, partners - you name it. In addition to the gameplay, the soundtrack is beautiful, enjoyable, and is certainly enough to keep you motivated. Obviously, the graphics are pixelated (with the exception of when character dialogue pops up), but the art is nice and I will admit that I find some of the monsters rather cutesy.\n\nI somehow managed to hop off this game for a while (which was good because if I hadn't, it would've been an unhealthy addiction for me), but I have taken note that the One Way Heroics Plus DLC is coming around Steam sometime soon, so I'll definitely be playing soon again. Do I recommend this game? Of course I do! If you choose to purchase this game, I now wish you all the good luck on your journey to defeat the Demon Lord!", "timestamp_created": 1439278104, "timestamp_updated": 1439278104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17466022": {"recommendationid": "17466022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069137183", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1437781367}, "language": "english", "review": "Confusing game at start.

Derecha = Aventura\"[/b]\n\nEste Rogue-Like RPG Japones muestra una atrayente portada de lo que podria ser un juego del cual podria llevarnos a nuestros juegos de infancia, los RPG 2D los cuales eran tan simples y tan dificiles, que sin importar que, pasabamos horas y horas de adicci\u00f3n e intriga jugando para seguir entendiendo el juego y su historia (habiendo una en la cual enfocarnos). Siguiendo la musica que acompa\u00f1a sus simples mecanicas y combates, esos juegos nos dejaban una gran satisfacci\u00f3n a la hora de jugarlos.\nEste JRPG promete eso y mucho mas superando expectativas... Si estas preparado a correr a tu derecha.\n\n[b]Historia/Tematica:[/b]\n\n\"La Oscuridad\" ha sido invocada por el \"Demon Lord\" para que con unico proposito, devore todo lo que llegue a pasar por delante. Animales y humanos que sean tragados por \"La Oscuridad\" han de poder sufrir la muerte o la mutaci\u00f3n de seres malignos esparcidos por el planeta para seguir haciendo estragos a medida que La Oscuridad sigue avanzando lentamente desde la parte izquierda hasta la derecha para seguir cumpliendo su labor.\nTu siendo el hero\u00e9 del reino el cual todos colocan tus esperanzas en ti, has sido asignado por el rey con la gran misi\u00f3n de detener a \"La Oscuridad\" matando al \"Demon Lord\" acompa\u00f1ado de tu fiel acompa\u00f1ante consejera \"Fairy Iris\"... Pero las cosas a veces no solo pueden ser como creemos.\n\n[b]Arte Visual:[/b]\n\n2D totalmente atrayente y muy nostalgico. Desde las monta\u00f1as, hierbas mas peque\u00f1as, colores y detalles infimos de la armadura de los personajes, y los retratos de los personajes en la parte inferior izquierda ya dibujado los cuales dependiendo del \n\npersonaje pueden cambiar ciertos detalles faciales del mismo. Para nada pesado a la hora de jugar que se hace totalmente comodo y calza a la perfeccion con la sintonia de la aventura.\nA primera vista te quedas un poco impresionado al ver cierta linea negra al lado izquierdo del mapa ya siendo un poco mas sobresaliente... Mas de uno caminara directamente hacia alla, asi consegui el primer logro.\n\n[b]Arte Auditivo/Musical:[/b]\n\nMientras mas vas caminando, escapando de la oscuridad y luchando contra los enemigos, monstruos, bandidos, hasta llegando a pueblos y pasando por otro tipo de ambientes, la musica va a ir cambiando de una forma tan grata o hasta perfecta para el momento lo cual nunca hara que uno se aburra de ella. Mas de una vez quedaras mas y mas tiempo queriendo seguir jugando sin importar cuantas veces mueras debido a cuanto te puede absorber su musica recordando hasta los videojuegos de tu infancia.\n\n[b]Controles e Interfaz:[/b]\n\nPara nada dificiles para el usuario llegarse a acostumbrar a ellos, en cuestion de solo unos pocos minutos ya se puede \nfamiliarizar con ellos. Pero en momentos de peligro debemos de ser sumamente cuidadosos ya que un solo movimiento nos puede costar la partida a causa de los nervios o no pensar nuestros movimientos con cierta perspicacia. Su \"Men\u00fa\" y \"Opciones\" son totalmente comodos y gratas al usuario de usar sin ningun tipo de complicaci\u00f3n para lograr mayor enfoque del mismo en su gameplay.\n\n[b]Jugabilidad:[/b]\n\nOne Way Heroics es un \"Rogue-like Rol JRPG Indie\" por turnos. Por cada cantidad de movimientos que hagamos, y dependiendo del ataque que hagamos (Y habilidades), \"La Oscuridad\" avanzara. No solo deberemos preocuparnos por mantener nuestra distancia contra la desconocida y malvada oscuridad que mantiene un ritmo muy constante, sino que cierto tipo de obstaculos como monta\u00f1as y lagos los cuales al pasar atrav\u00e9s de ellos nos pueden llegar a quitar entre 5-10 turnos mas \"Stamina\".\nMataremos monstruos para ganar experiencia y subir de nivel a medida que vaya pasando la travesia.\nPasaremos atrav\u00e9s de dungeons las cuales nos veremos un tanto obligados a medir nuestros movimientos ya que, si tardamos mucho tiempo entre abrir los cofres y \"explorar\" nos podriamos ver atrapados entre \"La oscuridad y la pared\". Ciertamente puedes romper la pared. Y... \u00bfSi no da tiempo? \u00bfSi el arma se rompe antes de poder romper la pared?\nLas armas tienen sus limites de usos, sean dagas, espadas, hachas, varitas, escudos, petos, etc, etc. Muchas veces deberemos de tener cuidado en que armas que queremos conservar para reparar o tirar para seguir teniendo capacidad en nuestro inventario y seguir moviendonos, ya que constamos de una \"Capacity\" (capacidad) de cuanto \"Weight\" (peso) podremos cargar con nosotros. Si llevamos mas del limite, no nos podremos mover, causando que nuestros movimientos sean anulados. \"La Oscuridad\" tambien se detendra si tu no te mueves, modo del juego que permite darte cierto descanso mientras decides que agarrar y desechar, pero los monstruos no lo daran.\n\n- Diferentes clases con sus diferentes habilidades cada cual las cuales iras desbloqueando con \"Hero Points\" al igual que los \"Perks\"\n- \"Perks\" que se compraran para la mejora de tu personaje cuando se empieza una nueva partida.\n- \"Hero Points\" los cuales se conseguiran por tu record en tu partida despues de finalizar el juego o morir.\n- Vault Dimensional en el cual seremos capaces de guardar cualquier objeto para futuras partidas.\n- 4 modos de juegos, uno mas dificil que otro monstrando cada uno beneficios y contras, sin contar su \"Maniac Mode\".\n- Humor inocente y sano en ciertos momentos de juego y entre \"Loading screens\"\n- Precio totalmente bajo para una gran experiencia de aventura y muchas horas de entretenimiento.\n\n9.5/10\n\nMentor/Curator de [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/VaomGaming#]Vaom Gaming[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1439082152, "timestamp_updated": 1439168686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650473415851593018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17449693": {"recommendationid": "17449693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171119946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9371, "last_played": 1662335533}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably my favorite rogue-like so far.

Considering the fact that it was purchasable for less than a dollar--as well as its high approval rating--I figured I'd give it a try.\n\nThe game's concept is a fun play on a classic video game trope--the left side of the screen is literally a huge wave of annihilation, and anything that is consumed by it is obliterated. It's up to a multiverse-travelling hero (the player) to face this apocalyptic force and save the world!\n\nFor the price, I've found the game to be thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly diverse. As many others have mentioned before me, the soundtrack is great. There's a large number of tunes for each biome, enemy encounters, and structures in the world. The number of potential classes to play as and the different ways to win also gives it a nice boost to replayability. A large variety of variables can be changed to make the game easier or harder, depending on your preference.\n\n---GRIPES\nThere's only a few personal gripes I've had so far (and they are small). First, while there is a large number of biomes for the world, I would have liked more types of natural and constructed obstacles. Water is one such element present in the game, but it tends to be little more than a mild variation in the terrain. Occasionally, lakes will spawn with chests in the middle of them, but otherwise they're fairly generic and feel a little short of their potential in the game's unique setup.\n\nAnother minor issue is that some classes are noticeably harder to play with. I'd like to play more as an Adventurer, for example, but the class's physical weakness and emphasis on running away makes it difficult to level up and increase their equipment load (something this thief-like class desperately needs in order to maximize their chest-looting!).\n\n---OVERALL\nOverall, it's a fun game that I'm still enjoying at the point of this review. I should warn that--like every other game--it's not necessarily for everyone. If you're not a fan of roguelikes or RPGs, you might have some difficulty getting into the live-grind-die-repeat cycle you'll quickly recognize in the game. There's also a noticeable manga/anime influence in the art and storytelling style,  which might clash with some players (personally I enjoyed it, particularly the game's humor).\n\nI should also mention that the game seems to have an expansion that adds content such as more companions, classes, and gameplay elements. I unfortunately haven't had the chance yet to try it--it's currently unavailable on Steam--but the presence of its Achievements here hints at its eventual release.\n\nPersonally, I've enjoyed this little hidden gem, and feel that my less-than-a-dollar was well-spent.", "timestamp_created": 1437625913, "timestamp_updated": 1437625913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17182720": {"recommendationid": "17182720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005895667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1437625382}, "language": "english", "review": "This little gem has my attention right now.\n\nSurprisingly fun!!

If you like to complete a game and put it away, your experience may be lacking.\n\n\n\nThis review is somewhat late, as I beat it several months ago. It only took me about 4-6 playthroughs if I remember right. I think I only unlocked 2 additional classes and barely any of the other content, as I was able to \"win\" through the luck of the RNG. I am someone who does not mind restarting games over and over due to dying and learning, but I can't say I like replaying a game once I've beat it.\n\nOne Way Heroics has fairly standard roguelike combat which I got the hang of fairly easily having played other games. The darkness adds an additional layer to this, almost making it like chess - you have to be able to plan your moves several steps ahead, taking into account each enemy's movement speed, movement patterns, item locations, and whether you might get trapped by the terrain. This can all be done fairly rapidly in most areas outside towns and dungeons. The game, being a rogelike, has a decent amount of teaching through experience and playthroughs.\n\nThe big big big gripe I have with the game, and is the primary reason I wish I could give a \"mixed\" rating? I managed to kill the dark lord before I think I should have been able to. I discovered one of the special artifact items and managed to fight him inside a town. Just a single artifact, my level wasn't that high. I truly expected him to be harder. Then I expected that to not be all and for the devs to pull a \"Disc 1 final boss\" on me. But no, the Big Bad of the game can be defeated by simply holeing up in an inn with a single artifact weapon and blowing all your items and special abilities.  I had no longer felt a real desire to play it afterwards.\n\nHowever, this is my personal taste. While I find the idea of NG+ and completing a game many many times fairly dull (in most cases) for those people who DO like that sort of gameplay, this is a decent offering. I didn't encounter many, if any bugs in my playing, and the visuals are uniformly presented with nothing that seemed out of place.

This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.\n\n=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=\n1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything.\n2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]\n3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.\n\n=REVIEW=\nNow what can i say about this game? That it is worth the money. It is a small game with only one purpose for you. Go forth and kill stuff. But there is a twist to it. The World is ending and you are the legendary hero to venture out and try to get ahead of what is coming after you to kill you. And what is that right behind you? Pure Darkness.\n\nThis game leads in a certain direction and that one is Right. You go as far as you can get to meet at the end the Bad guy to stop the End of the World. But that is not an easy task. Even though this game is semi roguelike you wont have that much trouble with it like other roguelike games. Over the time of you playing you will die. But everytime you can transfer items into a little box that is between the dimensions. And as soon as you visit a new world you can decide if you want to take it with you or not. This makes the game a bit more enjoyable and easier for you. But in the end it depends on you how it ends.\n\nThe game brings you into a randomly generated world. Here will the Adventure begin and here you can do whatever you want. Go on and kill some bad guys. You are the Hero. Go into the Taverns and buy gear and let the people help you. Or just kill them and their guards. That is right. You are allowed to do everything you want. Kill, destroy and so on and so forth. But there is a nice twist to it. If you are the great Hero you are able to find people that want to help you defeating the bad guy. And since everyone trusts you they will not attack you when seeing you. If you do attack other people though the game will punish you. The word goes around very fast and in other inns or taverns the guards will recognize you for what you did and will try to kill you.

It can be considered a roguelike, but permadeath is not really present. However, the game rewards those who make it to the end without dying or saving (yes, you can save). So basically, it's you who decide the kind of experience you want. And there's the variety you expect for this kind of game: 8 classes, 8 difficulty levels, lots of customizable weapons and armor (which will break with frequent use) and accessories, enemies, maps, NPC's, endings, daily updated campaigns with special conditions, cool music, art and animation. Like the game says, the only constant is darkness. You will always need to go to the right of the map, as the left is constantly destroyed. And it all works well. Definitely worth it's price, because there's a lot of replayability, the game is addictive and you won't get bored soon.\nI also strongly recommend it's \"Plus\" DLC, because it is a true expansion to an already great game, adding lots of content like 3 new classes, tons of new items, new area types, new enemies and NPC's, 2 new companions, and 12 new epilogues, including a new, hard final boss. The DLC may be expensive when compared to the \"base\" version, but since the \"base\" version is usually cheap, the DLC cost will feel balanced if you consider the total amount of content you're getting. The DLC also installs like a new game, separated from the \"base\" game with a launcher. This is cool because some aspects were balanced and tweaked, so you can go back to the \"base\" version at any time if you like. However, you can only import your save to the \"Plus\" version. If, like me, you done everything in the \"base\" game and want more, this is for you. There's plenty of new content here (around 50%) while the game still feels the same (which is great). For the same reason, if you didn't liked the \"base\" game, you won't like the \"Plus\" content. If you're a new player, i recommend jumping straight to the \"Plus\" version, because you'll get the best One Way Heroics experience to date, with all the content from the \"base\" version.

You will find yourself a new challenge almost every single day.\n\nThe game plays good, has controller support, has a good learning curve, and it makes you feel like a real hero when you accomplish something.\n\nThe cons?\nWell if you don't like dying a lot, then this is not the game for you. One mistake or wrong decision can get you trapped and sometimes the game will be unfair to you.\nSometimes you will see the game paused with the message \"loading map\" which is a slight setback in pace.\nClasses are a little bit unbalanced (in my opinion this only adds more challenge for those willing to take the risk)\nMaybe if you are really looking for a complex story in a game this might be a let down. (You are the hero, save the day, thats about it)\nBut that is right about it for the Cons.\n\nIn short, while I only have 9 hours currently into the game, it feels like it has been minutes.\nIf you are looking for a cheap game that is worth the price, and that will consume your time like there is no tomorrow, you will not be disappointed with One Way Heroics.", "timestamp_created": 1432198951, "timestamp_updated": 1432198951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540229856967926025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15922313": {"recommendationid": "15922313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051346525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1057, "last_played": 1439264345}, "language": "english", "review": "Great combination of procedurally generated and RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1432178200, "timestamp_updated": 1432178200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15909655": {"recommendationid": "15909655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116127011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 10202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3133, "last_played": 1623319779}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a fun Roguelike dungeon crawler where the entire world is your \"dungeon\".

The goal of the game is to stop the darkness from spreading which you do by defeating the Dark Lord who appears after 400km (Walk in the park mode) or randomly set distances in every other mode. With Walk in the park (easy) mode the Dark Lord only spawns once but chases you indefinitely until either of you dies while with other modes the Dark Lord will despawn if he doesn't kill you within 3 hours game time (aprox 27 actions) and it's spawn timer will reset.\n\nAfter each attempt win or loose, the dungeon crawler portion of the game kicks in. Your performance will be rated and you will get an amount of hero points based on how well you did.

One of the most noticable ones is that the game takes place on a world map, each move will take you one turn and the darkness on the left side of the screen will draw closer. Basically as you move and battle across the world, darkness will consume everything behind you. Be it an enemy, friendly npc, objects or the entire terrain. You have to avoid it at all costs. During your journey you can find various loot and treasures. From simple weapons and armors up to supplies and precious magic scrolls. The rpg mechanics are fairly generic, you defeat enemies and gain level points which can be spent later on cetain spots on the map. Although you still increase your stats normally by gaining experience. Various weapons and armors have different attributes. Scrolls and magic items might have special abilities, pretty much the usual roguelike stuff.\n\nCombat is extremely simple and only requires you to attack the enemy by pressing one key, then a series of dice rolls will determine everything. It's not that engaging but yet very enjoyable mainly due to the smooth controls and fast pace of the game. Your character has certain special abilities though that require stamina points which are automatically generated as long as your energy is high enough. Energy is another ressource and acts mostly as a starvation meter. You lose energy with each term and depending on the terrain, you might lose even more. You refill your energy by consuming various food items.\n\nNow let me explain the goal of the game and perhaps one of it's more compelling features. As soon as you start a new run, your goal is to defeat the Demon Lord which appears in 400km in the world map. During those 400km, you want to level up and get the most loot in order to prepare for the final encounter. But due to the darkness, time  management is vital and you have to carefully plan ahead your moves. Even if the combat is simple, there are many things to take into factor. For instance various terrain types can give you additional bonues/mali, some enemies are more resistant than others to various weapons. Furthermore with the spreading darkness, you really want to make the combat the most efficent as possible. Turning it into somewhat of a puzzle game. During your journey, you can also meet tons of charactets that have their own quests, some may join you on your journey. Others provide services or act as merchants. Finally there is a lot of variety and content in this game, there are tons of classes and things to unlock. Each generated map feels really unique and offers different challenges.\n\nAlso the game let's you save items that your next character can chose right at the start of a new run. So there is some progression in this game, furthermore you can spent a rare currency to save at certain points of the maps.\n\nTo conclude, there is a lot to talk about but this game is definitely a blast to play and offers something refreshing to the roguelike formula. It really conveys a sense of adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1430458978, "timestamp_updated": 1430458978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15623156": {"recommendationid": "15623156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145443788", "num_games_owned": 581, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1503647886}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a awasome game and its a great change from modern day fps", "timestamp_created": 1430402610, "timestamp_updated": 1430402610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15619530": {"recommendationid": "15619530", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989317695", "num_games_owned": 2749, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1430452403}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty cool game.

So, i moved on from that.\n\nThen I moved on from the graphics. After all - I still play Master of Magic. Sure, that game is 21 years old and this game is the ripe old age of 1, but hey - the old adage that playability trumps graphics is alive and well.\n\nThe other comment to make is the balance. Some rogue-likes out at the moment are really hard. Fun, but searingly hard. This one is still damn hard, but play it through a few times and you can absolutely get your wins. Loving it. And it's crazy good value! Particularly right now. It's on sale for $1.18. That's just stupid. As in, stupidly good. You pay more than that for a piece of crap on the iTunes store...

En cuanto al juego en s\u00ed, lo primero que pens\u00e9 es que ser\u00eda una cosa muy repetitiva en el que siempre haces lo mismo sin ninguna diversi\u00f3n (matar, correr, matar, morir)... y por el contrario, es un impresionante juego con mucha diversi\u00f3n.\n\nLa primera cosa que me di cuenta es que siempre voy a querer jugar m\u00e1s. Yo no soy un fan de los juegos donde se tiene una cantidad limitada de tiempo para hacer algo, pero la oscuridad me empujo a ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1 en el juego, y le da un impulso de adrenalina incre\u00edble.\n\nLa segunda cosa es que yo soy un gran fan de RPG's y tal, y este juego es de los que pongo mi alma en mi personaje. Hay tantas posibilidades, no se puede evitar este juego si te encanta algo diferente cada vez que le pones \"Juego Nuevo\".\n\nAs\u00ed que supongo que voy a hacer una especie de resumen:\n\nPros:\n+ Juego muy divertido, nunca se vuelve aburrido\n+ Gr\u00e1ficos bastante decente\n+ \"S\u00f3lo una m\u00e1s vez\" o \"5 Minutors m\u00e1s\" -tipo de juego\n+ Uno de apuesta no es tan largo hasta que encuentre un punto de guardado / morir, por lo que puede jugar a este cuando est\u00e1s aburrido y tienen poco tiempo para jugar.\n+ Mi fetish de RPG's... o sea el alma se complace\n+ Es muy divertido a veces \"Corre Forest, Corre\"\n+ Tu hada personal dira que te ba\u00f1es ya que llevas tiempo sin levantarte.\n+ Gran durabilidad \n\nContras:\n- No hay mucho en cuanto a la Creaci\u00f3n de un Personaje, dos apariencias y con un 3ero que es desbloqueado... sin embargo usar las clases es lo divertido y dificil. \n- Los mundos creados al azar pueden ir desde \"Que ch$%&%# es esto!?\" a \"LOL no tengo oportunidad..\".

Por que a mi!?!?\" \n\nComo Conclusi\u00f3n:\n\n\u00bfTe aconsejo comprar este juego? Depende.

With a total of 8 classes (3 initial classes if my memory serves me right), it adds variety and replay value. Though some might see themselves inclined to a certain class since it is kind of OP. There are dirty humors within the dialogues too, though it's mild enough (unless you understand the references or the language).\nThe maps are limited, in which you will notice after a few hours. Though their sequences and contents may change depending on the dimension/campaign you will play through. \n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] You'll mostly see pixel graphics in this game except when character dialogues pop up. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n[b]Audio:[/b] The game showcases good, quality music. The tracks change depending on the area you are currently at which creates the mood of the setting.Even though I already have played the game repeatedly, the charm of it still lingers fresh to my ears. Sometimes, I find myself opening up the game and idling on the menu screen while listening to the opening/menu soundtrack.\n\n[h1][u][b]The Verdict[/b][/u][/h1]\n\nFor a game that packs a lot of replay value, comedic references, good RPG transition and a unique side-scrolling mechanic, it is already a great deal by itself even without discount. A must-buy for JRPG fans.\n\nIf you are asking if this game is worth its value, my answer is [b]\"Yes, it is worth it\"[/b].\n\n[quote]If you would like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/]reviews[/url], or follow our curator group at [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GoodGamesGR#curation]Good Games Giveaways & Reviews[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1426681387, "timestamp_updated": 1458335021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738088250160217285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14941636": {"recommendationid": "14941636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067625216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1567649562}, "language": "english", "review": "Sort of like Passage, but fun and a JRPG.

But never did I expect the amount of content, replayability and just plain fun I have had with this game so far. I haven't even tried out harder difficulties and many of the classes I have yet to unlock! I'll tell you about some time spent in game.\n\nI played this a bit on my own and a friend said it looked interesting. So I got it for him...the price is too good *insert subliminal buy now message* and Smoking Wolf deserves it for the excellent work!\nThis game isn't co-op but we chose the same map to kinda compete and help each other out. \nWe got into the same map. A nice, easy, stroll in the park difficulty map for his first time. He chose the Swordmaster class and I choose the Force user. Me being all experienced from my 2-3 hours game time, ran off looking for treasures, things to kill and xp. \nWhile happily one shotting every thing (first time Force user class...dayum) he asks some questions about the mechanics, the tutorial isn't great but you can figure most things out.\nI run into a Carzy Dragon knight, or something simliar, whom I one shot with glee because these guys are tough and I've died to them many times! \nMeanwhile my friend runs around, way behind, having a grand time. Some time passes.\nSuddenly he yells:\n \"Oh **** that guy just killed me!\"\nMe: \"What? Who killed you?\"\nHim: \"Some guy in a building! What the hell!? He just killed me in one hit!\" \nMe: \"Huh? Where? All these creeps are pretty basic. Noob! Thought you had this old gamer style!? Hahahahaha!\" \n\nWe pride ourselves on being born gamers (another way of saying we are getting old), because we do well or above average in most games, having played games since the first Commodores. So if a game is hard or we fail our pride takes quite a hit.\n\nHim: \"Some green dude in building with chests. What the ****!? Such BS...\"\n\nRealization dawns. Fail friend...\n\nMe: \"Hahahahaa! Sorry dude forgot to tell you those green dragon knight guys are very tough! I had no problem. Just one shot them muehehehehehe.\"\n\nWith his fail run of the map he somehow managed to unlock the Adventurer class and decides to try it out on the same map.\n\nHim: \"Ok so screw that place, Ima go ova mere.\" Apologies...he actually talks like that.\nHim: \"OMF A ****ING BEAR!\"NOOO!!\"\nMe: \"Hahaahhaa a bear!? What the hell man, you have the worste luck!\"\nHim: \"Noooo! He has friends!! They're chasing meeeee! They're chasing meeeeee!!! Aahhhh!\"\n\nJust rofling at his attempts to run away from the killer bears. He dies horribly gain.\n\nHim: \"**** those bears. I'm gonna get them.\"\nMe: \"Dude bears are sick, we don't even have gear or levels to kill them, just go take another route.\"\nHim: \"Nah **** that. Them bears are going down!\"\nMe: \"Psh, good luck fool.\"\n\nHe restarts.\n\nHim: \"Ok they're coming for me, gonna lead them to these guards.\"\nMe: \"Could work, maybe.\"\nim: \"Shweet! The guards did all the work for me! See I told you I'd get those bastards!\"\nMe: \"Nice one. Now you can finally catch up. Sheesh you suck! You've only gone like 20km all this time. I'm almost to the Demon Lord.\" \nHim: \"Oh my sweet cheesus balls...\"\nMe: \"More bears?\"\nHim: \"Duuuuuuude...\"\nMe: \"What?\"\nHim: \"Duuuuuuude...\"\nMe: \"WHAT?!\"\nHim: \"Duuuuuuude...I just picked up a Godslaying longsword....\"\nMe: \"What the ****!? Where?\" <----already turning jelly.\nHim: \"From a Feral Dog! Hahaha! I just killed it and it dropped this! It has X and Y and OMFG check this Z out\"\nMe: \"...\"  -.-\nHim: \"Omg this thing is ridiculous! ###dmg in one hit! Gib, hahahahahah...gib, hahahahahaha!\"\nMe: \"How the **** does that drop from a dog!?\" all jelly now, and greedy.\nHim: \"I dunno. You're s'posed to be the expert...gib, hahahahahaha!\"\nMe: \"...\" full of jelly and careless.\nMe: \"**** I just died trying to open a stupid chest.\"\nHim: \"The darkness?\"\nMe: \"Yes the darkness.\"\nHim: \"Noob. Gib, hahahahahah!\"\n\nHe dies later because he didn't watch his Hp and we decide that dimension YYOCIFHH  has beaten us...for now. But HE gets to take his Godslaying sword over to the next level if he wants...where is MY Godlsaying longsword?? Sorry. Still jelly he got it and I didn't.\n\nThis is what I like about this game:\n\nCool new map any time you want. Adventuring and never knowing what you might find.\nLeveling and getting loot...so much loot. I cry a little bit every time I have to drop an unidentified item.\nThe mechanics and gameplay are simple but I think mastering each class will be a challenge.\nThis is \"Roguelike\" to a degree but far enough away to not make it grindy, repetitive and boring after 20 games. \n\nI never expected this to become one the games I regard with this much respect.\nSo grab it! *insert subliminal buy now message* You won't regret spending a penny.\n\nThanks for reading and thanks for a cool game Mr Wolf!", "timestamp_created": 1426597804, "timestamp_updated": 1426598163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520913541316986084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14929363": {"recommendationid": "14929363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073264393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1618119743}, "language": "english", "review": "To be quite honest I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this game.

Plenty of people have done that, aped their style and failed. So you know you need to create a simple RPG, but you need to use all the gathered knowledge and experience of the past 20 years of RPGs to shake out what works, what doesn't, what's fun, what's not, what worked then that doesn't work now and what works now that wouldn't have worked then.\n\nCongratulations, you've just created One Way Heroics: An early 90's style RPG informed by the knowledge of the past 20 years of RPGs!\n\nThe storyline is simple: Save the world. Classic, right?\nWell, thing is, you're on a timeline. That's new.\nIt also makes it very difficult to explore everywhere and talk to everyone--two things you MUST DO in an RPG!\nAh, but the game is randomly generated, and you can re-visit a world by re-entering the seed (think something similar to old save codes). That's both new and old!\nBut there are save slots too, if you reach the classic save point. That's old.\nWhen you die, you can transfer some of your experience and gear to your next playthrough. That's new!\nSo too is using some of that to unlock new classes and perks!\nThis revisiting, this ability to replay worlds and continue on after failure with an overarching metagame leads to another thing that works now which wouldn't have worked so well in an older RPG: The game can be run through and beaten in a couple of hours or less.\n\nThis game brings in some of the best aspects of casual games and hardcore games, of old RPGs and new RPGs, to make a great RPG you can put down and pick right back up on later. I honestly feel a little bad only paying 87 cents for it due to a sale, but the game is under 5 bucks normally... still a steal, considering it doesn't play like a $5 game!\n\nIf you like RPGs but no longer have time for them, this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1426211003, "timestamp_updated": 1426211003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14851195": {"recommendationid": "14851195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039153112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1617548259}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like an addictive, insanely fast paced hybrid of Super Mario, Final Fantasy, and Legend of Zelda.

After your first attempt and death you are awarded with hero point and you can use these to buy mor dimensional vault slots and perks that you can use for the next attempt. Becuase of this every playthrough becomes valuable as you have to try you best every time to get good stuff and even though you may fail at beating the boss at that atempt the stuff you gathered can be stored in the dimensional vault and be withrawn at the start of the next game.\n\nThe game itself can be a little bit disappointing when you walk around and see a house or dungeon way too many steps away and you see it disappearing in the shadow every step you take, but be sure that there's going to be way more epic loot ahead. And if you are really obssesed with entering precisly that house you can reload the same world with the next charachter if you want to do so.\n\nPersonally i find the Pirate class to be the best one. Yeah he may have negative charisma making the villagers hate his face, but after adding 2 charisma+ perks everything is fine.

After the character creation and a bit of customisation you are dropped into a randomly generated world with death coming for you from the left side of the screen and adventure, loot and almost certain death waiting for you on the right. Every time you move, fight, use an object or talk, the world moves on: enemies act and the darkness comes a little bit closer, forcing you to plan your next moves well. Do you want to try going for that treasure chest? Kill that enemy? Explore that building? Maybe talk to a merchant somewhere else on the screen? You are very unlikely to be able to do everything. Luckily, you can generally move a bit faster than the darkness, so even if you let it come close, you will be able to outrun it for a bit again, provided you don't waste too much time for a bit. If you make it far enough, a boss will show up and you can win the game... or die trying. \n\nDue to the random map generation, the difficulty of the game will vary greatly from cakewalk to trying to break a wall with your head.

You start off talking to the Queen after creating your character, now first off playing it, there are instructions on how to control, but theres still no sense of starting & learning to make your way, it just drops you in without much to know, which is quite a minus for starting out. But prior to my last sentence, once you learn, it gets better, a lot better. After you learning the controls, first thing i did was die, why was that? i pondered for the few seconds til i made another game, then i understood, the game keeps scrolling to the right, everytime you do something, & it only stops when you use an ability which makes it stop for 3 turns, which unless you are fighting, or as it suggest when to use it, breaking through walls for which i will cover later, its not always that useful, less a emergency. (it also increases damage during this period)\nAs i said before, it scrolls constantly every turn, & thus this is were the hard choices come in. Your inventory weight is limited, meaning you can only carry so much, & at the start its not that big of an inventory, its allright, but you need to increase it early on by giving up your Levels at a goddess statue in a dungeon, there are several statues, but not in all dungeons, this idea right here is also very interesting, also at the statue you can increase specific skills (Strength, Intelligence, Agility Etc.), which once again, is very interesting & cool. But then theres \"Where to go\", as you roam there are towns you can pass by which of course you can buy equipment at, & at the same time, in towns (where scrolling does not stop, still gotta keep moving) & outside of towns, there a items you can find, there are a lotta good items you can get, but the problem where in lies with inventory space, if you don't have enough, then ya can't carry, or ya gotta trade it for something else. With limited amount of moves it can be hard to get through, or get to towns & dungeons, which can have major items, but depending on your previous moves, you may not be able to get through, but alas, there is hope. Breaking walls, literally you can beak through while hopped on coolade & 'splore dem dungeons or to get through the towns. (sorry you can't actually be hopped up on coolade) the last thing to mention, past all the things i said, this game can be long, & i mean long, do not expect a short game, the goal is to get to a certain distance & fight a appearing boss, but the distance to get to the boss, can be long, because it is randomized, & even if its at like, 250 distance, getting through 200 is long enough, & it doesn't end there, everytime you start a new quest is randomized, making it different everytime, thus far longer! You either have the decision to play a random generated world, on normal, or hard (Normals hard & long enough) or there are also different modes to playthrough, which i haven't even covered cause of the main game, damn its long!\n\nOne Way Heroics, is a constantly moving, tough decision making, level sacraficing, long tough RPG, & if you like those kind of games, its the right kind for you.\nBut alas here are the plus & minuses of it.\n\nPLUSES\n+Long, with several different modes & the normal game is randomly generated.\n+Challenging, its really tough with the screen scrolling, & random hard enemys can pop up to kill ya instantly if your not prepared.\n+Its an RPG, cmon, whoz dusn' like rpgs.\n+Classes & traits, several different classes & traits to choose from & unlock as you slowly play through.\n+Randomly Generated Worlds\n+Several other different modes besides the story to play through\n+Records Your Run, after making a run, it records the entire thing, which you can save & show others.\n+A Universal Inventory, basically if yur current character dies, but you found such a cool item & ya wanna keep it, you can unlock universal inventory spaces, which can hold items for your next character.\n\nMINUS\n-Really doesn't teach you how to play, or whats happening so much at the beggining\n-Customization, while its not a big deal, there would be a bit more if you could customize your character besides there being just a gender & class choice.", "timestamp_created": 1425970737, "timestamp_updated": 1425970850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654726564884185791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14817930": {"recommendationid": "14817930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990718043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1453579861}, "language": "english", "review": "Super addicting rogue-lite, definitely worth it", "timestamp_created": 1425966226, "timestamp_updated": 1425966226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14816628": {"recommendationid": "14816628", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971291045", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1442005170}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun roguelike with a quirk that is integrated seamlessly into the gameplay.

This may seem like a simple mechanic, or maybe something that would limit the fun you could have, but it's honestly what makes this game so addicting.\n\nYou have to plan ahead. If you blindly rush into any dungeon you see you'll likely find yourself stuck behind a wall, frantically trying to break it down as the darkness creeps up from behind. You have to consider whether you can clear it before the darkness catches up, whether you have the HP and gear required to take on the monsters inside, and whether to advance into a room or wait and let the mobs come at you one by one.\n\nIt encourages you to pack all those items that you'd discard without a second thought in other games. Scroll of Confusion? Use it on the Demon Lord so you can run away while he flails randomly. Teleportation Pill? Use it when caught behind a mountain range and pray it drops you on the other side. (Seriously, watch the map. Mountains are just as dangerous as monsters.) Nayuta Fruit? Use it when in a snow area to replenish your energy. Big stone? . . . Leave it, this one is actually useless.\n\nThe character classes are reasonably varied. Each class starts with different stats and abilities depending on what their purpose is. For instance, the Knight has the Great Wall ability, which lets him regen health every turn. While the Bard has the Song of Heroism, which increases party members damage and defence. There's also an adventurer class, with stats that make him perfect for stashing as much loot as possible.\n\nThe world generation is simple, but effective. You'll be seeing the same tiles over and over again, with few real differences between the biomes. Thing is, it's the layout that matters, not the scenery. It's the generation of Alters of the Goddess, towns, Dark Brotherhood hidouts, and Golems (Be very prepared before you try to take these things on) that make each new world interesting.\n\nAfter each run you'll be awarded Hero Points which you can spend to unlock new perks, classes, and expand your Vault. (In which you can store items from your previous run, in order to use them in the next.)\n\nThe last feature, and judging from the other reviews here also the most unappreciated, are the story missions. These change every day, one day you'll be accompanied by the healer Dosey, the next you'll be tasked with rescuing the Queen. Each of these NPCs have different stories which you'll learn more about as you fight with them. These really make adventuring more interesting, and are a nice addition to the game. They didn't have to be there, but it's nice that they are.\n\nOne Way Heroics is, in my opinion, criminally underpriced.

Recruitable NPC's each have a short story, which you discover when certain conditions are met.\n[*]It has several ways to win, and hence has several endings.\n[*]There are many classes and skills to encourage replayability and experimentation.\n[*]Every play-through is different. (Maps, monsters, items are all randomly generated).\n[*]You can customize gear over several play-throughs.\n[*]The music is great.\n[*]The controls are easy to use.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Not all keyboard controls are customizable. (You can fully customize a controller though.)\n[*] RNG can be frustrating. Sometimes you're just plain unlucky, but I wish there were some guarantees in the game (ie. If you find a locked door, you have a chance to get a key).\n[*] Replayability drops off a bit after you've finished all achievements and seen every ending.\n[/list]\n\nOne Way Heroics is a fun game where you can sit down for a couple of hours and try your luck.

Leaving this as a highly recommended game for times when you are not sure what to play or when you are looking for somthing simple to pass the time. \n\nRating:\n4/5  - Good\n\n\nThank You\n\nskirby1990", "timestamp_created": 1422070099, "timestamp_updated": 1422070099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14131909": {"recommendationid": "14131909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066589894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2383, "last_played": 1477597570}, "language": "english", "review": "Seriously fun, and worth far more then the price tag would suggest - and addictive.", "timestamp_created": 1422046121, "timestamp_updated": 1422046121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14111659": {"recommendationid": "14111659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079465512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1516, "last_played": 1543642341}, "language": "english", "review": "So this game is deff on the list of games you can pick up and play for 30 or so mins.

Of course if you're a prude and you don't want to do that, you can have fun with the other classes as well. (But seriously, pirate is the only class you'll ever need did I  mention I like pirates?) The story while simple at face value, can actually get a bit complex and the characters are interesting and you will get attached to some of them, not all of them, but some of them. Also this game allows you run around butt naked punching things to death so what's not to like about that eh? All in all, a very fun game that's easy to pick up n play but can get complex if you decide to make it that way.

Perhaps many of you play roguelikes fanatically. I am not talking games like Binding of Isaac or FTL. I am talking ADOM, Nethack, Dungeon Crawl, those sorts.\n\nThose of you who do play those games may feel at times that their greatest strengths, their vast complexity and length, can often become overbearing and intimidating. By the end of any roguelike, the game becomes exhaustive. You've been at that game for days just for that one playthrough. And how many times did you have to die just to learn every special situation, and figure out every monster along the way to victory? These games require a lot of cognitive overhead and rote memorization.\n\n\n\nDoesn't it seem counterintuitive that I write a gripe about roguelikes in a recommendation for a roguelike? Yes, sure, but this is exactly what One Way Heroics tries to shy away from. It is a true roguelike, but it shies away from the issues I stated before. It plays fast and simple.

This makes for an intreasting dynamic as you try to balence exploration, monster slaying, cheast looting, and even buying and saving. For every action you take the darkness creeps a little closer. Luckily after each run you'll earn points towards buying classes (you start with two of the 8 available), Perks (you start with 3 slots and only stat perks available, you can buy skill perks and will aquire 2 more slots as you buy perks), and most importently Dimensional Vault spaces (Which allows you to carry over your best/favorite gear and items). \n\nOWH is a little light on the story but compared to a lot of rogue-likes it's on par or above. Features a party system you can take advantage of (As long as you have charisma and don't abandon the appropriate npcs to the darkness). A fair amount of gear which can hold up to 10 enchantments meaning a huge variation of what can be found/made. A MASSIVE random map generator (seriously this things HUGE you can create a world by typing in nearly anything). An online mode where you can compare your success to others and even find player ghosts which will grant you half a lv's worth of exp and a random item said character possesed. There's also multiple difficulties ranging from the very very short Walk in the Park  to the slightly more demanding Massive Odeisy, online scoring and 44 acheivements to collect. \n Now I paid full price and I'm an old school gamer so I can honestly say I've blown a lot more then the measily cost for this wonderful game in an arcade and I'm getting a ton of fun out of it, it's worth the buy!", "timestamp_created": 1418065847, "timestamp_updated": 1418096817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13278834": {"recommendationid": "13278834", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994487037", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 762, "last_played": 1514077117}, "language": "english", "review": "We don't often see console-style roguelikes - ones that handle well with a controller and are generally accessible - especially on the PC.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The number of hours of gameplay to price has proven to be a solid purchase.\n\nI do not wish to oversell.  This is a solid game.  It has both pros and cons.  However, at this price point, it's a very high return on price.\n\nThe Pros are that it's a 2d sidescrolling, roguelike, fantasy style game that contains elements of progression post rogue-like death.  The unique aspect of the game is that the world is constantly scrolling to the right, and that if the hero is trapped on the far left of the screen, it's game over.  The game offers a few classes, with more unlocked as you continue to play through, and the ability to carry forward items (how many items can be expanded as well).  It's a typical 2d fantasy style throwback game.\n\nThe Cons of this game is the seemingly random difficulty at times.  Experiencing impossible creatures right outside the starting castle, and random event demons that you can't avoid.  This can be painful if you're trying to clear with a particular class and have dedicated some game clearing items towards your hero!  As mentioned in other reviews, there's also random map loading, which can hurt continuity of the game, but is overall relatively minor.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I believe buyers will experience a

Still trying to beat it. Worth even more than its original price. \n\nGraphics: Old-school graphics, which can be a boon or curse depending on your tastes. Art style for the characters is anime-style, and I kinda like the sketch style for the PC portrait.\n\nSound and Music: the music is pretty good( especially in snow terrain), though one track seems to cut out a little when it loops. The Music does fit the mood really well every time, though. Sound effects are nothing special. \n\nStory: Being a rogue-lite, the story isn't all deep and engrossing as the heavier hitters, but has some interesting twists.\n\nCharacters: Pretty likable, actually. The way they develop as you go on your journey is great and while they're not totally original, they're awesome nonetheless. ( and the endings can get pretty touching.)\n\nGameplay: If you're dipping your feet in the rogue genre, this would be a great place to start. The Ransom aspect is there( provided you don't make perfect world by abusing the world naming system) and death is permanent, but you can reload from saves, provided you have the crystals or luck, the awakening skill helps save your ass if things don't go as planned, and the Vault helps with later playthroughs. The idea of using levels as potential stat boosters is great. There's a variety of classes, each with their own playstyle(defense, long-range, offense, charisma, etc.), though you'll have to earn a few before you get them. I love the simple idea of the side-scrolling aspect; it leads to some very tense moments( especially when in dungeons or near mountains.)And the little touches, like the NPC dialog, the varying levels for enemies, the differeing difficulties, the replays,  and even the multiplayer aspects( no co-op, but there is a way they can help... and you can show how awesome you are when you clear a world.)\n\nAll in all, if you can live with the old-school graphics, the relative lack of multiplayer and the rogue-liteness, you'll find a game that is well worth or even more than the price.

I am really moved by the plot, once you are smart enough to see through the veil and get to the deeper part of the characters and their backstories and the future you want to create for them.\n\nLet's start with the pros:\n\nMaps related;\n- Enough rogue like elements to keep players who wants new experience every time interested (create random world/enter different map codes)\n- Rogue-like features frustrates you? Don't worry, you get to stay on the same map and die as many times as you want if it pleases you. In another word, this game will provide you the opportunity to get a good learning curve, and the elements to make your future gameplay easier or more challenging, totally by your choice (such as using pre-saved items from last playthrough/death or not doing that and just hop right into a new world)\n- Maps aren't just 'different', they have different characteristics, coming with different perks and extra challenge. Pick according to your own liking/style (some of them are pre-sets with description, no worry of getting confused!)\n\nIn another word, a great deal of variety for gameplay experience and control on difficulties, pick as you desired or just go random!.\n\nGameplay;\n\n- Interesting game mechanics; More than 'move and attack'. Different classes have totally different play style (aside from knight and swordman, the 2 starting classes. Tho not having the same stats and starting items already meant a great deal of deaths and exploring for new players until they got lucky or unlock other classes). Strategies are based around classes more than how skillful you are. Also, you are at risk every moment. Move to the right or be annihilated!\n- Challenging; this is a game that you will die quite a lot in it. Is it unfair tho? Like, deliberately making the game overly punishing or clunky to play? No, nothing of those. \"How to win\" is something that needs to be learned in this game. Game difficulty scales according to how far you traveled, so no 'getting to level 99 and 1 shot the boss'. Try that and you will get one shot by a skeleton instead.\n\nPlot:\n\n- IT HAS DEPTH. Esp consider the different worlds you play in and as a result, having different play route/traveling experience. Without trying to get all the NPCS, it took me 3 clears to fully understand the story of this game, which left me almost in tears when I finally 'know'. All the npcs have more personality than you do :0) \n\nMusic:\n\n- I like them. That small ense of sadness coming from them fits very well with the atmosphere and the plot of the game.\n\n\n\nThere is so much heart in this game that this sales is totally not doing it justice!\n\n\nOk, as for the cons: \n\nOne may complain about it being 'too short' i guess. As much as I liked it, I am a bit disappointed when I see that I have only 13.4 hours on it... well, there's only that much it can offer I suppose. That keeps it concise tho! I am just sad that it ended so soon hm...\n\nGame can be a bit too punishing/unfair at times :0) like, a wrong map for new players whatnot.... that is compensated by allowing players to try different maps, preset or no. Also there are lots of sharing/walkthroughs online, just try google. Seriously tho, just because it's pixiled which may or may not remind you of FF/dragon quest, doesn't mean \"One Way Heroic\" is as easy when you first started; just move, encounter, level up and kick ass. Doesn't work like that, and it will be your ass that is kicked.\n\nNo other complaints really, you'll find the game quite fair once you actually start playing it.\n\nFor any RPG fan that doesn't mind a challenge, 10/10 must buy, esp consider its low price. You'll find it worth it, the creators deserve the respect.\n\nExtra points if you're into oldschool RPG music and characters development.... no, just the NPCs, you are as uninteresting as you ever are.\n\nEDIT: NO \"WALK IN THE PARK\" DIFFICULTY IS ALLOWED", "timestamp_created": 1417392785, "timestamp_updated": 1417398876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13165953": {"recommendationid": "13165953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052263229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1449586361}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and enjoyable to play", "timestamp_created": 1417365988, "timestamp_updated": 1417365988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49800795316696167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13164184": {"recommendationid": "13164184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079230721", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1419187902}, "language": "english", "review": "awsome fast action wont get bored, must have", "timestamp_created": 1417360039, "timestamp_updated": 1417360039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13159161": {"recommendationid": "13159161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053061950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 556, "last_played": 1417241088}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly I didn't expect much for my $0.87US, especially from something advertising itself as a roguelike which is usually code for badly disguised roguelite.

Took me 3 tries to win the first time. Took 22 tries to unlock all the classes. Still haven't finished more than 3x. It is no Dungeon Crawl or Angband or even Tome or Portralis but it manages quite nicely to be fun and have hidden depths. Dying doesn't suck all that much and if there is a beef with the game I suspect hard core Roguelike players won't like that you can save/reload the game but Saving itself is an iffy prospect and hard to scum. \n\nThe only sure way to save the game at any point is to buy/find a save crystal.

What makes this roguelike different from most other roguelikes and yet similiar to FTL, is that there is an advancing wave of darkness that forces the screen to scroll to the right. If you fall into the darkness? You die, and thus you need to keep moving to the right to survive, hence the name of the game. You would think that something like that would leave very little room for story, and in a way you are correct. But there is actually a bit more plot than it appears on first glance and you will need multiple playthroughs to fully understand what is going on. \n\nThe gameplay is mostly based around exploring, killing enemies and finding items while staying ahead of the scrolling wave. You need to find items to recover your energy, health and stamina, while also looking for weapons, armor, and enchantments. During this time the Demon Lord will occasionally pop in to try to kill you, and you either have to run from him, using whatever status effect items you have to slow him down, or finish him then and there. This sounds very simple on paper, but in practice it's actually a quite expansive resource and time management game, and you often need to plan your movements carefully to avoid getting killed by the scrolling darkness.\n\nThere are also a number of interesting NPCs, but sadly they very rarely appear. Each one has their own backstory, personaliy quirks, and even an associated ending. To mix things up even more, there is a random prefix system that can sometimes spawn either an enemy or an NPC with a stat changing prefix such as \"stiff-necked\", with some of them even changing the character's dialog, often in hilarious ways.\n\nLike most roguelikes this game has a lot of replay value, but here it's even more enforced by the fact that you can \"vault\" items at the end of a playthrough so you can get them at the start of another playthrough. Combined with the various classes, starting perks, and random world generation, you will likely end up with quite a bit of variety right at the start of your various runs through the game.\n\nThere is even a limited online play component, in that you can start on a world where other players have played and see their ghosts where they have died. At the end of a run you will also see leaderboards listed all the other players who have played on that world.\n\nUnfortunately this game isn't perfect, which is to be expected with it's nearly non-existant price. The stats aren't very balanced, with some like intelligence being less useful than the others, and charm in particular is almost useless given that it's mainly used for recruiting companions, who, as said before are extremely rare. I also noticed that bows seem a bit underpowered since they can't combo like melee weapons and often you can just throw things for similiar damage. Hopefully the upcoming expansion polishes the game up a bit, but even with the few issues this game has, it's worth far more than it's listed price at the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1417223789, "timestamp_updated": 1417223789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488803356885910034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13132397": {"recommendationid": "13132397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019861008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1702, "last_played": 1550598711}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent many hours playing this game, and I will say, it was worth it.\n\nPros:\n-Very high Replayability with all the classes you can make.\n-Diverse biomes and unique world creations\n-Highly addictive\n-Somewhat cute art when talking to Iris and other characters\n-Epilouges are awesome too\n-Classes all have their own strengths and weaknesses\n-The epilogues are very emotional\n-Game clearly has a lot of love and care put into it\n-Retro Feel\n\nCons:\n-Can be very short as the game can sneak up behind you\n-Can infuriate you when you mess up\n-Battles can be very unfair\n-Very basic and repetitive combat and moves\n-In my own experience, I've felt like there was no reason to continue playing once you've unlocked everything.\n\nRating I would give\n8/10 Amazing Game!", "timestamp_created": 1417223583, "timestamp_updated": 1418289906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13119768": {"recommendationid": "13119768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022554720", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1419338407}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like FTL rogue-like elements, perma death system.The gameplay in this game is so bloody fast u wont know wth is going on when its ur first time playing it.Basically this game throws u into the role of a *hero* and fucking just makes u play it, i will describe it as someone who is tied to a chair and forced to listen to nyan cat 100 hours long but the good kind of nyan cat :D .

Since the old days of Rogue and Hack, indie developers from all over have taken the basic ideas of roguelike games (procedurally developed worlds, blistering difficulty and permadeath, for example) and ran with it. \n\nOne Way Heroics literally \"runs with it\" by providing a game that forces you to keep running forward until you reach your destination: your final battle with the Demon Lord threatening the world. The parts of the world you leave behind are gradually consumed by a darkness that will devour you, too, if you wait too long or try to backtrack. So, in order to survive your encounter with the Demon Lord, you have to prepare yourself by gathering items and equipment and gaining levels on the way.\n\nReplayability is high due to the fact you can use Hero Points gained from a previous playthrough to help your next incarnation succeed better or faster than before. There's the Dimensional Vault, where you can leave your best items behind for the next play-through. You can also unlock new advantages or even new classes, for greater variety and strategy. You may also choose to run through the same world next time, rather than generating a new one, meaning that you can remember where towns, dungeons, merchants and particularly dangerous enemies are on the map, and approach or flee from them accordingly.\n\nThe game itself is a short one, which is good for those of us busy folks who want gaming in small bites. You can sit and finish a play-through in less than an hour. But there are multiple worlds (including multiplayer ones hosted online) and modes if you get bored of the standard game.

Whether for a 20 minute stroll or an epic 2-hour odyssey with perma-death waiting around every corner, this game aims to suit itself to multiple tastes.\n\nFinishing a game, whether winning or losing, awards points used to boost one's future playthroughs (with wins awarding more). Whether it be unlocking new perks or opening new slots in the Dimensional Vault to transfer items from one playthrough to the next, every run feels like it progresses the player. That being said, while there are technically save areas, losing concludes the run and records the player's performance right there - no going back to try and get more points, but it will allow you to conclude a run 'just for funsies'. Maniac Mode, the game's 'hardcore' setting also prevents players from importing items from previous games, though depositing new items is still possible. Save points and dimensional vaults make the game friendly for casual runs, but the true hero wins on Maniac Mode with no takesies backsies (the greatest scores are only counted upon no deaths).\n\nMore than that, the game is also surprisingly colorful. Dialogue and narrative is sparse, but sweet and entertaining. Furthermore, there are hidden secrets everywhere: the various characters you meet may have hidden dialogue, items may have unexpected purposes, and the non-restrictive nature of weapons gives a lot of freedom in designing 'builds'. There are even secret ways to win - it is recommended you do not go in with a guide, and simple explore yourself, as reading the wiki ruins a lot of the surprises this game has to offer (don't even look up those secret ways to win).\n\nThis reviewer's only criticism is that, after clocking a couple dozen hours, I'm ready for more! The weapons do resemble each other a bit too much, there's a hard limit on the available spells/abilities, dungeons resemble each other, and the charming character dialogues do eventually run dry.\n\nFor $3.50, this game was absolutely and totally worth it. It's creative, it's original, it's got high replayability, it suits people looking for various challenge levels, and it deserves to be recognized for what it is: a small but great roguelike RPG.\n\nA minor edit to this review, a newer 'edition' has come out called Mystery Chronicles: One Way Heroics; however, despite slightly higher quality sprites, it manages to be inferior to One Way Heroics and One Way Heroics+.

The vault allow your next heroes to grab the items from them, and thus start a new game with powerful equipments right from the start. With this system, you can soon have starting heroes that are extremely powerful.\n\nMoreover, since this is an hybrid JRPG, there is a lot more story in this game than there is in a typical roguelike. During each of your travels, you may find some new locations or characters, and this will help you better understand what is exactly happening to the world, as well as unlocking new places, storylines and endings. This helps alleviates one of the problems of roguelikes which is that they sometimes feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nThe gameplay itself is nice, with many items, skills, and classes that allow for different approaches to combat. It's turn-based, with positioning being an important part of the combat system. If you're lucky, you might later be able to expand your party, and have companions help you on your quests, which add more tactical options. Once again, this is a nice difference to classic roguelikes where you're usually all alone all the time.\n\nAnother good point for the game is that it should please a large number of RPG or roguelike fans. It has 4 different difficulty levels and you also have the option to turn off the Dimensional Vault as you wish. This mean that casual players will enjoy being able to finish the game on Easy and Normal, while Roguelike veterans will get the challenge they are looking for by playing harder difficulties, without the help of the vault.\n\nOn the whole, I really enjoy One Way Heroics. It offers me some interesting challenges, but somehow, it also feel like a relaxing game, because you're all alone in the vast open country (contrary to many roguelikes who prefer claustrophobic dungeons). It's a very nice game to both unwind, and also get my brain working hard, depending on which difficulty i play on.

(If you're the sort that likes to go \"tl;dr\" then just scroll to the bottom, but I mean, then why are you even reading reviews to begin with?)\n\nI picked this game up for <$0.60 when it was sale during the summer. I have to say, those were the best $0.60 I have ever spent. One Way Heroics doesn't appeal to you with stunning graphics, rich storytelling, or intricate gameplay. Instead, it is more retro gaming, silly short tales, and an easy to pick-up set of controls. Now you might be wondering, why would I want something like that? Arguably everything but simplicity of the controls could be considered negative or at least niche.  One Way Heroics doesn't offer high spec gaming while emptying your wallet - what you're buying is meaningless fun and entertainment.\n\nWhen I first opened this game and started an adventure, I found myself with my silly little 2D character talking to a \"Naughty King Victor\" about the darkness at the left of my screen that would attempt to eat me until I killed the Demon Lord. Yes, clearly the storyline could use some work, but as I struggled to kill weak mobs and then stronger demons I found myself falling for this game. Everything was fairly straightforward and the desire to complete achievements, \"save the world,\" and become a true hero compels you to play over and over again. It doesn't take several hours to do a run through like a quest in some RPG, just 30 minutes or so if you're short on time. Yet, you can play longer sessions that go for tens of hours depending completely on what you want to do and how much time you have - and those hours? They were some fun hours.\n\nI won't try to tell you that you'll be so entranced with One Way Heroics that you'll spend thousands of hours playing it - you probably won't. But it's easy to lose 10, 20, maybe even 100 hours of your life having fun by sending your hero towards the right of your screen. Was that worth my 60 cents while it was on sale? Definitely. Is it worth the full $3.49? Absolutely. Most of us play games to have fun - and One Way Heroics delivers.\n\ntl;dr?\n\nIf you're a hardcore gamer looking for a game with brilliant graphics and intricate/competitive gameplay to drop thousands of hours on, I think you're better off somewhere else.\nIf you're someone looking to spend 10-100 hours having fun in your spare time?

To tell you the truth, for such a price, I was expecting something horrible, dreadful, like an 8-bit Ride to Hell. Did I got surprised? Yeah! Buuuuuuut as usual, let me explain the BAD things the game has first, so we can take them out of the way:\n\nThe game is kind of short. Of course, for such a price, you can understand it, so it's not that big of a deal. Besides, this is a Rogue-like game, and rogue-like games are usually short, but change in every playthrough, this is no different from the standard on that regard.\n\nThe other thing that I did not like at all, is the lack of multiplayer. This game had such extreme potential for a Coop experience, but instead you can play the same randomly generated world at the same time as one of your friends, to see who goes further...INSTEAD OF PLAYING TOGETHER, AND HAVING FUN! I was indeed dissapointed by that, by looking at the captures of some friends that got the game, and by looking at the pictures and videos of the Steam-Store, I was expecting to play at least with one friend in a journey to save the world by punching demons on their d#cks.  You know, the usual. \n\nNow, let's talk about the GOOD stuff, pretty much everything else. As I said, it's a Rogue-Like. At the start of the playthrough you select the kind of character you desire to control, and special skills for you: You want to be fast? You want to be strong? You want to use magic? You want to start with a companion? You want to start with insane amoutns of gold? It's your choice, and it's indeed well made. I really did enjoy starting in different ways, and testing different strategies.\n\nThe game pretty much goes like this: The world is being taken out by some sort of \"Dark Sonic Boom\" (Damn Obama, he stole that from Guille!), and ANYTHING NEAR THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN IS F#CKED. Your goal is to travel to the right, getting stronger, surviving the wilds, getting better gear, meeting other people, saving lives, and if you get far enough, saving the world. It might sound simple enough, but the game mechanics make this journey, a journey to remember: First of all, you have to eat, or your character will get tired. Sounds easy enough? Well, there's not that many free food out there, so you have to make sure to visit any Inn or Town and get supplies before they got suck up into Oblivion (I bet that portal leads to Obama's #sshole, NOW THAT'S ONE SICK WAY TO END UP DEAD). Not only that, but your equipment won't last forever. Your stuff has limited use, for example, 100 uses on a sword. Once you swing it for the 100th time, the thing breaks, and it's lost forever. There are ways to repair it and make it last longer, but you should make sure to AT LEAST CARRY 1 BACKUP WEAPON. Infact, I always try to carry at least 3 weapons on myself. And armor? HAH, THOSE THINGS BREAK TOO, SHIELDS INCLUDED! You're far pass f#cked on these lands, specially later on when enemies start to get dangerous!\n\nFor a cheap game, there's a lot of fun to be had in this game, and I do recommend it. The game is worth 3\u20ac WITHOUT sales, and that's already cheap enough, on sales it usually lowers to 1\u20ac or so.

Fortunately, despite its initial simplicity, the gameplay becomes addicting due to its blend of a slow turn-based aspect together with a sense of urgency created by the ever-scrolling screen. The gameplay becomes especially enjoyable inside of the dungeons, where the player must plan out all of the character's moves to kill all the monsters before the darkess reaches you (and maybe take some loot).\n\nSOUND:\nAlthough it didn't strike me as particularly mesmerising, the sound track does a good job at involving the player, and is enjoyable enough to listen to for a long amount of time. \n\nART:\nOne Way Heroics seems to be following a recent trend of indie games having pixelated graphics, but despite this I really enjoyed the art, and in this case, it matches the old-school RPG feeling of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a good recommendation for those people who only have a couple minutes available to play games and also to those who have multiple hours to play.

It has a VERY surprising amount of depth for a game that is by default played on a resolution of about a smart phone (what you see in the screenshots is what you get, and full-screening it does not help its prettiness!). Graphics-wise, it's incredibly indie -- see the character \"portraits\" in the bottom left corner that seem to be sketches made a bored developer, especially Swordmaster Class C for a laugh.\n\nIf you get this game, it's for its gameplay, which does one thing, but does it really, really well. The turn-based gameplay with a constant timer and emphasis on movement will make it incredibly addicting for old-time Rogue-like players, as experience points (read: monsters to farm) and treasure may be within arm's reach but inaccessible due to the choices you have to make. The item appraisal system makes every item a mystery and makes even a new starting sword drop a desired reward, as durability constantly counts down with few ways to repair items and replenish supplies. Even when you're on top of the world, you'll feel pressured and challenged by item weights and inventory limits, decreasing energy and stamina, and other factors to encourage you to weigh risk and reward (\"how long should I wear this Training Bracelet, which cripples my stats for more experience?\") to get ready for the next area.\n\nThe \"hidden\" parts of the game are by far the most enticing. You simply have to go out and find out for yourself how to get access to things like Party Members, Force powers (spells), the Dark Brotherhood, Hidden Elf Villages, Goddess Statues, and Key of Seals and their associated doors. After each death or victory, the progression system encourages trial and error, mixing and matching unlockable classes and perks with rotating featured Dimensions and allowing players to access the Dimensional Vault to carry over a limited number of items. The game is well-supported outside of a playthrough with a replay system, a hall of fame for each dimension and for your overall profile, and, of course, the different daily Dimensions featured. It does not hold your hand after kicking you out of the castle with a fairy of questionable use, explaining only the most basic and necessary mechanics until you recruit party members: you have to go out and discover it for yourself, since at a base level the game is so simple! Even the limited story and simple humor is fun to discover, especially as more party-member-specific endings are unlocked.\n\nOne of the best games on Steam under $5, and amongst my favorite Rogue-likes; highly, highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1412401721, "timestamp_updated": 1412728240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503246724605560303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12341190": {"recommendationid": "12341190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023042534", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 809, "last_played": 1454600105}, "language": "english", "review": "This.\n\nThis game right here is the exact game all RPG-Maker style games wish they were. \nGuys...

While AAA developers stick to doing what they know will make money (sequel after sequel, FPSs, etc.), indie developers are more often willing to take risks on new ideas. Sure, you still get plenty of repetition out of the indie scene (side scrolling platformers, RPG Maker RPGs, roguelike elements, retro visuals, zombies, etc.) but I think that their overall percentage of innovative games brought to market is higher. Oddly enough, One Way Heroics features all the examples I listed in parentheses for repetition except for platforming, yet it still goes down as an innovative game in my book.\n\nIn order for you to be successful in One Way Heroics, every action you take requires that you be mindful of the ever encroaching darkness on the left side of the screen. It's such a simple concept and yet it has such a profound effect on the entirety of the game. I particularly appreciated how it forced a fast pace to the game (an extremely uncommon trait in RPGs) and demanded strategic thinking. Both of these play into a relatively harsh learning curve. My first attempt ended very early on yet I was quickly able to restart and learn from my mistakes. This isn't an exceedingly deep game so the learning curve relaxes after the first few hours. That said, between the 8 classes, a variety of perks you can choose from, and 4 difficulty levels, there are enough new things to try to keep your interest.\n\nIt's when you look outside of the gameplay that One Way Heroics comes up short. Its visuals, while not offensively bad, are very generic and bland. The music is a little better but equally generic. I'm still not entirely sure what to make of the story. It's odd because so much of it is worked into the game like an optional sidequest or rare, chance encounter. There were several moments that I enjoyed but the terrible English translation, silly anime character tropes, and high degree of difficulty in even accessing the story put a major damper on this aspect of the game. Despite 33 hours played I only ever encountered one of five NPC characters that you can have join your party and hear their story. The only reasons I can think of to have that level of rarity are a misguided attempt to elongate replayability or an MMO inspired reward for dedicated players. This is an excellent point to lead into my summary: One Way Heroics has a solid gameplay concept at its foundation but is surrounded by otherwise amateurish game design.", "timestamp_created": 1412089418, "timestamp_updated": 1412089418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576273143291473389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12300412": {"recommendationid": "12300412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071108814", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1548711192}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game, where to start... \n\nYou choose your hero, and start in one of the many maps.

However you decide to play I promise you will die, a lot, luckily there's this thing called the Deminsional Vault, where you can stash your goodies, and then pick them back up at the begining of the game, which if you have a lot of OP loot (like me) it makes the game a cake walk, that is if you decide to open the vault. There is a lot of charm with this game, and it's a really great deal on steam, hours of re-playability, plus secert endings, alternete versions of charcters, not to mention the special deminsions which get changed out daily.

The game is very clever in both its execution of gameplay and art style and here he is what i love about the game:\n\n- Many demensions (worlds) as they are randomly generated\n- Tried and tested RPG methods that work, sometimes better than other games\n- Easy to pick up, hard to master\n- Soundtrack is off the scale (and is free with the game!)\n\nHowever this game wont certainly be for everyone. If you hate turn based RPGs then you wont like this one bit, as it does rely heavily on this feature. Here are a few nags i have about the game:\n\n- Can become to easy once your gear is insane \n- No enough end game for me (except setting my own personal goals)\n- Classes dont feel different enough (however there is a very wide choice)\n\nAlso please note, while this game has no direct multiplayer, it does have community demensions in which heroes can compare how they have faired against eachother e.g how far they go in KM.\n\nMY RATING: 8/10 - Worth everyone penny!", "timestamp_created": 1409942529, "timestamp_updated": 1409942529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11978931": {"recommendationid": "11978931", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960719767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1407937479}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun.
