TLDR: Feels like Undertale, but actually playable for a non-gamer like myself.  \n\nTo elaborate, I found this similar to Undertale because: \n-  Dialogue changes with reapers before and after doing an action.  \n-  The player gains vast empathy for ghosts and reapers alike.  \n-  Hidden areas.\n-  Just plain vibes.  (I know, its just my \"raised-by-the-internet brain rot.\"  Sue me.)\n\nIt is unlike Undertale because:\n-  The battle system is speed based decision making through a menu, instead of a bullet hell.\n-  Short and sweet game.\n-  Personified player character.\n-  While there are different endings to Grimm's Hollow, its no where NEAR as complex as Undertale's paths.  This is a good thing!  It can be kind of frustrating if each ending requires specific specifications, and if you mess up, its all over.  Grimm's Hollow is therefore vastly easier to consume, and as a non-gamer, its a welcome change.  \n\nWill be replaying many times over.

It has touched my heart in many ways and will definitely be one of my favorite games for a while.\n\nStarting with the positives, the music and visuals were amazing. I was shocked when I first opened the game to be greeted with visuals almost resembling that of Undertale and Deltarune, which cost much more than Grimm's Hollow. The tutorial is very helpful, and guides you through very nicely instead of just leaving you to figure it out. As the game progresses and you gain more abilities, you can discover your own combinations for combat styles, and there is no 'one way' to defeat any enemy. I won't spoil anything, but the ending is truly moving and climactic, and feels really worth it after all you've worked for in the game. It leaves a lot of answered yet unanswered questions, and resolves the game just enough for it to be satisfying, but also leaves it open ended to leave you wanting more. The game has very good pacing with its story and has just the right balance between game play and plot. It finds a way to fit quirky, light characters into a personal and deep story.\nSome negatives of the game mainly involve the controls. When I first started, I found the dodging mechanic to be quite finicky and inconsistent. This made some fights quite frustrating as I was unable to dodge enemies attacks and avoid taking damage. This skill is especially crucial toward the end of the game, which makes the wonky mechanic quite annoying. \nAt some points of the game, I also felt a lack of direction. I didn't know where I was meant to go half the time, and found myself just wandering around in circles until I found an area to progress in. Although this definitely could be a personal issue, it really fed into my play time of me just running around directionless. \n\nOverall, I would 100% recommend this game. Although it has some slight flaws, they definitely can and will be overlooked once you dive into the wholesome little world Grimm's Hollow has to offer. It has a compelling story and lovable, quirky characters who will all find a place in your heart. It has a nice playtime of 3-4 hours, and is a lovely way to spend an afternoon.

It's a turn based game in the Final Fantasy style, which means everyone charges their turn with time. Nothing new but that's fine for a little game like this; the problem I had with this system's application was completely technical: it didn't feel very polished since enemies still charge attacks while SOME of your menus are open; this means enemies can attack you with quick-time moves (that you dodge with timing) while you are about to select something. This is especially annoying when the enemies are faster since they make the menus feel slow. This isn't helped by the fact that the attack button (Z) is buffered (which means activates after the enemy finished the attack) but other buttons aren't, so you easily pick the wrong option. Another thing that feels like a bug is the fact that buffs you use on yourself... can miss?? WHY?! Or, again, attacks that you did correctly with the slider... can actually miss. That is a system which lies to the player.\n\nThe other reason combat didn't feel very exciting was how stats work: from what I understood, defence is a flat reduction of damage... which makes the stats more important that any possible strategy. An exception to this could be Poison... which I didn't bother to use since doubling attack and defence with Specials was an auto-win in every fight; you can even use Haste and Sleep/stuns for more turn economy on top of that and go almost infinite with Quick Attack.\n\nBut don't get fooled by the lenght of this post: the game IS good (for the points I covered at the beginning) but it simply isn't very fun to play for how it is structured.", "timestamp_created": 1694801768, "timestamp_updated": 1694802078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146336735": {"recommendationid": "146336735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879059575", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1694786429}, "language": "english", "review": "no way this game is free\n", "timestamp_created": 1694786589, "timestamp_updated": 1694786589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146332137": {"recommendationid": "146332137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880063067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1643803079}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute little game.

Grimm's Hollow feels like it was originally developed as two separate games - a short visual novel and a short Undertale-inspired RPG - and those two games had to fit both of their contents into the runtime of only one of them. A majority of the game is spent dungeon crawling in a derivative, if servicable ATB combat system. The gameplay is fine, and the art direction, character design, and music come together to elevate the experience. Were the game to consist of just this, it would have been fine. However, as a result of the high-concept narrative and the short runtime, dialogue and story scenes are dumped unceremoniously onto the player, in jarring scenes that lack cohesive progression. It's a shame, because what's there is actually really damn good, and with a little bit of a longer runtime it could have really won me over, but it's a free indie game, so I can't exactly criticize it for that. The game has four endings, only two of which I found narratively satisfying, and costs $0. It's worth a playthrough, and I look forward to what Ghosthunter (the developer) comes out with next. 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1692543300, "timestamp_updated": 1692543300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144638649": {"recommendationid": "144638649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272298659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1692534476}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego ha estado muy entretenido y me ha gustado mucho ir siguiendo la original historia que nos van ense\u00f1ando poco a poco seg\u00fan vas avanzando.\nA\u00fan as\u00ed, las batallas se hacen un poco pesadas y pueden llegar a tener alg\u00fan bug. \u00a1Pero en general el juego est\u00e1 genial!", "timestamp_created": 1692534614, "timestamp_updated": 1692534614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144630582": {"recommendationid": "144630582", "author": {"steamid": "76561199173374306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1692525252}, "language": "english", "review": "i would kill for Grimm", "timestamp_created": 1692525328, "timestamp_updated": 1692525328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144601738": {"recommendationid": "144601738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347089008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1697958705}, "language": "english", "review": "you like rpgs?

Nice to sit down and chill for a while. The story is also very nice, I love the characters, especially Grimm and how fatherly he acts.\n\nI think, one thing I'd wish better is that they fix a bit more of the turn-based part of the game. I like the fact there aren't really turns, per say. But sometimes, it gets difficult to understand. Especially at the beginning, when you don't have your speed raised up, most of the time you just stand waiting your 'turn' and wondering why you are receiving so much damage. In a way, it's nice because it teaches you how to level up the right stats. But it does seem a bit unbalanced, since at the beginning you're too slow and get too damaged, and at the end you're too fast and there's barely a challenge.\n\nAlso, sometimes, the 'evade' mechanic glitches as well. Sometimes you get the 'evade' bar while you're in the menu to choose your attack. And at the end it's not a difference, since you're already high leveled and has some extra wp in you. But at the beginning you can easily die by that.\n\nOther than that, it's a really cool game, fun to play, and welcoming for both the ones who just want to play the game for its story and the ones who want to play for the RPG style.", "timestamp_created": 1691025670, "timestamp_updated": 1691025670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143294214": {"recommendationid": "143294214", "author": {"steamid": "76561199051153697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1698451429}, "language": "english", "review": "i could not get OMORI so i tried this game out, it has a wonderful art style and story that i liked!\ni think you should play it if you want OMORI.", "timestamp_created": 1691025099, "timestamp_updated": 1691025099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143291628": {"recommendationid": "143291628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335246840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1605002719}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cute and fun game. the artstyle is pretty sweet and the gameplay is fun.

It ties everything together, from the visuals (look at the protagonst's black void of an eyes and try saying they are not cute), to mechanics (sweets instead of health potions (what health, you're dead)), to characters (the Grimm Reaper him(?)self likes tea, chocolate cakes and knitting).\nThe thing is, death is scary. The thought of death is scary, especially after the fact. It's only natural to hide from it, behind baloons, sweets, and literal masks. The game is very aware of that, and it's at its best when it acknowladges it to the player. \nI enjoyed my time the most when characters engaged in (heartfelt and witty) conversations. Grimm's Hollow has a limited cast, but every single one of them is full of personality and is very loveable.\nBut other than that the game has a lot to offer. It's tactical combat is not the deepest there is, but for such a short runtime, it has a lot of variety in enemies, weapons and tactics. \nThe game even has several endings!\nThe only criticism I might have is with the implementation of QTE mechanics. Or even one exact mechanc of parrying. It took some time for me to figure out how it works, and it is extremely important for a final fight.

Es muy parecido al de Undertale, aunque mucho m\u00e1s tosco. Muchas veces vas a hacer el mismo da\u00f1o o m\u00e1s en la zona naranja que en la blanca, pero luego igual haces 20 veces menos, cuando seg\u00fan el propio tutorial, deber\u00eda hacer siempre la mitad de tu da\u00f1o total si est\u00e1s en esa zona, Alguien podr\u00eda argumentar que es porque haces cr\u00edtico, pero realmente no hay muchos indicadores de ello, y se siente m\u00e1s aleatorio que otra cosa, Las zonas roja y negra funcionan bien, eso s\u00ed. Adem\u00e1s, sobre el final de juego el combate es b\u00e1sicamente un chiste. S\u00e9 que el foco del juego es la historia, pero ese comienzo tan absurdamente complicado en el que un plumazo te mata y ese final en el que los enemigos hacen 0 de da\u00f1o no se entiende.\n\nLa segunda queja, y la m\u00e1s importante, es la de la traducci\u00f3n. No puedes cambiar el idioma del juego. Se asigna autom\u00e1ticamente dependiendo del idioma de tu Steam. Yo lo tengo en castellano de Espa\u00f1a, y lo m\u00e1s cercano que tiene el juego es el de LATAM. Bien. Mi queja no es porque \"unga bunga traducci\u00f3n latina caca\". Eso me da igual. El problema es que la traducci\u00f3n latina tiene una calidad de verg\u00fcenza. Estamos hablando de una traducci\u00f3n oficial, no de una fan translation, donde se entienden m\u00e1s estos errores. Sinceramente, da la sensaci\u00f3n de que el que haya hecho esto, ha ido al traductor de Google a \"hacer\" el trabajo. Hay miles de comas donde no toca, m\u00e1s palabras mal escritas que bien, ya sea por acentos que faltan, sobran, o est\u00e1n mal puestos, o por palabras directamente mal escritas en las que igual hay una b donde va una v. No solo esto, sino que se nota que el texto estaba originalmente en ingl\u00e9s, pues hay traducciones literales de expresiones como \"oh my god\", o el uso excesivo de pronombres que caracteriza al ingl\u00e9s, y no digo ninguna tonter\u00eda de \"oh no ha usado elle\". Quiero decir que literalmente la palabra que m\u00e1s vas a leer es \"\u00e9l\". Y hay mil ejemplos m\u00e1s como estos.\n\nS\u00e9 que el juego es gratis, y que en definitiva es una experiencia disfrutable, pero eso no significa que no podamos exigir calidad y criticar mierdas de este estilo.

I will say its a decent game for a free title and it has multiple endings which does give it some replay value. The story was simple, but still emotional and effective. I love the art style too with a cool pixel art and it reminded me of Undertale in a way. It also has a nice progression system as you get spirit essence from all the ghosts you kill and can spend that on unlocking new abilities or upgrade your base stats. I found this to be very satisfying and I got a rush when I had collected enough to do a bunch of upgrades all at once.\n\nCombat was where it gets interesting and in my case a little frustrating. Whenever you do basic attacks, you have a little gauge meter with a reticle moving and you have to hit it in the middle in order to perform successful attacks. You need to do this also to build up your magic meter so you can eventually perform your more powerful abilities. Enemies will attack and some attacks you will be able to dodge by way of the same gauge mechanic. Because of that its a game where you have to pay attention during combat otherwise you can easily get wiped. What I don't like about this battle system is that it tends to feel like a mix of turn based and real time, as sometimes when the menu you pops up for you to select your next move, enemies can still attack you. There were so many times where my menu would pop up, but I found it better to just wait a few extra seconds for the dodge mechanic to come up so I could do that first before attacking. It just got really frustrating after a while and sometimes it was inconsistent as I would hit the middle of the gauge but the enemy would still hit me or I would miss my attack. Plus at the end, during the final boss fight, they throw in a third mechanic that you have to contend with that I can't talk about because its a bit of a story spoiler. It got really irritating having to manage 3 different mechanics during an intense fight, where all I really wanted to do was just take my time and plan what my next move would be.

I'd give it a solid 4/5.\nPositives: Sountrack and sound design were fantastic, sounds really helped add to the atmosphere. Character design was adorable and spooky cozy. Battles were appropriately balanced, if not a bit on the easy side, which I think is always nice if you're trying to complete a stat grid or grind. The diversity of the attacks was well rounded, though it would've been nice to have the ghosts have a wider range of attack styles; evading attacks did get tedious in the end. Overall, perfect spooky atmosphere with solid gameplay.\nFeedback: I didn't really care about the story or the characters, personally. Partly that could've been because I was expecting a longer game, but after playing other games that explore death and mourning, this one didn't hit the mark for me. I really didn't care by the end and didn't feel like playing it for a different ending. The pacing was a bit too fast and I would've been content with more times spent in the dungeons. Also, there was some moralizing about in-world things that...fell a bit flat for me since as a player I wasn't given an option to not do the thing being moralized about. \nOverall, I would tell people to play this game for the atmosphere and a fun, decently easy, dungeon romp.

I've just finished the \"casual\" mode, which I picked since I prefer story to combat in games. The design, combat, and story are spellbinding. I swear I got sucked right into the world itself. It is a very honest and yet relatively gentle depiction of grief, the best depiction I've ever personally seen. My one and only regret is this: of the two (of four) endings I found in my short time playing, both have me thinking about the grief I have tucked away myself.

I was looking for something short enough to pass the time. I wound up going for a 2nd, better ending because- well, you'd have to play the game to find out, hehe. And it wasn't too difficult to play the normal difficulty, either. I felt like it was just right for a short and casual, yet story-driven game. I love the world building, even though it isn't that massive, and I enjoy the lore. The music and art are lovely, and it was overall a great experience.\n\nEDIT: Regarding the combat system, I will agree with some of the critiques. It wasn't immediately clear why the ghosts were still able to attack me while I was on my own attack menu. To me, this kind of removed the point of calling it \"turn based\". It was really a matter of using Spirit Energy to level your stats such as health, damage, speed, etc. Like, upping your speed will help plenty.\n\nSimilarly, my dodge would not go through even if I could swear I hit the Down arrow on time. This feature is not found in the manual, so I just had to live with it and I got by through improving my stats. Speaking of which - I didn't really use most of the skills. I used some where applicable (Slash on multiple enemies), but apart from that, I mostly stuck to the default attack and Pierce. Every now and then, I'd try out one of the other skills but I'd forget about them later on.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it's better than many free to play games on here.

best part of this game. This game is the only game that got me close to tears when I played it. For such a short game (about 2-3 hours for me), it envelopes you into the story quickly and it does it so well. If this was any other game, with this incredibly short playtime I wouldn't give a shit about Lavender and her brother. All the characters are so likable. Lavander, Timmy, Grimm. Hell, I could kind of sympathize for the baker. (The antagonist of the story) But the cherry on top were the endings. Except for when I played Undertale, I have never been so satisfied and sad with the endings. All 4 of them almost left me in tears. Especially the bad ending. The combination of some of them being so bitter-sweet yet so fulfilling scratches an itch I never knew I had.\n\nThe art style and animation is unique and very well polished. In many games like these the art style usually lacks emotion and depth, but here it just works. And the animation is very smooth as well.\n\nThe music is surprisingly catchy and nice to listen to coming from an indie game.\n\nThe combat system surprisingly never gets boring. This is because of the incredibly short length of the game. Its simple but complicated enough at the same time.\n\nI am so happy I stumbled across this game. \n10\\10 This is a must play.", "timestamp_created": 1680198006, "timestamp_updated": 1680198006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135741338": {"recommendationid": "135741338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930164698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1680185859}, "language": "english", "review": "Should have costed money", "timestamp_created": 1680186026, "timestamp_updated": 1680186026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135719177": {"recommendationid": "135719177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847782053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1680149358}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is too good for free game T _ T <3 <3", "timestamp_created": 1680149612, "timestamp_updated": 1680149612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135702251": {"recommendationid": "135702251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424367750", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1680121737}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like one of those classic games that could've gained a following, but nope.\n\nThis one is recent, free and hopefully not forgotten..", "timestamp_created": 1680124010, "timestamp_updated": 1680124010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135693948": {"recommendationid": "135693948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978230672", "num_games_owned": 1422, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1680115050}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want \"active time\" BS play this game.

This element is even strengthened by the presence of secret walls that can be found by clicking the action button on normal walls, once the player finds the right spot, the wall tears apart leaving a secret access. Not only this highlights a sense of discovery but it also creates a small loop where the player, in order to have advantages in combat, is pushed to find new secret passages, kill the mobs, get the treasure and get out.\n\nThe combat system is modeled on a standard role playing game system that has been around for many years. Once Lavender collides with the ghosts the combat starts, the player can choose among four actions: swing, special, pocket and flee. The swing is the basic attack, the special is the special attack, the pocket refers to the inventory where the player can choose among different items to use in the combat and flee is used to attempt to run away. Even if the combat system looks like many other role playing games systems, the fight is made a little bit more fun by the addition of real time components. When the player chooses to swing the attack bar pops up and the player has to press the action button at the right moment if he wants to increase the attack damage. The same component is used also for the enemy attack, some of the enemies can be countered by actively pressing the action button at the right moment in order to dodge the damage. This gives the player not only a phase of planning and strategy but also a phase of real time playing. In such a sense, the player feels more engaged and needs to rely both on his planning and active skills.\n\nGrimm\u2019s Hollow also presents a few loops even if the main story is straight and clear: Lavender has to find her brother through the realm while hunting souls. During the game the player has to engage enemies in order to upgrade Lavender\u2019s talent tree and eventually be able to face stronger and stronger enemies. At the beginning of the game, the player has to die a few times before understanding the game mechanics, in particular when and how using items during the fight and \twhich talents to upgrade first. In such a sense the game flow is not well balanced giving to the player a sense of anxiety as soon as Lavender faces the first few ghosts; at the beginning just a few ghosts can kill the player if he doesn\u2019t make the right choices or choosing and purchasing the right items that can make him win the fights. On the other hand, as the game progresses, the player finds the combats easier and most of the time, boring.\n\nAmong all components the story is the element that stands out the most; Lavender wakes up in a bed, dead and surrounded by strangers in skeleton mask while she got herself a job as a reaper. The story is funny and made more interesting by the many dialogues that the player can experience along the game. Even if the story looks foregone on the surface, it hides a more complex and a deeper plot that is not given. Another point that makes the story a bit fun is the introduction of sarcastic components from the very beginning; the developer wants to tell a story that sounds sad but makes the player have fun while experiencing it. The player is pushed again by a sense of discovery, he wants to progress in the game to find out more about Lavender and Timmy\u2019s story, a deep fairy tale story.\n\nThe loops are shallow and not complex and this makes the player experiencing the game only once; players, once they finish the game, are not pushed to come back to replay it because the goals are very straightforward and easy to reach. The developer uses an expedient to create the game more interesting for players that not only are driven by a sense of discovery but also for players that are driven by a sense of achievement; the story has four different endings that can be unlocked by replaying the game.\n\nIn conclusion, the game design is shallow on an aesthetic point of view, even if it has many role playing game components, these components are not complex and the flow of the game is not balanced. The game is eventually easy to learn and beat. The story, on the other hand, is a component that makes players keep playing driven by a feeling of discovery. The audience of the game is focused on casual players that may or may not be used to RPG mechanics and they would like to discover more about Lavender story. \n", "timestamp_created": 1677826460, "timestamp_updated": 1677826460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133896390": {"recommendationid": "133896390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198898385285", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1643916184}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute, Sad and Fun.\nWorth the 4 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1677728776, "timestamp_updated": 1677728776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133760289": {"recommendationid": "133760289", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086824493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1687517894}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had a ton of fun for just 5 hours, and yeaaaaaaa my playtime was like last year but shhh this games beautiful and I love it", "timestamp_created": 1677528429, "timestamp_updated": 1677528429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133732939": {"recommendationid": "133732939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086495934", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1676251375}, "language": "english", "review": "That game hits different when you read Grimm with italian accent in mind", "timestamp_created": 1677495783, "timestamp_updated": 1677495783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133702214": {"recommendationid": "133702214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405869923", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1677452721}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with great story!

Sweet, but also [i]bitter[/i]sweet - though I wouldn't say it's super sad (at least not [i]most[/i] of the endings; watching [spoiler]Timmy lose himself and become a hostile ghost is rather distressing[/spoiler] , and [spoiler]I think the 'best' ending, so to speak, is the one that made me cry the absolute most[/spoiler] ) but it definitely made me at least tear up regardless; there's a heavy sense of melancholy without being oppressive. There were also one or two surprises for me as I played through. There were also some giggly moments, which made a nice lighter balance. The music was a lovely fit for it, emotive and rarely taking centre stage, and the sound effects in general not disruptive or irritatingly repetitive when playing straight through (as I often find RPG sound effects to be).\n\nIt took me about an hour and a half to get to (one of the) ending(s) the first time, and I've gone back to play through the others as well.\n\nI played on casual mode (partly because I [i]was[/i] more interested in the story than combat, partly because I played it on no sleep for days) but I found the combat well laid out. I did have an occasional issue with \"evade\" failing even when I hit it properly, I think (as another reviewer mentioned) because there were other menus up for my own attack at the same time; it wasn't nearly every time and it wasn't enough to be a real disruption to my combat or my enjoyment of the game, though I did level up my willpower (health) a bit, early, to allow for it just in case. I barely unlocked any of the spells (only the one that allows you to steal your opponent's WP and the AOE slash) and went for a barebones combat method (only levelling up strength, defense, willpower, speed, and special) that worked just fine for everything up to and including the boss fight, at least in casual mode.

can't be masterpiece with only 2\u20133 hours long, but still, the way the story is told in the game and the story itself is fine, emotional package.\n\nGame-play: It's fun, but the mechanics whatever are using the game are not for too short games - if the game was at least 5\u20138 hours, it was possible even to compete for some indie awards. I'm talking specifically for the RPG mechanics - you have many choices, but after all you actually have almost everything. And in a 2-hour game, you can't feel the consequences of bad decisions because they're not possible. \n\nDifficulty: They're two possible difficulties, but I don't think anyone will make difference between the two - this is drawback in my opinion because I found out that the game have 4 possible endings, which are dependable on how the last fight progress. But because it's so easy, you should be either badly or very unlucky to actually reach a different ending from the standard one.\n\nMusic: I don't I can say much about it, it was gorgeous.", "timestamp_created": 1673189566, "timestamp_updated": 1673189566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130313697": {"recommendationid": "130313697", "author": {"steamid": "76561199251956143", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1673067586}, "language": "english", "review": "free", "timestamp_created": 1673056440, "timestamp_updated": 1691879131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130290291": {"recommendationid": "130290291", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180181465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1700605770}, "language": "english", "review": "eat death donuts", "timestamp_created": 1673031742, "timestamp_updated": 1673031742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130252831": {"recommendationid": "130252831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846410985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1672892302}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the best games I've ever played!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1672993224, "timestamp_updated": 1672993224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130179371": {"recommendationid": "130179371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170159321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1672917442}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is absolutely amazing and i cannot believe it is free.

it does\n   (I had to set up a KBM to gamepad configuration in antimicro (program), similar to RPG Maker games)\n\nStory: 7.5/10\n  + interesting setting, premise, and primary objective for the game\n  ~ primary objective was reached a bit quicker than expected, which didn't allow the world to be as developed and interesting\nGameplay: 7.3/10\n  + timing-based attacks and dodges mixed with selecting skills for the combat was interesting\n  + upgrades to the protagonist had a clear effect on the combat, and the difficulty is somewhat based on you balancing stats vs skill unlocks\n  ~ it seems like the turn-based pattern to the combat is either buggy or is actually somewhat real-time, because the enemy would often get extra attacks if I didn't immediately open a menu to select a new attack or skill (this didn't seem fair or enjoyable since our attacks are strictly once per turn)\nCharacters: 7.5/10\n  + enjoyable characters with some development and upbeat jokes\n  + interesting characterization of the Grim Reaper\nGraphics: 6.5/10\n  + somewhat nostalgic and on the \"cute\" side, which helped make the setting less depressing and fit the story\n  ~ the art style is somewhat muddy, washed out, and underdeveloped, making some things hard to decipher what they are and not having a lot of details\nAudio: 7.3/10\n  + fit the setting, with the sound effects and music adding to the experience\nUI: 6.5/10\n  ~ limited to screen size and audio settings, and a bit limiting in navigating the menus\n\nScore comparison:\nHLtB:         7.4/10 (64 votes)\nMetacritic: 9.1/10 (only

I think it's insane this game is free and would be worth at least a few bucks. The time and effort put into it are clear, and it's a great little gem. \n\nThe fight mechanics take a bit to get used to, but they're fun and challenging. I ended up switching to casual mode as the time-sensitive nature combined with a somewhat trial-by-fire learning of the controls (I read the manual but it's hard to perform a new task under pressure) made me want to go easy. That helped the game greatly, and I could breeze through it and enjoy the story. \n\nThe final boss fight is when everything was lost for me. \n\n**Minor spoilers**\n\nThe final fight involves a two \"person\" battle where you must juggle switching between characters with the enemies' fast-paced attacks. As this was the first battle with a second player, the controls suddenly became confusing and difficult to manage. \n\nI struggled to figure out how to switch characters and fight and what to do with my new buddy in combat. Since it was the final boss it was high stakes and I spent so much time panicking trying to switch characters and attack while balancing defense that it made it a frustrating and impossible task. There is a small possibility that I am dumb, and there was a simple solution, but either way, this turned me off of the game. I loved it so much that it was disappointing to see the ending pulled out from under me because of bogged-down mechanics. \n\nI hope this is something relatively easy to fix (like introducing p2 a little earlier into combat). I really did enjoy the rest of it, and it's hard to complain about something free.

The gameplay is your standard Turn-Based RPG that isn't anything special but works and isn't relatively broken or incredibly convoluted. One problem I do have is with the \"Evade\" mechanic. I never really got a good grasp about how to properly evade certain attacks, because when I pressed the button to evade, there was a chance that it doesn't go thru and ends up hurting me. But there there is times where I do evade it, so it basically becomes a guessing game for a very cut and dry mechanic. But this wasn't much of an inconvenience since it barely happened.\n\nThis game talks about sorrow and grief. Death is a sad thing that many people struggle with, and this game talks about how it can affect people, how it can change them, for better or for worse. Not everyone can move on from the past. Some people want to return to those times of blissfulness. Some people just don't want to accept that someone they loved is gone. And it's ok to feel grief, it's natural. Some people feel incredibly alone during these times of hardship. But rest assured that, you are not alone. Even if you don't realize it at the moment, you are surrounded by people that love you, and will try to help you and be with you. It's never easy to accept that a loved one is gone, but do know, that the people around you will try to make it a more bearable process. Don't give up.\n\nOverall a pretty good game. The fact that this game is free is incredibly surprising and it feels wrong not paying for it. It's relatively short (2/3 hours), and it's pretty easy to get all of the endings.

Farm Speed and DMG, One-shot everything.\nThe last boss is easy as well. Just have the 4 buffs up and kill him in no time. No challenge (I played on Normal Mode, there is only one other Mode: Casual. Less fights, and Easier fights. Should have chosen this one as there was no challenge either way. Only waste of time.) But! This is a free game, So what can you say.\n\n> Story: I didn't like it much. Maybe I didn't understand it. The game has 2 Endings. They are not much different beneath the surface, and I think that can teach us a lot about letting go and dealing with Grief of losing someone.\n\n1. The Bad Ending: Her brother is no longer in the Realm of Death with her. She goes crazy, mindlessly farming Ghosts until she passes out of exhaustion. No one dares talk to her. Out of pity, Grimm, an acquaintance of her teleports her to a bed, letting her sleep. She just can't live with the fact that her brother is no longer living. Even if she is dead herself. Even if she can not see him anyway\n\nEven though, she knows that he is living in the After-Life. Such a sad path to take.\n\n2. The Good Ending: She gets the Soul of her brother back, and he goes to live in the Realm of the Living.\nNo different for her. But she is happy now. She made friends! She tries her best to get stronger in order to get to the afterlife and not be in the Realm of Death (As a reaper) no more.\n\n- See? No difference for her. Either way she can not go back to the Realm of the Living. Either way, she can not see her brother.\n\nBut knowing he is in a better place puts her at Ease. The mindset shift aside,\nit is no secret that we are going to lose most, if not all of our loved ones someday.\n\nIf you are grieving in the Loss of a loved one, specially of they have passed away, just know that they most probably are in a better place.\nThey most probably are happier.

You can beat this game in around 2-3 hours pretty easily. The way reaping works in this game and all of the fight mechanics are done well (which is good because you have to do it quite a bit). If the fights aren't your thing, you can play it on the casual mode and still complete the game without issue. The story and themes were very well represented in my opinion, they were taken seriously but weren't being preachy about it. The characters were interesting, though I do wish the more minor characters were given a tad more love and attention, but this is a short game, so I'm aware there was only so much the creator could've fit in. Overall, I enjoyed the game and thought it was very well made. My only two complaints are the length of the game and that characters weren't as fleshed out as they could've been.

But there is plenty of free food in the game so you can replenish your health often, and dying isn't really a big deal (unless you're in the final fight, in which case you dying gives you specific endings).\nFun game!", "timestamp_created": 1660154827, "timestamp_updated": 1660154827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120390793": {"recommendationid": "120390793", "author": {"steamid": "76561199120674424", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1625617205}, "language": "english", "review": "i cant believe a free game like this isn't getting the attention it deserves. i've literally played paid games way worse than this.\n\nit's free, it's cute, and it's a genuinely enjoyable turn-based combat rpg. it has a meaningful storyline and is replayable. what more could you ask for??\n\n10/10!!!", "timestamp_created": 1660137982, "timestamp_updated": 1660137982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120375927": {"recommendationid": "120375927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856635573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1660098682}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY CUTE i reccomend this game 10000%", "timestamp_created": 1660112263, "timestamp_updated": 1660112263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120316796": {"recommendationid": "120316796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878286288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1660025912}, "language": "english", "review": "Why do I always play games involving children dying.\n", "timestamp_created": 1660025998, "timestamp_updated": 1660025998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120245504": {"recommendationid": "120245504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199183413903", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1630701565}, "language": "english", "review": "TBH, disfrut\u00e9 cada momento de jugar este juego.

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. \n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. \n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern.

Story-wise it is a delightful journey through and through, a heartfelt and charming blend of silly and serious without being too over-the-top on either regard (quite careful and friendly with its' subject matter at that), to put it simply, a journey worth having- The game doesn't take long to complete and quite honestly it's worth every minute you give it.\n\nPS.

Hard to think of a more succinct way of summarizing my feelings after playing through it.\n\nThe battle mechanics aren't exactly anything flashy, but they more than get the job done. It's satisfying building up your skill tree, even if realistically speaking, you won't be using much more than the standard slash and, occasionally, the Flinch or Sleep spells by the later sections [spoiler]and even during the final boss[/spoiler]. It's all a pretty good foundation to build off of if the devs decide to work on another turn-based RPG at some point in the future.\n\nStory and art direction are the strong suits of Grimm's Hollow. Very endearing setting, with lots of great character designs, and I'd definitely love to see more work from the artists involved. The story itself was very sweet, even if there was more telling than showing than I care for at points, and after getting every ending, I've been left pretty smitten with the protagonist. The one sour note I can think of is that it was a noticeably short experience (I got all of the endings in about 3 hours), but considering that it's entirely free, that's hard to complain about at length.\n\nVery solid all in all.

It was made with the help of a version of RPG Maker and I think it also has one or two stock sounds. The different characters are very nicely designed and develop a certain personality quite quickly. The landscapes are partly kept quite simple but atmospheric. The dialogs are as expected partly funny and exciting. It's all kept in a certain \"Indy style\", which generally appeals to me very much. The general sound design was for me personally unfortunately the weakest part of the game. Many effects sounded very generic to me and rather like they served as \"gap fillers\". Unfortunately, not one of the music pieces that run in the background really stuck in my head. However, this is probably purely personal taste, because the music has obviously been created with a lot of effort and is in no way just some generic droning. While writing this review, I listened to the OST again and unfortunately can't assign any of the melodies to a certain region in the game. The OST was created by Natbird and Bruno Buglisi. The OST is available for free on You Tube, or for fans who want to support the developer, also available on steam with other bits and pieces.\n\nAll in all, I really liked the game. Especially the story and the whole visual design appealed to me very much.\nI hope the developer Ghosthunter will one day create one or even more games of this kind. I would be very happy about that :)\nThis game manages in a very short time to \"touch\" you and make you interested in the depicted world.\n\nI would like to name Untertale as a similar game. Who liked Untertale, will feel quite quickly \"back home\" :)\n\nI can only recommend this game and fervently hope for more from the developer Ghosthunter.

I recommend leaving BLUE or RED FLAME at the point where it asks for 60 Points to improve as after that BLUE or RED FLAME will be maxed out.   ONE or THE OTHER.  Just make sure ONE of either BLUE or RED is NOT MAXED OUT.  You can max out all other skills, and attributes.   Also it's a good idea to have VIOLET FLAME MAXED OUT.\n2-  BETTER YET DON'T MAX RED or BLUE FLAME UNTIL you get the part with the LAST BOSS.  AT THIS POINT, with your Skill Tree still NOT MAXED OUT create a SAVE GAME that will be accessible later.  It may be a good idea to make sure you also have enough points (which should be 60 if the only thing you didn't max was either RED OR BLUE FLAME) to max your skill tree but DO NOT MAX THEM OUT YET!!!  \n3-  FINISH the game for the first time.  AND NOW you can read a guide on how to get all 4 endings, so you won't get spoiled or anything.\n4-  This is the part that you will thank yourself for reading my BIG TIP, and following it.\n5-  And enjoy your other 3x endings without having to possibly play the game 1-3 more times :)", "timestamp_created": 1650744835, "timestamp_updated": 1650744835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822423815727233887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114346815": {"recommendationid": "114346815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309357981", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1650731428}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\ni mean that very heartily.\nthis game is a very beautiful experience and the ending makes me wanna cry...\nthe rpg system is actually enjoyable(better than most tbh)\\\nplease play", "timestamp_created": 1650731570, "timestamp_updated": 1650731570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114334273": {"recommendationid": "114334273", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179299259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1651442172}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best free experiences ive ever had", "timestamp_created": 1650716785, "timestamp_updated": 1650716785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114331385": {"recommendationid": "114331385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043535601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1650712979}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a cute charming little game, artstyle adorable and easy to learn fighting style.

After upgrading your character a little bit the turn based combat becomes very easy, I happened to max out my defense right from the start and barely took damage for the entire game. \n\nMy greatest enemy was actually the janky menu more than the mobs - combat doesn't pause for your turn so enemies continue to attack you while you're trying to navigate the menu and just *attack* already. Combined with a very clunky interface that that feels unresponsive because your inputs are locked whenever an enemy's attack animation plays, and that involves many superflous clicks to go through (EG, have to \"select a party member\" before attacking, when there's only ever the one party member), the menu can make combat slightly frustrating. The rough edges on the menu would be much more forgivable if I didn't have to navigate it on the clock, but it works out in the end because combat is ultimately very easy anyway.\n\nIMO though, this game is much more about it's story than it is about the combat. I think this game came out before Pixar's Soul, but if you've seen that movie, the premise is very similar. Soul was a very good movie. Grimm's Hollow is a very good game. The story is simple and compelling and all of the multiple endings are thorough and satisfying. The story is the heart of this game and it is heartwarming.\n\nAesthetically the game looks pretty good. They made wise decisions with their limited man power and ended up with some very bang-for-buck art direction. They use a mostly monochrome color palette for example, which means color theory is not a consideration, everything you draw will look good with everything else because it's *all* purple with just a few exceptions. The game is pixel art. The tileset is also mostly solid colors rather than textured details which gives the world a smooth, cartoonish look, and serves to really highlight the things that are given more detail. Icons are cute and simple, wonderfully attractive abstractions. My go-to healing item for the whole game was the ghost cookies because they were just so cute, despite being literally the weakest item. It has very consistent theming, I love the sort of halloween theme it has. I remember about halfway through the game I happened to look at the background of the inventory menu for the first time, and it was a bunch of cute little ghosts and skulls and stuff scrolling by. I thought to myself \"Oh hey, that's good! That looks nice, I like this game.\" Little things made me smile, you know?\n\nThe soundtrack is good! I'm super picky about audio transitions, it's a pet peeve of mine when the game loads a new area and the music just cuts abruptly? This game does not do that. Most AAA games do make that mistake, but this little indie game got it right, and I appreciate that. I did find that quickly switching between ambient music and battle music was jarring, but that's a problem every RPG ever has. The sound effect for the \"piercing gaze\" attack was also irritating, the enemy that does that is my least favorite and I always groaned when finding that one.

I played nonstop for more than 3 hours, and I don't normally do that with story games like this. There were lots of pros to this game, a lot of really nice features, pretty atmosphere, really good music, etc. But there were some cons too.\n\nThe fighting is my biggest complaint. It's not really turn based. The enemies you go against can just keep attacking constantly. Even so, a lot of the fights are simply, but they can be really frustrating when you get hit time after time after time by one or two enemies. In one of my sequences, I got hit 15 times (literally, not an exaggeration) before I was finally able to make my turn. Also, the final fight, the additional character that you get to use seems to be a little more in the way than actually useful. They do have their benefit, but it's also not super intuitive and a little messy when actually fighting.\n\nOther than the fighting, I don't have very many gripes with the game.

However, by Hour 2 and beyond, you are loaded with items and can defeat most enemies with little to no trouble. Reaching max level for the 'true' ending is an effortless affair. Though I had hoped for at least one enemy or boss- optional or otherwise- that would actually require a few rounds of fighting to defeat, that's clearly not this game's focus or goal, so much as its characters and themes.\nStory: An interesting take on Limbo and the afterlife, where the spirits must gather the energy to pass into the true afterlife, or slowly decay into remnants of whatever aspirations they had in life. This is depicted literally through the Baker, [spoiler]whose spirit has remained too long in Limbo, and has begun to turn into a bunch of bread loaves, physically.[/spoiler] \n\nClocking in at about 3ish hours of content and free to play, you may as well give it a shot, if you like cute little RPG indies like this.", "timestamp_created": 1642845431, "timestamp_updated": 1642845431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108506556": {"recommendationid": "108506556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438419980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1642822761}, "language": "english", "review": "nice little game", "timestamp_created": 1642822715, "timestamp_updated": 1642822715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108501492": {"recommendationid": "108501492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364880920", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1304, "last_played": 1681730519}, "language": "english", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1642816182, "timestamp_updated": 1642816182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108498416": {"recommendationid": "108498416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281024985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1642784701}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Admiro la esencia que tiene el juego y el humor que a veces parece tonto que maneja, he llegado a jugar 2 finales, desconozco si a\u00fan hay m\u00e1s, debo admitir que con lo poco que he llegado a conocer me he sentido a gusto con la historia y el concepto que maneja acerca de la muerte y lo que representan los segadores y los fantasmas en el mundo de los muertos.", "timestamp_created": 1642811974, "timestamp_updated": 1642811974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108492944": {"recommendationid": "108492944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042906319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1643068335}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Demaciado bueno.", "timestamp_created": 1642804911, "timestamp_updated": 1642804911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108475530": {"recommendationid": "108475530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329229079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1642786653}, "language": "english", "review": "great game\n", "timestamp_created": 1642786698, "timestamp_updated": 1642786698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108416562": {"recommendationid": "108416562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060274390", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1642717032}, "language": "english", "review": "The only critique I have is that there isn't more", "timestamp_created": 1642717546, "timestamp_updated": 1642717546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108400619": {"recommendationid": "108400619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427821685", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1619924816}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is my kinda game.

Having spent 0 points on skills in the beginning makes the game look tottaly hard an impossible, but with the first few correctly spent points, it will be a piece of cake for experienced players, this until the boss, I got caught with a one shot the first time I fought him, that's because all the damage I had took so far didn't surpassed over 100 hitpoints, so the next time I maxed out the hitpoints and it was a piece of cake again, it's just be careful to not get one hitten with the debuffs the boss gives. There was one detail that caught my attention and I really would like to know the reason behind it: in one of the caves, a waterfall forms a reversed cross, wich can be either an edgy satanic symbol for \"cool\" kids to show their edgyness and lack of discipline at home, or St. Peter's cross, that means not being whorty of the same death as Jesus Christ.

This game takes about three hours for me the first time around, and in that time it manages to do what a lot of other games can't. It makes you feel something, for every single character in it, no matter how small the part. From the main character, to the \"villain\" and all the side characters. You hurt for them, and hope for them. The people who made this clearly worked really hard to make it. It was such a small group of people and yet it was so well thought out. There is so much heart to it. I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone for the story alone. If you like games with turn based fights then this one is definitely for you.

I highly suggest you support the creator, he's made a really breathtaking experience here.\nWithout further preamble, here is a list of PRO/CON bullet points.\n\n[h2]PRO:[/h2]\n+ Great Music\n+ Wonderful Visuals and Animation\n+ Great Dialogue\n+ Wonderful Tear-Jerker of a Story\n+ Nice, if simple, combat\n+ Good and Skippable Tutorials\n+ Short and Sweet (2 hours)\n+ Multiple Endings\n+ IT'S FREE!\n\n[h2]CON:[/h2]\n- Unstable frame rates (at least in fullscreen mode, I think the game may not be optimised for it)\n- Slightly floaty controls (but not in combat, since it's turn-based, which is all that matters)\n- Powers are unbalanced, as in, you don't really need to use most of them (just levelling up HP and ATK will probably get you through most of the game) - the exception to this point is the final boss (you really need everything here)", "timestamp_created": 1638026706, "timestamp_updated": 1647601619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104298783": {"recommendationid": "104298783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256585213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1638002533}, "language": "english", "review": "damn is this a wildride of emotions.", "timestamp_created": 1638003221, "timestamp_updated": 1638003221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104247905": {"recommendationid": "104247905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966653747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1637977909}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful art, intensely human story of love, life and death.

Y luego ves todo lo que me he sacado. No es una gu\u00eda de compras.\n\nEsto es la mejor historia contada de la mejor manera que he visto. Trata de una adolescente que ha muerto y que est\u00e1 ahora en un lugar extra\u00f1o y con tem\u00e1tica oscura.\n\na lo que me refiero con \"buen contada\" es por lo que pude sacar sobreanalizando el t\u00edtulo, primero me d\u00ed cuenta de que la historia ten\u00eda algo m\u00e1s escondido de lo que estaba por la escena en la que la chica nos cuenta a nosotros y al mismo tiempo a su hermano lo que pas\u00f3 antes de su muerte. La chica es una adolescente que sus padres pasaban por una mala situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica, y ella ten\u00eda que quedarse en casa y hacer los queaceres. Sus padres se peleaban muy seguido, se maltrataban y gritaban. sus peleas hab\u00edan sesado, su situaci\u00f3n economica era buena, pero su padre muri\u00f3. Esto le peg\u00f3 demasiado duro a la protagonista, pero antes de morir hab\u00eda dejado embarazada a su madre, y as\u00ed naci\u00f3 el peque\u00f1o timmy. Un ni\u00f1o inocente, al que lala (la protagonista) le encantaba jugar con \u00e9l cuando ten\u00eda tiempo libre. su madre quer\u00eda mucho a Timmy, dejando de lado a lala, pero a lala no le import\u00f3... Ella no hab\u00eda recibido amor de sus padres. De lo \u00fanico que recib\u00eda y daba amor, era de su hermano... En esta parte llor\u00e9 como un puto ni\u00f1o, pero ahora hay m\u00e1s. lala quiere darle un alma a su hermano, no le interesa revivir ella, ya no le interesa nada m\u00e1s que su hermano. Pensar esto realmente me peg\u00f3 tan duro que llor\u00e9 10 minutos de las 2.5 hs que jugu\u00e9 al juego. Yo saqu\u00e9 el final malo, en el que el panadero se llev\u00f3 el alma de timmy y se convirti\u00f3 en un mutante. por lo que grimm tuvo que sacrificarlo. Lala lloraba y lloraba por la muerte de su hermano. Una cosa que not\u00e9 es que por el poco amor que recib\u00eda Lala de sus padres, ella representa a los fantasmas del juego c\u00f3mo sus pensamientos a s\u00ed misma. hay un monstruo que es un reloj, que he representado que es la manera en que ella se v\u00e9, una perdida de tiempo... No solo me baso en ese monstruo, tambien en otro que es un parasito que veo como si ella pensara que es el par\u00e1sito de la familia. Lala cuando termina un combate no est\u00e1 cansada por lo que tuvo que hacer, sin\u00f3 que representa como se siente. \nOtra cosa que encontr\u00e9 es que cada vez la m\u00fasica se pone m\u00e1s oscura. Lo tomo como la decadencia de la mente de Lala, que ella solo quer\u00eda salvar a su hermano, lo \u00fanico que le importaba. Y con todas las dificultades que se le ponen, se va desanimando m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s. \nEl uso del color es 10/10 de este juego. Al principio al parecer una historia conmovedora y con mucho carisma, todo es colorido. Hay globos coloridos, las habitaciones son bonitas, la cueva est\u00e1 hecha de colores vivos, y al final todo se torna gris, oscuro.\nuna cosa que not\u00e9 es que el color oscuro en los ojos de Lala es la falta de amor que tiene. Y que poco y nada le importa ya su vida.\nLala quiere redimirse, sent\u00edr que su existencia ha valido de algo, esa es otra razon de porque Lala quiere salvar a su hermano.\nLuego de esto que pas\u00f3 al final del final malo, grimm nos cuenta como actu\u00f3 Lala posteriormente. Solo se dedicaba a matar monstruos, a veces se quedaba pensando en frente de una cueva. Todos le ten\u00edan miedo. Cuando la recog\u00eda y la dejaba en una cama luego de que se desmayara, desaparec\u00eda en cuanto salia de la habitaci\u00f3n. Grimm quer\u00eda volverla a la vida, pero ni el pod\u00eda hacer eso sin perjudicar a un alma. Es un final muy melancolico.\nAhora que me he pasado el final bueno, Timmy logra tener el alma, todo parece tener un tono humor\u00edstico. Hasta que Timmy debe irse, y se da cuenta de que Lala le ha mentido sobre que ella ir\u00eda con \u00e9l. Termina accediendo a irse y joder estoy llorando que mierda me pasa? acabo de conocer este juego hace 3 horas joder \nLuego de esta escena, Lala se \"medio abre\" ante grimm y luego proceden a irse.\nAhora sucede algo extra\u00f1o, en vez de relatarnos lo que ocurre grimm, nos lo relata Lala. Lala nos cuenta que se perdi\u00f3 en las cuevas, esperando a \"pasar\", hasta que Grimm finalmente la encuentra y la deja en la cama del principio. Nos cuentan una realidad mucho mejor a lo que vimos antes, Grimm aprende a tejer, ya no hay panadero, y Grimm decide hacer un sueter de Timmy para recordarlo con cari\u00f1o, lavender llora por su hermano perdido, desea verlo otra vez. Ella confunde la realidad que vivi\u00f3 antes de la muerte como un sue\u00f1o, y su vida actual como la realidad. Grimm act\u00faa de una forma divertida y bastante paterna con ella. \n\nSaltan los t\u00edtulos...

After putting in the time to fully beat all of the games endings (which is totally worth it) i found myself just sitting there, thinking about the game i just beat and how many people i know that would love it just as much as i did or maybe even more. To put it short this game is one of my favorite story driven games now and i hope that my review will help people buy this wonderful game and have just as good of a time as i had with it.", "timestamp_created": 1636869621, "timestamp_updated": 1636869621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102752071": {"recommendationid": "102752071", "author": {"steamid": "76561199182694536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1636866306}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad el juego me termino gustando mas de lo que esperaba, es un juego corto y divertido recomendable uwu, por cierto, Quieren pan?", "timestamp_created": 1636867550, "timestamp_updated": 1636867550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102744542": {"recommendationid": "102744542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963822847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1627939078}, "language": "english", "review": "Very charming and heartfelt little game with lovely visuals.

This scratched that RPG Maker itch perfectly with pleasing visuals, decent combat, and a nice little story that's too the point and doesn't overstay its welcome.  I think my favorite part of the whole thing came down to some of the sound effects in battles, since they use the same hit sounds that are in OFF (I'm pretty sure, at least - it's fitting unless it's some default noise).  I kinda wish that the combat required more of you, since there's a lot of moves that I simply just didn't end up using because it was easier to use the instant kill moves.  The only time I really considered using the other moves is in the last fight, where the status effects are basically required.  Really though, the game is more focused on its atmosphere and story, so it doesn't really bog down the experience.  I got the bad end and true end; both were pretty satisfying.

I love looking at games and how they can be designed around certain constraints, seeing what interesting ideas are brought to the forefront to be conducive to both a great experience and one that doesn't compromise in its vision. In this case, it seems like the entire goal of the game was to craft an emotionally moving, character driven story while only having around 2 hours of gameplay, give or take, and I'd say that in this regard, Grimm's Hollow is a resounding success. The game is shockingly good at providing very clear and interesting pieces of characterisation that rapidly inject a lot of charm and colour into the world, all main characters having extremely clear and nuanced elements to their individual motives, a bunch of genuinely funny lines, just a bit of everything to give them just enough unique traits to feel distinct and interesting while still shrouding them in enough mystery to keep them intriguing, even once the game ends.\n\nTo add to this, the narrative in general is short yet very effective in its portrayal of attempting to process grief and everything that comes along with it in a variety of ways that naturally act as a way to ramp the tension and stakes. I love the way the music becomes so intense as things go on until it hits a point where it completely plateaus into a series of long winded, droning melodies that feel as if they represent the true reality of the situation setting in. Likewise, the use of colour feels pretty interesting, with the vaguely warm and cool colours of blue and purple being gradually phased out for a much harsher red, which cleverly manages to establish a much more intense feeling that once again feels as if it's then cleverly phased out to a more neutral series of greys and whites.\n\nOn top of the excellent, charming writing, I also really appreciated the combat once I got into it, being fairly simple and easy, but providing a lot of variety in what way you could choose to build your character and approach any given situation, having to carefully consider where to dump your resources for whatever potentially dangerous situation is ahead. The little timing based elements also kept it that bit fresher feeling, even if those mechanics were ultimately pretty shallow and felt as if they really should have had some nicer feedback associated with them to feel as polished as so many other elements here, but they did the trick enough to only rarely be a distraction. Overall this is just a really solid little game that does a lot with its short runtime and feels like an extremely well oiled machine with so much heart behind it. Definitely play this if you're at all into RPGmaker aesthetics or charming, occasionally quirky narrative experiences.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1636723553, "timestamp_updated": 1636723553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102615296": {"recommendationid": "102615296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245127064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1576372412}, "language": "english", "review": "An adorable little game.", "timestamp_created": 1636671606, "timestamp_updated": 1636671606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102611701": {"recommendationid": "102611701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891328084", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1636665883}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun rpg with a solid concept.
