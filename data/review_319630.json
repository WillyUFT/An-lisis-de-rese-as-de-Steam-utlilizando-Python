Characters were really well-written and the travelling back in time element of this game was really fun to play around with. I liked the detail put into the world-building, and the suspense felt behind every decision-making moment. I felt like this game was very nostalgic while I was playing it. I think this game pulled this off well with its introspective approach i.e. the diary kept by Max and the photographs taken. You felt attached to the characters in the game. I also liked that you could compare the choices you made with your friends and with everyone else who's played the game after every chapter. The story was well thought out and it put you in a great dilemma when deciding which characters were trustworthy. The music was also really fitting and added to the game's teenage American 2000/2010's feel.\n\nCons:\n\nI'd say the puny amount of endings that this game offers can be a downside if you were expecting that your choices would dramatically change the ending of the game. Though to me it was still worth it.\nI also encountered a couple of glitches in the game as well but they weren't too bad.", "timestamp_created": 1700597485, "timestamp_updated": 1700598179,

Spoilers ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn principle, this game is brilliant. I enjoyed the characters, the time travel mechanic is cleverly done, and the puzzle elements were compelling without becoming frustrating. I would have had no hesitation in recommending this game, and in fact I did and offered to buy it for a friend. \n\nRight up until the end.\n\nTo me, the whole point of this game was to explore concepts like consequences and agency as experienced in the life of a sympathetic and compelling character. I went into the game with the idea that it was a \"choices matter\" game, and I went in sincerely believing that - with the exception of a few somewhat jarring moments when the plot seemed to be on rails - I would get a ton of replay value from going back and exploring how the story played out if I made other decisions. I was looking forward to seeing how the decisions I had made (and sometimes agonized over) would impact the ending, so it was pretty profoundly disappointing to learn that, seemingly, they didn't.

Watching the develop of Chloe and Max's story evokes a whirlwind of feelings; pain, sadness, joy and sympathy are the most recurrent, at least in my experience. And it's important to say that the franchise goes beyond the two girls, and also delights and touch the player several times by diving intensely into the complicated life of each citizen of Arcadia Bay that we can interact with, each one more complex and interesting than the other, but above all: you feel like you are interacting with a real person, like everything in LIS will always feel so real.\n\nThe environment is so highly detailed, all things were thought out and reckoned down to the smallest details and everything here has a reason and a meaning, nothing is \"by chance\" or just for style points. Speaking of style, the game, even without having the biggest budget, knows how to perfectly convey the feeling and ambiance needed for each scene, and the cartoonish touches, the painting, the soundtrack and lighting will all bring the intimate and cozy feeling impeccably. But not only that, the game will also use the same elements (and many others) to bring us pain and fear when necessary, and as ironic as it may seem, time will fly right before your eyes while playing, and you'll catch yourself playing a 2-hour episode without even feeling it, and, in fact, this may be the only thing you won't feel here.\n\nTalking about such a complete and complex masterpiece like this would take me tons of pages, space I don't have here, but don't fret, nothing is worthier than try it out to make your own conclusions when we're talking about Life is Strange. It'll literally be impossible for you to waste your time playing it, and be prepared tho.\n\nReady for the mosh pit, shaka bra?", "timestamp_created": 1700254174, "timestamp_updated": 1700254345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150289838": {"recommendationid": "150289838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383899343", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 60080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60080, "last_played": 1636034087}, "language": "english", "review": "Just look at my hour play, you already know it", "timestamp_created": 1700240941, "timestamp_updated": 1700240941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150289603": {"recommendationid": "150289603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157102571", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1471096256}, "language": "english", "review": "~ DIFFICULTY ~\n\ud83d\udd32 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n\u2611\ufe0f Easy\n\ud83d\udd32 Normal\n\ud83d\udd32 Hard\n\ud83d\udd32 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n\ud83d\udd32 MS Paint\n\ud83d\udd32 Bad\n\ud83d\udd32 Meh\n\ud83d\udd32 Graphics dont matter in this game\n\u2611\ufe0f Good\n\ud83d\udd32 Beautiful\n\ud83d\udd32 Masterpiece\n\n~ MUSIC ~\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Bad\n\ud83d\udd32 Not special\n\ud83d\udd32 Good\n\u2611\ufe0f Beautiful\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n\ud83d\udd32 This game has no story\n\ud83d\udd32 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n\ud83d\udd32 It's there for the people who want it\n\ud83d\udd32 Well written\n\u2611\ufe0f Epic story\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Free\n\ud83d\udd32 Underpriced\n\ud83d\udd32 Perfect Price\n\u2611\ufe0f Could be cheaper\n\ud83d\udd32 Overpriced\n\ud83d\udd32 Complete waste of money\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n\u2611\ufe0f You can run it on a microwave\n\ud83d\udd32 Average (But with tons of mods, would require a high end)\n\ud83d\udd32 High end\n\ud83d\udd32 NASA computer\n\n~ LENGTH ~\n\n\ud83d\udd32 Very Short (0 -

If you're misanthropic or just don't care for teeny angst and self-promoters, it's likely just gonna be taxing for your \"social battery\".\nCharacters are mostly well designed and believable, if you restrain your expectations to giving everybody under the age of 25 or so in the game about as much credit as you'd probably give children throwing tantrums, teenagers experiencing their first rushes and overdramatic or overportraited personalities being must have trope characters so minorities within minorities can identify themselves with somebody.\nAdult characters in the game, on the other hand, are actually well designed. Would have been a lot better without the pretentiousness and the catering to young (american) audiences.\nThe main reason that I dislike the game though is the illusion of choice in regards to the absolute ending of the game.\nSpoiler (somewhat):\nThere's only really 2 ending cinematics and they (didn't test, but logically can't deduce any other results) don't differ at all, no matter the playthrough choices.\nThe way up to the end does differ though and character interactions do change noticeably enough.\nConsistency within chosen paths and overall storytelling continuity does seem to be well done and without bugs though.\nIf you're an emotional, less critical person, I can see some merit to experiencing the story.\nThe game doesn't step out of character throughout, so the quality it promises in episode 1 will be the same that it delivers in episode 5.\nIf I had to rate my experience, I'd give the game a 4/10.

personally, if you dont care about the look of the game (although it is mostly cutscenes) just get this version, I personally like the look of it more.\nThe rewind mechanic is one of my favourite game mechanics in \"movie games\", in any other story driven game this would be considered \"save-scumming\" but Life is Strange actively encourages you to rewind and see all possible outcomes and pick the one you find most favourable, while not shying away from showing you the consequences of Max abusing her powers, though I wish it had more of a punishing system gameplay-wise like a cooldown if you rewind too many times in a row, though i suppose it does have a limit on how far back you can go in any given scene\nStory-wise, im not gonna go on a tirade on how \"cheesy\" or \"awkward\" the dialogue is, this game is about 18 year olds in 2013, I was an 18 year old in 2013, me and my friends also said hella lame things like the characters in LiS, though I do feel like you can tell by the usage of slang at times that it wasn't written by a native english speaker (the over-use of the word Busted, which at times is contextually incorrect is the biggest example)\nThe development of Max and Chloe's friendship and it's culmination on the final lighthouse scene is what made me realise i was in love with my best friend and we've been a couple since 2015, so thanks DONTNOD for making us

The setting is also amazingly done, with Arcadia Bay & Blackwell Academy being both memorable and enjoyable to navigate/explore whilst building relations with fellow classmates and strangers alike. The VA/dialogue is amazing for all of the characters (although rather corny at times) as it truly makes you feel like you're back at Highschool with the cliquey feel, along with the not so rudimentary bullying that occurs. The SFX is great, the cinematics were nicely shot (although dated in texture quality) and the music was absolutely spot on. One of the reasons I enjoyed this game so much was the musical score, and not only were the OST's great, but how they were incorporated into the game and cinematics created many goosies! Now apart from the character design, the gameplay/story stole the show. The ability to build relations the way you see fit using Max's supernatural powers was incredibly fun. Being somewhat of a \"perfectionist\" when it comes to RPG's and story/narrative driven games, being able to explore the various dialogue options and seeing how they effect the future story choices by using Max's ability was soooo good. No more saving prior to a big story pathway decision, or even googling the results of said actions just to make sure you don't completely bottle everything, being able to use Max's supernatural ability to explore the various options was truly enjoyable, and quite often comedic as well. I personally don't get emotionally attached to games that often,  but Life is Strange did a great job at tugging at the heart strings. Personally, what enabled this was remembering most of the characters names and personalities, or even the notable features of the game's setting or places of interest as a result of how well these aspects of the game were created. The only notable drawback was the rather poor visual quality of the textures and the facial animations/lip syncing, but the game was released in 2013 so there is some slack to be given. Definitely a must play, especially being such an original game - 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1699378335, "timestamp_updated": 1699974841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149700338": {"recommendationid": "149700338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969435069", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1348, "last_played": 1699250623}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished game, went to sleep, woke up, cried for 30mins.\n\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1699358089, "timestamp_updated": 1699358089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149685251": {"recommendationid": "149685251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859749628", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1799, "last_played": 1696831382}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved every second of this game, so incredibly well written.\n\nSpoiler, don't trust photography teachers they will make you cry.", "timestamp_created": 1699326498, "timestamp_updated": 1699326498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149682618": {"recommendationid": "149682618", "author": {"steamid": "76561199207807287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1023, "last_played": 1699334489}, "language": "english", "review": "worst game ever", "timestamp_created": 1699322030, "timestamp_updated": 1699322030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149671155": {"recommendationid": "149671155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237933508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1277, "last_played": 1699307048}, "language": "english", "review": "My fave forever <3", "timestamp_created": 1699304466, "timestamp_updated": 1699304466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149667596": {"recommendationid": "149667596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136959839", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1624029770}, "language": "english", "review": "I cried a lil the first time.

Meet up with old friends, make new ones, see familiar places, experience what has changed and what has stayed the same.. Unravel a mystery, maybe find love. You make the choices and deal with any consequences, good or bad. Or good \u00e0nd bad. You discover more about Max' past and shape her future. Tough choices an difficult dilemmas. Joy and fear, melancholy and despair. every human emotion is in here.\nYou will get drawn in and feel with the characters'emotions, feel their joy and grief make sure you have at least 25 hours available in one week bcs its worth playing this without large gaps.I played it in 18 hrs over 2 or 3 days. Oh and i needed about a week or 2 before i was emotionally recovered. Might want to keep some time for that lol. Did i mention you will cry? bcs you will.  \n\nIn the end it was a cathartic  experience for me. As Max came to terms with her past, made something of her present and worked towards making the future... i healed stuff from my past, felt better about the present and felt inspired to do more with my future.\nHmm.. maybe im over-emotionalising it as i am very sensitive to touching stories.. But play it. Its awesome. Might look for the remastered one...i hear it looks better.\n\nIts most certainly worth your 20 euro-equivalent money units imho just for how brilliant the story sucks you in and makes you care, but you can get it on sale ofc.

It's not the best game ever, but it's not the worst either. It seems to sit somewhere in that weird \"Hey, if you want to spend 15 or so hours stuck with annoying, mean, bullying young adults and their drama, be my guest!\".\n\nI struggle to understand why this game has such good reviews when its pacing is all over the place, the gameplay is fairly standard, the graphics are stylized but absolutely stacked with bad animation; most of the characters even though well written for the most part, often end up being an absolute joy-kill to be around and as a game that  self describes itself as a \"choice matters\" game, in reality and actuality nothing you do in the game matters until the very last 5 or so minutes of the game.\n\nI could go on about many issues I've had here with this game, but I will just get the one that irked me the most out of the way - I hated almost every single moment I had to spend with Chloe - I dislike her no matter when she is, how she is, why she is, she is a bad friend, she is manipulative, she is mean to everyone and you will be stuck dealing with her nonsense for most of the game, right to the very end. I do not think I have ever had a displeasure of being forced to \"care\" for a character in a video game as much as I did here. I really, really dislike her xD\n\nSo yeah, overall the vibe was kinda cool but screw Chloe and her BS drama and crap. Would not ever want to play this game ever again. \n\nOn paper, this game is perfect for me. In practice, I was frustrated and often annoyed by being forced to revolve an entire game around Chloe.\n\nI felt bad for Max for having to deal with her. She was smart to not get in touch with her for 5 years and it should have stayed that way. \n\nNow try to guess my choice at the very end of the game. \n\nLol.", "timestamp_created": 1698278018, "timestamp_updated": 1698278018, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148861209": {"recommendationid": "148861209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412546156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1432, "last_played": 1698251173}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished the game and now I am depressed, hahaha.

This game, however, is not for the faint of heart, as it delves deeply into themes that often remain hidden beneath the surface of everyday life.\n\nFrom the very start, \"LIFE IS STRANGE\" pulls no punches. It tackles issues such as bullying, suicide, self-harm, sexual assault, and more, forcing players to confront the harshness of these themes. This is where the game's strength lies, in its unflinching portrayal of the real struggles and turmoil faced by its teenage protagonists. It doesn't sugarcoat the challenges they experience, and it encourages players to empathize with their plights.\n\nYet, this is also where \"LIFE IS STRANGE\" becomes a double-edged sword. Its unrelenting dive into these dark waters occasionally feels overwhelming and unnecessarily grim, almost as if it's attempting to outdo itself in depicting trauma. It's a stark reminder that life, indeed, is not always kind, but at times, it feels gratuitous in its attempts to convey this message.\n\nWhat sets \"LIFE IS STRANGE\" apart is its emotionally charged storytelling. The characters are well-developed, and the relationships they form are both relatable and heart-wrenching. The game's focus on choice and consequence adds depth to the narrative, as each decision resonates with the player on a personal level, making them ponder the ethical and emotional consequences of their actions.\n\nThe game's various endings, however, are where the narrative takes a strange, almost nonsensical turn. Without delving into spoilers, it can be argued that these endings feel disconnected from the weight of the rest of the story. They left many players feeling that the emotional investment they had made in the characters had been undermined by a conclusion that didn't quite fit.\n\nNevertheless, where \"LIFE IS STRANGE\" undoubtedly excels is its soundtrack. The music, often melancholic and reflective, perfectly complements the game's themes and adds a layer of emotional depth that resonates long after the credits roll. In this aspect, the game truly shines, making its players feel the depths of its characters' sorrow and struggles.\n\nIn summary, \"LIFE IS STRANGE\" is a well-written, tragic drama that unapologetically explores the most challenging aspects of life for young adults.

While the game has received critical acclaim and has a dedicated fan base, it's not without its criticisms and flaws. Here are some common criticisms of the series:\n\n1. Pacing Issues: Some players have found the pacing of the game to be slow, particularly in the first episode. The game's focus on character development and story can sometimes lead to a lack of action, which may not appeal to all players.\n\n2. Dialogue and Writing: The dialogue in \"Life is Strange\" can be hit or miss. Some players feel that the teenage characters use unrealistic or cringe-worthy language and expressions, and the writing occasionally veers into melodrama.\n\n3. Lip Syncing and Animation: The lip-syncing in the game has been criticized for not always syncing well with the dialogue. The animation can also feel stiff or awkward at times.\n\n4. Binary Choices: \"Life is Strange\" is known for its branching narrative and choices that affect the story's outcome. However, some players have criticized the binary nature of these choices, where it can feel like you're choosing between two extreme options rather than making nuanced decisions.\n\n5. Inconsistent Voice Acting: While the game features a strong voice cast, some players have found the quality of voice acting to be uneven, with some characters' performances standing out more than others.\n\n6. Plot Holes and Unexplained Mysteries: The game introduces several supernatural elements and mysteries, but not all of these are satisfactorily explained, leading to frustration among players who were hoping for more closure.\n\n7. Limited Gameplay: \"Life is Strange\" is primarily an interactive drama, and some players may find the gameplay elements to be limited or lacking in complexity. There's a stronger focus on storytelling than traditional gameplay.\n\n8. Technical Issues: Some players have reported technical issues such as bugs and crashes, which can affect the overall experience.\n\n9. Some Controversial Themes: The game tackles various serious and controversial themes such as mental health, bullying, and suicide. While some players appreciate the game's willingness to address these issues, others may find it heavy-handed or mishandled.\n\n10. Art Style: The game's art style, which features hand-painted textures and a somewhat surreal aesthetic, is a point of contention. Some players love it, while others find it off-putting.\n\nIt's important to note that these criticisms are subjective, and many players and critics have praised \"Life is Strange\" for its engaging narrative, well-developed characters, and unique approach to storytelling.

The dialogue and scripting can be awkward, the pacing could be better, and sometimes the choices you can make don\u2019t matter that much. And it\u2019s all set within an American setting that is obviously made people by outside of the United States. But I didn\u2019t really care about the game's issues because I really enjoyed replaying Life Is Strange all over again.\n\nThe story and characters all have this awkward and idiosyncratic charm reminiscent of Twin Peaks, but it is also really interesting and sometimes absorbing. The rewind mechanic makes for compelling moments that will surprise many players, and it is really unique how most choices can be rewound so you can see the other immediate outcomes of your choices. It\u2019s also just really fun to rewind time and play around with the dialogue and characters. \n\nI also really liked the performances of the two leads. Ashley Birch\u2019s performance as Chloe is definitely a highlight but Hannah Telle\u2019s performance as Max is also worth mentioning. The latter\u2019s character and the pairing of her interest in photography with her time travel abilities is just a really good match in general.\n\nSo I do recommend Life Is Strange. Experiencing it again after not playing it in several years was really worth it. It\u2019s probably the closest I could have gotten to playing it again for the first time.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOne last thing to say is that there are two versions of Life Is Strange. This version (the original) was made with a low budget but it had a photographic art style. The remaster was done by Deck Nine, not DONTNOD \u2013 the original developers. \n\nFaces, facial animations, hair, and some environments look better but some aspects are definitely uneven and the remaster looks darker overall. Not that Deck Nine did a bad job but there are several reasons why the original version of Life Is Strange might be worth picking up over the remaster:\n[list]\n[*]The original game is cheaper, especially on sale.\n\n[*]You can get the first episode for [u]free[/u]. Essentially you get a full episode as a demo.\n\n[*]It\u2019s the original game that DONTNOD had released during 2015. Some people might see the value in that.\n[/list]\nThe remaster is also reported to have several issues even after recent patches. But the original is also somewhat buggy as well. I have had at least one or two bugs per episode. Most are nothing serious but I did get stuck in the environment twice however. \n\nThe original game still has its low budget but stylistic charm and has its own reasons why someone would pick it over the remaster. But to be honest you could go either way here. Whether you want something that is true to the original or the remastered version you\u2019re going to be experiencing the same great story and rewind mechanic.", "timestamp_created": 1696369104, "timestamp_updated": 1696518285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147584024": {"recommendationid": "147584024", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075836118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1205, "last_played": 1677362456}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is so pretty and cozy and fun :3", "timestamp_created": 1696361721, "timestamp_updated": 1696361721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147582381": {"recommendationid": "147582381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285010204", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1696246869}, "language": "english", "review": "whoaa!

La ciudad ficticia de Arcadia Bay cobra vida con detalles y colores vibrantes, y la m\u00fasica complementa perfectamente la atm\u00f3sfera del juego.\n\nEl juego te permite explorar el mundo y tomar decisiones que afectar\u00e1n el curso de la historia, lo que a\u00f1ade un elemento de rejugabilidad y te hace sentir que realmente est\u00e1s moldeando la narrativa.", "timestamp_created": 1695835208, "timestamp_updated": 1695835208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147135451": {"recommendationid": "147135451", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101985888", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1698059247}, "language": "english", "review": "ive seen stranger things", "timestamp_created": 1695829235, "timestamp_updated": 1695829235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147130183": {"recommendationid": "147130183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254646129", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2528, "last_played": 1541569336}, "language": "english", "review": "Drama about stupid teenagers, but well made.", "timestamp_created": 1695824072, "timestamp_updated": 1695824072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147107342": {"recommendationid": "147107342", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132533085", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1024, "last_played": 1696707316}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad uno de los mejores juegos que eh jugado, me lo complete tanto en PC como en PS3, el juego es una belleza gr\u00e1fica a pesar de los a\u00f1os, la historia es atrapante y hermosa ;).", "timestamp_created": 1695788943, "timestamp_updated": 1700603270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147105238": {"recommendationid": "147105238", "author": {"steamid": "76561199153458975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1140, "last_played": 1692922566}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanta este juego\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1695784914, "timestamp_updated": 1695784914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147098254": {"recommendationid": "147098254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450509030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1699838812}, "language": "spanish", "review": "de los mejores juegos de la historia por su historia xd\n", "timestamp_created": 1695772680, "timestamp_updated": 1695772680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147075535": {"recommendationid": "147075535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964867981", "num_games_owned": 1461, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 678, "last_played": 1695752991}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Life is weird.

I am a huge fan of the Telltale games and I love games with some kind of time manipulation mechanic. I enjoyed the game and I looked forward to playing it, but the plethora of issues it has in both story and game play dimensions leaves me to just barely recommend this title.\n\nThis game has a lot of great qualities bogged down by not-so-great qualities. The voice acting is stellar, but the writing is really awkward. \"Wowsers.\" The game does a great job of creating a cinematic atmosphere, except when for some weird reason the character's lips stop moving or the voice actor was told to shout their lines because they're at a loud party... except it's a scene in the bathroom where the music is a lot quieter. The time control mechanic is nicely implemented, except that the \"shift\" to rewind faster button hardly seems to do anything at times. Some of the dialog choices are interesting, but they're often so nondescript that you can't even tell what you're opting to say. There are just a lot of issues with this game getting in the way of things.\n\nOverall, my main critique comes down to the pacing. I almost stopped playing after episode 1 but after seeing comments about things getting more interesting, I gave it a shot. To its credit, things did get more interesting. However the slow pacing issues it had from the start never went away. The game is constantly trying to set a mood with ambient lighting, music, and emotional voice acting, but it doesn't have the writing to back it up. Some of the scenes are too long and lack substance or significance. I found myself bored quite often. It's tedious to listen to all the dialog and content in the game but if you skip through everything it kind of defeats the purpose of what I'm playing. It's a dilemma I found myself in time and time again.\n\nThe story is somewhat interesting in that it at least adds layers the more you play, but at the end of the day I found that Life Is Strange more often tells you how to feel instead of letting the game play and writing speak for itself.\n\nVerdict: MODERATELY GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1695607987, "timestamp_updated": 1695884296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146972378": {"recommendationid": "146972378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140461272", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2427, "last_played": 1695600344}, "language": "english", "review": "bay > bae", "timestamp_created": 1695600444, "timestamp_updated": 1695642953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146967904": {"recommendationid": "146967904", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059464359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 964, "last_played": 1695594248}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1695594270, "timestamp_updated": 1695594270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146966857": {"recommendationid": "146966857", "author": {"steamid": "76561199251584030", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1695593087}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games out there!", "timestamp_created": 1695592925, "timestamp_updated": 1695592925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146952993": {"recommendationid": "146952993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800201698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1085, "last_played": 1695580361}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing and good story", "timestamp_created": 1695580447, "timestamp_updated": 1695580447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146950770": {"recommendationid": "146950770", "author": {"steamid": "76561199403356878", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 947, "last_played": 1697337930}, "language": "spanish", "review": "lesbianas, porros, viajes temporales, nazis \nhermoso 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1695578174, "timestamp_updated": 1695578174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146940765": {"recommendationid": "146940765", "author": {"steamid": "76561199415491769", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 963, "last_played": 1685229672}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Masterpiece [/h1]\nI've always been interested in playing LiS, but I never actually tried it.

It really hooked me in with it's time travel mechanics, but then made me stay for it's gut-wrenching yet euphoric story. They also delved way deeper into it's time travel lore than I was initially expecting- something I really appreciated as a sci-fi fan. Much more substance than your cliche \"oh no! don't cause a paradox!\" scene you get from lots of traditional media these days.\n\nMany movies, TV shows, or games, are able to make me feel happy or feel sad, sometimes to the point of laughing out loud or crying, but very few are able to make me feel other emotions just as strongly. This game has some moments of visceral disgust, as well as total catharsis. It's choice-based mechanics can even make your experience existential. \n\nGraphics are usually the last thing I care about in video games, but despite it being eight and a half years old, the graphics hold up and it's a pretty game to walk through. Seeing realistic human expression and emotion adds so much depth to the emotions you feel as the player.\n\nThe only downside is there isn't much gameplay other than walking around and making dialogue choices. The very last chapter introduces some hide-and-seek gameplay mechanics, but it's more tedious than it is fun, imo, mostly due to how slow you have to sneak around. The atmosphere is crazy good at that part, though, which more than makes up for it.\n\nMy last point is just that the achievements seem a bit obtuse. There's 50 of them and they all involve finding a secret location for taking a picture. Sometimes you have to go through entire dialogue interactions, rewind to get the correct dialogue options, and only *then* are you able to take one of these secret pictures. I ended up only getting about 12 on my normal playthrough and it also felt somewhat tedious to go back and get the rest of them using a guide. In their defense, after beating the game, you unlock a \"collectable mode\" that lets you get collectables without affecting your choices, and you can also skip to various different points within each chapter to essentially skip right to a photo. Despite this, there are many chapters where you have to sit through a long opening, or go through various plot point cutscenes and dialogues until you get to the point you can take the picture. My advice would be to look for a spoiler-free achievement guide you can follow during your initial playthrough.\n\nAchievement-hunting aside, I truly believe that this game is an absolute must-play, for anyone who likes or doesn't like video games. It's a beautiful story that almost anyone will be able to relate to. If you like sci-fi or happen to be from the state of Oregon, that also adds a cherry on top!\n\nAlso, bae before bay 4 lyfe.", "timestamp_created": 1695468168, "timestamp_updated": 1695468278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146839863": {"recommendationid": "146839863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051007408", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1492190182}, "language": "english", "review": "Sad story, fun game  play!", "timestamp_created": 1695455045, "timestamp_updated": 1695455045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146827917": {"recommendationid": "146827917", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971338760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1011, "last_played": 1695437843}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally, played this game.

Life is Strange (2015)\nSimply the best, though not my personal favourite this one sets the bar pretty damn high. It has great characters and location settings. A rich story and the protagonist \"gift\" does not feel as confined as later edition in the franchiche. \n\n2. Life is Strange 2 (2018-2019)\nMy favourite, I enjoyed the episodic release however it was to long in between. 1-2 weeks gap would have been fine. It got an feel of exploration and adventure, a great road trip. I wish our main protagonists would meet up with the ones from LiS1 at some point in the franchise. Protagonist \"gift\" was limited to certain moment and that I did not like that concept. There must certainly been way to write around it, giving us some leeway.\n\n*The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit* (2018)\nA side story, but it's really good! Very short, I don't want to spoil anything, but if you want the perfect experience, PLAY this after LiS2 first episode.\n\n3. Life is Strange: Before the storm (2017)\nPLAY this before LiS1 if you have the possibility. It went deeper into some characters background and really add to the lore. Certain parts really hit the high notes. It's a prologue to LiS1\n\n*Life is Strange: Before the storm - Farewell (2018) \nAs the main game, this bonus episode gives some insight in the protagonist background in LiS1, especially on their starting points. A short but cute edition. \n\n4. Life is Strange: True Colors (2021)\nA nice setting, and got the looks. Interesting characters, but the game is way to short. I felt it had something going on, and then just ended. \n\n-Life is Strange: True Colors Steph's story (dlc) is exclusive to Deluxe upgrade and Ultimate. I think this is a really bad idea. I won't buy it, unless it will be released as buyable dlc, [u] DO NOT [/u] promote this kind of business model my dear LiS fans. I am fine with deluxe and ultimate regarding to cosmetics, earlier release, but not exclusive stories.\n\n5. Tell me why (2020)\nStandalone, yet still worth the experience. Quite boring characters, but the game is artistically interesting. It has its moment here and there. Not LiS, but has the same vibes.\n\n*I haven't bought the remastered edition because I've already got an great experience of these games when they were first released. As I understand nothing important was really added to their ReM either?  I would rather see longer games, more customization, less restrictions and perhaps make mini ingames ranked? I would like to have an connection ingame to other players in some way other than gamechoice summary. Maybe use your phone ingame to contact other players on route?

Full of easter eggs, clues and quarks. Implementing time travel makes the \"choices matter\" experience a lot more fun but doesn't remove the edge of the mystery and suspense which builds perfectly throughout each part.\n\nI feel like the developers captured a lot of what may be perceived as \"archetypal\" drama/relations which mirror and frame recent past and current modern American social issues rather well. Although the particular \"type\" of drama which forms the basis for the story line is not something I generally enjoy, it was well written and executed. \n\nThe game-play mechanics are nice, simple and stress-free. The warping of space/time puzzle solving process is still exciting to think about even after playing through the game and feels very fresh from other titles which attempt similar processes but with very different overall game-play mechanics and story-goals.\n\nThe character dialogue felt a little stiff at times, but funnily seemed to coincide with some stiff character visual animations...maybe needs some smoothing out somewhere.\n\nThe dark and twisted path the story cuts is very heart wrenching and at times, believable to the point where one wonders if it is based on true events (in game disclaimer states otherwise). I find this to be good storytelling though, not a negative! \n\nIt only took a couple days to complete 1 play-through but this was only due to the compulsion to stay up way to late to play through the last two chapters, once it hooks you, it's hard to set it down until you know how it ends....and there are end(s)!! If you are more patient, there is a lot more to get out of it, as I didn't completely take the time to do some of the side stuff.\n\nIn all, a fantastic, magical, very emotional, twisted and chilling game.

I am talking about Sonic fan levels of low expectations.\n \nThe only choice that matters is at the very end. Maxes power is contrived bullish!t it simply doesn't make any sense\u2026 But that is only the tip of the iceberg. It breaks its own rules, invents stakes when there are none, Max suddenly gets enhanced powers due to an emotional moment. \n\nTextures, animation, lyp syncing and models are bad. Mind you this game was funded by Square Enix. \n\nThe \"Protagonist\" of this game is Chloe, she is a nihilist, hedonist, immoral, d3g3n3rat who manipulates Max to do what she wants. The only reason why Max chooses to be Chloe's punching bag is due to guilt of not staying in touch. \n\nThere are a lot of questions that are not answered. Why does the storm arrive. Why did God/mother nature give Max powers and why did they try this experiment with Max and Chloe? Why can't Dontnud make a competent game? Why do so many people think Chloe's an Maxs' relationship is \"cute\" despite it clearly being a toxic one. \n\nThis game depresses me, it shouldn't exist, \nBut there is money to be made from middle aged millennials with poor money management skills and too much free time, and by elder gen Z who steal money from their parents' purse. \nIt preys on people who have poor taste and who can't shoot for shit\u2026 but who still want to spend 30-60$ on a game to escape from the real world because its not special enough for them. \n\nDevs tried their best to manipulate people who suffered topics that are in life is strange to make them believe the game has quality. It works well with given music. \n\nIf this game holds a special place in your life because \"representation\" you need to re-evaluate your choices and stop being a weakling who needs \"representation\" to feel strong.\n", "timestamp_created": 1693499263, "timestamp_updated": 1693499336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409937888383865356", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145390493": {"recommendationid": "145390493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250049674", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 1645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1645, "last_played": 1693487440}, "language": "english", "review": "Life is Strange definitely gets you invested in its story the more you go in. There's interesting characters (for one you get to play as an ex-pirate but now a ninja witch, that pulls Barry Allens) that aren't just good or bad, and give you mixed you mixed feelings, which in turn make the choices harder to make, as there's not always a winning situation. The magic mechanic is pretty fun, as one of the first things I did was replay a football hitting someone 5-6 times before I warned them about it. Be warned, however, the game will be gaslighting you every chance it gets - you'll make a choice then the game will be like \"Maybe I shouldn't have done that\" then you rewind and make the other choice and game will be like \"Maybe I should've done something\". Also quite enjoyed the bits that start making you question if things are real or if you're losing your mind at this point (mainly from pulling Barry Allens). And finally, I did love the story, but to be fair found the endings kind of disappointing, mainly because both of them felt like they devoid all of your choices throughout the game of meaning, as in you could've saved everyone or been as evil as possible but in the end all of those actions are either erased or annihilated.", "timestamp_created": 1693498903, "timestamp_updated": 1693498903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145377432": {"recommendationid": "145377432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302336735", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1694081825}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games ever made with an amazing narrative and one of the best and prettiest soundtracks.

The replayability is a bonus too, you can go back and see how different choices affect the story\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe characters are what make this game special.

It\u2019s the character development that really hooked me in and kept me playing\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe setting in Arcadia Bay is calming but the issues the characters face are anything but. The game does a great job of tackling real-world issues that young adults and teens face, making it not just a game, but an experience that makes you think\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe emotional impact of the story is something I wasn\u2019t expecting but greatly appreciated. You get invested in Max\u2019s life and the challenges she faces.

But I'd be lying if I said the dialogue doesn't get better, because it does. On the other hand we have the gameplay which isn't hald bad!

I only wished they showed us more details of the aftermath at the last episode. And this game was such an emotional roller coaster for me. I've always heard people saying this game is life changing, and I agree now. The only cons of this game is how short it was, (I WISH IT WAS LONGER)\n\nBut, overall this is a masterpiece of a game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1692117190, "timestamp_updated": 1692117190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144265250": {"recommendationid": "144265250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084124753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1445, "last_played": 1692040216}, "language": "english", "review": "Unforgettable, unique experience.

But, I just... have to talk about this game, no - experience.\n\nTo start off, I want to sort of... explain my perspective. I remember seeing this game when it was releasing the episodes over time on console. I still had a 360 at the time, and given how I was... 13 or so, I didn't pay much attention. I kinda regret that now, to be honest.\n\nEverything, from the music, to the characters, to the environment - all of it encapsulates the experience the developers wanted you to have - it impacts your emotions in the direction they wanted it to(which in a lot of cases, is depressing), and it's a beautiful work of storytelling. Seeing the development of Max and Chloe's relationship is such an amazing, almost... surreal experience. I think people can draw their own parallels from their own lives to these characters, and that alone is something beautiful.\n\nWords possess power and strength beyond what one could know, in many ways. It's fitting enough to say that on a game where your choices do matter - where your actions and sayings have a direct effect on your relationships, on the very world around you. At a point, it transcends beyond what you would call a game, and feels more akin to a novel, a good piece of literature - a true masterpiece in its own right, that as we have seen, is standing the test of time well.\n\nPlus, you know a game's good when you can say so many positive things in a review, and not even have finished it yet. 10/10 so far, I highly recommend, sale or not. I don't think it's gonna change from a 10/10 either. :)\n\nEdit: Finished the game, got all the achievements. Episode 5 was a total mindfuck, and threw me off guard in a lot of ways I won't spoil here. Game also made me depressed at certain points, and even had me tear up and cry a little. Still a 10/10.

The characters are all diverse and well thought out, as is the rest of the story, dialogue, and choices - they feel like real, unique people with their own quirks. This connection you build with the cast accentuates every moment and tragedy this masterful story puts on the table. The game is perfectly capable of making the player laugh, cry, and even build resentment toward its characters. I believe the game has not one message or takeaway to be had, but instead, many. Maybe the most obvious theme is to cherish every moment and person, because, unlike Max Caulfield, the average person cannot time travel or take photos to literally relive memories. The consequence of her abilities is the skillfully conveyed guilt that she experiences for her actions, and each moment of hopelessness and pain creeps up on the player just as much. Overall its a very beautiful story that, pardon me, made me cry like a bitch several times, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this style of game.", "timestamp_created": 1691578414, "timestamp_updated": 1691581047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143708664": {"recommendationid": "143708664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409612188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1255, "last_played": 1691494506}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty cringe sometimes but theres enough good to mostly cancel it out imo ^_^ fucking love walking around and inspecting 10000 things", "timestamp_created": 1691577568, "timestamp_updated": 1691577568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143708438": {"recommendationid": "143708438", "author": {"steamid": "76561199239630167", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1695749463}, "language": "english", "review": "i haven't played a game with a better soundtrack than this. game is beautifully made and i cannot wait to play more episodes :D", "timestamp_created": 1691577241, "timestamp_updated": 1691577241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143682602": {"recommendationid": "143682602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881662120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1691533915}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691533944, "timestamp_updated": 1691533944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143677328": {"recommendationid": "143677328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808264430", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1543, "last_played": 1688879483}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso Juego, no solo la primera vez lo jugue yo solo y me encanto sino con amigos es genial y te da mucho sentimiento.\nGOTY 2015", "timestamp_created": 1691527195, "timestamp_updated": 1691527195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143660151": {"recommendationid": "143660151", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055949758", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 964, "last_played": 1697526574}, "language": "english", "review": "LIfe don't get stranger than this.", "timestamp_created": 1691509276, "timestamp_updated": 1691509276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143657306": {"recommendationid": "143657306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971505682", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1510, "last_played": 1691691213}, "language": "english", "review": "Aside from the weird dream in episode 5, the story was great, and almost all the characters were likable and had interesting things to say.

In fact the loading screen before every one of the five episodes in the game, hammers it through that your choices have consequences, your choices matter. \n\nBut for the most part these choices, which the time manipulation rewind effect does let you affect, are minutia and largely inconsequential events. Events such as someone getting a ball thrown after them. On top of that it has no cost to use the powers, either in game mechanics sense or in the overall plot sense. \n\nFor the most of the events that can be manipulated, they have little impact on the overarching story, outside of a few critical moments that must be resolved, correctly, to see the story continue.\n\nThis lack of cost stands in stark contrast to what the main character says early on in the game, where she states she shouldn't use her powers frivolously, but even if you ignore that statement and go ham with her powers at every possible moment, it has no effect on the story, which is kinda silly given the core plot focuses around precisely her use of her powers and the large consequences using them appear to have, but that seemingly only matters when it comes to Chloe.\n\nSo despite repeated statements that consequences matter, there is only one choice that matters as the ending presents itself as a binary choice, A or B, and nothing leading up to that moment, from the players actions, makes any difference.\n\nThis leads to the point that there really isn't much of any gameplay to speak of here, it's an interactive Young Adult novel that plays out over five episodes, much like a TV series. Which isn't necessarily a negative point, but like most Young Adult entertainment these days, it falls to the same tropes seen elsewhere, such as including characters acting out of character to service the plot and storytelling, and when it finally comes down to the conclusion, the writers cannot weave together their various plot points and plot elements they've spent five episodes leading up to so it all ends up being nonsensical in the end.\n\nThe voice acting is decent and the musical score feels contemporary for this portrayed small town setting the game takes place in. The graphics range from serviceable to leaving a lot to be desired at times and doesn't feel very consistent in its presentation.\n\nSo while Life is Strange isn't inherently terrible, or even a bad game, it also isn't overwhelmingly positive, as the Steam reviews would suggest. The game has 161.317 reviews at the time of writing, of which only around 20% has 10+ hours of playtime, in a game with roughly 15 hours of playtime or longer, depending on the level of completion employed. The final achievement in the game also shows only around 25% even completed it. Which paints a very different picture to the very positive reception it seems to have enjoyed. Perhaps it's even a bit misleading.\n\nSo just like the games binary ending, the review much also be binary, positive or negative, and thus it falls towards negative.", "timestamp_created": 1690913304, "timestamp_updated": 1690913304, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613846898078918457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143210066": {"recommendationid": "143210066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311669583", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1624714000}, "language": "english", "review": "Top 3 game fs", "timestamp_created": 1690905135, "timestamp_updated": 1690905135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143208743": {"recommendationid": "143208743", "author": {"steamid": "76561199509878457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1699802002}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE", "timestamp_created": 1690903603, "timestamp_updated": 1690903603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143206538": {"recommendationid": "143206538", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091432808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1691322487}, "language": "english", "review": "must of must", "timestamp_created": 1690901069, "timestamp_updated": 1690901069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143185039": {"recommendationid": "143185039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043774865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1251, "last_played": 1690866120}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm about 10 years late on this one but I loved it so much more than I thought I would.

They are very well paced, have interesting story, characters, dialog, and choices for you to make along the way. I genuinely enjoyed the first 4 episodes and was anticipating each new one as it came out.\n\nEpisode 5 botched all of that, somehow. The pacing is weird after the first half, the story falls apart, the time travel mechanic gets a funky twist that isn't very fun, and your choices in this and all previous episodes get thrown out the window for a 2 button option Deus Ex ending that makes the first 4 episodes basically pointless. It was such a disappointment especially after waiting for it to come out and streaming it for friends the day it dropped.

It's about accepting loss and coping with grief, in all of its messy and painful ways. The story revolves around teenager Max Caulfield, a timid and anxious girl who witnesses a long-lost childhood friend being murdered whilst at school. In that split second, Max discovers that she can reverse time and change the outcome of situations using an intense emotional reaction.\n\nAcross five episodes, Max uses her powers to prevent the deaths of several key characters. From a suicidal student, bullied for being drugged and made to commit sexual acts, and preventing the death of her closest friend's family member in a car crash. When we lose someone we love, we can feel overwhelmingly guilty that we could have done something to change the outcome. Due to Max's obsession with perfecting the universe, she inadvertently twists reality into a nightmarish dreamscape infinitely worse than if she had left everything alone. Upon facing this, Max has to make one final decision. \n\nA significant portion of my 20s has been spent trying to navigate loss and, more specifically, guilt. I've dedicated years to trying to reassess what I could have done differently; I've felt consumed by a bitter sense of guilt which begs me to find a fixable flaw in my personality to stop this from happening again. It's a testament to Life is Strange that, upon the game's conclusion, years of pain escaped by body through tears which flooded down my cheeks. I held onto the person next to me so tightly, squeezing them as I let out years of pain onto their shoulder.\n\nLooking back, it reminds me of that interview with the Opera director. People will enter our lives, change us forever, and they'll leave. Like side characters, or fairy godmothers, they can teach us so much about ourselves, help us find the beauty in ourselves, but eventually every curtain has to close. We can rewind these stories in our heads, permanently pondering what we could have done differently, but Life is Strange helped teach me how to move forward.\n\nThank you, Life is Strange, for helping me explore my own personal healing through one of the most compelling, beautiful and emotionally intense games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1690318817, "timestamp_updated": 1690318817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142778346": {"recommendationid": "142778346", "author": {"steamid": "76561199350825327", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 957, "last_played": 1690339810}, "language": "english", "review": "o fuck i dont give a shit about the bay i just want to see Chloe once again: ;but i didnt make a max choice its chloe choice", "timestamp_created": 1690303464, "timestamp_updated": 1690303464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142751366": {"recommendationid": "142751366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056355740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1673, "last_played": 1690314098}, "language": "english", "review": "A Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1690276455, "timestamp_updated": 1690276455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142741420": {"recommendationid": "142741420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304262678", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1755, "last_played": 1649561567}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive game.", "timestamp_created": 1690259001, "timestamp_updated": 1690259001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142736940": {"recommendationid": "142736940", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042309647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1253, "last_played": 1693671787}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es simplemente cine.", "timestamp_created": 1690251078, "timestamp_updated": 1690251078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142733231": {"recommendationid": "142733231", "author": {"steamid": "76561199416080693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1699416666}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best written story games i've played to date.

All done so well, I was blown away. Ep 3 made me cry.\nMake sure you interact with basically everything you can, as sometimes, photo ops don't always appear right away & need to be triggered by some other action. \nMy only complaint was the puzzles in Ep 5. They felt kinda out of place for the rest of the game. The door one made sense but the others were a lil strange IMO. It was cool they switched it up a bit but I guess since it was at the end of the game, it felt like it didn't match the other 4 episodes. Either way, I still fully enjoyed this game & would highly recommend.

I am a fan of choice games, but none of the ones I have played have delivered such a great story that I have gotten so completely absorbed in to this degree. I started the game having no idea what to expect (I had only heard of it, saw it had good reviews, and saw it was on sale and cheap, so why not), but I will be honest and say that after I had played chapter one and was halfway through chapter two, I did not have high hopes for the rest of the game. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't really into it, so I stopped playing and forgot about it until I was bored a couple weeks later.

hermoso, la banda sonora es tan buena que tengo una playlist con todas sus canciones. El guion y desarrollo es destacable, pero el verdadero punto fuerte de este juego son los personajes.\n\nLos personajes secundarios son muy interesantes, cada acci\u00f3n tiene su trasfondo y sus consecuencias. Realmente son personajes super profundos e incluso uno como jugador se interesa honestamente en su historia y las cosas que cada uno de ellos tiene para contar. Creo que mi personaje secundario favorito es Warren porque es muy tierno y lo amo <3 sinceramente me quede con ganas de saber m\u00e1s de el y de su vida.\n\nOtro de mis personajes favoritos es mi novia Chloe Price, creo que Chloe es un personaje que cualquier jugador te LIS ama. Es hermosa, es lo que las manic pixie dream girl wanna be quieren ser.\n\n La protagonista Max, es una protagonista super presente en el sentido de que no se siente que al estar  jugando uno este vaciamente controlando la vida de Max y tomando decisiones por ella, cada decisi\u00f3n disponible es honesta y consecuente  a su personalidad, pero teniendo en cuenta que tampoco tiene una personalidad lo suficientemente fuerte o destacable para llegar a ser irritante o poco empatizable, Max me parece un sano punto medio, personalmente es un personaje con el que genere mucha empatia, y realmente pude sentir tensi\u00f3n, nervios e incluso miedo a pesar de que obviamente la jugabilidad no es el fuerte de este juego, si no su historia, lo cual me lleva al siguiente tema;\n\nMe encanta pensar en los videojuegos como un m\u00e9todo de llevar la cinematograf\u00eda un poco mas all\u00e1. Los videojuegos son un medio muy maleable e inmersivo, ya que es uno mismo el que lleva la historia y no es la historia la que lo lleva a uno. Muchas personas no le dan una oportunidad a juegos como estos porque no tienen una buena jugabilidad. Y es verdad, Life is Strange y en general cualquier juego de la categor\u00eda \"las decisiones importan\" no van a tener una buena jugabilidad, su enfoque tiene que ser otro. Hay que darle una oportunidad a esta clase de juegos porque los videojuegos son mucho m\u00e1s que mec\u00e1nicas y jugabilidad. Muchas veces un juego con una buena historia es mucho mejor que uno sin ella pero con mec\u00e1nicas incre\u00edbles.\n\nsi hay una sola cosa mala de este juego esa es que me dejo un hueco en el coraz\u00f3n una vez lo termine. Igualmente yo lo veo super rejugable, algun dia voy a jugarlo nuevamente para sacar todas las imagenes del juego ;)\n\nEn fin:\n\nLo recomiendo? Si\nEs un juegazo? Si\nChloe me hizo lesbiana?

From the moment I started playing, I was immediately drawn into its captivating story, which delves into the complexities of human struggles. The narrative and characters dialogue feels incredibly realistic, exploring themes of friendship and love in a way that resonated deeply with me. I became fully invested in the lives of Max and Chloe, empathizing with their triumphs and feeling their pain. The emotional rollercoaster I experienced throughout the game was a testament to its powerful storytelling and the ability to evoke genuine emotions.\n\nBut it wasn't just the story that moved me; it was the impeccable soundtrack that amplified those emotions to another level. The carefully curated songs and original score were perfectly timed and placed, adding an extra layer of depth and intensity to each scene. I remember how I dig into spotify to find every song of this game to enjoy it in real life.\n\nLife is Strange was more than just a game for me; it was a personal journey of self-reflection.

Max soon realizes that messing with time doesn\u2019t always make things better. In fact it can make it a lot worse.\n\nThe story is decent but is filled with a lot of cringy dialogue at times. A lot of the story focuses on your friend Chloe who is a rebellious teenager who is always angry at the world, and often uses heavy guilt tripping on her friend Max to get her way. \nWhile the story has a lot of choices the player can choose, the final outcome to the game remains the same. It is still entertaining to see the various choices play out and then rewind time to see what else could have happened. The choices you make do slightly shape the story so it feels like it did have an impact.\n\nThe gameplay is more of a walking simulator with some very light puzzle solving such as obtaining an item, rewinding time, and then use that item.\nRewinding time mid conversation to use any information obtained is also part of puzzle solving you will come across. You can also use your camera to take pictures throughout the game tho they are more like collectibles rather than a core mechanic.\n\nThe graphics still look very decent and the voice acting is extremely good. The game has a nice looking art style to it and the animations are fluid and look decent enough where there\u2019s no stiff or janky movements.\n\nOverall a decent game with a story that is original, even if a bit cringy at times.\n\n8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1689053183, "timestamp_updated": 1689053183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141805491": {"recommendationid": "141805491", "author": {"steamid": "76561199466516626", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1689045986}, "language": "english", "review": "enjoyed this so much! it was so peaceful and very intruging.", "timestamp_created": 1689045911, "timestamp_updated": 1689045911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141799342": {"recommendationid": "141799342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353527109", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1689037878}, "language": "english", "review": "well that sucks i have to go buy the rest", "timestamp_created": 1689037855, "timestamp_updated": 1689037855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141797250": {"recommendationid": "141797250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000520748", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1687786799}, "language": "english", "review": "Un juegos con m\u00e9todos de tortura medieval", "timestamp_created": 1689035163, "timestamp_updated": 1689035163, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141791702": {"recommendationid": "141791702", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228208032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 825, "last_played": 1689229764}, "language": "english", "review": "it has amazing graphics and requires little storage to play. the plot of the game is awesome and there are so many twists and cool characters.", "timestamp_created": 1689027995, "timestamp_updated": 1689027995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141774584": {"recommendationid": "141774584", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024877419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1688896523}, "language": "english", "review": "max.... drooling emoji.... drooling emoji......", "timestamp_created": 1689011149, "timestamp_updated": 1689011149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141765922": {"recommendationid": "141765922", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133118675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 715, "last_played": 1698957010}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1689003001, "timestamp_updated": 1689003001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141760430": {"recommendationid": "141760430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210200991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1688997414}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll just say it briefly, this game is the best of the best.

While it came out 8 years ago, I only just played it for the first time.  I had not watched or read anything about this prior to playing, and what an experience it was!  I did not play the remastered collection, so some of my thoughts may be moot with the remaster.  At times I found the lack of lip movement when the characters were speaking to be a bit distracting.  The use of terminology and slang like \"hella\" and \"apropos\" got to a point by the third episode where I audibly laughed and rolled my eyes, which took away from the immersion.  But, on the whole, those things really don't matter.  This story is beautiful and heartbreaking.  The score is phenomenal.  The characters are fleshed out so thoroughly that you really feel for people and think about them and their situation long after you have shut down the game and tried - key word TRIED - to go to sleep.  But you can't, because you are still thinking about this game.  When it was all coming to a head in the final moments of the game, I was left deep in my feelings (which this game will most certainly do to you).\n\nIf you have not played this one, I absolutely recommend you give it a try.  It is a masterpiece.  Be aware of potential trigger warnings for such things as unaliving, drug use, assault, etc.  There are moments that are heartbreaking and difficult.

They did try to implement in puzzles, and it means that any time pressure for a certain scene is taken off, and you can see the short-term consequences.

Esta capacidad le brinda la oportunidad de cambiar cualquier situaci\u00f3n y tomar decisiones diferentes. Si se equivoca en una respuesta a una pregunta, simplemente retrocede. Si rompe o toma algo que pertenece a otra persona, puede revertirlo. Max utiliza este don para ayudarse a s\u00ed misma y a los dem\u00e1s, aunque las consecuencias de sus acciones son impredecibles. El rebobinado del tiempo se convierte en la caracter\u00edstica principal de Life Is Strange, donde Max se enfrenta a obst\u00e1culos, mentiras, apoyo, as\u00ed como secretos y misterios por descubrir.\n\nLife Is Strange comparte similitudes con Remember Me y los productos de Telltale Games. El juego te permite explorar diversos lugares y interactuar con los personajes. Cada personaje es \u00fanico a su manera, y tienes la oportunidad de tomar decisiones que influir\u00e1n en el curso de los acontecimientos. La atm\u00f3sfera del juego se captura de manera excepcional, haciendo que te sientas personalmente involucrado en la historia. Los gr\u00e1ficos son hermosos y los personajes se vuelven entra\u00f1ables. Tu actitud hacia ellos puede cambiar a lo largo del juego, y algunos revelar\u00e1n sorprendentes secretos que no esperabas. La banda sonora complementa perfectamente la atm\u00f3sfera a lo largo de los cinco episodios.\n\nLa trama de Life Is Strange es emocionante y llena de sorpresas. Es imposible predecir qu\u00e9 suceder\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, aunque a veces puedas hacer conjeturas que se cumplen en cierta medida. Hay giros y vueltas inesperados, y tomar decisiones importantes y dif\u00edciles es fundamental en el juego. Lo m\u00e1s destacado son los dos finales completamente diferentes que no est\u00e1n relacionados entre s\u00ed. Ambos finales son conmovedores y tristes, aunque esperaba un poco m\u00e1s de ellos. A pesar de los finales, la sensaci\u00f3n general es de tristeza porque el juego ha llegado a su fin. Es como terminar de leer un libro interesante y no querer que acabe. \n\nUn gran reconocimiento para Dontnod Entertainment por su excelente trabajo. Han logrado crear una experiencia de juego que no se queda atr\u00e1s en comparaci\u00f3n con los juegos de Telltale Games. Life Is Strange es un juego maravilloso que recomiendo comprar.

The complete season includes all five episodes of the game, which were released between January and October of 2015.\n\nOne of the standout features of Life is Strange is its gripping storyline and character development. The game follows the story of Maxine Caulfield, a high school student who discovers she has the power to rewind time. As Max navigates through her life in the town of Arcadia Bay, she makes decisions that affect the outcome of the game's narrative.\n\nThe game's writing and voice acting are superb, creating a believable and immersive world for the player to inhabit. The characters in the game are well-developed and relatable, with their own unique personalities and struggles. The game tackles issues such as friendship, bullying, mental illness, and time travel, creating a deep and thought-provoking narrative.\n\nThe game's graphics and art style are also stunning, with a hand-painted aesthetic that adds to the game's emotional impact. The game's soundtrack is also excellent, with a range of indie and alternative songs that perfectly capture the game's mood and tone.\n\nOne of the game's most significant strengths is the ability for the player to make choices that affect the outcome of the game's narrative. These choices have far-reaching consequences and make the player feel invested in the game's characters and story.\n\nHowever, some players may find the game's slow pacing and lack of traditional gameplay mechanics to be frustrating. The game is more focused on storytelling and character development, rather than action and adventure.\n\nOverall, Life is Strange is an exceptional graphic adventure game that offers a gripping storyline, well-developed characters, and a unique time-travel mechanic. The game's emotional impact, stunning graphics, and excellent soundtrack make it a must-play for fans of the genre. However, players looking for traditional gameplay mechanics and action-packed gameplay may be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1687518834, "timestamp_updated": 1687518834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66425025463104248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140547864": {"recommendationid": "140547864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319578596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1346, "last_played": 1689258438}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a masterpiece even though I have never played choices matter genre before.", "timestamp_created": 1687518354, "timestamp_updated": 1687537953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140544261": {"recommendationid": "140544261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328110270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1227, "last_played": 1687011966}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know how I feel about this game.\n\nI love it, and hate it at the same time.", "timestamp_created": 1687512270, "timestamp_updated": 1687512270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140540189": {"recommendationid": "140540189", "author": {"steamid": "76561199184563928", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 10771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 945, "last_played": 1696018248}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] Rese\u00f1a r\u00e1pida de Life is Strange [/h1]\n\n[i]1.

or 2019 on my mobile phone, and when I reached Episode 5, one of my classmates deleted the game, and I couldn't complete it at that time. Unfortunately, I didn't have a PC back then, so I struggled a lot. However, recently I saw that this game was on sale for a very affordable price of $1.38 USD. So, on June 14, 2023, I bought it, and today, on June 22, 2023, I completed the entire game and unlocked all the Steam achievements.\n\nLife is Strange games are really good, and their stories are super amazing. This game is worth every penny. For $1.38 USD, I got all the episodes of this game, and each and every episode felt like I was watching a thrilling suspense movie.  The game's graphics and visuals still look really good even after all these years. Kudos to the whole team who made this amazing game.\n\nThe game's graphics look pretty good, the gameplay and controls are very easy, and the story is just amazing. I can guarantee that everyone will love the story \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb . Unlocking the Steam achievements in this game is really easy, and they are not hard at all. Everyone can unlock all 60 achievements very easily. Some choices were very hypothetical, making it difficult to choose one option. Especially the last hypothetical choices of the game. Those last choices were very hard to make, but the ending was good. I will say that the last hypothetical choices were the most difficult choices in gaming history \ud83e\udd2f\n\nWhile playing Episode 5, I felt like I was experiencing everything in real life. The story literally blew my mind, and I kept thinking about this game and its characters all day. This game was also relatable to me as I had a friend, but since 2019, I haven't been in touch with him, so it felt like the character Max was based on my life. LOL. Also, this game taught me many things that will help me in my life, such as the \"Power of Choice\", \"Empathy and Understanding\", \"Dealing with Consequences\" and most importantly, \"Friendship and Loyalty\" and \"Appreciating the Present.\"\n\nLastly, I want to take a moment to appreciate all the devs who worked on this game and made it amazing \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb . Also, we can't ignore the hard work of all the voice actors. Each and every actor did their best job, and I really appreciate them. They are the best\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udd25\n\nThank you for reading until here.\u2764\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1687437570, "timestamp_updated": 1687437570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140489878": {"recommendationid": "140489878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198225553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1688999660}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything is just very memorable and nostalgic.", "timestamp_created": 1687432083, "timestamp_updated": 1687432083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140488080": {"recommendationid": "140488080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836847279", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1589132659}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd rather die in obscurity than have released anything even half as bad as this", "timestamp_created": 1687429218, "timestamp_updated": 1687429218, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450478404760360718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140485344": {"recommendationid": "140485344", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024569933", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1687419999}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler]To save the bae or to save the bay[/spoiler]\n\nHighly recommend, super investing story!", "timestamp_created": 1687424238, "timestamp_updated": 1687424238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140485036": {"recommendationid": "140485036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069601192", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 634, "last_played": 1687438140}, "language": "english", "review": "happy pride month!", "timestamp_created": 1687423657, "timestamp_updated": 1687423657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140474208": {"recommendationid": "140474208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873244474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1819, "last_played": 1687401994}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Su historia me parece sinceramente maravillosa, cada peque\u00f1a acci\u00f3n por insignificante que parezca resulta ser un evento detonante para el desarrollo de la historia, el trasfondo de los personajes y sus desarrollo conforme la historia avance me parece tambi\u00e9n fant\u00e1stico, adem\u00e1s de contar con una incre\u00edble banda sonora, la cual se adapta muy bien a cada momento en el juego. 10 de 10, obra maestra.", "timestamp_created": 1687402354, "timestamp_updated": 1687402354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140473897": {"recommendationid": "140473897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108224483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1687418174}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched a play through from PewDiePie back when the game came out in 2015, but I was not happy some of the choices he made in the play through, so I bought the game myself.

Despite the age of the game, and some technical limitations that come along with that, the visuals and story still hold out strong as a work of art.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is more of a story than a game in the traditional sense.  Each scene of the game is like a scene in a novel, in which you can explore around, interactive with people and look at random items from peoples' lives.  The scene advances when some plot objective is reached, but there's no urgency in advancing through the narrative.  Most interactions are irrelevant to the plot, they're just there to experience, kind of like browsing though art in a gallery.  I found it relaxing just interacting with the mundane posters and other objects in the scenery, which each tell a small part of life in Arcadia Bay.\n\nThere are some puzzles where you have to use your powers to advance the narrative, but mostly it's about the story itself, and the choices you make along the way.  The fact that you can't easily quick save / reload adds weight to your choices, and forces you to take ownership of them.\n\nPlaying the game now, long after all the episodes have been released and people have moved on to other things, adds a kind of new meta-layer to the experience. Like the Polaroid photos that are ubiquitous in the story, the game itself is now like a vintage snapshot of a moment in the past.

Love the music. \n\nFor those looking for my thoughts and feelings on the game, read on:\n\nLife is Strange is probably one of the greatest game I have ever played in my several years on Steam. Yes I am very late to playing it and fully enjoying it's story but I think that this game has held strong over those years. It's story still beats any game I have played recently or any game that will probably come out in the years to come. But then again, this is coming from someone who is biased so take this review with a pinch of salt. \n\nYes the graphics may not be the best but this game does not rely on that to impress it's players, it's the amazing attention to detail and the world building that does. This game focuses so heavily on being able to tell a story through the world and art style rather than hitting us with a two paragraph bit of text telling us what happened or is happening. \n\nThis game will subvert your expectations from the very start until the very end, the whole scope of the game changing how the player will think and feel until it finally clicks in the players head and they finally understand. This game is filled with mystery, happiness and loss, there will be times where you think \"God I wish I hadn't of said that\" or \"Jesus, I didn't see any of this coming\" that's because this game gives you the ability to change your fate and others. \n\nAnother great part of this game is it's soundtrack, many moments will be accompanied by music that fits the tone extremely well, almost like it was made for it. As you get further into the game, this music will become more hard hitting and at some points bring out some emotions to help bring those scenes to completion. \n\nTo end things off as I do not wish to make this review too long winded, I fully recommend this game to those who have yet to purchase this master piece, just like 96% of the community who has. I also recommend a box of tissues and to play this game with good sound. I cannot recommend the remake of this game yet though as I haven't played it, though all I have seen from it is that it just makes the overall look of the game better.

this game? Yes. I am an competitive FPS player and this game is more like a visual novel/movie than a game, so it can be really frustrating to play if you are not used to a slow paced story mode game. That being said, the art style of this game is definitely different. Unlike Detroit: Become Human, this game does not have realistic graphics, but an individual-looking hand-drawn art style. This sets the game apart when it comes to graphics. In terms of gameplay, the game is well optimized, and does not stutter or lag a single bit, I did not suffer from even 1 frame drop throughout the 20 hour gameplay. This game is best enjoyed on a big monitor/tv with a controller in your hand.\n\nThe game contains 5 episodes, each episode ranging around 3 hours in length. You can either play this game in one sitting like I did, or the more advisable way in which you can enjoy it would be to play it on 5 separate days, 1 episode per day. This is definitely up to you, but the game did get annoying for me and I had to power through it. The way things elevate in this game, the twists and suspense, the choices and the \"what if\" moments are just beautiful to say the least. If I had to sum this game up in one sentence, I'd say this is the final destination movie series turned into a game, with obviously some differences. The music is very soothing, and the ending is definitely different.\n\nTL:DR: Definitely a worth try. Episode One is free on steam and the game requirements are not high at all. Have a crack at it, episode one is only 3 hours. Remember to get a controller as well, I did not have one.\n\n\nF*ck LGHDTV+ though", "timestamp_created": 1687120085, "timestamp_updated": 1687134864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140294758": {"recommendationid": "140294758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421118319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1688046770}, "language": "english", "review": "RAAA I LOVE THIS GAME RAAA :3", "timestamp_created": 1687115146, "timestamp_updated": 1696146436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140292824": {"recommendationid": "140292824", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080150701", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1688472834}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece game..10/10, good game", "timestamp_created": 1687112893, "timestamp_updated": 1688227156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140291582": {"recommendationid": "140291582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049598764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1687110413}, "language": "english", "review": "What to say about that game.\n\"The Walking the Dead\" was \"only\" great but this was awesome.\nOf course, it always depends on the person one is.\nFor me, i like those kind of games where you have to make choinces which alter the corse of the game - of course the overall result is the same but the way changes. \nMoral choices are also \"forcing\" one to think about ones choices.\nI kind of like the rewind, even though i stayed with my first decision.\n\"The Walking the Dead\" put one under pressure and one had to choose a decision within a set timelimit, which is great too.\nBut the rewind with the kind of loops and twisted mind / world ... \nI got lost in thoughts, if you like \"The Walking the Dead\" you will like this too.", "timestamp_created": 1687111472, "timestamp_updated": 1687111472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140289365": {"recommendationid": "140289365", "author": {"steamid": "76561199471888343", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1687108714}, "language": "english", "review": "The story of the game is amazing, i enjoyed playing it, but the thing I didn't like about the game is the graphics, I wish it was more better ngl. but when I played episode one I was so amazed by the story of it and how you can interact with consequences.

Her character does share some resemblance to my own personality. Since this game is old, there should be no problems running it. So performance is great. While non-linear, this games story brings out nostalgia with the games artstyle, dialogue, setting, and soundtrack. Extream depth to the characters, especially Chloe Price, the deuteragonist of the story. Overall the story is timeless and honestly transcendent. I won't ever forget it as long as I live. Since this is a game featuring interactive storytelling, your actions will have consequences.

But the thing that made me love the game the most was that it taught a lesson. \n\n[spoiler] I have a lot of sympathy for this game because it taught me a lesson: you can't escape the truth.. I hated David early in the game and was so happy when Chloe's biological father William came along, but then things took a turn for the worse. In Episode 5, Chloe died. His crying when we tell her clearly tells us how much he loves his stepdaughter and how much he truly cares for his family. And that's when I realized I had made a mistake and accepted David, he's a good father just because he's an ex-military so he doesn't show much love for his family. I sacrificed Chloe at the end of the game because that's what it was meant to be. Both characters started to mature as the episodes progressed, of course, especially Max, in Episode 5, she already has a fight with herself. In short, this game taught me that we can't escape reality and that sometimes we just accept situations. it was a great game for me [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1686955639, "timestamp_updated": 1687265246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526216030120849609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140182879": {"recommendationid": "140182879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881387611", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1033, "last_played": 1686954412}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1686954435, "timestamp_updated": 1686954435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140182433": {"recommendationid": "140182433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142748326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1688931974}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a special game that I'll always hold close to me.

However, it makes up for its corny wordplay with a story full of twists and turns and red herrings that one could easily fall for. If you are a lover of story-driven games and generally enjoy games as a storytelling medium- this game is wrapped in a ribbon for you.\n\nLife Is Strange is one of those gems that receives flack for being controversial in its approach to difficult subjects simply by showcasing them. As everyone has a different opinion regarding such themes I won't touch upon them in this review- however, I believe they handled heavy subjects with grace and respect. Sometimes, things that are hard to hear-  those truths of life that we wish we could turn away from- are still the truth nonetheless.\n\nThe gameplay is actually quite decent for a story-driven game, and provides just enough player interaction to keep you on your toes, or awake at the very least. The devs definitely were creative in the ways they chose the player to interact with the Life Is Strange world and I appreciated it most during some of the detective-work sequences in which the player has to figure out mystery puzzles. \n\nIs it a movie-game? Somewhat so, but you will feel immersed in the story regardless. The cinematography alone is worth picking up Life Is Strange. If you're a lover of the arts, theatre, film in general- you will appreciate many of the incredible and nuanced scenes within. You can tell the dev team is as passionate about the arts as the characters.\n\nFor my one worthwhile nitpick, I will say this- the claim that choices gravely affect the narrative is not completely truthful. Your choices affect the dialogue and small details of the story, but generally do not interfere with the main narrative. You will still have the same choices in the end. I somewhat wish there were more contrasting routes, but it might be best this way- completionists would have a nightmare with the length of possible routes if so. I know I would have.\n\nWho is this game for? Lovers of mystery, detective work, a convincing story and the romantics. Give it a chance.

criticisms, i really do, but i wouldn't change a thing about it to be honest. not the gameplay, not the characters, not the presentation of the story, not even the clusterfuck that was episode 5 specifically. because a game about rewinding time and creating alternate realities climaxing at the most david lynch shit ever is to be expected in my opinion. all of this does not unfortunately save the game from being a victim of french writers trying to find out how american teens spoke in 2013, though i do find the dialogue very charming because of that. chloe price you will always be famous for saying \"hella\" 13 times total. max will not be famous for \"wowser\" though\n\non a more serious note, i think this game's story is masterful. i think the sort of \"red herring\" of it being about trying to find rachel amber then being revealed to just simply being that chloe can't die is so interesting to me. i also adore how mark jefferson is the root of every single bad thing happening in this game. i.e. rachel disappearing, literally everything with kate, and manipulating nathan into doing his dirty work, and hell, even chloe getting shot in the bathroom. literally none of this would've happened if that prude wasn't a freak\n\n9/10 would cause a storm via the butterfly effect again", "timestamp_created": 1686303661, "timestamp_updated": 1700297076, "voted_up": true,

If you like slow paced, character focused games and have a bit of time on your hands (15/20h) then maybe for you.\n\n\n\nA bit more time and no spoilers :\n\nIt wasn't that bad, just a big letdown from what I expected. I can't give the game a thumbs up for that reason. And seeing how well it sold and how overwhelmingly positive the reviews are I do not believe it matters anyway.\nI would recommend the game for sales and if you got 15/20h to throw away, are easily moved, don't care too much about inconsistencies, are not at all looking for any kind of neat SF or well done coherent time travel, are not bothered by slow paced videogames (especially episode 1/2) and very little gameplay (goes from taking photos of very specific things to looking for bottles in a dump so yeah).\n\nSo if you just want a chill, relaxing game with nice visuals then maybe. I did not like most of the characters but their development isn't so bad (even tho they're all super clich\u00e9) and they are subtle enough that I guess some people will grow to appreciate them a lot or even from the get go  (and seeing the popularity and overwhemingly positive reviews and how character focused the game is I guess it's the case).\n\nHonestly, it felt very teensy and I don't see any of my more than 16 acquaintances/friends really appreciate the game (especially to the extent it is loved), except if the ones that are very new to video games and haven't read/watched that many stuff/aren't very critical about what they \"consume\".\n\n\n\nSPOILERS. SPOILERS EVERYWHERE :\n\nIt was fine. But honestly I'm so disappointed. I expected some good storytelling, lovable characters, a well done time travel focused story, but... The game is full of contradictions and inconsistencies at every levels. Whether it be on how the powers of Max worked (like the fact that she can teleport, wth?) or in terms of plot. I'm too lazy to develop how bad those inconsistencies are with the plot, there are far too many and multiples in every episode. For instance, how Chloe just sits there with Max on her lap after seeing her nosebleed then pass out. Any sensible human being would call an ambulance in such a situation, would he not? It's a small thing (and not the best example) but when you add several per episode it starts getting on your nerves and did for me. It made the characters less belivable and broke the immersion.\n\nSpeaking of characters, I found most if not ALL of them to be quite insufferable, unbelievably insecure (and I know it is one of the main topics but still it was too much for me) and hella self-centered (including Max always comparing herself to Rachel like an 8 yo). And they felt way too edgy and weirdly \"young\" (in a \"I'm a 45yo man trying to write teenage girls/boys\") to feel real and be attached to them. \n\nI also found most of the choices and their impact to be very artificially and clumsily implemented in the game (like how some characters will just spit out that you were nice to them and thus they will help you or whathever, very elder scrollsy now that I think about it). \n\nLastly, the pacing was also pretty bad and I felt bored most of the time, the inexistant (in terms of complexity and fun) and yet very present gameplay didn't help (looking for bottles, taking pictures of specific stuff in your notebook instead of just offering the player the possibility to make his own photos).\n\nBy the end, I sadly still did not care for most of the characters and what could happen to them. \n\nAnd I did not enjoy the ending of the game tbh, it felt empty and meaningless (and the whole chaos theory thing is insufferable, makes no sense, like the double moon and unpredicted eclipse (let's not speak of the storm and the fact that it seems god/destiny/Poseidon brings it if Chloe does not die because that's how the world works). It's nice in the visuals prism of things but it's dumb and brings an unwelcomed aura of superstition to the story that was veeeery strange (like how the Science teacher/Warren were like \"an unpredicted eclipse (which is a very predictable event)? Oh well, guess weird things happen sometimes\". In the real world, which LiS is supposed to be set in, such a event would lead the scientific community to a very different reaction). \n\nI'm also not sure I'm a fan of the whole episodic nature of LiS and how this game aired originally. And I have that complain for pretty much all games that do it. But almost none do that anymore to my knowledge, so I'll it go...\n\nI could go on and on and probably forgot half of what I had to say about the game but you get the idea.\n\nFor what I did like now : the voice actors are ok, the music too (not great imo but fits the tone of the game) and there are some actual really neat visuals in the game, especially in the last episode. And overall, the artistic direction is nice. I was quite bored throughout the game but not so much that I didn't want to finish it so I'll put it as a good point, but maybe I was just in the mood.\n\nOverall, it really was meh. I would sorta recommend it to certain people (especially younger ones) but then I would also recommend Telltales games like WD or The Wolf Among Us and many other before if the person wants a narrative focused game (heard that Night in the Woods is amazing and deals with similar topics as LiS, but I have not played it).\n\nI worry people with a certain experience with narrative games / people that are more critical and maybe older in general might be quite disappointed by what this game is. I sure was. Now again, seeing how overwhelmingly positive the reviews were and are still, there might be something I cannot see.", "timestamp_created": 1684604779, "timestamp_updated": 1689356999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522471904754638672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138612053": {"recommendationid": "138612053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414161183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2660, "last_played": 1598029777}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is my whole personality", "timestamp_created": 1684589612, "timestamp_updated": 1684589612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138608515": {"recommendationid": "138608515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038998971", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 866, "last_played": 1684857218}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic Choice Matters game - Great storytelling and likable characters!

Strange is a game that truly touched my heart and left me feeling emotional and moved by the end. From the moment I started playing, I was drawn in by the stunning visuals, captivating storyline, and relatable characters that made me feel like I was a part of their world.\n\nAt its core, Life is Strange is a game about friendship, love, loss, and the difficult choices that we all face in life. As I played through the game and made decisions that impacted the outcome of the story, I found myself becoming deeply invested in the lives of the characters, and their struggles felt like my own.\n\nThe game's unique time-travel mechanic added an extra layer of complexity to the story, allowing me to explore different paths and see the consequences of my actions. But what really made this game special was the way it tackled difficult themes like depression, suicide, and family dysfunction with sensitivity and empathy, never shying away from the harsh realities of life.\n\nAs the game reached its climax, I found myself moved to tears by the emotional payoff that all my choices and interactions had led up to. It was a bittersweet moment that left me feeling both heartbroken and fulfilled, a testament to the power of storytelling and the human experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Life is Strange is a masterpiece of storytelling that will leave you feeling emotional and invested in the lives of its characters. It's a game that tackles difficult themes with sensitivity and empathy, and reminds us that even in the darkest moments of our lives, there is always hope and the possibility of redemption.

The art style, music, meanings and story is beautiful. Although I already knew the story (somewhat, i had kind of forgotten) I still felt fresh into the game and my gameplay wasn't hindered whatsoever by my prior knowledge of it. The only thing I will say is: Keep in mind, your choices matter for the journey and that's what matters most. At the end there's a big choice that happens with every gameplay no matter what choices you make and the 2 endings are always the same. This game is about the enjoyablility in the moment, rather than the satisfaction at the end. But don't worry!

The game sat firmly in the library until one day in 2021 where I installed it for the first time.\n\nLife is strange was not an easy game to start, it was as a matter of fact one of the most boring games I've ever played. First of all I always like to get into the games I play, and for this game it required A LOT of reading about a bunch of people and things I didn't know anything about. Basically you had a journal, that would keep filling through the game, a character sheet, with information regarding important people in the game, and a bunch of stupid SMS'es. To top it of I had to also deal with a young white girl, trying to speak and do gang signs like a black person, and being cool, when not really feeling it, even when trying hard. The game focuses a lot on relationships and how people see eachother, but as the main character and protagonist Max or Maxine, you decide if you're gonna make things better or worse.\n\nFor the 2nd part of starting this game, it was a lot more different than other games I have played. Even interacting with objects and people felt weird, but most importantly...having to do stuff over and over again. I can understand that making mistakes may want you to replay stuff. That's how most games with a save is, but the choices you have to take, requires a lot of extra time spent thinking, and doing stuff over, mostly the conversations.\n\nSo to sum up the first part of this review. The game was not very easy to start for me, and I even deleted my save and started the game over again, because so much time had passed. Still, I would almost always choose a different game to play than Life is Strange...simply because it didn't really feel like a game for me. After actually getting into the game for reals, I started to think really hard about this already early. \n\nSee. Life is Strange has a lot of choices, and choices that can lead to drama...this game had A LOT of drama. It's almost like you can never make everyone happy. You always have to make a choice that disappoints someone else. On top of this, Life is Strange is actually a pretty emotional game, and I sat there more than once yelling out into the room \"WTF am I supposed to do now?\" Yes, it can make you feel stuff, but as a grown, adult man, do I really care that much about it?\n\nThis game will be different for everyone, but how much we care about it is something else. Would a younger person, a girl playing this game, feel different about this, than me? Cringe less when certain words or phrases are being said. I know for sure that I had some cringy moments, some emotional moments, but it was more because you're getting more and more into the story.\n\nIn the end I think the game and story was well made, but this game was not for me. I bought it, installed it and played it all through, but I never felt it was a game for me. The start was boring, the endless choices made me annoyed, but most of all, I didn't really know what to say about this. There was a lot of drama; heck the game was even exciting and you kinda wanted to keep playing. However, when I was getting close to the end of the game and the story, I kinda wanted it to be over, so I could play something I appreciate more.\n\nSo to end this review. This game was not for me, and I should have given it a thumbs down, and not recommend it, but I think that there are people that would appreciate this game more than me, and so I would definitely say that you should give it a chance...simply because it's very much different to other games.", "timestamp_created": 1681718100, "timestamp_updated": 1681718366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61839449405670166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136839141": {"recommendationid": "136839141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165692732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1324, "last_played": 1681699791}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games ever, will never forget <3", "timestamp_created": 1681699592, "timestamp_updated": 1681699592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136836505": {"recommendationid": "136836505", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092243828", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 798, "last_played": 1658511072}, "language": "english", "review": "idk gay people or something", "timestamp_created": 1681694547, "timestamp_updated": 1681694547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136835772": {"recommendationid": "136835772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151990765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1681692966}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermoso juego, lo vale cada centavo.", "timestamp_created": 1681693236, "timestamp_updated": 1681693236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136831279": {"recommendationid": "136831279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313524234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3261, "last_played": 1615609724}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the first game I played on Steam and it will always have a special place in my heart \u2764\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1681685481, "timestamp_updated": 1681685481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136830182": {"recommendationid": "136830182", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228337985", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2099, "last_played": 1695420703}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sin duda una historia incre\u00edble, no tengo palabras para describir todas las emociones que me ha hecho sentir este videojuego, una obra maestra.

Along with her childhood friend Chloe, she investigates the mysterious disappearance of a fellow student and uncovers dark secrets about her town and herself.\n\nThe game is divided into five episodes, each lasting about two to three hours. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the environments, interacting with characters, and making choices that affect the outcome of the story. The game also features a few puzzles that require using Max\u2019s time powers to manipulate objects or situations.\n\nThe game\u2019s strongest point is its story, which is engaging, emotional, and unpredictable. The game tackles serious issues such as bullying, suicide, drugs, and violence with sensitivity and maturity. The characters are well-written and believable, and their relationships are complex and dynamic. The game also has a great soundtrack that fits the mood and tone of each scene.\n\nThe game\u2019s weakest point is its technical aspect, which is not very polished or consistent. The game suffers from graphical glitches, animation errors, lip-sync issues, and occasional bugs. The voice acting is also uneven, ranging from excellent to mediocre. The game\u2019s pace can also be slow at times, especially in the first episode.\n\nOverall, Life is Strange is a memorable and impactful game that deserves praise for its narrative and artistic vision. It is not perfect, but it is ambitious and original. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys story-driven games with meaningful choices and consequences. I give it 8.5 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1681651585, "timestamp_updated": 1681651585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136799725": {"recommendationid": "136799725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044151427", "num_games_owned": 967, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1324, "last_played": 1527430219}, "language": "english", "review": "\u3164", "timestamp_created": 1681647205, "timestamp_updated": 1681647205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136792876": {"recommendationid": "136792876", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095562046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 802, "last_played": 1681637097}, "language": "english", "review": "such a amazing game i loved it", "timestamp_created": 1681637049, "timestamp_updated": 1681637049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136781117": {"recommendationid": "136781117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139649259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1149, "last_played": 1681616772}, "language": "english", "review": "Played all the way through, really taking extra effort to make the right choices, but in the end none of it matters.

Victoria happens to be alive which I'm glad as well. \n\nThank you devs, if any of you are reading this, LiS is something that I come back to annually to remember the experience and the bond Max and Chloe has. I hope something similar can come by again, because I didn't feel it on LiS3.

Or Victoria's character development, Or Samuel's backstory with Rachel, we didn't get anymore of that, it was just mentioned and never seen again.\n\nFourth, How did Max get her superpowers? It never really was explained, I also didn't get how all of sudden she can go into pictures and change the past? Plus, that alternate reality thing didn't really matter and didn't do anything, the only thing we figured out is that Nathan was the one that crashed into Chloe, that was basically it.\n\nFifth & Final, the endings felt so basic, the first one with Chloe dying was actually pretty good and made me sad but the second ending with destroying the whole town was stupid and pointless, I also don't get why they chose the second ending to be the canon ending, I prefer the first one as it made more sense and actually made you feel sympathy for the character, but they had to rekt that whole thing up! Mr. Jefferson was also a stupid character, having him telling us what his plan was, didn't make any sense as we were blacked out, did he just wanted someone to talk to.. or..? I also wished they kept the whole plot-line of Nathan knowing about the storm, it would've made things more interesting, and maybe your decision making would either save Nathan or Nathan will die by Jefferson? Something to get the people playing entertained to be excited for what's going to happen next!\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I did enjoy playing Life is Strange, but if it had more thought and passion into it, I think it would've done all lot better, though this is just my opinion.\nI recommend this game because it can be fun replaying at times and making decisions kept me entertained, though there were flaws in this game.\nThough, I'd probably play again to look at more stuff and get more achievements.\nI would defiantly try out the other Life is Strange games though.\nanyways, thanks for listening!", "timestamp_created": 1681137294, "timestamp_updated": 1681137294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136472693": {"recommendationid": "136472693", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990826273", "num_games_owned": 1999, "num_reviews": 398, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1039, "last_played": 1560745763}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a masterpiece, you must play this.", "timestamp_created": 1681136876, "timestamp_updated": 1681136876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444444417953491211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136460447": {"recommendationid": "136460447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069077992", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1451123147}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a cat here.\nFriends passing by can touch her and click Like to pet her once.\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \uff3f\uff3f\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\u4e8c\u3064.", "timestamp_created": 1681118855, "timestamp_updated": 1681118855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393546581268310547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136458857": {"recommendationid": "136458857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315362870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1626629567}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely fell in love with this game when I first played it all those years ago.

It was during the summer and I was playing with my cousin, we were just kids, I was 12 and she was 15. I remember of us laughing and also crying in the various moments that this game have offered to us. I never knew that Chloe's life would later become so relatable to me at the point that I can safely say that I've passed through everything that she passed during the game and also at Before The Storm. This game has shaped who I am and I'm so glad it did.\n\nIn the same year that I've played the game my mother passed away, almost like the game was a warning for what I would be going to pass through. I've lost friends, my family became a mess and I became a lone wolf in my own way, just before I met someone that became special to me, just for that person disappear from my life like the others did. [b] Everybody lies. No exceptions [/b]. I know it's a popular thing nowadays to say [i] \"Oh, that character is just like me\" [/i] but this thing here isn't what people have been doing with Netflix's Wednesday or something like that, I didn't expect that, but it happened. Chloe Price is not a real person, but she was able to do something that nobody else was able to: she made me strong.\n\nLife is Strange shaped my personality, my music taste, my art style, my cloth style (maybe some of you will notice that my hair in the profile pic is blue, yeah... you can guess why), not just because I really like this game, but because it did things to me that I would never imagine that a game would do.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game. Please, play it. Damn I feel like crying just by writing this, I'm so thankful to DONTNOD for developing such a masterpiece, a masterpiece that didn't need 4K RTX graphics to impress and neither an ultra high budget mocap technology to do so, just love and an amazing story.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1680384580, "timestamp_updated": 1680384580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481506466865539551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135909907": {"recommendationid": "135909907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094208228", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2055, "last_played": 1680384325}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with incredibly great details!", "timestamp_created": 1680384373, "timestamp_updated": 1680384373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135907427": {"recommendationid": "135907427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056697245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1478857360}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply ahead of its time with the storytelling.", "timestamp_created": 1680381955, "timestamp_updated": 1680381955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135901284": {"recommendationid": "135901284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962873898", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1865, "last_played": 1677875186}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Life is Strange es una obra maestra del g\u00e9nero de aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, que ha logrado capturar la atenci\u00f3n y el coraz\u00f3n de los jugadores de todo el mundo.

I usually don't pay attention to PS+ monthly games, especially one that is a single-player story game. It was definitely not a game i would typically download, however, i'm so glad that I did. I have so much nostalgia for Life is Strange. The plot, Max and Chloe, the music, the beautiful scenery of Arcadia Bay; I fell in love with all of it. Since the 7 years when I first finished the game, I have replayed it countless times. The game does a great job at making you feel like you yourself are a student at Blackwell High, living in the small but eventful town of Arcadia Bay. For anyone who hasn't played Life is Strange, I strongly recommend that you do. I have bought all the games, including the remasters, and though Life is Strange 2 felt weak to me (I only got half way through the game before it was unplayable), all entries in the series are pretty good as well.
