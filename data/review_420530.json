But I'm gonna make an exception for OneShot. I'll try and avoid spoilers as best I can for most of the review, but still, beware. A short summary in case you don't want to risk it: BUY THE GAME, PEOPLE RAVE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S GOOD. Now with that out of the way..\n\nOneShot isn't a game, it's an experience, as cheesy as it may sound; there isn't a lot of \"gameplay\" so to speak, moreso walking around and solving puzzles. In many cases, and to some people, this would be a bad thing, and something that would make them turn away. However, OneShot does it incredibly well. Firstly..\n\n[h1] The Characters [/h1]\n\nI'll just say it straight up. The characters in this game are f#####g awesome. They are each unique, incredibly memorable, and very lovable (Alula, Silver, and Lamplighter my beloveds). While many don't have a substantial amount of depth, I think it can be excused in this case, as OneShot isn't a very long game; It took me only a little over 7 hours to get the normal and \"true\" endings. Due to that, there isn't much time to build each and every character, lest it take away from going around, solving puzzles, and trying to save the world and get Niko home. Despite this, the characters each have their own personalities, all of which kept me- and hopefully you- engaged in the world and loving its residents.\n\n[h1] The Soundtrack [/h1]\n\nI'm not going to write an entire paragraph or two for this, it's f#####g great. Each track is wonderfully fitting, sounds good, and adds perfectly to the game and its atmosphere.\n\n[h1] The \"Gameplay\" [/h1]\n\nNow, for the side dish before the main course: the gameplay. Yes, the side dish; there is a reason gameplay is in quotations in this sections title. In OneShot, your goal is to explore the world, talking to people to figure out ways to advance, and find items to help you solve puzzles to progress through the game. While some games can do this and still have gameplay, whether this be through a unique combat system or form of gameplay mechanics, OneShot does not have this. This, however, is mitigated through the games fast travel system, which makes a large chunk of the backtracking the player has to do (and there is a good chunk of it on a blind players first run) much more tolerable. The one thing that also holds the \"gameplay\" together is the games puzzles. To put it simply, the puzzles are f######g genius. Due to OneShot being a game not afraid to bend and break the fourth wall, many puzzles rely on you yourself messing around with the games borders itself, files, etc. etc. Many times this can be quite confusing on a first playthrough, but you can receive multiple hints throughout these puzzles, meaning with these, and thinking outside of the box, you can certainly get through them and experience the true meat of the game; The main course, of course being..\n\n[h1] The Story [/h1]\n\nOneShot's story, while not utterly mind-blowingly amazing, is still fantastic, and I implore you to buy the game to experience it yourself. I cannot do it justice. Now, the story generally revolves around the player, the Worlds God, guiding Niko throughout the World to bring a light bulb, the Worlds new sun, to the top of the Tower. Throughout your journey, you'll find many hiccups in which you must solve puzzles to get through, and meet many of the games characters. To be perfectly blunt, in the first quarter of the game, the story is at its weakest- at least it was for me, and some other people I know. While it is certainly interesting, the player is left completely in the dark, with little incentive to go out and find answers besides to complete the goal of simply getting to the end of the game, leading to some players, if you are like me, having to force themselves through the first quarter, and it can be a bit frustrating for new players to figure out what to do, and where to go. This is where my gripes with the story end, as afterwards, we start learning more about the world, the characters, get more familiar with the game and its tricks, but still keeping enough mystery to keep us coming back for more after beating the \"main\" game; the solstice ending. For the sake of not spoiling anything, I won't delve into it that much, but I will say it basically becomes an entirely different game, just in familiar settings with similar characters, and that everything becomes much deeper, and more questions are answered, as well as giving us a \"true\" ending of sorts.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nOneShot is an incredible game with a story that becomes very gripping, with lovable characters and incredibly unique puzzles adding even more flavor to this already delicious cake of a game. I hope this review at least brought some light onto this game and why you should buy it rather than people just going \"hurr durr it good don't spoiler yourself and just buy it\". The game is genuinely amazing that made me choke up a few times and almost cry, and has swiftly become one of my favorites of all time, and I hope you can feel the same way as me, if you end up buying this. If you don't, I don't blame you at all, but I ask you at least look up a playthough, so you can skip through the boring parts and get to the good stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1700734788, "timestamp_updated": 1700734957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151274875": {"recommendationid": "151274875", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074297747", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 815, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1700742918}, "language": "english", "review": "Goodbye, Niko......", "timestamp_created": 1700730671, "timestamp_updated": 1700730671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151269451": {"recommendationid": "151269451", "author": {"steamid": "76561199251177557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 209, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1700008428}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the gato :3", "timestamp_created": 1700728435, "timestamp_updated": 1700728435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151264382": {"recommendationid": "151264382", "author": {"steamid": "76561199212698881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 536, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1700726245}, "language": "english", "review": "woww!", "timestamp_created": 1700726303, "timestamp_updated": 1700726303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151238267": {"recommendationid": "151238267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198852662222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 562, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1700715519}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible game with a story that's very easy to connect with.

Through both its story building and character interactions, OneShot can and WILL pull at your heart-strings and leave a lasting story ingrained into your very memory.\n\n\nOneShot is a indie top-down, story and puzzle driven RPG. Originally made in 2014, it re-released on Steam on December 8, 2016. At first, you may write off OneShot as a bare bones game with nothing much to do other than solve some simple puzzles and walk around the world, but this is far from the truth. While yes, for the most part you talk to NPCs and walk around the world solving puzzles to progress through the game and generally takes less than 9 hours to complete fully, OneShot differs from other games of this genre due to [spoiler]its puzzles having to be solved directly on the computer, like not just in the game world but also the physical computer the game is running on[/spoiler]. I don't really want to share even a little bit of information about the world of OneShot because I firmly believe that you should go in blind to experience the full potential of the game (however you can look up how to solve some puzzles if you need to). The character you control, the NPCs you interact with, and the world as a whole can feel very really at some points of the game. This is exemplified by the fact that the OST of OneShot is both quite somber and lonely-feeling, imploring you to interact with others just for some interaction. All of the aspects mentioned above enables the world of OneShot to force its way into your heart and soul by making your spend quality time with both the main character and the NPCs around them. This game can and will leave a burning story of both of wholesome, hope restoring moments and soul-crushing, heart-string pulling cut scenes that will leave you yearning for more.\n\nIn conclusion, OneShot is an underrated masterpiece that both rivals or even beats similar games such as Doki Doki Literature Club or Undertale and deserves its own pillar in the indie game hall of fame. \n10/10, would recommend even if you don't play these types of games.\n[i]*note, the story of OneShot does not end where you think it does. Please find out how to get back to the world or look up a guide online, just please for the love of Player, experience the whole game.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1699756946, "timestamp_updated": 1699838604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149972985": {"recommendationid": "149972985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836271475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 743, "playtime_at_review": 1173, "last_played": 1699753892}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece, and definitely one of the more unique ones.

It's also a really funny story with well written dialogue and endearing characters.

Solstice was also an incredible twist that also filled in plot holes I had mostly forgotten about. Once I thought the game was over there was more to it. I also personally think most of the puzzles were too easy, but they still challenged me from time to time. Also, don't be fooled by the cute aesthetic of the characters, as there are some more disturbing themes as the game goes on. \n\nBack to the story though, and there will be slight spoilers from this point on. It is possibly the only video game that has ever made me cry (from the story, not rage) and I actually felt the characters were more than just code and sprites.

This game's main selling point is how its characters know that you, the player, exists. If you've played Undertale, Doki Doki Literature Club or anything of the like you'll feel right at home.  \n\nThe 4th wall breaking goes beyond just the game or its writing, and I mean that in a literal sense. Certain puzzles will have you interacting with applications outside of the game window itself in unique ways I have never experienced before. As the store page describes it, \"Gameplay mechanics that go beyond the game window\" and it certainly does not fail to deliver on that front. \n\nOn the topic of puzzles, they felt fair and easily understandable. Throughout my entire playthrough I only had to look up something once and it was for something super minor. There was a door I needed to enter and I forgot where it was. If I had to nitpick about one super tiny thing in this game, it might be that it's really easy to get lost and a lot of unnecessary backtracking will happen in the process. Regardless though that is such a minor complaint in the grand schemes of things and it honestly didn't really bother me that much. \n\nCharacters in this game are well written and make you empathize with their situation. Its residents are living in a world with a dying sun and its up to the player to guide Niko through their journey. As you make your way through the game you'll meet many faces and as you interact with them, you start to form a bond with the inhabitants of this world. What is easily one of my favourite aspects of this game is that not only are you reacting to this world around you, but so is Niko as well. It's one of those rare games where it felt less like \"controlling\" a character, but rather it was more of a back and forth relationship between me and Niko. Niko regularly consults with the player to ask about their opinion on what to do (or not to do), or sometimes even just to chat. It's because of this that Niko feels less like a video game character and more of a friend you're looking out for, and easily one of my most memorable protagonists I've had the pleasure to play with. \n\nRegarding the horror aspect of this game if you're worried about jump scares or anything like that I am pleased to say there isn't anything of the sort. The game is only scary in the atmospheric sense, relying on tone and music to set the mood (and even then it's not that bad). So if you're squeamish you won't need to worry about that here. Speaking of music, the music in this game is a pleasure to listen to as well. A large selection of tracks here and they're all well done. The art direction is great as well. It's simple but charming and I really liked the pixel style and how each region has its own colour theme. \n\nIn closing, OneShot is an incredible game that I highly recommend. It's only about 10 bucks for an experience that you won't find anywhere else. For me, it joins that upper echelon of games that are not only fun to play, but more importantly leave a deep and lasting impression on me that I won't ever forget.

That's not even to mention how you interact with them. Not playing as Niko but guiding them through the world you are both set in and being able to interact with them as yourself is an excellent example of this. Not only was it an amazing choice and allows you to feel connected with the characters. But it also really makes them feel.. alive. The story is amazing as well. It's not only intriguing but emotional, with it's interesting puzzles, wonderful environments and lovable characters. and allowing itself to break the fourth wall really expands the world and adds on to the experience.

The immersive interaction is fantastic, and very complementary to the game's central storyline. I played three times to ensure that I explored most of the script and alternate endings, and it's impressive to see how much of the story unfolds or is added into optional replays.\n\nDuring my first run, I enjoyed investigating most of the maps and (haphazardly) trying to piece objects together to solve various puzzles. The game is very charming in its exploratory nature. There are a lot of interactive objects and characters, and each map area offers different tasks that rely on their own unique environments. The second and third time around, I opted for alternate endings including solstice and, true to the nature of this game, was in awe of how much its narrative has to offer. The last run contained fewer exploratory elements but placed a greater emphasis on insightful introspection, furthering yet another dimension of the game.\n\n[spoiler]For example, the longer I played, the more Niko's questions felt pertinent to discussions surrounding not only coding or artificial intelligence but existence in a materialistic sense. Most of the characters (outside of the robots) were unaware of their lives as being dependent on the limited constructs of an entity or World Machine. Similarly, we tend to navigate the world around us under the assumption of free will rather than an entirely causal or deterministic viewpoint. Whether free will exists or not is beside the point, but I think Niko's attempt to navigate that moral dilemma is very true of human nature, especially from an experiential point of view.[/spoiler]\n\nThis game offers a comprehensive, self-referential story within 5-10 hours of gameplay. There are large-scale, highly cinematic games that could require a far greater time investment and still not scratch the surface of what this game was able to accomplish in a relatively concise time frame. It's now one of my favourite games, and I don't know how to adequately convey how enjoyable OneShot was without over-hyping the game and doing it a disservice. Still, I feel very appreciative of the multifaceted way this game emerges from its own development, as well as its careful thoughtfulness towards others, so I wanted to write a brief review.

say for nearly every other game I've played.

This game is the only game I have played where I'm so easily able to care about characters even if they only have one or two interactions with the player. Oneshot is an experience I think that everyone should take part in. The art is beautiful, the music fits in perfectly and is just wonderfully composed, not to mention the story and writing makes sure you know that your choices matter.

This game had me either crying or smiling. From the 4th wall breaks, to the funny moments that you spend with Niko, this game has thrown me through a loop of emotions I haven't felt in years.\n\nThis game makes you care for Niko from the very beginning. From the dark house, all the way to the tower, this game has you  almost bolted to your seat in a way, not wanting to close the game, in the fear that you would hurt Niko in some way. Along with that, the OST and world are absolutely stunning, especially for being pixel art.\n\nNow, the times that the game has you seperated from Niko is absolutely horrifying. You try and make contact with the character that you have so dearly cared for the entire game, with no response. When you finally continue contacting Niko again, it feels like you and him have been seperated for the entire game. Don't even get me started on returning the lightbulb to the tower in the first playthrough. I was absolutely horrified at the idea of leaving Niko, either option felt like it put the other in jeopardy. \n\nSolstice was single handedly the most heartbreaking, but emotionally joyful things I have ever been through. When you load up the game into Solstice and you hear Niko say your name, then forget what it means, it truly horrified me seeing that, but once Niko understands his true mission from Proto, you finally understand Niko's mission. To tame the world machine. Hearing this, I didn't, and couldn't close the game for another 3 hours. My eyes were completely glued to the screen for the remainder of the game.\n\nSaying goodbye to Niko was one of the saddest things I've ever seen in my entire life. You've been emotionally attached to Niko for the entire game, but then, when you finish the game, you won't be able to see him ever again, running the game would just be like playing a recording. It would feel fake. It's almost the perfect, but bittersweet end that could've went down.\n\nIf you have an extra $10.00 to spend, you should go out of your way to buy this game. It will be the best $10.00 you will ever spend in your life. I will recommend this game to absolutely anybody, regardless.

Your gameplay is literally halted because \"God\" has to tell you about this cat-creature being in danger IMMEDIATELY now it's important!!!! and also, it prevents you from exiting the game (outside of task manager) if you're in a cutscene, because of these \"God\" popups. Imagine programming in something that doesn't let the player stop playing when they want to. God forbid I do that.

The interaction between the player and the protagonist, the moral choice at the end, the overall structure of the game (3 Zones plus one) and the new character(s) that show up to guide you through each zone are all the OFF formula replicated (and used in Undertale as well, another OFF descendant). This game's key hook is that unlike in OFF the protagonist is unambiguously good, and with an actually noble goal that virtually everyone in the game wants to support. There are no villains, not even the \"antagonist\". In many ways it was refreshing to see a game like that, with no attempt to force some extreme moral choice on the player in ways that most games in the genre seem to desire (there is a choice but it's debatable how meaningful it is). The music and atmosphere are both fantastic, my only real problem with it was that it could have used more puzzles and a few of the solutions were a bit esoteric.\n\nYou'll know it if this is your kind of game.

The characters are great, the story is well made, and it's incredibly unique. This game did things I never thought a game could do. Heck, I witnessed something walk off a game window and out of my screen- This game can get very emotional, and that makes it so much better. I love games that make you feel things. This game has humor, story, emotion, etc. Everything a good game needs. There's some parts of the game where you get completely stuck, but then you finally figure out what the issue was, and there's so much satisfaction from those small moments. I have so far only beaten the game once, and I definitely plan to beat it more. If you're looking for a unique game that can make you laugh, cry, or maybe a little bit of both, this is definitely a good option. Some of the best money I've ever spent, if I'm being honest. \n\nShort summary: Cute game, well made, special, and emotional.\n\nPS: You get to ride a roomba.\n\n10/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1694274074, "timestamp_updated": 1694274074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145945754": {"recommendationid": "145945754", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974016593", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1695251829}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1694218139, "timestamp_updated": 1694218139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145943105": {"recommendationid": "145943105", "author": {"steamid": "76561199487374232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1694906685}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good game so far, it's kind of similar to undertale except there's no fighting (from what I've seen) and its only focus is on story.

[b]Easily 8.7/10 overall.[/b] Check it out![list][*][b]Art: 9.3/10.[/b] The palette choice is the perfect contrast between dark, cool colors and bright, warm colors respectively, in that it sets the stage for Niko, the protagonist, being the sole hope for this dream-like world. I suppose my only critique might be the lack of contrast within each set of colors respectively\u2014cool and warm, that is\u2014although the pixel art of [i]OneShot[/i] also seems to reflect the technical limitations of the sixteen-bit era in that each color tends to be uniform throughout a given sprite, rather than textured.[*][b]Soundtrack: 8.3/10.[/b] It's really hard to make a soundtrack for a video game\u2014particularly in this day and age, since mixing and mastering are of particular concern\u2014but [i]OneShot[/i] does it really well; especially with such [i]leitmotifs[/i] as the item-get sound effect. I'd say my only critique on this front, really, is that the music sometimes feels a bit too \"present\" rather than \"ambient.\"[*][b]Level Design: 9.1/10.[/b] When an open-world game tends to have a linear path, it can be either frustrating or intuitive. I think it leans more towards the latter as long as you actually read the dialogue options and play around with the environment.

"review": "a variety of notes, written whenever i can stop full body sobbing long enough to write them.\n\nvideo games r the single greatest medium for this thesis statement, but it applies to all art. art is soul-powered, the machine cannot operate without a soul and the soul has nowhere to go if there is no machine. the machine must itself be made by a soul, often with the intent of capturing it, but it can only capture echoes and afterimages, only detectable with certain tools from certain angles. art in all mediums is in the ultimate superposition, completely at the mercy of its observer...yet the function of the machine is to convince the observer that its the other way around, and that THEY are at the mercy of IT\n\nthe most enriching experiences , for me, have come when awareness of this conflict have only aided the power, when i can see all the reasons i Should Not Care and how flaccid they are next to the amount that i Care Deeply. what is created is not distance but an Understanding, an effortless exchange where both i and the machine are aware of our relation to eachother, we have finally found someone who values the exchange as mutual instead of expecting the other to do all the work. many many ppl engage with art as a rule expecting it to simply whir away while they sit there and passively observe it, never letting their soul interact with it, never extending understanding to its limitations, never allowing it to just Be without explaining itself. that this is such a Particular Issue with the medium of video games has roots in a lot of causes, but i do not believe those causes are anything inherent to the medium itself. games, more then any other medium potentially, CAN demand your soul, and in this environment, it might be a moral imperative that they do\n\nundertale is such an unbelievably trite line of comparison that i trust that u trust me that i wouldnt bring it up without good reason...aside from the fact that its rly an origin and anchoring point for my first exposure to a lot of these thoughts, its fascinating how two games that , timeline-wise, rly cant have Ripped Off Eachother, ended up with such similar things on their minds, and a similar drive to breathe life into what are on a surface level Barely Sketched worlds. in general i would say this is a lot more Specific and Conscious then undertale...undertale is thematically massive, filled with moments and images and rhymes that feel like they Should be straightforwardly didactic, but considering how vastly differently ppl have taken it over the years, theres plenty of testament to it being more of an associative sprawl...undertale does Not have a thesis statement, oneshot does\n\ni might slightly prefer the sprawl approach in general...theres a lot more to chew on in a lot more directions, plus ive just had more time to live w/ undertale so its not the fairest comparison for me probably. but i also cant deny that i See my own personal undertale lens in this game, and that in fact it feels like an entire experience oriented out of that specificity, exploring and honing it to create the most power possible. thats the real reason i suppose that im bringing it up even tho its kind of embarrassing to do so...oneshot is capable of doing things Intentionally with its awareness of the player and its protagonist and the surrounding world in a way that undertale can rly only do between the lines with the player/frisk/chara interlocking triangle. the triangle is more interesting, its something ive been chewing on for years...but im not sure i feel it like i feel me and niko. and like how niko feels me and them.\n\none last note: one of my favorite things, esp compared to similar games, including undertale if im being honest, is its lack of moral judgement. it assumes that u are acting in good faith, are capable of having complicated feelings, and have a generally healthy ability to acknowledge that it is Just Fiction even as u are

The only problem I had in the game was the playtime which wasn't even short, coming in at about 6/7 hours, I just want to continue to play and explore with the cat, it truly pulls you in and makes you care so much about the characters and it's world.

It's more of an experience than a game in the traditional sense. After playing through both the main story and Solstice I can say OneShot has left it's mark on me. It made me think about my life for a second. I realised how finite we are, but these worlds we craft for ourselves are simply incredible. The way the game connects Niko with the player through direct conversation is something so unique to me. And it's something so little games do, because they don't really have a reason to. Oneshot is built around the influence of the player, acknowledging them throughout the game. It was quite startling at first but after a few hours I felt myself getting used to being addressed by Niko. I must say the game does an outstanding job at making the player care about Niko. The fact that they know you are at least partially responsible for every action, certainly makes me feel awful about accidentally hurting Niko. The use of my name really drew me in and made me feel like I was a part of the game. The emphasis on what is real and what is not is a big part of what makes this game special. After finishing I had to get up and think for a moment. Deep down we all know none of this is real and it's all predetermined, but just playing the game for a bit makes you forget that fact, question it even. And the music, yes, the music. It's incredible. Super immersive and I love listening to it. Music is a big part of games for me and I'm glad OneShot did it well. Overall, it's perfect if you love meta games or just thinking about life. Even then, I would recommend giving this game a go just because it's so special. I don't think I'll ever forget this game to be honest. Certainly not Niko.

Throughout the 'story' you play as 'Niko', a character who gains sentience as they explore and learn the new world that they have awoken in. The objective of the game as the story follows is to restore sunlight in this dull, decaying world. However, as the player progresses through the story, they begin to form a special bond with Niko and other characters in the game through interactive dialogue and engagement of the player as a 'god' in this world, creating an emotional attachment and a willing desire to achieve the supposed objective in the game. Accompanying the player are two characters you learn more of as you advance in the game: The Author and The Entity (or The World Machine). These characters provide insight and different perspectives of how a player truly views these simulations created by developers and the player's effect through traversing these intricate yet astounding simulations. From playing this game, it has opened such interpretation to how I view games and the significance of the characters to me. I would have never thought that a game showcasing a silly little cat trying to save a world could give such obscure and perplexing messages. Hints such as metaphors of death, naturalism, acceptance, and too many to list are littered throughout the game which enables the reader to finalize the true message which this game portrays. Normally, I'm not an individual who tends to write reviews on every game I play. However, for this game it is truly an exception as the need to express myself on how breathtaking my experience was was not something I could just hold in. For anyone who wishes or wants to play this game, it is an experience which has truly opened my eyes and made me see the world as well as others who aren't as significant in my life differently, and I believe you should give this game one shot.", "timestamp_created": 1692022149, "timestamp_updated": 1692022149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144168590": {"recommendationid": "144168590", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023361715", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1694249714}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing experience!

I don't write reviews, but this will be an exception. If you played Undertale and liked that, you should enjoy OneShot as well. In my opinion, it is much better than even Undertale.\n\nPlease avoid any spoilers before playing this game. As such, if you haven't played the game yet, I'm not going to spoil anything in this review. Just list a couple things.\n\n#1 The game is a puzzle game, which means that its gameplay revolves around solving well... puzzles. You'll find yourself walking around and not knowing what to do a lot of the time. You really need to explore a lot and think a lot whether an item you collected can be used or not.\n\n#2 The game has no combat systems or anything alike, the gameplay is mostly just walking, exploring and talking to NPCs. So, the gameplay isn't overall very rich, it's very very simple. I personally found playing it very relaxing, because there isn't much happening, and you are allowed to rest and focus. The graphics and music are top notch and make you sit back and enjoy everything around.\n\n#3 Story is the strongest side of this game, and to be honest the story itself is pretty much what this game IS. Like I mentioned before, the gameplay is simple, there is not really much \"replayability\" (the game is called \"one shot\" after all) and so the story is its biggest strength and main, most important feature.\n\nConcluding: if you like a good story, if you like good music, if you're sensitive to art (this game is art) and you don't really care about the gameplay and you're hooked by the story easily, this game is just for you and you'll love it. I'm afraid if you prefer games where gameplay is the main selling point, you won't be satisfied.\n\nTL;DR : Absolute masterpiece, but for people who appreciate art and are invested into stories. Not for people who like tons of gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1691319363, "timestamp_updated": 1691319363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

Desde el principio, OneShot se desmarca al romper la cuarta pared y hacer que el jugador entienda que es m\u00e1s que un mero espectador; es parte fundamental de la trama.\n\nNarrativa y personajes:\nLa trama es el coraz\u00f3n de este juego. La historia de OneShot se desarrolla con lentitud y esmero, revelando gradualmente detalles sobre el mundo en el que se encuentra Niko y su objetivo final. La relaci\u00f3n entre el jugador y Niko es una experiencia emocional \u00fanica, ya que ambos deben colaborar para superar obst\u00e1culos y descubrir la verdad detr\u00e1s de esta misteriosa aventura.\n\nEl elenco de personajes secundarios es peque\u00f1o pero impactante. Cada personaje tiene su propia historia y motivaciones, y se convierten en piezas clave en la comprensi\u00f3n del mundo y la vida de Niko. El enfoque en la empat\u00eda y el cuidado hacia los dem\u00e1s es una de las cualidades m\u00e1s destacadas de OneShot, dejando una profunda impresi\u00f3n en el jugador.\n\nJugabilidad y dise\u00f1o:\nOneShot presenta una jugabilidad \u00fanica que se centra en la exploraci\u00f3n y los rompecabezas ingeniosos. Aunque la mec\u00e1nica de juego no es particularmente innovadora, es la manera en que se implementa lo que lo hace especial. La interacci\u00f3n entre el jugador y Niko se lleva a cabo de manera creativa, incluso involucrando el uso de archivos del sistema y mensajes directos para resolver ciertos enigmas. Esta peculiaridad rompe los l\u00edmites tradicionales del videojuego y sumerge al jugador en una experiencia m\u00e1s inmersiva.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico es otro aspecto destacado del juego. El mundo de OneShot est\u00e1 representado en pixel art, pero con una est\u00e9tica \u00fanica y cautivadora. Cada escenario est\u00e1 lleno de detalles y simbolismo, lo que agrega profundidad a la atm\u00f3sfera del juego y lo convierte en una obra de arte visual. La m\u00fasica y los efectos de sonido tambi\u00e9n juegan un papel fundamental en la creaci\u00f3n de una ambientaci\u00f3n emotiva y evocadora.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nOneShot es un tesoro escondido en el vasto mundo de los videojuegos independientes. Su enfoque innovador, narrativa emotiva y dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico encantador lo convierten en una experiencia \u00fanica y significativa. A medida que la trama se desenvuelve y se revelan las verdaderas implicaciones de las acciones del jugador, este se encuentra inmerso en una reflexi\u00f3n sobre la moralidad, la empat\u00eda y el significado de la vida.\n\nEn resumen, OneShot es un videojuego que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del entretenimiento superficial, dejando una huella duradera en el coraz\u00f3n de quienes se aventuran en este mundo fant\u00e1stico. Es una experiencia que se debe vivir al menos una vez, para comprender la magia que puede desprenderse de la simplicidad y originalidad en el mundo del entretenimiento interactivo.",

It is a puzzle based game and its gameplay is nothing interesting, but if you play oneshot, you do not play it for the game, you play it for the story. As a narrative game oneshot is extremely meta but manages to integrate the meta aspects of itself in a way that feels natural and dynamic. It separates the player from the player-character, who is the innocent and lovable Niko. With the consequences of your decisions affecting a character who is not yourself, the player is forced to look at their decisions in a different light: How will this action affect not just the game-world, but also Niko? OneShot hinges on a grand theme of life. What is life's value? Who is alive? Are some people more alive than others? Does the answer to any of these dictate how we should or must treat others? Indeed, the penultimate judgments that players must make about these questions is not made easy by the cast of lovable and interesting characters. OneShot is a great game and is well worth giving a play, even if you are not normally fond of narrative or rpg-maker games.\n\nSPOILERS FOR ONESHOT AND FOR ITS ENDINGS PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK:\n\n\n\nThe secret ending to OneShot is touching, but I do feel like it somewhat sullies the game by undermining the player's final decision. It takes the climactic question of \"who more deserves to live?\" and removes its weight by saying \"uhh. How about everyone.\" Its a sweet ending, and it is nice to see all the characters live on, but it also erodes the moral debate that was previously established. Also, the lore dump it entails can be a bit frustrating. Solstice is not necessarily bad. The painting of the world machine as suicidal along with the debate about reality that it poses is interesting. I just think Solstice would have functioned much better as perhaps its own stand-alone game, or maybe a spinoff.

I'm writing a review. Bear with me, gamers. This \"\"review\"\" is quite biased because I liked the game so much.\n\nBefore you read this? Please consider playing it blindly. If you love music, story, and relationships.. This game will make your heart twist and turn. Tears may fall. It happened with me. I am not forcing you to play it blind, as I am nobody to say such a thing. You will most likely fall in love with everything about OneShot. Maybe some parts less than others.\n\n[h1]Personal Experience[/h1]\n\nI have never in my life been so beat up in my emotions (in a somewhat positive way) by a video game. Ever.\nSomefreaking how I got so attached to Niko (the protagonist) that I felt genuine sadness for the next few days when I finished Solstice.\n\nSadness, longing, et cetera. I wanted a OneShot 2 just to see Niko again. I have high hopes for some fan-games that could do that.\n\n[u]Potential Spoilers below, in the black box. I extrapolate on my enjoyment of some themes throughout the game.[/u]\n\n[spoiler]I loved the themes of how you are God. God to that World, due to you being the Player. It's heartwrenching when you have to make big decisions for the poor cat-person, Niko. The thing is so innocent, it's a precious sight.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]The fourth wall breaks really helped enforce in my mind that there is indeed a high power besides you in this world.\nThis high power is like a person, too. The bots that are \"tamed\" feel genuinely real, to me.[/spoiler]\n\nOkay, now let's get into the actual playable areas of the game. I won't be hiding this.\n\n[h1]World[/h1]\n\n[b]The Barrens[/b]\n\nI give it a 10/10. There are many places to go. I like the purple/blue tint to it, giving you the sense that there is practically eternal night. Like a sort of hell. Sun's gone. Sorry. No light.\n\nIt emphasizes the sheer importance of you putting the bulb into the socket. Weirdly enough, the fumaroles in one area scare me. Like actual dread. \n\nWhen I walked into the place and saw the pop-up that said \"The air here is unbreathable.\" I just didn't go back. Not until I had something on Niko's face.\n\nSpeaking of utter dread, when the dialogue popped up that said \n\n[i]\"What if my scarf got caught in there..? And then it'll pull me in, and....\"[/i] \n\nin the factory, interacting with the presser actually scared me into never coming back there. Eventually I came back to actually progress through the game. I was still very scared.\n\nThis concludes the Barrens.\n\n[h1]The Glen[/h1]\n\n8/10. \n\nA foliage and water-filled region consisting of a green theme, and a sort of ruined look. Vines sprawl all over the place.\nThat is the main reason I loved The Glen so very much. I loved the ambiance. The Barrens did this well, too.\n\nThe Glen evokes the feeling of ruin and disrepair, but you soon find out it still has inhabitants, making the best of what they can and still being somewhat happy. They still give you smiles. They, once again, feel real.\n\nWhen I went into the place where Maize was, I was not impressed nor moved by the layout. I did not particularly like how it was just three rectangles, and I wish it were more decorated.\n\nThat, however, did not dissuade me from the game one bit. Every game has its flaws. When Maize said \"I'm not afraid anymore\" after she held the sun, I did indeed feel tears form in my eyes. That was a bittersweet thing.\n\nAfter you give her the sun, I like how the vines look. How they contrast with Maize, the Sun, and the grass.\nThe music that plays there gives off a feeling of \"I'm dying, but that's okay\" (since she was at least able to feel the Sun) as well as sheer melancholiness.\n\nI did not feel much from Calamus and Alula, but I did feel something from the fact that they're kids, surviving in a dying World that's barely holding on in hopes of a Savior.\n\nThe flooded theme of the ruins and overall style of The Glen is nice. I enjoyed it verily, but not as much as The Barrens.\n\nThis concludes the section covering The Glen.\n\n[h1]Refuge[/h1]\n\n11/10. Yes, I'm giving it an 11/10. When I saw that there were people here I was like \"there are people here??\".\n\nI felt happy, but also very sad for the people living there. They're just waiting to die at this point. When Niko went to the bartender for some pancakes, I felt awful when she (in my mind don't get mad at me) said that she wanted her mama, and started crying. \n\nI felt for her. Homesickness is awful, especially knowing that this \"World\" is freaking weird and you're unsure of if you'll actually be able to SEE your mama again.\n\n[i]\"Am I... even here to save the world? People have been saying how the sun won't fix anything!\"[/i]\n\n[i]\"I don't even know why I'm here.. ..I just wanna see my mama again...\"[/i] - [b]Niko, in the Cafe[/b]\n\nThat actually hurt. Bad. Heart hurt. Big bad.\n\nThe overall red theme of the Refuge gives, once again, a perfect sense of dread and alarm. The music fits, too. \"Eleventh Hour\" is a fantastic track name, for the eventual lead-up into the ending. It is indeed the Eleventh Hour with what is happening in the game as of that point in time.\n\nLamplighter was a funny character. He once again feels very real, like a dude just trying to do his job and getting somewhat frustrated. It's some good character design.\n\nAnd then comes the Tower. Maybe this should be a section in and of itself, but I don't care !!\n\n[spoiler]\"Niko and the World Machine\" feels so different from the ambient soundtrack of OneShot, which is why it made me feel so broken on the inside. I was torn. Through toil and tears, Niko and I have made it to the eventual end.\n\nThe decision was so hard. So, so hard. But ultimately, my love and compassion for Niko overturns any other decision I could ever make. So I return her home.[/spoiler]\n\nAs Kirk says to Spock at the end of \"The Search for Spock\",\n\n[i]\"Because the needs of the one.. outweigh the needs of the many.\"[/i]\n\nThis concludes the review of the actual game. Music time.\n\n[h1]MUSIC!![/h1]\n\nYes. Please. Yes. I love the music of this game so much that I'm making a composition off of it. I normally never compose songs with motifs from other media, but OneShot is a beautiful exception and well worth it.\n\nThe ambience of the music is absolutely perfect for many areas of the game. And it all fits together like a consarned jigsaw puzzle. There are leitmotifs littered throughout the soundtrack which is why it is so memorable.\n\nUndertale does this well. That's why it was memorable. That's why OneShot is memorable, too.\n\nThank you. To all who worked on this game, you have genuinely changed my life and helped me to think better and clearer.\n\nThe game is well worth the money. It's like a book.\n\n[h1]Post-Script[/h1]\n\nThis was less of a review and more of my ramblings on why I enjoyed the game so much. I am simply a casual player who loves music, stories, and philosophy. If you read this and didn't just comment \"i ain't reading all that\", thank you.\n\nI will reiterate. I am not a serious critic.

But then.... i still feel distressed that I made the decision, what happens to the world, are they real in the sense that niko's world is real? what happens to them? what happened when i left niko at the tower? My emotions were convoluted. So i decided i would finally try the solstice run the next day. Needless  to say i wasnt ready for a roller-coaster of emotions, new puzzles, dialogue, lore, characters. I'll keep it short because i dont even know what to say but, this game is the best 4th wall breaking emotional roller-coaster of puzzles and characters (especially niko) of a game.

It made me feel something deep that I haven't felt in a very long time. Throughout the game, I did not feel like I was controlling the primary character. Instead, I could feel that they were a separate being, with their own emotions and desires. There were several moments when the main character would reach out to me, and I would learn more about their past, their home life, and their desire to return to it. And when the game ended and I lost this connection, I felt a piece of myself being lost with it.\n\nApart from this deep connection, the graphics and sounds of the game are simply stunning. They are truly able to convey an abnormal level of emotion through a lower-than-average level of detail. Every detail of the game was clearly put together in just the right way to invoke a sense of both calm and dread, of companionship and loneliness.\n\nThis game is easily one of the best games I have ever played. If you wish to play this game, I recommend it with a strong warning - you will be longing to return to the game after completing it. And, while you can use mild file manipulation to do so, and wild file manipulation to do so even more, you will never feel the same connection you initially did when completing this game the first time.

I wish the meta puzzles were more in-depth and the puzzles in general left me wanting more because they never really evolve or even get much harder by the end. Overall, it gets an 8/10.

Unlike a game like ULTRAKILL, where the game is still grand, spoiled or not, OneShot is a game that, if I had spoiled it for myself, well... it wouldn't have been the same. Please, try this game, at least a little. It's not expensive, and it's worth the money.

Niko siempre me pareci\u00f3 un gran personaje: dulz\u00f3n, valiente, lo que debe tener un h\u00e9roe. En 2014, rejugar el juego como ahora, borrando el archivo y que recuperase parte de recuerdos, era imposible. Simplemente, aparec\u00eda el cuarto sin m\u00e1s, iluminado o no. Me volv\u00ed a comprar el juego porque vi que despu\u00e9s de diez a\u00f1os sin jugar, hab\u00edan metido nuevas implementaciones, no me arrepiento de la compra. \n\nOne-shot es, simplemente, un viaje a casa; un nuevo descubrimiento, un mundo por conocer. Cuando lo jugu\u00e9 por primera vez, no me lo pens\u00e9 demasiado, salv\u00e9 el mundo a la primera y llor\u00e9 aunque me pareci\u00f3 lo correcto, ahora, hice la segunda opci\u00f3n y, SPOILERS, lo siento por ello: aqu\u00ed romp\u00ed la bombilla. Estoy rejugando de nuevo con la opci\u00f3n de borrar el \"save\", pero, sin embargo, sigo opinando lo mismo: el mundo en el que Niko juega, es ego\u00edsta (no hateo a ning\u00fan personaje ni al mundo de forma fehaciente, s\u00f3lo recalco como mi propia percepci\u00f3n ha cambiado durante los a\u00f1os con el juego, con 14 y ahora casi con 23) pone la responsabilidad de salvaci\u00f3n en manos de un personaje como Niko que no deja de ser un ni\u00f1o que tiene miedo y todo el derecho de aceptar no salvar ese mundo para volver a casa. \u00c9sto tambi\u00e9n me hace pensar en el complejo del h\u00e9roe en la vida real, la man\u00eda que tenemos muchas veces de librar batallas que no son nuestras, desgast\u00e1ndonos y poni\u00e9ndonos gestas her\u00f3icas cuando de la primera persona que tenemos que cuidar, es de nosotros mismos. No es nuestra responsabilidad, por duro que suene, salvar a otras personas, porque muchas veces, nosotros ya tenemos no que vivir, sino que sobrevivir. Aunque este juego nos ense\u00f1a sobre responsabilidad y que lo importante es el camino, tambi\u00e9n creo que podr\u00edamos pensar en esta otra reflexi\u00f3n. Cargar a personas con nuestros propios problemas, s\u00f3lo porque queramos que otro nos salve, queramos a nuestro propio Niko, queramos que alguien nos traiga el sol, es...ego\u00edsta. \n\nEl sol ya est\u00e1 en nosotros, no necesitamos que otros lo intenten, ni tampoco alimentarnos de la luz ajena.
