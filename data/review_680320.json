It's like someone handed google translate a fifth of vodka to chug before putting it to work on this game. I still can't make sense of anything beyond the bare bones of the narrative. The one saving grace is that what you have to do to progress the story at any given point is pretty simple, so you can usually stumble your way through without any real difficulty. Unfortunately, the resulting lack of investment makes this modestly sized game feel agonizingly slow. Second is that there is a fair bit of dissonance between story and the BGM; a situation that varies between tense and downright dark should not sound upbeat or idyllic. The BGM isn't bad, in fact it's quite good, but it doesn't fit the game. The voices and SFX are at least basic - not bad, not good either, but they at least aren't clashing with the game. The UI is mercifully simple and (if you go down a certain path) the H comes quickly, easily, and is at least decent. The proportions on Alice are... odd. I can't really tell if her thighs are ripped or not, or if the shifting mass of them is simply a consequence of the art style *shrug*, nevertheless despite being rather trope-y, she's still fairly attractive and the CG quality is fine overall. The only direct complaint I can muster regarding the CGs is that they'll occasionally zoom in, but not increase the resolution, so it's VERY pixellated on such shots.\n\nDespite my complaints the game is still decent and competently put together, so it gets the thumbs up, but this is one of those \"get on sale\" or \"get if you've already got the better games and need something new\" types.\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1655874783, "timestamp_updated": 1655874783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116162920": {"recommendationid": "116162920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209347431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1696905050}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, buenas cg's, para nada dificil y tedioso.", "timestamp_created": 1653777320, "timestamp_updated": 1653777320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111626666": {"recommendationid": "111626666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085145356", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1266, "last_played": 1646513508}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1646513554, "timestamp_updated": 1646513554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110881448": {"recommendationid": "110881448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339848579", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 145, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1600434924}, "language": "english", "review": "This marks a great fall of a hero.

It's also the main reason to get this game since it's pretty sub-par in every other respect except maybe voice work (and that's 90% moans).\n\nBranching plot with a few different ends.  Not a ton of them, but a handful of reasonably different endings and paths to get there does give a little replay value.  However, since the translation is so terrible you only get the gist of things at best which makes the plot feel pretty generic even by H-game standards.\n\nSound is ok, what bits of voice are used are good enough to not be jarring though only two characters are voiced anyway, though since it's the the PC and the villain it doesn't feel too weird that they're the only voiced roles.\n\nThe RPG portions are very basic and silly-easy even on the higher difficulty, but they're also quick enough to get through or downright skippable enough to not bog things down if you don't want to get stuck in the grind (of the non-H kind).  However, they don't really add anything either and it often feels like the game could have been a Visual Novel instead and not lost much of anything.\n\nIt's also annoying that fullscreen mode is tucked away in a properties window from right-clicking on the top of the game's default window rather than a nice in game settings option, but at least it's there because otherwise it would feel like a game for ants at my typical resolution.\n\nSo overall, I'd say the game is maybe worth the low price (especially if you catch it on sale) but only for the art.

Unfortunately, it has been published by one of the worst possible publishers SakuraGame/Paradise Project. In effect, the localisation is horrible. The translation is on google translate level at best. Hence, the plot is very hard to follow, and often unintelligible.\n\nThe plot itself is pretty average even considering low budget. There are no unexpected twists or any deeper moments. 8 endings provide some variety but some of them are barely distinct. The main characters lack depth and some secondary ones have no backstory at all. They just are.\n\nThe art is objectively ok (some might like it), but subjectively (my opinion) is somewhat below average. The backgrounds and maps are good enough for this budget. There are a lot of CGs and even some simple animations, but not much variety. Lot of scenes but just like CGs, not much variety. Additionally, even with patch, all hCGs are mosaiced (with patch). This diminish enjoyment.\n\nThe music is forgettable. Sound effects are fine.\n\nOne scene causes game to crash, which is actually pretty good. A lot of doujin games have many more issues  than this one.\n\nOverall, the game would be acceptable depending on your taste, but the horrendous localisation and censorship prevent me from recommending this title. 4/10\n\nDON'T SUPPORT THIS SCUMMY PUBLISHER!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1592247482, "timestamp_updated": 1592247482, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578138589859008789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70670791": {"recommendationid": "70670791", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031334008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1605556381}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]QUICK FACTS[/h1]\n\nType: H-RPG (RPG Maker)\nDeveloper: OneOne1\nPublisher: Paradise Project\nPrice: 3,99\u20ac\nEst. playtime: 6-8 hours\nCensorship: yes (patch online available)\n\n\n[h1]THE GAME[/h1]\n\n[b]MECHANICS[/b]\nRPG Maker in OneOne1 style: your MC is based in a village/city where you can freely roam around. There\u2019s no overland map; instead you get missions that unlock new dungeon areas where you can fast travel to. Completing missions progresses the story in a mostly linear fashion. \n\nOn normal difficulty, most of your time is spent fighting in dungeons. [b]Combat[/b] is basic, very easy and quite repetitive. You can either grind random mobs for XP or get killed by them every so often (which teleports you back to town and gives you a level for free). Boss fights may be a bit of a challenge if you get to them too quickly. Items and skills are somewhat useful, but mindlessly bashing the attack button and the odd heal gets the job done too.\n\nControls: Keyboard only. Use Ctrl to fast forward dialogue.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nYou play as Alice Dietrich, the sole heir of the noble Dietrich family. Your father\u2019s death left you with a sizeable family debt, which you to need repay.  Luckily, you\u2019ve been trained as a gunner knight, which allows you to perform quests for money in service of the kingdom.\n\nThere are three main story routes: [spoiler]succeed at everything and remain a knight, fail to pay your debts in time and become a slave, or turn evil yourself[/spoiler]. Between these routes, multiple endings are available. The outcome largely depends on whether you succeed at certain missions or not. \n\n[b]QUALITY[/b]\nAs a game, The Heiress is a pretty lousy product. The story is shallow and predictable, the gameplay is way too easy to offer any added value, and the translation is a bug-ridden pile of rubbish. Some scenes may actually crash the game due to localization errors; you may need to change the language temporarily in order to get past them. \n\nThe game does offer some replay value due to the different story routes. However, that\u2019d require you to go through all of the above again.\n\n\n[h1]THE GOODS[/h1]\n\n[b]SUBJECT[/b]\nThe lewd in The Heiress is mostly about Alice\u2019s sexual (mis)adventures, which at first mostly happen against her will. But as is customary with these type of games, she may end up becoming perverted enough to enjoy it and even take the initiative. In addition, there are a couple of scenes featuring other NPC\u2019s.\n\nKeywords: [spoiler]bondage, big breasts, group, fluids, forced, humiliation, milking, monster, public, solo, straight, tentacles, urination[/spoiler]\n\n\n[b]CONTENT[/b]\n44 scenes made of static CG\u2019s, as well as short (combat) animations supported by rudimentary voice acting. \n\n[b]ACCESS[/b]\nIt\u2019s possible to finish the game without hardly seeing any lewd at all, if [spoiler]you succeed at all of your missions[/spoiler]. However, once you [spoiler]have lost your virginity and fail to pay your debts[/spoiler], you\u2019ll come across most of the scenes in the game.\n\nCombat animations get unlocked once you lose your virginity. Once you complete the game, you\u2019ll get the option to unlock the full gallery in subsequent playthroughs.\n\nCensorship: Visuals are censored by default, and there\u2019s no patch available from the developer. However, [url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGmlC696yfs]this gentleman[/url] explains how to get one for free. \n\n[b]QUALITY[/b]\nThe lewd in this game is actually pretty good: high quality (albeit at a somewhat dated resolution), varied and a fairly large amount of scenes. Animations are rather crude and will look familiar if you\u2019ve played other OneOne1 games, but they\u2019re a nice extra.\n\n\n[h1]VERRO\u2019S VERDICT[/h1]\n\nThe Heiress is one of those games you should only consider buying for the lewd. As with many other games from this developer/publisher combo, the gameplay and localization will probably annoy you more than they\u2019ll entertain you. It\u2019s very cheap though, so if you\u2019re on a tight budget and you enjoy this type of content\u2026  But don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\n\n[i]Looking for fairly priced adult games with good gameplay?

I can totally ignore the fact that this woman could dive head first into a pool and her floatation devices would hit the water long before her body ever got wet.\n\nThe sexual scenes are um....kind of....I wanna say disturbing? Awkward maybe? And I understand that the translator put in work on this game without any kind of a firm understanding of the English language.\n\nI played through the first 20 minutes reading everything, then I couldn't be bothered...its that bad that I sped through all the text. Im sure in japanese this game is fire but in english it should be in one. I beat the game just by occasionally checking the mission status.

The game works, but the language is so bad that you more often than not have to actually guess what's being said. It's frustrating and takes quite a toll on the player. This is because SakuraGame relies entirely on machine translation, and most likely doesn't even know English language themselves. When a language is directly translated, as machine translation do, it often doesn't make very much sense because idioms and sentence structure isn't the same in different languages. You need human skills and intelligence to make sense of it all, and make it into something that relays the same message. \n\nSakuraGame doesn't do that, and ONEONE1 knows, but they still asked them to translate the game instead of someone with actual translation skills. Why? Who knows, maybe ONEONE1 doesn't really care much for gaijins, but still want our money, and SakuraGame works cheap and fast? It's hard to say. No matter, the fact still remains that \"The Heiress\" has language that's so bad that it completely destroys what's good about the game.\n\nEDIT: The in-battle H-attacks doesn't work in the Steam version.

tus acciones, lo unico malo y que casi me hace devolverlo al inicio fue la pesima traducci\u00f3n al ingles y que cuenta con varios errores que te sacan del juego, esto se soluciona poniendo el juego en chino, pasando la parte que te saca del juego y volverlo a poner en ingles, pero lo perdono por que los creadores ni si quiera son esta region del mundo y acaba de salir no hace apenas unos dias,

I can't stress this enough, trying to make out what everything means is painful, as opposed to Dark Elf or Material Girl where it was really badly translated and goofy at points.\nAlso, the localization has actually broken the game. We'll get back to that later.\n\nSo, what else? Like Dark Elf, you have pretty generic JRPG system, that is easy as fuck. Even if you continiously select basic attack while fighting normal enemies, it is impossible to lose, since they do so little damage, and gaining levels heals you completely, which you do fast enough to negate any damage that you might get. The only challenge seems to be in boss fights, where you either find out the weakness for fast kill, or heal yourself every few turns. It really is easy as fuck, and makes you wonder why there even is combat here.\nHow about porn? Good news is that unlike Dark Elf, you don't need to lose to get sex-scenes here, it seems to be based on player choices in the story. Bad news is that some of them crash the game. I'm not even joking, this is what happened to me during the first sex-scene of the game.\nhttps://puu.sh/x7Qb3/1df918a006.jpg\n\nAnd really, the whole game is the same bullshit, but even more annoying to read through compared to previous releases, so I'm not really planning to play any more.\nIf you absolutely need RPG Maker porn, play something else. Even Dark Elf would be better choice, but I strongly advice looking for something else, not released by SakuraGame.", "timestamp_created": 1502497909, "timestamp_updated": 1502498218, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78096693754196167", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34178275": {"recommendationid": "34178275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033717744", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1502490030}, "language": "english", "review": "Game started up and I tried to be one with my inner weaboo by choosing chinese but cant read anything so im stuck in the starter zone.\n\nI like sushi so I thought I was japanese so I thought I could read it.\n\n\nI had the worst experience you've ever seen believe me.
