While this game is not to my tastes now, I can see the appeal of the game that had me interested when I first played it.  It's the most well-developed game in the series and will take more than a few hours to get through (unless you're using speedhack).  My main gripe with this game is Evelyn.  I appreciate the idea that there's an alternate character to romance, but I don't agree with the execution.  I may be misremembering this, but to my knowledge, Evelyn is more or less Emily in a different font.  They have slightly different ways of talking and have different music tastes, but they are fundamentally the same person.  The game plays out exactly the same regardless of who you choose (except the endings you can unlock differ depending on who you first chose).  I don't see the point in having a second love interest if there's no real difference in story.  I also wish you could speed up the game without having to download Cheat Engine but that's not a dealbreaker.

Once I got into it, I really just wanted to keep going to the end, cheesy 2008 electro music and all.\n\nAnd for someone who's never used Facebook, for your entire game to be you exploring

And yeah at the end she tells me she knew that F... that Steve liked her all along and liked \"Many friends like me but it's ok\" Then Cancel my date with an excuse but go to the photo booth with Steve??\nI hate summer\n\n- Third, This is a huge red flag for this game\nThe first playthrough is a forced bad ending no matter guide tells you to confront and drop it at any point it still bad ending so First playthrough (Save file) You might have to choose the opposite girl you like to not hurt feeling as much\n\n- The Last one is Emily is Away <3 have most Functions and Features of all three games\nIt has so many Ending possible\nbut it comes with 'All Ending Achievement' (I'm an Achievement perfectionist)\nIt's very frustrating to try to convince or choose some choice that changes the ending\nAnd as I say early this game makes me hate Evelyn It's terrible to just restart the game to just \"Hey, Babe\" and smile\nBecause m...

It's okay for me i guess. The intro to this game is the legendary Windows XP one but when you log in to \"Facenook\" the cursor, while loading, resembles the one from Windows 7 (i was a Windows 7 user not that long ago, i can still vividly remember it). So this is a weird design choice, maybe the developer wanted to merge the two most remembered & loved OS's ever? Maybe.\n\nThere are two girls you can have a romantic relationship with, just like the previous game (except only the 1st one has Emily, the 2nd one introduced Evelyn).\n\nThere are 5 main endings and 9 sub-endings, which depend upon mainly minor choices, not the super important ones. I wouldn't suggest going over all of them since the game gets tedious after its 3-4 hours run. Too much typing and enter-ing! There is one achievement that requires you to get all MAIN 5 endings ONLY, not the sub-endings. If it didn't pop, go to secrets and press on the \"5/5 endings\" icon. It will pop up.\n\nThe main 5 endings differ a lot i guess but most of the time only the name of your girlfriend changes. At times i saw many similar dialogue moments since i was changing from Emily to Evelyn and vice verca to get all the main 5 endings. You will notice the same dialogue as well after those 3-4 hours i was talking about earlier. Since it is only just an indie game, this must be why there isn't enough variation between the two characters dialogues and personalities (although i remember that in the 2nd game where Evelyn is introduced, i remember her being a completely different person compared to Emily) or it could just be laziness from the developer.\n\nIf you, like me, tried the 1st two games, wanted to complete the collection, get some easy 100% achievements and appreciate the 2000's aesthetic, then i am recomending this game to you.", "timestamp_created": 1689779582, "timestamp_updated": 1689779582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142378291": {"recommendationid": "142378291", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013033830", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1689731422}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game and love all the new characters but the cause to effect does confuse me.... buutttt it was great.... just fininshed a long few days of playing all three games with my bf and i can safely stay that even complex story games like the telltale series have nothing on this.... it brings so much realism and immersion with so much emotion behind it...

Not sure if this was the intention of the game, but based off the other reviews written by other players and how difficult it is to get a \"good\" ending in the game, I wouldn't be surprised. Overall, this is what I thought of the game:\n\n- The links that send you to a Walmart version of YouTube was pretty cool, you can even click on the videos suggested to you on the right, you can rate the video itself, and like/dislike the comments on the video. \n- Taking the love quiz and writing my own status/notes was cute.\n- I wish there were more options for dating besides Emily/Evelyn. The game puts you into the perspective of a straight male, and as a straight female playing the game, I would often try to just stay friends with Emily/Evelyn and try dating somebody like Mat instead, but that just wasn't an option. \n- After playing all three games, the conversations start to become predictable or boring, so I had to take breaks in between sessions. I got really tired of being asked to listen to new music every time I talked to a character or started another chapter. \n- The endings frustrated me, I didn't appreciate being gaslit about being manipulative and controlling to Evelyn after asking her to tone it down with Steve since they were flirting with each other (at least they were in my opinion). But I guess this is supposed to simulate what a real high school relationship can be like, especially with social media, so good job to the creator if that was the intention. I also hate that Emily suddenly despised me just because I didn't go to her party (I didn't even say I was attending, I put down 'maybe' hoping there was a chance I could attend both). I went to Evelyn's party instead and she didn't talk to me for the rest of the game.\n\nOverall I love the series, but this game just was really frustrating, and everybody else seemed to agree based on their struggle to get a happy ending with whichever S/O they chose. Just wish the story writing was a little bit better, then it would've been a perfect game, and I would've felt confidence enough to recommend it to my friends without fear of them getting fed up with the game (like I did).", "timestamp_created": 1689632107, "timestamp_updated": 1689645869, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665429532527923584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142264369": {"recommendationid": "142264369", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091914578", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1689715411}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool idea and fun but I don't have a desire to play a second play through.

I will start by highlighting what I liked about this game:\n- This game made me feel very nostalgic about my days in high school, where I would spend hours chatting with friends on social media sites about random stuff. The chat conversations in this game was quite similar to what I had with my friends. \n- I liked how the game had its own \u201cYouTube\u201d page with playable music videos directly from YouTube. Although the only song I know from the feature videos is the Metro Station song, it brought back memories.\u2028\u2028Now what I disliked:\n- The chat system. It was okay at first, but having to type every time after you\u2019ve selected the text choice can be very grind and boring. I understand that the developers may have added this elements to make it seem realistic. But there should be an option to let players to skip this part if they don\u2019t want to press random keys every time they select a text choice.\n- There is no tutorial or anything that can help a player get around the game smoothly. I happened to have tapped \u201crespond\u201d to a Facebook post about my own death, this literally caused the game to RESTART. I basically had to start over from ZERO. The game is already very grindy given that you have to tap random keys on your keyboard every time you selected a text response to the other characters. It\u2019s no fun having to start over, if I knew this would be the result I would have not clicked to respond to the post about my death.\u2028\u2028Overall, I wanted to like this game and recommend it due to how unique it is. However, the mechanics and lack of tutorial is the reason why I cannot recommend it. It can get very grindy.

But I'm glad for that mistake, because I probably wouldn't have gotten the game otherwise.\n\nI'm one year older than the characters in the game. This game does a very good job of recreating how we used to use social media in that era. And not just the aesthetic, but the actual usage of the technology itself. Back when Facebook wasn't just your elderly relatives sharing conspiracy theories, and you still had plenty of friends without a cell phone- when social media was used to communicate outside of school hours because you didn't have any other way to reach some people. \n\nThis works because that technology-based socialization that we cheered then and lament now is actually what drives the narrative and characterization forward.\n\nThis game made me feel a way that I haven't felt in a long time. Actual Facebook doesn't even feel that way anymore. Sure, I could look up songs or shows from 2008 and remember that feeling, but this game actually brings it back.\n\nIs that just nostalgia? Maybe, but I think its something else as well. It's using the specific medium to communicate a feeling that no longer exists.

It's a visual novel that takes place on a Facebook-like platform set in 2008, and boy, does it capture the essence of that time. As I controlled a high school senior navigating relationships and the impending college life, I found myself making choices that shaped the story and the friendships around me. It felt like every decision carried weight, as if my digital persona depended on it.\n\nThe game's attention to detail is remarkable. The recreation of Facebook, called \"Facenook,\" feels incredibly authentic, from the scattered updates in the feed to the chain surveys in the forgotten Notes feature. And let's not forget the pokes! It's like stepping into a time capsule.\n\nThe story unfolds through digital conversations, and choosing between responses led me down different paths. It's amazing how a simple click can alter the course of the narrative. The game captures the anxiety of managing online relationships, and I found myself juggling various friendships and dealing with conflicts. It's like defusing a bomb, trying not to make a wrong move that could break a friendship.\n\nWhat struck me the most was how my choices shaped the story and reflected back on the nature of my own online persona. It made me realize how carefully we curate our words and how easy it is to lose sight of our true selves in the digital realm.\n\nEmily is Away <3 nails the authenticity of the era. The recreation of YouTube, called \"YouToob,\" and the inclusion of cultural references and stylistic typos truly transport you back to the mid-2000s. It's a period piece that captures the escapism and culture of that time, but it might be a bit alienating if you didn't experience it firsthand.\n\nThe game's commitment to linguistic authenticity and the nostalgia it evokes make it a unique and sometimes cringeworthy experience. But that's what makes it so special. It's an embarrassing journey that celebrates the awkwardness of our digital interactions.

i'll be honest, the first time i played i was disappointed that no matter what my first playthrough was doomed to fail. that my relationship with the little pixel on my screen was doomed to crash and burn no matter how much i wanted to succeed. i was going to play again to get a better outcome, but then i realized i could only do it with my not favorite girl.. which is okay.. but it turned me off from replaying it so soon. it took me. and i'm not kidding. a year to pick this back up again, but now that i've played it again (and i'm sorry to the dev to reveal that i cheated to be on the right track to be with the girl i preferred <ev3) and completed the good ending i've gained some new perspective. \n\ni feel like coming back to it and revisiting the game and its characters the story felt more close to home for me. thinking about how the first playthrough is meant to fail leaves me with this thought: sometimes things in life just don't go your way. and there's nothing you can do about it. like with mat, he loved kelly very much but that didn't change the fact that they had grown to be too different and no longer compatible. but he still got a happy ending, just not the one he was expecting. i kind of felt like coming back i also got to have that. i don't know maybe i'm thinking/looking too deep into it, but i guess that's what i like so much about these games. i get to immerse myself in this little online world and forget about the real world for a bit. i get to socialize with these fleshed out characters and live a virtual life with them for a while. as an entry in the emily is away series i feel like this one has a lot of little details and content to explore and enjoy. i like finding the websites, the notes and the playlists. the photos the characters post. i've always been fascinated by the way EIA3 tells a story through social media.\n\nin the next entry i think it would be really cool to have an instagram, or maybe an online clothing store to choose what to wear for certain events. maybe a spotify to make your own playlists for the other characters. there's a lot you can do with this format and if there's another entry in the series i'd love to play it. thank you for making such wonderful, immersive games!", "timestamp_created": 1686348262, "timestamp_updated": 1686348262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63252943754196167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139670378": {"recommendationid": "139670378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409411459", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1686107861}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really fascinating game. Just like the previous two games, the way that it builds rapport between you and the other characters is so interesting, delightful, and heartbreaking at times. The Facenook (basically Facebook) UI built into the game felt super authentic to the classic late 2000's. Even the webpages (these are REAL webpages that open up in your browser), even thought they're pixellated to high hell, teleports you back to the glory days of YouTube in 2008. I thought that the inclusion of Facenook as the main social media service was really clever, bringing in poking and giving pictures to all of your friends (and enemies) that you either chose to make or break in the game. Adding pictures for all of the characters and visually displaying the events with you and your friends that are discussed in the private chats drastically improves the immersion, unlike the previous two games.\n\nIf you want a game that will make you face tough moral and social decisions naturally in a late 2000's internet-style setting, then this game (alongside the previous two games) will be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1686108484, "timestamp_updated": 1686108484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139636544": {"recommendationid": "139636544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101197602", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1638933610}, "language": "english", "review": "Big Yes", "timestamp_created": 1686054540, "timestamp_updated": 1686054540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139616323": {"recommendationid": "139616323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817676290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1685939384}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely game!

For one, the choice about who you date happens really early... Like, you don't even know that's what you're choosing kind of early, so it actually just feels like you're being forced into a decision you didn't even know you had made. A lot of the choices you have for dialogue tend to feel like the same thing in the list you pick, but once typed out in full are drastically different vibes than you may have thought and you can't go back. If you were able to go back and pick a different option after seeing the message that would, in my opinion, be a lot better. The chapters are also long, and honestly sometimes really boring. There are times where you're stuck in a conversation that is kind of pointless and not interesting, but all the choices for dialogue are the same so you can't really do anything about it. \nFinally, and this is fully personal opinion, I would have broken up with my partner wayyyyy sooner if given the option. Or at least tried to communicate way sooner. \n\nI'm just generally not tempted to go back and play any other storylines, and for that I can't recommend this game.

All the music they listen to? not my taste at all (I barely noticed some good stuff like Phoenix, but that is mostly it - pretty poor quality in general, though that is a subjective assessment more relevant to aesthetics analysis). The way they write, sms style, swearing every sentence, typing as if they go through a seizzzzurre each line, forgetting capital letters, punctuation, etc? miles away from my habits, I never understood that thing. Their school culture, prom, graduating, college, all that? from a country very differing from mine. And finally their mentality, bored teenagers, going to the mall, binging on alcohol, partying, grounded by parents, flirting with each other like rabbits... I always hated that as a teenager, and I did not get a tender look on that either as a grown up dad.\nSo what is left? Well, I had more hopes for the gameplay (with the web interface and all) but it all comes down to a very, very basic visual novel (say something, choose ABC, say something, choose ABC, etc) and choices do not seem to matter that much - the arborescence of choices feels pretty apparent, sometimes it is clumsy how the dev wants you to go a certain way. I also felt the dialogues were not very distinct from each other, like they all speak rather similarly, I would have hoped for the dev to ask a writer to model more distinctive dialogues to create more distinctive personalities. As of now, your girlfriend speaks like your best (male) friend who speaks like your other punk (female) friend who speaks like... a hiphop singer? It did not feel super immersive.\nSo after all, it could sound as if I only give negative impression, but after playing for a day on this game... it still made me feel a bit nostalgic about my own teenage past, about relationships through internet, and almost (almost) caring for the few characters K. Seeley invented. And making this game (caution: spoiler) [spoiler]not an actual dating sim but a breaking up sim[/spoiler] is a very unique take on the genre, with a different, melancholic tone, and that is to be praised. The effort is notable (all the fake facebook, the notifications, etc) and many people will find their adolescence back for a couple of hours with this game, so I guess that explains why so many positive reviews. I just wish there was more game than that, more in-depth writing and more stuff I could relate to - but on a \"human experience\" point of view, he still touches basic stuff from our teenage life, so I guess there is that. An interesting little game you might want to check out (I have not played his two previous (free!) games).", "timestamp_created": 1676624452, "timestamp_updated": 1676624452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490727484226226807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132997369": {"recommendationid": "132997369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887038156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 631, "last_played": 1676589688}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, I don't expect it to be over here just yet!", "timestamp_created": 1676589032, "timestamp_updated": 1676589032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495357662439346313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132942119": {"recommendationid": "132942119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029759219", "num_games_owned": 1776, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1676511840}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically, Brethren Before Wenches\nMat is MVP", "timestamp_created": 1676511959, "timestamp_updated": 1676511959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523459792137145996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132878323": {"recommendationid": "132878323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198811114019", "num_games_owned": 13370, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1676440367}, "language": "english", "review": "There are a few things you cannot control in your life, hurricanes, earthquakes, and Emily is Away <3", "timestamp_created": 1676440539, "timestamp_updated": 1676440539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562015056610107422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132803584": {"recommendationid": "132803584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441623024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1700127054}, "language": "english", "review": "I rizzed up a girl! just to realize IRL I have no experience talking to women!

And I'm not even sure what happens if I DO tell her she needs to cut him off.  I didn't bother to waste my time and go back to find out.  Does that make my relationship better?  If it does, that's not healthy, and if it doesn't...that's...also bad game-play because then your choices wouldn't even matter?

I like the old Facebook layout with pokes and status updates and chatting with your friends and the way it makes you feel like you're getting to know everyone.

The characters are again very one note, with very few distinguishable character traits, with the differences between the two love interests being pretty much just aesthetic. Again, much like the previous game, the characters acted like they were middle school rather than their senior year of high school. The dialogue was incredibly frustrating as the love interest would get mad at you for little things over seemingly no reason. Even if you encourage her to make amends with her past friends and make new friends in her classes, she will later say that you don't want her to have friends and are manipulative, when in reality all you want is for her to not cheat on you, and despite her claims of not cheating (even though cheating to her only means not sleeping with the person), goes on to date the guy she was cheating on you with. In the final chapter, the conversation with your now ex is very frustrating as she continues to act like you were in the wrong to be suspicious of her relationship with her \"friend\" and seemingly tries to get back with you while she has a boyfriend. By the end of the game, you are left with virtually no one on your side as everyone sees you as manipulative for not wanting to be cheated on, which left me so frustrated. The game maybe could have been actually good or at least better, if the characters actually had any personality because then at least, the issues coming up would make sense and leave you frustrated in a meaningful way. \n", "timestamp_created": 1675127720, "timestamp_updated": 1675127720, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663154184818267822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131897754": {"recommendationid": "131897754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965485500", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1673635889}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game", "timestamp_created": 1675119443, "timestamp_updated": 1675119443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131890834": {"recommendationid": "131890834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009388102", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1676261904}, "language": "english", "review": "Emily is Away <3 has changed so drastically since the first game.

I graduated from high school the same year as the characters in this game, so the nostalgia hits hard, and the developer did a great job at recreating Facebook and the internet in general from that time period. Everything from the music, to the kind of stuff that people were posting about on Facebook, even the dialog in the chat felt like stuff that I would have said or seen. Also, the characters feel quite real. They hook you in and get you invested in the story.\n\nThe problem that I have with it has more to do with the story structure, and can't be gone into without major spoilers. Suffice to say, nothing you say or do matters, other than at the very beginning when you choose which party to go to. After playing through the story, it felt very unsatisfying, I read a bit more about the game (specifically the community guide by Steam user Ark) and actually got a little mad once I understood how it works.\n\nSo in summary, if you were in high school in 2009 and want four hours of mopey nostalgia, it might be worth picking this game up on a discount. But don't expect to enjoy it very much, and don't believe the top user tag, which is \"choices matter\" or the developer's description where it says: \"Emily <3 features multiple branching paths, unique conversations and different endings.

It is too short for the listed price in my currency, and there are just better written visual novels worth the same.\n--> It's a multiple choice game on which you cannot, no matter what you choose, to get a good ending on the first run. That's my main problem with it: When you do your first run with one of the girls, you will get the bad ending no matter what and unlock the good ending with the other one. That means that if you have a preferred character you have to play the game 3 effin times to get a good ending with them. I only did my first run and it was a little frustrating to feel that even though i did everything right it didn't matter one bit. So i recommend you find your fav and play a run with the other one first.\n--> the writing is good but replaying the same run makes it really repetitive, which sucks if you HAVE to replay it at least once with the same person to get a good ending.\n\n\nthe good\n--> The visuals of it are amazing and it is really immersive to jump back in 2008. The music and the YouTube layout from the links and the quizzes make it a super fun journey down through memory lane. I recommend taking an hour to play it and like, deep dive in it for each chapter.\n--> The writing is fun, and the characters are supper compelling, which is just what drove this towards a thumbs up game. The drama is well developed and the conversations are wholesome and nice.\n\n\nAnyway. That's that. I recommend it if you like visual novels, i recommend if you see it with a nice discount, and i recommend it if you liked the previous 2, as it is way better then what came before :]", "timestamp_created": 1673885694, "timestamp_updated": 1676852663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130963731": {"recommendationid": "130963731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000739173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1674105249}, "language": "english", "review": "Emily is the nastiest skank b*tch I\u2019ve ever met.

I do wonder what people think of these games who didn't go through it firsthand?\nThe game does have a fair bit of nostalgia (the pull/crux of the series, along with navigating relationships to a point) but this game has a really questionable choice of mechanics:\n\n1) You cannot get a 'good' ending on your first playthrough, there's a coded switch to only offer that on your second relationship goal/2nd save. Play as kindly or realistically as you like, you'll still get the a short straw til you try again. That's not satisfying, that's forcing replays :P \n\n2) It misses a lot of the nuance earlier titles had and feels a bit shorter but equally drawn out (awkward pacing). Choices don't really matter until chapter 4 which decides the ending, then chapter 5's choices the subending and in typical fashion, characters do some nonsensical illogical things based on their wild teenage emotions and you need to stay grounded or be swept up in it lol\n \n3) You always have to justify your choices, especially if you want to feel like you've not just been interrogated by the NPCs who have themselves lead you down a path. You are once again playing emotional tugofwar with an NPC who always starts off open and excitable and can rip the carpet from under you - the female characters in these games are written to have serious personality disorders lol  It's amusing that these games enjoy imitating the social dysfunction of mid 2000 preadults (forgive us) but it's not always exactly an enjoyable experience as a game haha\n\n4) The switch to 'facenook' doesn't carry the same impact as AIM (and being 'away'). Surprised they didn't go with MSN as that was more the bridge between AIM and Facebook.

It evokes those feelings of \"first love\" if you've experienced it. I found myself grinning like an idiot through a lot of the dialogue.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend it due to a certain game mechanic. \n\nTLDR: Spoilers, your choices do not actually matter.\n\n[spoiler] It is IMPOSSIBLE to get the good ending on your first playthrough. It's in the game's code. No matter what you say, it will lock you into a bad ending. I feel this is completely misleading as the game advertises it self as \"Emily <3 features multiple branching paths, unique conversations and different endings. All of them depending on the choices you make.\" If the game locks you into a bad ending, your choices simply do not matter. In order to get the good ending, you must play through the entire game twice, getting the bad ending for each girl. I simply did not have the motivation to play through it a second time to get the good ending.\n\nI find this problematic as the player is left feeling either too controlling/manipulative, or too relaxed and careless. I've lived through this exact experience, and know that it's better to not be controlling/manipulative. I feel that if the player has the presence of mind to recognize this, they should be rewarded. I fear the young, inexperienced gamer may make the correct choices, get negative-feedback from this game, leading to them being controlling/manipulative in their real life relationships. \n  [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1672788107, "timestamp_updated": 1672788107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773283660411834717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130049005": {"recommendationid": "130049005", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091496840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1673053264}, "language": "english", "review": "dont be fooled by my play time i was afk for most of it\nthis was so fucking boring jesus christ", "timestamp_created": 1672772465, "timestamp_updated": 1672772465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48197522759437561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130040529": {"recommendationid": "130040529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121674698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1662150234}, "language": "english", "review": "---------------------------------------------------------------\nFACEBOOK FRIEND PRANK **GONE WRONG**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nLikes: +1 / Dislikes: -3", "timestamp_created": 1672764698, "timestamp_updated": 1672764698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130034952": {"recommendationid": "130034952", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036154627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1673550914}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ojal\u00e1 me muera !", "timestamp_created": 1672759720, "timestamp_updated": 1672759720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130017968": {"recommendationid": "130017968", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186414297", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1672741873}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent 3rd title for the Emily is Away series. It was great being introduced to the new social media of Facenook and being moved away from AIM.\n\nThe design of the game is great \u2013 has the same looks of the early days of Facebook and the story is probably the best out of the 3 games. However, it felt very much the same as the previous 2 games.\n\nThe story is very gripping, and I ended up playing through all the endings (mainly to get the achievement but also to experience all the different stories) and the writing is fabulous. However, even though there are two different characters in the game, both share the same dialogue. So even though the writing is great, it did feel a bit repetitive at times even though I waited  6 months between playing the game through the first play through and the second. And since I had played the last 2 games, it was very predictable as to what was going to happen next.\n\nI also found it disappointing that during the first play through, it is impossible to get a good ending. You can only achieve this after you have played through the game once before.\n\nThe game can run on any laptop or PC made within the last 10 years which is great as anyone can play it however, I think the price tag of the game is a bit steep. I think if you can pick up the game whilst it\u2019s on sale then it\u2019s worth it, especially if you\u2019ve played through the last 2 games. (You don\u2019t need to have played the last two games to understand what\u2019s going on)\n\nOverall, I think this is still a good game to pick up, especially during a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1672743112, "timestamp_updated": 1672743112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130006367": {"recommendationid": "130006367", "author": {"steamid": "76561199447341596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 556, "last_played": 1676063440}, "language": "english", "review": "l", "timestamp_created": 1672728616, "timestamp_updated": 1672728616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129992098": {"recommendationid": "129992098", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091441285", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1673122843}, "language": "english", "review": "good\n", "timestamp_created": 1672711470, "timestamp_updated": 1672711470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129991463": {"recommendationid": "129991463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073384091", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1673296359}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm so fucking heartbroken", "timestamp_created": 1672710783, "timestamp_updated": 1672805583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129985931": {"recommendationid": "129985931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117512949", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 680, "last_played": 1672707469}, "language": "english", "review": "fu em", "timestamp_created": 1672704906, "timestamp_updated": 1672704906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129984809": {"recommendationid": "129984809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203445066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1672703389}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a game that's fun, addictive and lures you into the drama then this is it :) I've only gotten two of the endings but it has been SO fun so far!!", "timestamp_created": 1672703747, "timestamp_updated": 1672703747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129978655": {"recommendationid": "129978655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832400890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1672697706}, "language": "english", "review": "it was a cute nostalgic game! just as frustrating as real life :DDDDD", "timestamp_created": 1672697739, "timestamp_updated": 1672697739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129978034": {"recommendationid": "129978034", "author": {"steamid": "76561199093727190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1672697095}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorites!

[spoiler] Something seemed off in the final dialogue. I had played the game making what I felt were \"good\" choices to keep pretty much everyone happy and sane and the dialogue at the end seemed to reinforce that... until Emily went off the rails on me no matter what I said and I then got a slightly-bad ending. Come to find out, you can't get a good ending on the first playthrough at all, even if you make all good choices. You can only get it the 2nd time you play. This felt supremely shitty to me, why make all of my choices irrelevant in the end? Went to go play again and choose Evelyn this time, only to then find out Emily and Evelyn are virtually the same character with almost no difference in dialogue. They just like different music. You expect me to play again to get a good ending, but there's literally nothing different?? No thanks.

The game requires you to play at least twice for the true ending, or five times for all endings, but the girls in the game are exact copies of each other.

Whilst I was initially excited to see a browser integrated into the game, and expected that external links have been incorporated within the game, unfortunately that was not the case; however, I have come to the realisation this likely has to be due to the omnipresent enigma that is copyright law. Provided this is the case, then that can be forgiven, but then my question becomes: Why not also create stylised derivations as was done for the rest of the game?\n\nIt pains me to say that although the gameplay itself was more enjoyable than the previous two games, this one was by far my least favourite of the trilogy due to its blatant disregard for my decisions during the first playthrough. It cannot be emphasised enough how distressed it made me.\n\nThe narrative also seemed to have regressed by being more heavy-handed than even the first game. My choices felt far more limited as if I was being told a story rather than being part of one, which is not in the spirit of games of this genre. As I continued to progress, I consciously found myself making decisions purely in the hopes that it would reroute the course I was being forcibly steered into rather than ones that would lead me in the direction I preferred. By the time I had finished the game, I was relieved it was over.\n\nTimed events have been removed which I believe was the right decision, especially as we were introduced to an even more complex interface with many pages to shuffle though. As such, the type-assist accessibility option was utilised; however, the settings menu ever continues to lack an audio volume slider. The controls are exactly as you would expect from the previous two games.\n\nWhilst I cannot honestly claim that it is a bad game altogether as there are certainly many players who will and do relate to the narrative far better than I possibly could, I simply cannot recommend it. It is not for me but I do look forward to the next installment in the franchise.\n\nFollow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43277557-Swyllikx/]curator page[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1670409817, "timestamp_updated": 1671608901, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128086343": {"recommendationid": "128086343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198663473", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1670393244}, "language": "english", "review": "break up sim", "timestamp_created": 1670393514, "timestamp_updated": 1670393514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615692317485809326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128080391": {"recommendationid": "128080391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051840032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1670382742}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok listen...So I was trying to get rid off that crazy, clingy Emily chick for at least 2-3 hours and still we got \"together\" altough I tried to be mean to her...like wtf? xD And in the end that dumb girl ditched me and the game just ended just before my good mate Mat, who I tried to get into me, visits me. xD Guess that game really gives some 2008-ies vibes.\n\n\"I keep on screaming, but there\u2032s really nothing left to say.\nSo get away, just get away!\" - Hollywood Undead - Sell your Soul :'D", "timestamp_created": 1670383528, "timestamp_updated": 1670383528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620883345603942871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128018064": {"recommendationid": "128018064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970929163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1670829844}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent a day playing this game.

Promise me, I wanna stress that I love this series, but I can't give it a positive due to one single problem. \n\nI'll start with the good aspects of the game since the main focus of this review is on the negatives. The game has more \"innovation\" compared to the first and second games. You can see in the first game, you are only limited to the chat box, the second game has TWO girls (not one!) and utilizes \"links\" that use your own browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc), but you're stuck in only sites that a character like Evelyn or Emily gives you. Which worked fine IMO, as the game doesn't need that much immersive action. However, this third one utilizes an \"in-game\" browser browse Facenook (a 2008 version of Facebook) but still uses your browser for other sites like YouToob. Other features included that more characters will come up and chatting with you (you can only chat with Evelyn or Emily in the second). Some notable character you'll talk about is your best friend Mat and his girlfriend, Kelly. There's not much else different from the other games that I can note.\n\nNow the negatives, which I hate to say this. The main issue with this game is that [b]Emily and Evelyn are exactly the same[/b]. Like legit exact. Notice in the game's achievement, there is an \"All endings\" achievement. At the time of writing this, it sits around 1.5%. If you're a completionist, prepare for a boring grind for you. Most of the game's dialogue is the same word for word. A scenario happening with Evelyn, even if it's minor and forgettable, will occur with Emily as well in some way. One of the most evident examples of this is their (as in Emily or Evelyn) \"baby\" is somehow dead, which the character learns is that it was their iPod and you are actually their \"babe.\" Here's a couple lines from that scene, \n\n\n\"<33\"\n\"what! oh noo :(\"\n\"I just tried to turn on baby and its deadd.\"\n\nEmily or Evelyn will say this word for word in the game with *barely* any changes at all. Most of Seeley's changes for the dialogue are just reworded to \"fit\" their type of personality. Their profiles clearly shows the difference, so there are not a identical one-for-one copy. But the dialogues sometimes make them indistinguishable at all.\n\nDespite all this, it's shown that in the second game, the dialogue wasn't worded for word. Evelyn is a punk who rebels and is all in it, while Emily is a shy person who seems to be taking her life slowly. They talk about the same things in the game but approach it differently. Emily and Evelyn have other plans for their future after college, and what their favorite music is. None of that is shown in this game. This goes back to the achievement I was talking about. If you're trying to aim for 100%, you're gonna repeat playing this game a lot with the same dialogue and repeating dating the same girl, almost like a chore.\n\nAnother big one is the ending. (spoilers) [spoiler]Your first ending to the game will always be doomed as the character you choose will always leave you, and the second ending may be a good one as long as you do everything right like a nice guy. I'm fine with that, as long there's replayability. It makes it more different compared to Emily is Away Too where people called it \"the game where you break up for lying about your favorite song\" due to how you can get a bad ending for just having different music choices and lying. So let's say you replay it. You picked Emily in your first run, so you wanna try Evelyn. After completing some of the chapters, it's clear that you say to yourself, \"isn't she just Emily?\" As I said in the previous paragraphs. It's a chore to repeat, even with different characters. You might even say that this paragraph is just a copy and paste from the last one but reworded to show Emily and Evelyn are the same because it all comes down to this flaw! So yes, I believe the problem in this game and why I am giving this a negative review is that it all originates from the problem. They are just the same two people. These two people are just the same. [/spoiler] If this was changed and was somehow like with the second game, I would give this game a positive review. But given how the first ending will always be, you're going to get bored on your second run.\n\nI wanna end this review to question \"why?\" This wasn't an issue in the second game, so why is it done here now? I think this is lousy, and the jump from $5 (second game) to $10 doesn't warrant this. The Emily Is Away series have a unique storytelling and there's so much potential to it, but it always fall short on one part.", "timestamp_created": 1669609609, "timestamp_updated": 1671901532, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785773873329162598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127305967": {"recommendationid": "127305967", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181589347", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1669602450}, "language": "english", "review": "ok", "timestamp_created": 1669590105, "timestamp_updated": 1669590105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127295356": {"recommendationid": "127295356", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198634698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 891, "last_played": 1670646529}, "language": "english", "review": "we say our goodbyes over messenger as the network overloads", "timestamp_created": 1669584424, "timestamp_updated": 1669584424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127291146": {"recommendationid": "127291146", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121898922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1669606931}, "language": "english", "review": "really good", "timestamp_created": 1669582282, "timestamp_updated": 1669582282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127134762": {"recommendationid": "127134762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037988227", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1669511597}, "language": "english", "review": "Emily is Away <3 is the third installment of the Emily is Away series and is (Minor spoilers)[spoiler] the third time a girl named Emily broke my heart. [/spoiler] \n\nThe game functions similar to visual novels where the story progresses linearly as you make choice dialogues when chatting to certain characters. Unlike the previous installments of the Emily is Away series, this game mimic the early age of Facebook rather than mimicking AIM/ AOL instant messaging. If you grew up around this era of the internet, it is certainly to take you on a nostalgic trip. \n\nNow the meat of the game is the interactive story and characters you talk to on Facenook (The in game version of Facebook). The characters you interact with all have their charms and personality that honestly replicate the feeling of chat messaging someone very well. Given that you can only send pre-determined messages that lead to pre-determined responses, it still works very well in making you feel like you're going through your final years of high school again.\n\nThis rings especially true when interacting with one of the main love interests, either Emily or Evelyn. As you progress through the game, you will progress (and even move backwards) with your relationship with them. The writing feels and flow very naturally, adding that extra layer of immersion that make you question if you're also starting to get attached to your choice girl. Because of this, this game can also create very real feelings in later parts of the games. You'll start feeling jealous yourself, heart broken, petty, irrational, all of this thing just as well as it makes you feel happy, content, butterflies, heart racing in the beginning of the game.\n\nThe only main criticism I have of the game is that Evelyn and Emily's personality seemingly merge after Chapter 1 which is a shame considering how different the two girls are. That and the [spoiler] Good ending is locked behind a second playthrough. I understand why you would want the player to experience heartache in the first playthrough as it leave a much more emotional impact but I wish that it was easier reaching the good ending without replaying the game. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a emotionally driven narrative and some nostalgia on the side, I highly recommend this game. Fans of the series will already know what to expect but newcomers can enjoy this just as much. The price tag of $10 is perfectly reasonable for a game of 4 hours with this much emotional impact but if you must, get it on sale.

This is a slice-of-life game where you talk to your character's friends during their Senior year of High School. The dialogue with friends (which seems to be the whole game) is dull the say the least. I was expecting more drama, unexpected events, and a choice between a quicker or slower-paced run. \n\nThe whole first chapter is simply just picking whose party to go to and that in itself took nearly thirty minutes (each chapter seems to be about 30 minutes but feels like 60). While playing my first run, I just wanted to pick one of the options within five minutes but instead, I had to read through the terrible dialogue. Which is the main issue...a game relying solely on dialogue...should have decent storytelling. Yes, the game does hit you with some nostalgia and memories of when Facebook was first invented but that isn't enough for people to have to read through the terrible dialogue. I found myself just picking options and just trying to get through the chapter because I found many conversations to be so uninteresting and seemingly never-ending. It's not very comforting that I am already skipping dialogue in the first two chapters when the whole game in itself is reliant on your responses. It would help if I could manually save the game instead of forcing myself to go through conversations that may end up being lengthy. \n\nI don't think this is a game for most people due to the simple storytelling but it's definitely unique and good for the sake of walking down memory lane for people who grew up during the Facebook era.\n\nLastly!!

Super nostalgic throwback for anyone who was in high school when Facebook was the hottest thing on the block. Everything from the UI down to the social interactions is dead on perfect. Characters and dialogue were well written and believable, and I found myself quickly investing in the story and the people involved.\n\nI'm torn about recommending this game. On the one hand, the nostalgic throwback was enjoyable, the writing and the characters have a lot going for it. But on the other hand, there's a huge problem with the inherent game design.\n\nThe game forces you to play it twice to get a good ending. There are two romantic interests, and whoever you go with on your first playthrough, you are predetermined to fail your relationship with her regardless of your choices, and on your second, you can only succeed with the other. Which means, if you want to to succeed with your preferred girl, you have to either: 1) know a head of time to do your first playthrough with the character you're less interested in (or not at all interested); or 2) edit your save file after completing the first playthrough. (Save file editing is only an option if you made the correct set of choices on your first playthrough, as far as I'm aware. If you didn't, then good luck, you have to actually play through it again.) I went into the game blind, as I do all games that I don't want spoilers for, and was thus left feeling very defeated despite knowing that I was as decent a human being as I could have possibly been. Realizing (after looking at ending guides) that I could edit my safe file to get the ending that I believe I deserved completely destroyed the immersion and impact of the game.\n\nFor a game that presents itself as a choice-based narrative, and one that emphasizes the themes of being a decent human--not gaslighting or emotionally manipulating people--the game design itself is extremely manipulative by rendering choices meaningless. A player who behaved like a good, moral human being should be awarded for their good behaviour. But no, the morally decent player gets gaslit by the love interest--and by extension, the game designers.\n\nI really want to recommend this game. I really do, especially because it's such a polished nostalgic gem. But Steam only has a \"yes/no\" option, so it'll have to be a \"no\" because the forced ending problem is entirely contrary to the game's core message and design philosophy. That said, I probably will still recommend it to people who would enjoy a throwback trip to 2008 with a VN-style dating sim, but I'd also preface my recommendation with the huge caveat as noted above, even at the expense of somewhat spoiling the ends.", "timestamp_created": 1666068662, "timestamp_updated": 1666068662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528363406658172607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123988536": {"recommendationid": "123988536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993770120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1666039498}, "language": "english", "review": "played with your emotions by making your choices not mather aparently", "timestamp_created": 1666039488, "timestamp_updated": 1666039488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502319514751434326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123945415": {"recommendationid": "123945415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452595569", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1665956094}, "language": "english", "review": "This made me not want to play any other game in this series", "timestamp_created": 1665953901, "timestamp_updated": 1665953901, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548452258110046387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123887238": {"recommendationid": "123887238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292028865", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1674536528}, "language": "english", "review": "And the food was bussin", "timestamp_created": 1665864338, "timestamp_updated": 1665864338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494981765747070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123856172": {"recommendationid": "123856172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120999825", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1665820500}, "language": "english", "review": "she was not girlfrann\n\nsteve is d!ckbagel\n\ndeuces", "timestamp_created": 1665821326, "timestamp_updated": 1665821420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636448144912719727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123848261": {"recommendationid": "123848261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038683088", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1665805244}, "language": "english", "review": "Really clever and impressive 2008 facebook simulator that actually made me feel like I was in my high school bedroom, chatting with friends on my old computer.

It made me question my choices and I had a fun time looking at the little details like the music libraries. Mat is a fucking great dood too. I thought I was gonna look back at this game like a fun experience because it has great story elements like how it made me regret not cancelling on Emily and going to hang out with Mat but if theyre gonna force a (bad) ending that deliberatly makes u feel like shit it is not a game I would recommend.

The whole \"facenook\" rip off thingy, has a lot of funny comments, interactions and links to other rip off websites, such as youtube with truly the most amazing 2000's music and memes. I found the conversations with characters just as cringy, as I remembered from my own, highschool life. (Wish I could just shoot myself at this point). Emily is Away <3 is for sure, \"first time, a charm\". If you're not that keen on getting the good endings, you can aswell call it a day and drop the game after completing it for the first time. I managed to complete the whole game, with every ending but, every other replay just got really more and more repetetive, dull. I was both amazed and obliterated by how my first playthrough turned out, cause it reminded me of some feelings related to my past relationship and it definitely got me thinking about mine and my ex'es actions. But other than that, both Evelyn and Emily routes, are almost the same. I still find Evelyn actually more relatable than Emily, cause for me, she has the spirit and likes the same music I enjoy, lmao. But most of the choices were basically the same in both situations. I thought I'll be able to see story behind their friendship break up from two sides, but... It wasn't explained well enough. There's for sure some wasted potential there, but I bet the future version of the game, will be an amazing thing to play. And now, I'll tell u my two, completly viable and not questionable opinions. First of all, Mat is a fking banger friend and he's truly the treasure of this game, wish I could become gay towards him at this point. And second. Evelyn>Emily. The fact Evelyn made a playlist with Rise Against made her automatically my bestie, no cap. I guess that's it. If you love to involve yourself into relationship, then suddenly break up without knowing any reason why it had happened, blaming yourself or your partner, here's your chance.

There seems to be only one or at most two critical choices that actually affect the outcome, everything else is illusion of choice. It felt like there was a spark during development but it faded away quickly, if that makes sense. On the positive side, it's quite affordable even at full price and dirt cheap on a sale so if you enjoyed the previous ones, might as well pick it up. You might like it more if you didn't play the previous games but in that case, go with Emily is Away Too.

The main difference is rather than using AOL Instant Messenger as a framing device, this one goes into the Facebook era. Much like Emily 2, this game uses a fake YouTube page to simulate the teens sharing music with each other (and honestly sometimes it seems like \"I like this genre of music\" is their main personality trait, which can be a con of sorts), along with the new addition of being able to see other people's wall posts, and doing the old cheeky survey deal that everybody and their mother used to do.\n\nThe addition of allowing the game to type for you, letting you focus on reading the story and selecting the appropriate answer was a great new feature. I get that the idea was for you to \"manually\" type the IMs to feel more involved but it rarely felt how they were hoping for it, and honestly it got tedious after several in game days of it. So being able to just focus on the characters and world was pretty welcome. Everything is designed with being authentic in mind. The teens are sappy with wall posts that are song lyrics in lue of actual communication. They spell words horrifically for somebody who should have a high school education. Presentation wise it looks like you're in the era.\n\nAnd as a story? It's an enjoyable journey. It's essentially a high school drama simulator, and it does it well. The fact you're also messaging side characters, such as your best friend in addition to the potential main relationship (one or two girls) also helps make it all feel more real. The bad part is after three separate games, it does get a bit old when we go back to the well of \"well we have to BS a reason for the seemingly happy relationship to go to hell\" for the third time. But, to be fair a lot of relationships go to die in the transition from high school to college so I can't give them too much crap for the repetitive nature of the series storytelling.\n\nIf you like little \"slice of life\" kinda games, this is worth a run through. That being said, if there's an Emily 4 I'm not sure I'd necessarily rush into buying it, expecting roughly the same overall story and ending for a fourth time in a row.

It does an excellent job of building up these parasocial relationships--completely virtual--and making you feel attached to the no-faced characters of this game. I do also like the way the characters are represented! Each distinct person is given a different-colored silhouette, making them identifiable, but not setting their features in stone. You can project whoever you want onto them!\n\nMy main problem with \"Emily is Away <3\" comes in the story's messaging during the final chapters of the game; specifically Chapter 4 and 5 (the game only has five chapters). Spoilers ahead, so read with caution if you have yet to actually play the game:\n[spoiler]I have quite an issue with the way the whole ending chapters of 4 and 5 are framed. The messaging it gives off--especially to younger high-school or middle-school aged children who could be new to relationships--is very alarming. For context: your girlfriend of choice in the game (either Emily or Evelyn) at some point becomes acquainted with a guy named Jeff/Steve (respectively). Jeff/Steve are going through some mental health issues, and your girlfriend gets closer with them through helping them. If you give your girlfriend the benefit of the doubt, she will eventually get so close to him that he convinces her to break up with you, and it is heavily suggested that she cheats on you with him. The lesson of the story here? Completely doubt your girlfriend, snoop on her friend's private profiles, intimidate him, and then question your girlfriend about it over and over. Every time she says that the conversation is making her uncomfortable, or she wants to stop, you simply have to keep on pushing and insist on having this conversation. Yes, seriously, that is what the game wants you to do. If you do this, suspect her, and convince her to drop her friends, you two stay together. If not, she breaks up with you. While, yes, this could very well be a real-life scenario, the messaging it gives of doubting your significant other, and having to question their loyalty and practically force them to follow your rules, is a bit odd.[/spoiler]\n\nBut that's just a complaint with the story. Besides that, I heavily enjoyed this game. I really love the touch of the characters sending you to an old 2000's version of YouTube, with real-life references, music, and memes from the era. Really takes you back! If you have a hard time socializing in real life, or want to have the typical \"HS experiences\" that you missed out on or are too afraid to have in-person, I highly recommend this game!

Otherwise, it's a good story about high school romance and how those relationships shape up to be.", "timestamp_created": 1660794468, "timestamp_updated": 1660794468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120815689": {"recommendationid": "120815689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199249219623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1662673521}, "language": "english", "review": "My Poor Broken Dreams :(((((", "timestamp_created": 1660793453, "timestamp_updated": 1660793453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120788319": {"recommendationid": "120788319", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096221046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1673856826}, "language": "english", "review": "boring and i cant continiuefrom where i left off", "timestamp_created": 1660751054, "timestamp_updated": 1660751054, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120787146": {"recommendationid": "120787146", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971975111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1660764537}, "language": "english", "review": "Its disturbing how much of a throwback this game is... getting more flashbacks than a vietnam war veteran here...\nrecomended for the OG peeps who were on facebook back in 2008", "timestamp_created": 1660749517, "timestamp_updated": 1660749517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120768153": {"recommendationid": "120768153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020003877", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1660717652}, "language": "english", "review": "The idea for the story seems very generic but the execution really elevates this experience. Everything is told through Facenook, a social media website similar to its real-life counterpart. \n\t\nBy creating this atmosphere for the game, it did a really good job of taking me through the way-back machine. Heck, I think I had even started my Facebook profile in 2008 around the time I left high school. There is a lot here that was a blast from the past from the back and forth with the different IMs, the pokes, the music, etc.\n\nI felt the writing did a good job to convey this high schooler mentality and the exchanges with the other characters felt realistic. I can't say I was a fan of how to get the different endings mainly because a lot of it will be replaying similar scenes. And you're locked out of getting the ending that you want unless you take the other path. For myself, I just went and edited the save file because I wasn't interested in playing it any longer than that.\n\nThat aside, it's a good game to play through at least once.

Being a spiritual successor, it's a brand new narrative with new characters and new endings to be reached. Like previous games, you use dialogue decisions to choose your path in the story.

I liked that [spoiler] LGB representation is available but you can either be a straight male or a lesbian.

Why does that matter if the person you pour attention, love, respect and admiration into starts to feel that the two of you have grown apart, even if you don't feel that way yourself? I'm serious, this series makes me feel this way because, while there are 'happy' endings where you end up with Emily, it's practically impossible without limiting your significant other and forcing her to convert to your skewed way of thinking, and is that really fair to the other person in the first place? What does getting the happy ending even mean if I've meddled and coerced the person I supposedly love into thinking she feels more strongly than she really does? At what point is it fair to myself to trudge through the sad reality that the person I'm in love with just wants something simpler than what we are, and why punish myself mentally and emotionally for that if it means we'll both just be unhappy, EVEN IF there's ever a chance that we could work things out and grow, if in the end it's all forced and not real?\n\n[b]And that's where this game comes with a lesson for me.[/b]\n\nIt's easy to say that Emily/Evelyn is a terrible partner because, in the more common of these endings, it ends up not being anything you or they did, but moreso the sad reality that, sometimes, people change. They move on, their feelings change as time goes on and sometimes, sadly, people just [i]grow apart.[/i]\n\nEmily is Away <3 is, in my opinion, a great way to teach people that sometimes things just can't work out regardless if you love each other and that sometimes in life, it's better for everyone to cut off the wound and let time heal all, and I think the happier of the endings is a way for people to feel like they've fulfilled certain things and truly beaten the game, though who cares what I say, it's ultimately up to how people interpret these things themselves and I can't tell you what this game should mean to you, that's up to you to play it for yourself and take your own thoughts away.\n\nDo I think you should play the Emily is Away series, let alone this one? [b]Yes.[/b] \n\nI think this game sort of helped me understand that in life, things aren't always just perfect moments without consequence where things can work out because the love you have for your partner is strong, because sadly it may not be that way for both parties and it's harder than just talking it out and coming to a root cause. \n\nIt really is a great game in that regard. all the 2008 musings and stylings of the early internet aside, (and I really do give credit to that aspect of the game, it's really a nostalgic and beautiful call back to those days of Hotmail, AOL, and Facebook in the late 2000's) I think this game teaches really interesting messages to those that have the capacity and want to hear them.\n\nGoodbye, Emily.\n", "timestamp_created": 1657011005, "timestamp_updated": 1657011005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118244627": {"recommendationid": "118244627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061024140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1657194876}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game to play and get immersed in.

The first one will be awesome if you want to \"relive\" the past, the second playthrough will just take away even the first ones good feelings. It became repetitive and while I felt like I'm speaking to a real person on the first run, the second ruined this feeling.\n\n---\n\nI absolutely adore this game, even with its mistakes.\n\nWhat I love the most about it, is that it managed to bring back feelings from the past, I never thought I would feel again he tension of choosing the good words to woo the girl, the teen dramas that -I think- everybody experienced in some way or another and even the cringe how I used to talk as a teenager. \n\nOverall for a first playthrough, it's really an emotional amusement park. Not so much for the second though, but I'll get back to this later.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is that I learned, you can't have the happiest ending for the first playthrough. While I understand the notion behind this (even if you do everything correctly, a relationship might just end), I still felt cheated. I replayed the last chapters 2 times to see if I can change the outcome, but it just didn't happen. After getting more and more frustrated, I decided to look up if there is even a \"best ending\" and that's when I learned, I would have to start again a new \"campaign\". That means if I want the best ending with my first chosen girl (Team Evelyn here), I would have to do EVERYTHING from the beginning. \n\nI tried starting a new campaign with choosing Emily now, so I don't have to do the same conversations, but unfortunately they were 95% the same (except for a few sentences). So I just gave up, and looked for a way to change my original playthrough save file so it registers as a second playthrough and that gave me the satisfying best ending. \n\nOverall I really recommend this game... but only for one playthrough.

series, but also the glaring flaws the game has. TL;DR, would I recommend the game? If you liked the first two Emily is Away games, I'd say a rather confident \"yes.\" However, if the story is the one thing keeping you on the fence, I can give you a rather genuine review of the story despite my own bias.\n\nEmily is Away had a wonderful story to tell of a young adult protagonist trying to confess his love to his crush. In that game, you could truly feel the tension of the protagonist, the fear of rejection, and the excitement when things went okay! It is a basic love story about a friendship you want to blossom into love, and then watching as you inevitably drift apart due to college. It really hit home for a lot of people, especially those who actually lived through the AOL Instant Messenger days.\n\nEmily is Away Too had a very similar story, but you got to grow close to either one of the characters - Emily or Evelyn - and not only was it another masterpiece of nostalgia, but also your standard dating sim with multiple choices that actually mattered.\n\nEmily is Away <3, as you may have guessed, has the exact same story. But it did not execute it as well as Emily is Away Too did. The main reason being Emily and Evelyn have no personalities of their own anymore. In Emily is Away Too, you could distinctly tell these two girls were polar opposites of each other. They had their own tastes in music, their own dreams, their own paths in life, their own ways of speaking. However, in this game, they are mere clones of one another. The only difference in dialogue you'll see when romancing one or the other is a change in name here and there. For example, my first playthrough was an Emily route. She says to the protagonist \"Hey, no byes. Never byes.\" At the time, I thought it was a super cute thing Emily had for her own character. I was rather disappointed when I quickly learned in my second playthrough on an Evelyn route that she said the exact same thing. That was when I realized these two characters have the same exact dialogue.\n\nIn Emily is Away Too, the characters were so different that even their ways of talking were specific to them. Little things like Evelyn being a bit more vulgar than Emily or Emily being a little more shy than Evelyn were what made these characters so different. That is what is severely lacking in this game. A sense of character.\n\nSo, is this game worth it?\nFor the experience of a classic Emily is Away game? I think so. The fact that it is set on Facebook caters to my childhood, so that really helped convince me to buy the game. The immersive story may be a bit lost with the game's obvious flaws, but the overall experience I'd rate a 7.5/10. However, I don't necessarily think I'd recommend this game to those who find the stories of games like this the most important part. So, buy at your own risk is my final consensus. \n\nI loved the game, I thought it was rather enjoyable and a good time waster if nothing else.

When I saw the direction the story was moving in, it triggered some major social anxiety and I haven't had the resolve to return to it since. Even though I\u2019m quite keen on this method of storytelling and found a lot to like about Emily is Away 3\u2019s presentation and narrative gameplay, I'm not particularly fond of doing polite social damage control for a cast of rather archetypal teenagers.\n\nSimply because the game told me that they were my friends, I was inorganically compelled to agree with these strangers, choose the kindest options, and play the middleman out of fear of any negative story consequences. It felt like going to a friend\u2019s party, being told all about that friend\u2019s friends on the drive there, and then talking to those mutuals yourself. You have to play it nice, nod your head a lot, and avoid taking sides because even though you know these people, you don\u2019t really \u201cknow\u201d them, ya know?\n\nPersonal tangents aside, Emily is Away 3 is logically the next chronological step in the series of retro-internet text-based romance narratives. The jump forward to 2008 means Facenook\u2122 is now the social platform of choice for this instance of Emily and Evelyn. Multi-tasking between posts and conversations on desktop social media is done with a slightly unnerving amount of authenticity. As with the other Emily is Away games, it\u2019s odd yet obvious to write a story about the concerns and relationships of young adults through the medium they would actually use for casual communication. In many ways, this is a prime example of the advantages that interactive media has over other traditional mediums. The sensation of being on the internet during that decade is captured more succinctly here than it is by simply browsing the Wayback Machine or watching ancient YouTube videos. I would\u2019ve never guessed that the original free Emily is Away would lead to a trilogy and it\u2019s been very interesting to see how the messaging software affects the stories they tell.", "timestamp_created": 1652809522, "timestamp_updated": 1652809522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115571073": {"recommendationid": "115571073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106694019", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1652747910}, "language": "english", "review": "Ayo fuck that Evelyn bitch. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1652747967, "timestamp_updated": 1652747967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115463365": {"recommendationid": "115463365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060311569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1652562517}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game for those with nostalgia for the late 2000s.

The layout of the game was a knock off of Facebook called Facenook. I will say it was incredibly accurate to how things were in 2008, messaging friends and angsty statuses were well captured. The background computer sounds were also a nice touch as they really sold the idea of using a late 2000s computer. The storyline was very \"highschoolish\". You make the choice of pursuing either Evelyn or Emily and date them throughout the school year. The dialog and the things that you interact with on Facenook really made a difference to the story. For example, Evelyn made a facenook post on my profile and I chose to ignore it, she got the memo and didn\u2019t message my character again. Dynamic interactions like that made the game fun and engaging.Overall I would rate the game 8.5/10, the only downside that I could think of is the replay value, in a second playthrough I chose to pursue Evelyn instead of Emily and found that almost the exact dialog was used for both girls.", "timestamp_created": 1651690497, "timestamp_updated": 1651690497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114932875": {"recommendationid": "114932875", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026308733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1689414987}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]What make this game make me feel something?

Teenage love stories are not my thing but the effort of bringing back the old Facebook made me stay. The characters, the plot, and the general setting are nice; even though they are a little cringeworthy, the characters are supposed to be teenagers so I cannot complain. \"youtoob.com\" and the music lists are absolutely hilarious and well done. And my first playthrough was nice enough with a bad ending. I thought \" Okay, that was sad but a good story overall. I wonder if I could have changed that outcome.\" And boy here we are:\n\nI learned that you need to play the same story AGAIN, but choose the other person as your romantic interest. Wtf? The \"good\" ending is hidden in a newgame+ mode despite the fact that you picked the acceptable answers for a \"good ending run\" in your first go? Okay fine, a little jarring, but fine. I was going to leave it at that but the supposed good ending bugged me so I restarted, chose the other character and my positive initial viewpoint of the game completely vanished in front of my eyes as I went through the EXACT SAME SCENARIO. I picked the other character, how come she is completely the same person as the green one but purple. Same feelings on disputed story arcs, same dialogue lines on most things, same anti-bye nonsense (I don't get it either, I'm too old.), same pictures (purple instead of green, yay!), almost the same \"rival\" love interest (The only difference is his name).

Otra cosa que \"Emily is Away\" hace muy bien es contagiar o hacer sentir sentimientos espec\u00edficos en el jugador, con esto me refiero a que si en dicha parte del juego hay un problema con tu pareja (sea Emily o Evelyn) vas a sentir el peso de la discusi\u00f3n, la incomodidad, el temor de que se eche todo a perder, etc. En este en especifico me parece SUPER POSITIVO y de gran valor el personaje de Mat que en el caso de mi playthrough simboliz\u00f3 perfectamente a ese amigo que esta en todas, en las buenas y en las malas, que sabe cuando vos estas mal e intenta todo para mejorar tu d\u00eda.

Emily is Away Too was a huge improvement on the formula of the first game, even adding a second choice girl, Evelyn.\nAnd in this game, both of them are back, with the addition of other friends and foes you get to chat with on the new Facenook app.\n\nBut unfortunately, not everything is as peachy as could be. Long gone are the trepidations of the original game, where you'd choose one option, yet the main character would opt out of writing it, leaving you in a state of powerlessness, which is par for the course when doing something like confessing to the girl of your dreams. And long gone are the differing storylines for the 2 main girls, Evelyn and Emily, from Emily is Away Too, which added a breath of fresh air, and an actual happy ending to the story, which were all welcome changes. But unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this sequel.\n\nThis game has 2 main stories, with a few differing aspects here and there, but in fact, if you play past the first chapter on your second playthrough, you'll find that that is actually a lie, because Emily and Evelyn's dialogues are the exact same. There is no difference in their stories whatsoever: everything single thing they both go through, and everything they say in the chats is the exact same, with the only difference being a name swap here and there.\n\nIt's quite sad to see from this team of devs that showed such promise before in the creation of their stories, and even though the game's atmosphere and world building, with fake websites that ACTUALLY work are very impressive, the story department is just very lacking.

One of which is a gameplay spoiler that I'll describe later, the other one is basically less of an emotional rollercoaster. Everything is usually going smooth and pretty predictable with almost no problems to overcome. I guess it's good on one hand, but less interesting on the other. Although if it was the only problem, I would probably enjoy it more than 2 previous games since I like this gameplay more. It's not only texting, but also interacting with people other ways even though it's really nothing much it feels more real (expecially since I've never used text messengers a lot, but somewhat more familiar with social networks).  Now about real problem and why I think it's stupid. [spoiler] As far as I know it's impossible to get good ending no matter what you do in your first playthrough. So you always get dumped, which in story really doesn't make much sense and can be described as \"teenagers sometimes can be stupid\". And in particular the ending I got was the best you can get in first playthrough and it feels uncompleted. You're taking a break with your gf and nobody knows what happens next, so you can only assume, that you broke up and it's the end. But wait, it gets worse, not only good ending doesn't have any new choices in second and further playthroughs and just ends differently for no reason, good ending only gets unlocked on the side of the DIFFERENT girl. Which mean you have to get bad ending with other girl to unlock good with the one you picked which makes zero sense. Not only most people wouldn't want to replay after getting bad ending, the ones who would want would probably replay with the same girl and get bad ending again. [/spoiler]\nSame spoiler, but TL;DR\n[spoiler] First playthrough you get dumped no matter what. It unlocks good ending with opposite girl. So if you want good ending with Emily you have to get bad with Evelyn first and vise versa. Good ending is completely the same except for the 5th chapter which is basically a result for all you did. So in good ending you can make the same choices but get a different result from the bad one [/spoiler]\nIt makes me feel very weird, especially since I think it all could be avoided pretty easily. I guess it is part of series feature by now, but imo it's even worse that was done in the first game. [spoiler] I was completely dissapointed that there was no good ending in first game. And it also looked really weird kinda like in this game in the first playthrough.[/spoiler] On the bright side, again as far as I know, unlike second game this one isn't as strict with your choices, so you can make minor mistakes here and there and it won't affect your ending.", "timestamp_created": 1649410258, "timestamp_updated": 1649410258, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113512319": {"recommendationid": "113512319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391811240", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1214, "last_played": 1674946037}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this games a couple times over and you know a valuable lesson I learned from Kelly is There REALLY isn't ANYTHING i could of done to prevent this from happening.

I'm led to believe it was because it wasn't immersive enough or something for me, but this game does immersion right.\n\nTL;DR, This game is amazing at immersion and getting you to care about the characters, your choices, and the effects of those choices", "timestamp_created": 1644918500, "timestamp_updated": 1644918500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110282423": {"recommendationid": "110282423", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133912600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 870, "last_played": 1659090108}, "language": "english", "review": "wow", "timestamp_created": 1644918324, "timestamp_updated": 1644918324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456144481897354126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110277209": {"recommendationid": "110277209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068909373", "num_games_owned": 988, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1644909208}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

However, with that out of the way, I do believe that EIA3 could have been much better than what we were given.\n\n[b] Complaints [/b]\nOne of the major complaints I have about EIA3 is how your character's actions (in this case, what you choose to say) does not really matter. There are only a select few decisions that you have to make that really impact the way the story plays out or how the characters view you. This wasn't a major issue during my first play through as you don't realize until your second run that most of your actions do not really affect things. This really made the second run of the game feel lackluster, as i knew that most of my actions didn't matter anyways.\n\nNow another complaint was that not only were you forced to only interact with Emily OR Evelyn during the course of most of the game, but both their routes were virtually the same, with a few minor changes. This REALLY killed the second run for me. I frankly barely cared about it, and I only really went through a second run because 1. [spoiler] you can only get a good ending during your second run [/spoiler] 2. I wanted to achievement hunt. \n\n[b] Bottom-line [/b]\nThis game really was fantastic and I really do hope that Emily is Away 4 is released in the near future, as I would definitely buy and play it. EIA3 was amazing despite some of its flaws, now its time to use those mistakes to make an even better experience than the last.

I Started my adventure and came across your best friend in the game, Mat, who showed me, The player, how to work the game and what its all about, I was also introduced to Mat's personal life and got a little more insight on his character, hes a rambunctious and a full of angst teenager (like most teens in 2009) (my cousin was one of them lmfao). Anyways we come to the first interactions with someone other than mat, Emily and Evelyn, and got to know a little bit about them and their characters. Then came the time to chose either going to Emily's BBQ or Evelyn's party; I replied maybe to both events (I had no idea i couldn't change it). After getting a glance throughout both of their pages I decided to go to Evelyn's party because why not it was a god damn party! That basically summed up chapter 1 for me.\n\nINITIAL THOUGHTS OF CHAPTER 1\n1. I thought it was a good introduction to the game\n2. The Characters and world building were good for being short\n3. Gave me a difficult time thinking on whose party i should attend\n4. Everything was lively there was not a bare moment\n\nAs I Continued on to chapter 2, It was the spookiest time of year October and im not going to lie i kinda cringed (not kinda A Lot) reading some of the dialogue. I also learned of Mats Halloween party and thought hell yeah Mat's cool why not! This is where the dating sim actually started in the story, Mat texts you and pulls up a photo from the party that i chose to go to and it was Evelyn's arm around and being Mat he thought there was something there (Little did he know) and that's the point where i actually started to use how i would actually feel in that situation so i play around the point that Evelyn is pretty hot. Then I learned that My character and Evelyn were already planning on \"hanging out\" at the movies. A conversation ensues eventually we admit that its a date and guess what! My character and Evelyn got into a relationship! I felt a sense of accomplishment which i barley feel from games like these (throughout the review this will be a common theme).  that's the bare bones of chapter two!\n\nINITIAL THOUGHTS OF CHAPTER 2\n1. I enjoyed how the choices of the last major selection actually impacted the story in major ways\n2. Enjoyed the conversation between my character and Mat, Evelyn as well\n3. This is the party of the story where i became emotionally invested and wanted to see more\n4. Gave a lot more insight on Evelyn and what she likes and what she doesn't like\n5. The satisfaction of the end of the chapter brought me visible happiness\n\nAh chapter 3, Though a good chapter there was really nothing much except for Mats problem and the statement of the ages by Evelyn (Im going to talk about this more), Though i felt accomplished earlier it carried on little until this point, the sheer emotion and excitement that filled up my body. I was honestly confused at first but i realized that the writing that went into this game was beautiful and it was reaching me on an emotionally level. At this point i felt like i was in that moment like im the character, like that was my reality. No game has done that so i give it major applause for doing so.\n\nINITIAL THOUGHTS OF CHAPTER 3 (going to keep it short)\n1. Amazing writing\n2. Loved the chemistry between charactes\n3. world building was really good\n\nChapter 4 and 5, i know i went like in full depth with the other chapters but this is something you want to experience for yourselves, so ill give you guys my initial thoughts in more detail to make up for it. These two chapters legitimately broke me. Im still confused at this moment, i felt genuine sadness, jealousy, and anger. I have multiple reasons why i relate with this so much some recent and some in the past but still, how Kyle Steeley wrote this out was terrific and honestly made me love this game already more than I liked it, And if you want to hear more about the stories i went through that relates to the plot or helped gave a deeper understanding of the game, i may make another post explaining it in more depth (yes, spoilers). \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nThis game though having some flaws in itself is worth every single penny, ive never felt so invested and excited to play a game like this in years. Thank you for the experience and i cant wait for more.\n\n-CallMeConvict", "timestamp_created": 1642325123, "timestamp_updated": 1642325123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108117935": {"recommendationid": "108117935", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088133072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1679598876}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good.

I played Emily is Away <3 as close as I could to reality as well (apart from my poor communication skills), choosing the quieter, more reserved Emily over the party-going Evelyn. The division between the two is only really in the first part of the game, where the two were friends and you must choose who's party to go to with your friend Mat and his GF. Things go relatively well, and that if you have some degree of problem solving and interpersonal skills you can breeze right through close to the end being happy with everyone. You help Emily reconcile with Evelyn after a falling out, the way being that they both need to let go, that things won't ever be the same. Emily mentions a major thing, she hates byes.\nAt the early parts, it is suggested that your friend Mat is cheating on his GF as mentioned by the opposite party's girl. This is a subject you can play, but I don't think it was true. Later on he is dumped by his GF who says he was always faithful and that she just grew into a different person. You can choose to ditch your plans with your other person and be with him or ditch him in his sorrow. Of course I helped the poor lad, approved of by Emily after. As the game goes on, there is enough drama to keep your attention but nothing extreme. Either Jeff or Steve with appear posing a 'threat' to your relationship, and it turns out as your choice whether to get jealous and accusatory, in which is can go either way.  (edited)\n\n At the end for your first playthrough (if you decided to pursue a girl), they will loose feelings and either break up with you or put the relationship into a 'break'. Having supported your friend Mat (who you may have helped into a new relationship) he sees that your relationship has broken down and will invite you over, much like you helped him. Evelyn who has had a good year, will also invite you to a graduation party.\nIn the last few lines, Emily thanks you for always being there for her, and that you've been a great friend, her last words to you are \"bye, (name)\". Emily is Away <3 is about growing up and changing like the others. But it is more than that, Emily is Away <3 is about learning to let go yourself through helping others; that relationships and best friends come and go, but good friends will always be there to stay.  I give Emily is Away <3  10/10, it would be wrong to give it anything lower from how well it kept my attention and made me actually feel immersed and involved. (edited)\n\nAnd that has been my journey. Like I said, there isn't a whole lot in this world that can make me truly feel, but these games certainly have. I think most people should have cried throughout these, or at least at the ending; maybe I should have too? I love all three of these games, and at some point I will play through them all again. They possess a perfect existence, connected yet separated; alternative realities. I give them all an overall rating of 10/10, I probably won't play anything like them for long time.

Even the \"conflict\" is  e x a c t l y  the same. \n\nSo this game's got bad replayability. Now maybe you aren't really supposed to replay this game anyways, so it's understandable it's made that way... wait, you can't even get a good ending unless you have atleast two playthroughs?? Yeah when I found out I was surprised too. \nAt first I thought this was like the very first emily is away, you're just doomed to get a sad ending and your heart broken in the process. But nope, you can get a good ending... if you're willing to replay this now suddenly feeling way too long game.\n\n\nIt's not all bad actually, I just needed to get my frustration outta the way first. \nThere were things I really loved, one of them being your best friend mat (I'm not gonna lie, I wish you could've gone for him instead of the girls!). He's really fun and has his own story throughout the game.\n\nAnother thing I loved are the photos! If you can even call them that, it's actually just pixelated pics but that's part of the charm. \nThe whole facenook design didn't feel quite as nostalgic as the AIM design but I still like it more. You can do way more stuff (almost like the real deal lol), like writing on people's walls and set a status.\n\nAlso that you can actually interact with people other than your two love interests is a huuuge upgrade! (Like i already mentioned, mat's the best)\n\n\nSo yea, don't get me wrong, I love the Emily is Away franchise, this is why it's even harder for me to write a not-so-good-not-so-bad review. \nThis game made me wanna replay Emily is Away Too but for all the wrong reasons... guess it's gonna stay my favorite out of the three. \nIn conclusion: do I recommend this game? To die-hard Emily fans like me, yes I do. It's nice to see your favorite characters again and especially getting those pixelated photos of your own character and the girl is really sweet. But for people who aren't invested in the characters, don't set your expectations to high.

I liked the new things they put in this game, the pictures with you and your friends are really adorable, posting on your friends 'wall' was also fun, and having a poke war. It all was charming but I didn't like the story and the way the ending was handled. It felt very weirdly paced and really made me feel like my choices didn't matter. Because at the end of the game, i could only act like a total jerk. I don't feel motivated enough to do the other path, because it's going to be the exact same thing, just with different music i can listen to on youtoob. I really miss the old mechanic in the game [Name] will remember that. It made me feel like what I said matters a little bit, the player was punished for being two sided, it felt real and actually made me feel like a jerk. This one doesnt have that and I think it hinders the experience a lot. I still enjoyed the game, but for the wrong reasons, i enjoyed the visuals and the music choice and some of the jokes.

All in all, it's an enjoyable and emotional story full of ups and downs in relationships. Not only romantic relationships, but friendships too. And that, I think, is the best part of this game. Mat is the MVP of the story! I doubted his intentions after the talk with Emily (although I still stood up for him) but later he proved me wrong and I felt really at fault. And the way he listened and helped me at the end, his iconic CHOICE words... I really wish, especially as a girl, that there was a way for him to become the main love interest. Because although I loved Evelyn in the first chapters, I was really dissapointed with the way she handled the situation in the last chapter. Mat was the only loyal friend to me. \n\nSo I did like the game and recommend it, but many comments before mine noticed the right thing - each part of the series is like a copy of the previous part. The devs change the smallest things, like visuals, but the story, choices, outcomes and conversations stay the same. Expecially the setting and plot.

It doesn't rely on cutting edge graphics or sound, but it does a great job of drawing you into the story.\n\nUsing an interface called \"Facenook\" which is just one typo away, it brings back those early days when the real thing was new and fresh and not the festering dumpster-fire that it is today. I stopped using the real \"Facenook\" almost 10 years ago, deleted all my posts and just keep it for the random friend that might send me a message. And you know what . . . I don't miss it at all. I still keep in touch with my close friends via texts. Same as \"Facenook\" circa 2008 but without all the added drama of seeing some friend of a friend repost the ginormous Cinnabon they just got at the food court and the multitude of meaningless and trite posts about whatever \"cause du jour\" that everyone is enraged about. Enough ranting.\n\nThis game has a kind of nostalgia that brings out memories of emotions and situations that I had forgotten -- possibly buried for good reason, but still worthy of revisiting. \"Reliving\" some of those with the benefit of the passing of time and a more mature perspective makes for an interesting game.\n\nDuring the time I play, I try to mentally put myself into the same mental age and mindset of the characters. I sort of create a filter that keeps away the cynicism and eyerolling that I otherwise might do if I viewed it from a present-day perspective.\n\nThe game's simple interface is just as easy as it would have been back in the day. I like that there are links that will actually open up mock pages that look like they are from 2008ish and still have working links to actual YouTube videos from that time (although they have changed the name to something not unlike YouTube, the videos are actually from YouTube.\n\nI don't want to give away the plot and the twists, of course, so no spoilers. The story itself starts out simple with your main character (who you can name as yourself or use any other name you like.) The main character is a male about age 15 who has just made the jump from AOL (You've got Mail!) to \"Facenook\" and created a brand new account.\n\nFrom there, you are contacted by your best buddy (via the chat) and can choose from 3 predetermined responses to reply. (You actually still need to press keys to get the messages to print in the chat, but the game will print out the preset text. (You can just hold the spacebar if you like and watch the conversation magically appear).\n\nAt that point, the choices you make and the way you respond to the characters in the game affect how the game plays out. There aren't a multitude of outcomes, but enough that you'll enjoy playing through more than once so you can see all the possible outcomes.\n\nIt's a dark game that drips with adolescent angst, and even if you don't identify precisely with the main character, it's worth \"suspending disbelief\" and putting yourself in his shoes.\n\nFor me, it was easy enough because I lived through those adolescent angsty times and so several places during the story were familiar enough that it was eery. It's an everyman story for people who lived during that time, but it will also work for just about anyone who can remember what it was like to be an adolescent where you were driven by indecision, hormones, and the torrent of emotions that happen at that age, where even the smallest \"crisis\" seems like a life or death situation.\n\nI'd recommend this for people who are older than the main characters and not for anyone who is currently under the age of 16 simply because it's meant to be a retrospective and unless your ultra-prodigious, you may not be able to grasp the message of the game. I think that it could also just be boring for present-day teens because it doesn't have the same glitz and glamour and polish of today's internet.

I just finished the first semester of my freshman year at the university and was done with the New Year festivities. Still somewhat anxious and depressed because of new environment and the death of one of my favourite singers of all time half a year prior, I was scrolling through YouTube to find myself something comforting. And I found a bit dated walkthrough (by Jacksepticeye) of this minimalistic, yet very cute game called [b]Emily is Away[/b] (2015). It proposed a trip to the internet of the past, to [b]good old times[/b], when social media wasn't that big of a thing and people used pretty simple AOL messengers for communication. Truth be told, back in 2008-2009 I used different kinds of chats, but despite that this game still somehow managed to make me feel [b]nostalgic[/b] and appreciative [i][of something that I never really experienced before][/i]. Although, behind that cute retro-aesthetic, a very sad story was hidden - a story about friendship and youth love, friendzone and [b]broken heart[/b]; a story about growing up and understanding that life isn't fairytale - people come and they go. And that's a pretty [b]bitter truth[/b] of life.\n\nAfter playing through it, I wouldn't say that my spirits were lifted, quite contrary. But I definitely adored the [b]vision[/b] and [b]themes[/b] it went for, so when I realised that this game had a sequel - I immediately bought it and 100%-ed in a matter of few hours. [b]Emily is Away Too[/b] (2017) was a more expanded and interactive version of its predecessor, which gave players more features and whole two routes with different endings. Story wasn't completely linear and the essential aspect of [b]\"parting ways\"[/b] became avoidable, as long as you made the right choices and weren't being a two-faced dingus. With amazing nostalgic aesthetic, this game gave you a chance to make things right from the get-go, while still sticking to the characters and the world, created by [i]Mr. Seeley[/i] in the first game. Needless to say, I was [i]extremely[/i] stoked when the third game in the series got announced.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nAnd after three years of waiting, we come to this particular game.\n\nSo.\n\n[b]Emily is Away <3[/b] (2021), similar to previous part, is not a direct sequel per se. It's more of a [b]reimagining[/b] of the story told before, but with fresh coat of paint and different outcomes. An [b]alternate universe[/b], if you will. Those, who already played [i]Emily is Away Too[/i], won't have hard time recognizing [b]Emily[/b] and [b]Evelyn[/b] [i][player's two possible romantic interests][/i], [b]Matt[/b] and [b]Kelly[/b] [i][previously mostly background characters][/i], [b]Jeff[/b] and [b]Steve[/b] [i][previously \"ex-boyfriend\" material][/i]. Well, here some of their roles have changed up a bit. For example, Matt is now your best buddy (who will be the one introducting you to the game), while Jeff and Steve turn from \"bad memories of the past\" to \"possible future danger\". As the game's description says, [i]AIM is pretty much dead[/i] in this version, so this game will take place in the [b]Facenook[/b] [[i]which previously served as an additional site not much used by player][/i].\n\nThe [b]features[/b] don't feel as prevalent as you can't really customize your preferences outside of chatting. And interaction with your personal browser in order to visit game's sites isn't anything new. Besides, the [b]plot[/b] is pretty similar to that of second game and structured in the very same way, despite it having some core differences. The story itself is quite [b][u]cyclical[/u][/b], which is ironic, and just like in the first game you are pretty much [b]doomed[/b] for a gut punch (at least first time playing). The problem is - game doesn't have that good of a replayability as events don't change one bit from route to route and the only dissimilarities between them are purely visual (like, different pictures and names). Otherwise, [b]aesthetics[/b] and whole tone are still as good as in previous two games, so if you are into nostalgic feel like that - it's a [b]worthwile catch[/b].\n\nWhat this game has that previous ones don't is probably a direct opinion of a third person. Whereas in first and second ones you'd have your opinion and opinion of a girl you're talking to, here you also get a perspective of your friend, who is outside of your romantic relationships and can share observations you would otherwise miss. I'd say overall [i]Matthey Gursky[/i] is the best character here as he is the only real bro, who cements the core idea behind this installment, which is [b]\"Strong friendship is more valuable than any romance could ever be\"[/b]. Or, to put it simple - bros before hoes lol.\n\nOh, and also (!) in [i]\"Secrets\"[/i] section you can unlock a mini-game called [b]\"Can you pet the dog?\"[/b], which is the cutest thing ever and a pretty neat stress reliever.", "timestamp_created": 1638229010, "timestamp_updated": 1638229010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7427787184715271", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104767656": {"recommendationid": "104767656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149173950", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 661, "last_played": 1638238655}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Te odio Emily me cagaste por \u00faltima vez.", "timestamp_created": 1638228101, "timestamp_updated": 1638228101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104742617": {"recommendationid": "104742617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110849976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1659813696}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game, from the Emily is away series.

With multiple people to impress, a new girlfriend, graduation coming up and possibly moving away for college, it really slinks you back into a time and a place when choosing which party to go to on saturday night after work was the biggest problem you had.\n\nThis game really hits the nostalgia spot when it came to the layout of the old websites it references, the music each character shares with you, the slang in which both you and your friends casually use in conversation and just the general topics and themes of the game. Achievements include playing a mini game which is bootleg version of Farmville, and even being Rickrolled.\n\nI was genuinely invested in these characters and story, their petty drama exhausted me to the point where I would finish a session and then go lay down because it felt like their problems really were my problem by association. These characters are written as if they are actually real, its hard to believe it's just a game, as I often felt 'I've been here before'.\n\nThe game made me laugh, kept me interested and absolutely broke my f-ing heart.

TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IN A REAL WAY WHICH IS: her getting close with some guy enough that they're posting back and forth on their walls which is apparently the only way people in this universe speak to one another and show their feelings\n\nthe way i was yelling out loud when the final chapter happened and eva 'confronted' me about my behavior and i realized that that was the apex of the entire story.... i am so beyond pissed that i bothered to spend money on this. for fucking real. the cool interface and design is NOTHING compared to the shit story they churned out and everyone pretends is 'deep' somehow. the praise for this thing? unreal and undeserved. the story? frankly harmful, the way all the characters read into every little choice you make, it felt like i was being gaslit the entire game, just a pawn for all these weirdo kids to play with. what the hell kind of an experience is that? i heard if i HADN'T told eva to stop talking to steve that she DOES cheat so like ?!?!?!?!? where is literally any logic here ? it feels like it was made for someone who has never actually interacted with a real person. people don't give a fuck about these specific, tiny things THIS much and the fact that they portray it that way is absolutely not worthy of praise. \n\nnever opening this game again.", "timestamp_created": 1635469661, "timestamp_updated": 1635470458,
