I played it a few times as a kid, have fond memories, but the puzzles were often too much back then. Really good game to get your gears spinning, puzzles can be quite challenging at times. I'm also in love with the visual style. The hand-drawn nature of the game's assets really breathes life into the world you're put in.\n\nOne preety ugly issue tho, all through the game, I was getting regular lag/stutter issues. The game would just lag for a couple seconds, slowing down the game with it, based on some things I've seen (eg, in hint book minigame, during the lag, I was able to shoot many more bullets in the same time) It seems like it's the game's ticks lagging behind, not just the graphics frames (they could be tied anyway). My computer is a high-end as of 2020, most new AAA releases have no issues running smoothly, yet this 20 year old 2D game has issues. This has been a major annoyance throughout.

Machinarium is one of those and I've finally played it.\n\nIt started a year and a half ago when I noticed Samorost in my Steam library, also created by Amanita Design.  I played the trilogy of Samorost games and came to appreciate this developer's style of adventure game.  It's also when I remembered Machinarium.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Eincrou/recommended/421120\n\nMachinarium is no less whimsical and quirky than Samorost... and no less challenging.  There were several times I got legitimately stuck.  Interactions can be obscure and there are some small objects that are tough to notice.  I consulted the in-game guidebook a few times, which is cryptic enough to still require some thought.\n\nThere are some arcade-style games that were a nice change of pace, but I think some went on for too long.  The one to kill 40 enemies in a maze was excessive.\n\nI didn't actually make any moves to buy and play Machinarium until I was out this past summer and played the demo for an upcoming adventure game called Boxville on PS5, which had been previously released on PC.  Its style reminded me again of Machinarium.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1750710/Boxville/\n\nWhen I was able to return home, Machinarium was the first new PC game I bought.  Maybe I'll get Boxville sometime, too.  Though not on PS5... playing point & click with a gamepad sucks.\n\nThis review has barely been about Machinarium, but come on.

I remember when I was younger and this game had only been out for a few years, and my class had begun to take an interest in playing it. I can recall my friends playing and talking about how great it was; all while I, the most tech illiterate and internet sheltered in the class (At least what I thought during the time) was unable to play it due to my parents not thinking that cheap mobile games such as this would be of any use to me. Something wherein I guess they where right, this game wouldn't have, and didn't change me with its fun story, amazing art, or fantastical score. Yet, it did work to do something in me by merely existing. For the fact that my understanding of what made a game something I wanted to play was fundamentally challenged. I was upset that I wouldn't play it in the time that it was popular amongst my friend group. But as I thought more, and grew up I remembered this story and it made me think, even right now as I write this I question why I play, but more importantly, feel driven to buy the games I do. When I bought this game earlier this month I did so for two reasons. One, it was on sale and cheap, a whole other factor within itself; and second because of the memories of never being able to play it before and wanting to know what made it \"Great\" in other peoples eyes. Which yeah, now having played it I can see why it was so good, but I cant help but think that if it were not for it my parents not buying it, or for the class being intrigued by it, my chance of being here right now would have been significantly decreased. I might have found it on my own, and the art might have made me interested enough to buy, and I would have had probably the same amount of enjoy-ability playing it. But I don't know this review is becoming a mess, and I don't even know what I am trying to say, if anything at all. I just want to know why we buy things. We like knowing or receiving positive reviews of games before we okay them, but why? Why should a game be considered any less then just because some people hated it, and why must we bully people for liking things other might not. This is gaming, there are soooooo many games out there in the vast web of what the internet has allowed humanity to achieve. Do I buy games because they are popular? Do I buy games because people think they are good? Because someone wrote a super long review of something that debates the very philosophies behind why in the world anyone should buy anything? \nWhat I learned from my parents not buying me this game as a child is that while reviews and popularity of something can be helpful in determining if something will be enjoyable to you, it shouldn't be the only factor in your decision to buy. Buy games you like, buy games others don't, and just play them. Elden Ring might be shit to one person, and some people loved Fallout 76 when it came out. Just have fun, do what you want, but don't let the crowd get ya down.\nAnyways, Machinarium is great and you should play it!

If that isn't within your skillset, you will be irrevocably stuck. And the puzzles are hard and convoluted. \nIf that's your thing, then, sure, go for it  :-)\nIf not, then be warned  :-(\n\nThis game gets a lot of cred., and I like both the story and how it looks. And it is wonderfully imaginative and I like the steampunk and odd characters. But it can be seriously obtuse - like : 'fix the power, to get electricity to a line, and get the cat to electrocute-stun itself, to carry down several stairs, to stuff into a pipe, to scare out a mouse, to make the music swing, to make a neighbour throw down a radio, that breaks and pick up a part inside, to ??'... or something like that, I may have got it jumbled a bit ... ;-)  There's a ton of stuff like that. Many places it's just about impossible to know what you have to do, to get what you need, to achieve...ehmm, what exactly ? Many items or interactable zones are almost impossible to see hidden in the scenery or background. And many of the puzzles are really hard. Plus the fact that the character has 3 different height levels and some (many) interactions will only accept if he's at some specific height otherwise he just stands there shaking his head. Luckily there are step-by-step guides to hand, the in-game hint is ok but also playthroughs and walkthrough guides by players. Without them I wouldn't even have been able cross that first drawbridge. \n\nAs someone who is absolutely useless at arcade games, a space invaders challenge played to the level of points-gathering required here is way beyond my skillset. Therefore utterly stuck at about halfway-ish in the game. And had to resort to guides again and again even to get that far.\n\nSo - am now uninstalling and feeling rather disappointed. OK so I am obviously too stoopid and too slow for this game. But it would have been nice if they had included an easier mode or just simply a SKIP function for those of us in the casual-and-slow category.\n\n--------\n[15/10: Just some language edits for clarity]", "timestamp_created": 1697305265, "timestamp_updated": 1697401296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642857134342193604", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148159647": {"recommendationid": "148159647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393844036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1697231629}, "language": "english", "review": "very cute very fun", "timestamp_created": 1697231656, "timestamp_updated": 1697231656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148125469": {"recommendationid": "148125469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106294994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1697144886}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo malo:\nDemasiado minijuego dentro del juego.\nLo bueno:\nAparte de que es precioso, hay puzles muy inteligentes.

into that.\nAll the puzzles make sense and theres not really any difficulty spike.\nThe world looks amazing, and is really lively with all the moving parts, all the characters and all the tiny cleaning robots, I love the tiny cleaning robots :3\nStory does not take up a lot in this title though, it's a simple, cute story, with adorable protagonists.\nAll in all this is 100% a recommend if

terminos de puzzles y la \"logica de point and click\") se nota una curva considerable a medida vamos avanzando en la trama, no es muy corto pero tampoco tan largo y el juego te va llevando un poco de la mano con pistas leves en el entorno pero tambien pistas mas directas que solo nos dicen que hay que hacer, es bueno saber que los desarrolladores sabrian que en algun punto te puedes quedar atascado y por eso pusieron una guia que puedes consultar en cualquier momento siempre y cuando completes el minijuego que trae (algo largo al parecer), lo cual le suma puntos y ayuda a que realmente quieras pasartelo bien con este juego.\n\nLa musica es bastante buena y hay canciones que facilmente descargaria no mas para escucharla de lo que me han gustado, puede que sean algo cortas y repetitivas pero no realmente molestas.\n\nNo te vas a perder de nada a medida que avanzas asi que es practicamente imposible quedar bloqueado en algun punto, aunque entre mas terreno se te abra mas dificil sera darte cuenta de ese minusculo objeto que no viste que era necesario para continuar.\n\nlo unico negativo es que el juego no tiene guardado automatico para lo lineal que es, cosa que te puede putear un poco si de repente se te crashea por A o B motivo y debes volver a recorrer todo el tramo y resolver los puzzles que perdiste en esa parte\n\npero que mas se puede decir, es un juego que vas a platinar SI O SI y eso me gusta, bastante casual friendly para aquellos que ya estan traumados (como yo) con supuestos logros que te fuerzan a jugar el juego otras 10 horas para conseguir todos los logros porque x objeto era perdible y etc\n\nun mundo que deja preguntas a medida lo vas explorando y quisieras saber un poco mas sobre el, aunque al final cierra con broche de oro con un

If this is what you're looking for, go for it, but it's not what I'm looking for in a Point & Click game.\n\nDespite this issue, what really made me refund this game is that atmosphere. There's none. I couldn't connect with this game like I could with The Dig or Amerzone. And the levels feels like just another stage of puzzles.

I loved the Samarost series, but it didn't dawn on me that this game was by the same developer, Amanita Design, until I finally started playing the game and began noticing the similarities.\n\u00a0\nBelieve it or not, this is a Love Story...well, technically, it is a robotic love story! I am still amazed that this developer is able to tell a story from beginning to end without a single word being spoken! Every character Josef the robot meets has a backstory they happily share with him via a thought bubble, and Josef somehow manages to help them all overcome their plights as he overcomes obstacles on his own journey.\n\u00a0\nThis adorable robot has a few tricks up his metallic sleeve. He can grow taller or squish himself until he's practically flat. When he comes across an inventory item, he simply eats it; okay, technically, he just stores the items in his tin can belly. If you try to get him to do something or go somewhere off-limits, he will shake his head vehemently, so don't try to convince him otherwise.\n\u00a0\nThe puzzles, at times, were maddening! I played the Tic-Tac-Toe game (place 5 nuts/bolts in a row) multiple times before finally beating my opponent. (the trick was to place my pieces away from the beaten path, so to speak, while leaving a gap because the AI could only block one end.\n\u00a0\nI loved the two Arcade Games, even though it was annoying to have to pedal an exercise bike to recharge the generator after each failed attempt. The first Arcade game was Space Invaders, where you had to score 1000 points by shooting all of the invaders without getting shot too many times, which ended the game. The second Arcade Game is a sliding box puzzle where you have to use directional arrows to move a blue dot into various boxes to move them until you place the smaller blue box into the larger blue box and then guide the boxes out of the gate, which opens once the two boxes are combined. This is repeated 5 times, with each puzzle being slightly more progressive than its predecessor.\n\u00a0\nMy advice is to pay attention to all the thought bubbles and look for puzzle clues that are usually nearby. Most of the door or machine puzzle instructions are just simple patterns that need to be set, such as selecting a series of lamp lights.\n\u00a0\nAfter completing this adventure, you feel like you actually accomplished something because it isn't always easy to figure out what you are supposed to do and why you're doing it. Eventually, you get that Aha! moment, and it makes you feel like a robotic genius, loll!

All the screens are hand drawn in an inspired, thoughtful way, with multiple motion elements (steam, flies, flickering sparks, etc.) to make the world come to life. There's a backstory narrative that emerges through progressive bits of robot memory, like a good cartoon or indie-animation movie. THE MUSIC AND AMBIENT SOUND IS AMAZING. Thank Tomas Dvorak (aka Floex) for creating an album's-worth of wonderful stand-alone-worthy music for this game. I kid you not, the music is on the level of great movie soundtracks or Pink Floyd/Brian Eno/Tron/etc. imaginative music. This is an A+++ game for me.

A new neighbor who was walking by glanced toward my patio because he noticed movement, realized I was playing a video game, and then later that evening, he knocked on my door because he wanted to introduce himself to his \"cool\" neighbors.  Over the course of the conversation, he mentioned Machinarium.  I had just picked it up in an indie games bundle, but I hadn't paid too much attention to it.  I tried it out that evening, and then life happened and I'm just now returning to it.  Thanks for the recommendation, Joe.  Let's do the compliment sandwich this time.\n\nMachinarium's visuals are gorgeous.  I like the funky, kind of cartoony feel where important things kind of stand out as opposed to the slightly more muted background.  Most of the robots have interesting designs (particularly the saxophone player), and the least interesting character to look at is actually Josef, the main robot.  The backgrounds have a soft, almost hand-drawn look to them, and there's a lot going on in town.\n\nControls are simple, but can be annoying.  I used a controller (DualShock 4), but I think a keyboard and mouse may have been better in this situation.  I found myself trying several times to click one object, or combine an object with something else, only for Josef to shake his head because he thought I was trying to do something else.  The final sequence with Berta was the most annoying.  During mini games, though, the controller was fine.  Space Invaders with a PS4 controller was a first for me.\n\nFinally, the soundscape is wonderful.

You meet bad guys, good guys and everything in the between on your journey. The gameplay is pretty standard with various puzzles, item hunting and even some mini games (some harders than others!). While some item puzzles can be tricky or not make too much sense, they are usually straight forward and there aren't really any dead ends.\n\nThe art design is very unique, and different from the Samorost series, this looks more like a family friendly version of HH Geiger's artwork. The soundtrack is pretty good and fits in where it should. This game continues the Amanita tradition of not having any voice acting, instead telling things through the environment, odd sounds and speak bubbles with drawn objects in them.\n\nI definitely recommend this as a point n click game for both fans of the genre and beginners.

Don't even know why I need to the radio either.  \n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back though was finding out I'd apparently soft-locked the game by messing with a clock puzzle the wrong way.  I even downloaded a save file someone else provided on the game's forums so this evidently isn't that unusual, but all that only to find out the devs patched the game to where there's no longer a way to import it.

So naturally I bought the game and I don't regret it one bit. The opening, music and animations took me right back, the atmosphere of this game is so lovely and meticulously crafted. I'm not the biggest fan of puzzle games but these puzzles were great. There were a couple of really difficult solutions you had to really pay attention to in order to get, but those were few and far between. Even with some of the more confusing puzzles, the music and atmosphere of the game entices you to keep going. The puzzles get harder as you go on, requiring more thinking outside of the box, but the transition from somewhat obvious puzzles to more obscure puzzles is seamless and buttery smooth. That first \"Ah ha!\" moment is so satisfying, and it only gets better as time goes on. I highly suggest the game, its one of the best I've played in terms of atmosphere and sheer artistry, as well as Amanita's other games, my Mother and I are very fond of them. \n\nAlso!

Beep \u2013 beep! Welcome to Machinaruim, my dear fella! Now, I invite you to this point-and-click adventure game developed by talented guys from Amanita games, that is one of the most adorable and visually captivating games I\u2019ve ever played!\n\nFrom the moment I launched the game I was whisked away to a quaint place of robots, machinery, and industrial landscapes, all rendered in stunning detail. The land-dawn graphics are simply lovely, with intricate elements and charming animations that bring the word to life. The game\u2019s art style is reminiscent of a children\u2019s picture book, with a muted colour palette and a soft, dreamlike vibe. The sound effects in the game are a symphony of whimsical robot noises from gentle whirring of gears to the satisfying clicks and clacks of buttons and levers, with each robot in the game having its own unique set of noises that convey its personality and quirk.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just aesthetics that make Machinarium so special. The game is also a delight to play! As you guide your robot protagonist through the winding paths, you deal with multi-layered mini-missions that require a bit of exploration and experimentation to solve. They range from logic puzzles, to dialogue ones where you need to decipher the intentions of other characters. The puzzles are integrated seamlessly into the world, it clues hidden in the environment and clever twists that keep you on your toes.\n\nIn a nutshell, Machinaruim is an absolute gem of a game that I would recommend anyone who chooses not only meticulously crafted universes but also touching stories. With its nostalgic touch and a meditative walkthrough, it\u2019s a true work of art that is sure to delight players of all ages.", "timestamp_created": 1677021567, "timestamp_updated": 1677021645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133237713": {"recommendationid": "133237713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064538414", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1676904080}, "language": "english", "review": "Couldn't beat it as a child and now i finally did.

A garbage disposal robot is flying out from the centre of the city to a junkyard where it empties its contents, including a set of parts for a small robot. This robot is controlled by the player, and it has to first reassemble itself before it can return to the city to make things right. However, there is a group of bully robots with other ideas of fun.\n\nThe cute little story in Machinarium mostly serves as a background to solving a varied set of puzzles. Some of them are based on the often a bit far-fetched type that is expected from traditional point-and-click games, and others are more like mini games within the game. The actual background to the story is uncovered as the game goes on, and it is not obvious at all to start with. This is also a good motivation to continue playing. The player wants to know more in addition to solve the larger issues created by the bullies.\n\nMachinarium has a very distinct artistic design. Both the graphical style and the music are very enjoyable. In addition, there is no dialogue at all in the game except animated thought bubbles and the body language of the interacting robots. This can sometimes make it a bit unclear where to go and what needs to be done. There is a built-in hint system that can aid in those situations, and also when the puzzle solutions are too obscure for the player.\n\nI liked the game for its style and its atmosphere. Sometimes I felt a bit frustrated when a puzzle did not want to be solved, but it mostly had to do with a bit of inexactness in the point-and-click part.

Once again this game compares most closely to environmental puzzlers where the narrative drives the game, because well - that's what it is. As such Limbo and Inside from PlayDead are obvious comparisons, albeit not entirely fair as Machinarium is quite a bit older than both.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game blew me away, and is, quite possibly, the primary attraction here. The sound design and art style blend together very well in a somewhat bleak but oddly wholesome world I would love to see more of. The story is minimal but compliments the tone of the game perfectly. The game presents itself very well.\n\nThe puzzles are... a bit of a mixed bag. There are some pretty classic ones like tic-tac-toe versus a literal bot, or rotation disc puzzles - but the game clearly takes most pride in the far-fetched comical ones that require you to set in motion a cartoon-like sequence of actions to proceed. Multiple issues arise on this front: it's definitely not always clear what the player can interact with, some of the interactions take forever to complete (very slow animations) and, by far the worst offender in my opinion, a lot of them are not at all isolated. The latter requires some elaboration: Machinarium divides the world in static sections that need to be \"solved\" in some way, but the game frequently incorporates elements from previous sections in future ones. This obfuscates problem solving horrendously as, if the player so happens to have missed a previous item, it is not incorporated in their thought process. It's quirky and adds a feeling of progression I suppose, but as far as the puzzles themselves go this doesn't make them any clearer or more satisfying to solve.

I finished the game in a few sessions with a total time of 5.2 hours. I only needed a couple of hints. Would I reecommend? Yes.\n\n[b]Things I liked[/b]\n- Music was really good, I just wish there was a way to adjust volume in game.\n- The 2d / minigame puzzles were really good. But were almost entirely disconnected from anything in the world. This is a pretty short list of \"things I liked,\" but really, the minigame puzzles are really good.\n- The world puzzle / adventuring was ok. Not as good as the minigame puzzles, but fun.\n- Lots of variety to the puzzles.\n\n[b]Things that were ehhhh[/b]\n- The inventory system. I don't know if there's a better way to do this, but I found myself frequently pulling things out of my inventory and blindly clicking around hoping for something to interact with.\n- The hint system was pretty useless. The times I needed a hint to figure out what to do, I was already trying to do what the hint told me. For example, rescuing pink umbrella lady's dog, I knew I needed [spoiler]to shoot the string gun to pull him across the pond[/spoiler], I just didn't know [spoiler]what I was missing (the plunger)[/spoiler]. The only other place I got stuck was the owl. I guess the \"hint\" is that the owl sort of interacts with you, so you have to figure that out, but I missed that (and the hint for that screen is about the cat).\n- The story / plot was confusing, in that you (the main character) lacked coherency. The start of the game implies you are a pile of junk with no back story (maybe?). And then later you find kitchen girl, and you two become immediately attached for some reason? The shallow depth of the villains is at least forgivable, their purpose in the story-telling is direct and clear.\n\n[b]Things I disliked[/b]\n- The minigames (not 2d/minigame puzzles). [spoiler]The space invaders game, and the maze game[/spoiler] at the end.\n- The \"crafting\" aspect of your inventory, with no hint about what can or should be combined.\n- Not being able to cancel an action, especially starting a long walk sequence to transition to another screen when I was trying to click on a location on the current screen.\n- Not knowing what I can interact with. I got stuck and had to check a walkthrough to find out [spoiler]I needed to click the camouflaged plunger in the jail cell because I didn't see it[/spoiler].\n- Having to repeat the same sequence multiple times. Escaping the sewer and [spoiler]grabbing the jailer's key[/spoiler], having to [spoiler]get the oil hose run to the outdoor elevator machine[/spoiler], having to re-solve the indoor elevator to go to a particular level.\n- Not being able to backtrack 1) at the indoor elevator door to the walkway up to \"the city\". Have to climb up the pipe and enter at the top again. 2) Not being able to backtrack, but can follow an earlier sequence to get back to a point, like the long path around to the outdoor elevator, so back tracking is \"allowed\" but not easy.\n- The clock \"puzzle.\" I still feel like I'm missing something.

I was so inspired by It that some of the characters I have drawn myself.\n\u2022 [b][u] Soundtrack[/u][/b] - Sadly, I'm a person that most of the time doesn't notice the music in the game.

Play time is ~2-4 hours to complete the story and to get all achievements. There is some replayability to this game much like most adventure games.  There could be additional ways to solve puzzles, interactions you missed, or just reliving the story again.

Well, my 9-year-old self struggled to progress beyond playing less than 20% of the game and I eventually give up. Any progress I made was thanks to the hint mini-game within the game itself. Even now, I still found the game quite challenging, yet incredibly enjoyable!\n\nSpeaking about the game itself, the artwork and musical ambiance are simply fantastic.

The graphics are all hand drawn and have a steampunk theme. \n\n[b]Achievements:[/b]  \n[b]How many:[/b] 12 Achievements, most are obtained by solving the puzzles and finishing the game. \n[b]How much time:[/b] Around 3 hours, if you don\u2019t get stuck for long. I\u2019ve spent more than 20 hours on the game but I played it several times and didn\u2019t use a guide.\n[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Easy, the solution for a few puzzles isn\u2019t very obvious but after a few tries, you will most likely solve them. Guides are available too.\n[b]Achievements\u2019 Difficulty:[/b] Easy. You only need to complete the puzzles and do a few additional tasks that aren\u2019t very hard to complete.\n\n[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  \nThis is one of my favorite point and click games. The hand drawn graphics are very well drawn and detailed and the characters and their animations are cute and funny to look at. The game itself isn\u2019t hard so it can be enjoyed by everyone, including children.\n\n\n[b]Join and follow my group Ribbon Hunters for more suggestions and reviews of easy indie games to get all the achievements:[/b] https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42556190-Ribbon-Hunters/", "timestamp_created": 1657184556, "timestamp_updated": 1657187705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118344932": {"recommendationid": "118344932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125301291", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1657195623}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best games ever made", "timestamp_created": 1657138732, "timestamp_updated": 1657138732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468164771795272827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118330002": {"recommendationid": "118330002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322489578", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1644131560}, "language": "english", "review": "Got robot pussy back\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1657122072, "timestamp_updated": 1657122072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118275523": {"recommendationid": "118275523", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960728404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1692958739}, "language": "english", "review": "iot is very good i recomend it\n", "timestamp_created": 1657046213, "timestamp_updated": 1657046213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118274148": {"recommendationid": "118274148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891327370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1656926123}, "language": "english", "review": "i used to play this when i was a child and after about 15 years later im still playing it that should say how interesting and fun this game is", "timestamp_created": 1657044643, "timestamp_updated": 1657044643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118273605": {"recommendationid": "118273605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436118202", "num_games_owned": 898, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1656795602}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely!", "timestamp_created": 1657044043, "timestamp_updated": 1657044043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118266671": {"recommendationid": "118266671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989571712", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1657035796}, "language": "english", "review": "that's one of my first and favourite games, I have already played it twice but i had to for the third time to get achievements on steam (before i played on a different device).

Seeing it on Steam recently I wanted to play it through again and get the achievements BUT over an hour of trying to fix the problems with this game I've decided to just give up and cut my losses. In the support section for this game, the devs stated back in 2017 they were aware of this issue and would look into it. 5 years later and there's no response, no update, no fix....\n\nThe game will run unbelievably slow to the point where you have to check the Task Manager to see what the hell is going on. It only takes 100k-ish of RAM, meaning it's not very intense on your rig but it plays like your PC is falling apart at the seams.\n\nIf you change the volume through Windows then it will just automatically put the volume back to maximum. I've never seen that in a game before, interesting choice from the devs... I don't understand the thinking behind it. It's up to me what volume I play the game at, not the devs.\n\nThe mouse keeps de-syncing too. When you start the game up, or minimize and maximize the game, or change window it snaps the 'game' mouse back to the centre of the screen when your actual mouse isn't on that spot. This means when you click on certain places the game gets confused and starts showing some weird splash screen when you're just trying to click the menus, the items etc.\n\n\u00a312.99 for such a broken game, that is around 15 years old now... it's daylight robbery.

441, "last_played": 1657860718}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nMachinarium is ok.  It will mostly appeal to those with some nostalgia for the old school style point and click adventure games of the 90's(like Space Quest or King's Quest).  I would rate the Space Quest and King's Quest games as superior but Machinarium has its own charm and a different vibe to it.  There's nothing profoundly new or unique about this game.  However the game flows just fine, has some interesting scenes with fitting ambiance, and I don't have any annoyances or complaints with it.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game was actually the soundtrack.  There's a few songs on there I liked enough to add to my playlists.  Since I was kind of medium on the game overall, this aspect was one that helped commit me to giving it a \"recommended\" rating.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games, and the videos/screenshots are appealing to you, it's probably worth your time.  However, I wouldn't rate this as an absolute \"must play\" of the \"point and click\" genre.  Get it on sale if it sounds like something that interests you.  I got it for $4 and don't have any regrets.\n\n[h1]Gameplay and difficulty[/h1]\n\nAt a high level this game is mostly a mix of \"finding the right item\" and solving various mind puzzles spread throughout the game, which is pretty typical for this genre.  Some of the mind puzzles can be complex and probably require at least a middle school mind or higher to figure out.  The mind puzzles primarily consist of maneuvering multiple objects in a confined space in order to obtain a desired configuration.  As an adult I found the game sufficiently challenging.  I had to stop a few times and come back with fresh thoughts another day to get by some areas.  At one point I got stuck and relented and looked for a hint online(don't worry, no spoilers ahead), only to realize I was only stuck because I made the wrong presumption about an object.  I thought this object was \"view only\" but it could actually be further manipulated. I just didn't try.  Kicked myself for that one.  None of the puzzles were too hard to solve.  They just required some time and thought.\n\n[h1]How long is it?[/h1]\n\nI completed it in 7.5 hours, which according to the game's leader board(measured by game time) puts me in the top 33% or so.  Decent length for the type of game it is, but maybe slightly on the shorter end when comparing to others of the same genre.\n\n[h1]Good for kids?[/h1]\n\nThis game is one of the most kid friendly point and click adventure game I've seen.  And I'm not saying that because the game is easy.  The game definitely has some hard parts that will require a mature brain to figure out.  But its good if you have a young preschool age kid that just wants to watch as you play through it.  There is no text to read throughout the game.  All communication is done through animated cloud bubbles, so no reading is required.\n\nThere's not any violence in the game.  Just some bullies who you have to outwit and overcome.\n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\n\nThe achievements are really straight forward.  They basically represent various milestones throughout the game, that are impossible to miss as you progress.  So if you complete the game you will have earned all achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1650478346, "timestamp_updated": 1650478553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114178731": {"recommendationid": "114178731", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998598944", "num_games_owned": 2046, "num_reviews": 1063, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1650467015}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic point and click game worth of your time if you are a fan of the genre.

Y, sin embargo, con el gran cat\u00e1logo de aventuras gr\u00e1ficas que hay, Machinarium ha conseguido un hueco en mi coraz\u00f3n, no solo por lo que transmite, si no por lo que es a nivel t\u00e9cnico. \n\nEn primer lugar, hablemos de la t\u00e9cnica. Ninguno de los personajes te habla mediante palabras; te hablan mediante una serie de historietas con dibujos (en ocasiones est\u00e1ticos). Esto tiene una parte buena y otra mala. La buena es que la historia se siente poco densa, f\u00e1cil de comprender en l\u00edneas generales y fluida. Pero, por otra parte, la libre interpretaci\u00f3n y la falta de detalles en la historia no me dej\u00f3 comprender los matices de los personajes, el porqu\u00e9 de la organizaci\u00f3n y, sobre todo, las motivaciones.\n\nLa b\u00fasqueda de los objetos es la t\u00edpica en cualquier aventura de este estilo: clicar el mapa para rezar de que ese objeto un poco diferente sea lo que necesitas para el siguiente puzle. Pero es en los propios puzles donde Machinarium, en mi opini\u00f3n, destaca. No son puzles de juntar objetos, de interactuar con el objeto del inventario con un NPC\u2026 son puzles l\u00f3gicos, de mayor o menor dificultad, que te separan de la mec\u00e1nica de \u201cAventura Gr\u00e1fica\u201d para llevarte a una de \u201cJuego tipo Escape Room\u201d. A mi juicio, es refrescante, y hace que las secciones est\u00e9n muy bien cohesionadas, generando una muy buena sensaci\u00f3n general.\n\nY por supuesto, no puedo hablar de la t\u00e9cnica sin hablar de las pistas que te ofrece el juego. Como Aventura Gr\u00e1fica, es consciente de que los jugadores se van a ver atorados en alguna b\u00fasqueda o en alg\u00fan puzle, as\u00ed que genera pistas de dos maneras diferentes: en algunas localizaciones el icono de pista se activar\u00e1, pudiendo darte un peque\u00f1o consejo, con la est\u00e9tica de dibujos, sobre lo siguiente que hacer; si lo anterior no es suficiente, podemos utilizar un libro, con un minijuego previo sencillo, que nos permite ver todas las acciones que habr\u00e1 que hacer en el \u00e1rea (incluyendo las respuestas a los acertijos). Como alguien que se suele bloquear en este tipo de aventuras, este tipo de ayudas me vienen de perlas. Adem\u00e1s, por la longitud del minijuego del libro, te planteas seriamente si utilizarlo.\n\nFinalmente, sin hacer spoilers, decir que la historia me ha parecido tierna. Simple, s\u00ed, pero tierna, en un mundo lleno de posibilidades que me hubiese gustado explorar un poco m\u00e1s. El robot protagonista, que se llama Josef (me he enterado por los cromos), expresa much\u00edsimo a pesar de no mediar palabra, y los flashbacks que se generan en ocasiones son MUY bonitos. Me parece que el juego consigue mucho con lo poco que tiene.\n\nEn definitiva, una aventura gr\u00e1fica suave, que puede meter a un nuevo jugador a este g\u00e9nero sin problemas.", "timestamp_created": 1650198872, "timestamp_updated": 1650198957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113949152": {"recommendationid": "113949152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099240311", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1650114586}, "language": "english", "review": "It's unplayable with all the stuttering.

It does so many things exceptionally well, but is held back from being a game I can truly recommend by some horrible, glaring flaws. Flaws so catastrophic that it drags an otherwise excellent package to a frustrating mess.\n\n-I had 2 big, gamebreaking bugs in my playthrough. This is a 5-8 hr long game. There are like 30 screens total. For 2 of them to be impassable is just unacceptable. The first was the elevator bug (documented here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/40700/discussions/0/1473096694444777484/), which required me to change the size of my window in game from fullscreen to 90% windowed to solve. Now, keep in mind, this is the type of bug where I don't KNOW if it's bugged or if I'm just doing the puzzle wrong, so naturally I wasted an hour or more of my life sitting there thinking it was me and not the game, before I eventually looked it up and found out the game was at fault. Stellar. The second gamebreaking bug I was able to diagnose rather quickly, but basically there's a puzzle which I couldn't get to work properly on mouse + keyboard (this is a point and click adventure game...) but for whatever reason my gamepad worked just fine\n\n-So that's bad enough, but truth be told the game is plagued by control problems throughout. The zones they gave for \"clickable\" parts of the background are either too large or too small. So very often a puzzle wasn't challenging because I couldn't figure it out, but because I didn't know I could click there, or even worse, because I already tried to click there but nothing happened because I didn't click in the exact right zone. The large ranges are particularly annoying when it moves your robot to places you don't want it to ... overall the whole thing just feels clunky.\n\n-Part of this is that Machinarium does something unique that I thought I'd like, but ended up despising. Basically for a thing to be clickable / interactable, your robot has to be right next to it. And your robot has 3 sizes (tall, normal, and small). This is different from traditional point-and-click adventure games in that generally the whole screen is clickable in this genre. What this ends up meaning is you move your robot to every node that he can move to, make him change sizes every time you do, and see if anything is clickable. You do this on every screen to see what you can interact with. This is not fun. And keep in mind all of the robot's animations are painfully slow. Joy.\n\n-But really, at the crux of it all is that though I did 2/3rds of the puzzles in the game unaided, there was a third of them that were just painful. And if you know this genre, you know that being stuck in a point-and-click adventure game with no idea what to do is a special sort of pain that just drains your life away. To the game's credit, there is a hint and walkthrough system implemented, but like most, I -really- didn't want to use them. I eventually caved, and that feeling has stuck with me since. If you're the type of gamer who can feel good even when using a guide, or hints, or a walkthrough, then maybe it won't bother you. But otherwise you'll likely be facing the doomed choice of whether to cheat or to suffer in point and click hell with no clue what to do. And for me, the controls were too cumbersome for me to persevere. I just got tired.\n\n-The coup de gr\u00e2ce was the final puzzle, which requires you to play back some musical notes you hear. This is bad enough because not only do I have no musical talent, but I'm actually hard of hearing in one of my ears (how's that for accessibility). But OK fine, maybe I could have done it anyway, but unbelievably, there is BACKGROUND MUSIC playing while you are supposed to be honing in on this musical sound effect that you'll have to memorize and play back. And the background music is the most horrific, unbearable track in the game! So I'm sitting there, trying to stir up the little musical acumen I have to memorize this melody while suffering through this distracting noise in the background and I broke. I used the walkthrough feature for the first time because to hell with it I just wanted it to be over. And so ended Machinarium for me. Not with a bang, but a whimper.\n\nSo yeah, I WANT to like Machinarium. I like point and click adventure games. The game is cute as hell. The artstyle is gorgeous. The music (other than that one track) is great! The worldbuilding and way it communicates story beats is awesome. And actually, the 2/3rds of the puzzles which clicked for me were pretty enjoyable. There is so much to like! But in the end, this is what my experience was, and I can't lie to you all. My playthrough was buggy, frustrating, and most importantly, fruitless.

I guess the devs did this to discourage players from brute-forcing their way through the puzzles, but when the puzzles aren't logical, sometimes that is the only remaining choice, and this system just makes the process a huge drag.

It has lots of things going for it: a wonderful aesthetic, endearing characters, and good music. But for me, the majority of the gameplay falls flat. \n\nThe graphics and level of detail were overdone. Also the music was very nice - but these puzzles: the totally ridiculous puzzles! How the hell would I ever be able to unravel these partially cruel mysteries? It sometimes was so hilarious that I started to laugh myself to tears whilst reading the walkthrough. Man, was this game some harsh brainteaser...\n\nFor example: At one point you have to go up and down underneath a power line because a bird is sitting on it and you need to get it down. What was I doing? Walking up and down all time with the bird doing the same. I almost exploded. When I finally got the idea to see the robot up and down because that's what he does to reach things high above or down below. That took some doing.\n\nOverall, I would only recommend Machinarium to fans of the genre, as there is really not much to the experience. In addition, there is zero replayability, and the game's length is not reminiscent of the original 90s hits.", "timestamp_created": 1645357019, "timestamp_updated": 1645357019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490130871534347534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110290867": {"recommendationid": "110290867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046881436", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1644928162}, "language": "english", "review": "I both like and dislike this game. \n\nStory is extremely simple in the way it is conveyed, but damn the puzzle elements in this game can be brutal.\n\nThe fact that the game has its own built in walkthrough tells me already that I should expect to get stuck at certain points, and at many I did. To my disappointment, just to access said walkthrough requires its own minigame which runs on far longer than it needs to, and you need to do this EVERY time you want to glance the vague pages contained within. It's not necessarily because the puzzles were too hard (Some absolutely were) that I got stuck, but more-so because the game blends everything together so well that it's hard to differentiate objects and interactables at times, which results in a hodge-podge clickfest where you spam the entire screen seeing if anything will react. \n\nA good deal of the puzzles have the ability to reset in case you back yourself into a corner, others, aren't so forgiving. The bead/abacus styled puzzle infuriated me for this. My initial train of thought led me to a tedious manual rewind to revert puzzle to its base state. Some of the puzzles I genuinely enjoyed, like the Greenhouse switchboard, others I hated. \n\nThe game features a unique mechanic wherein you can only interact with objects that are within arms reach. Whilst this initially comes across as cool this soon overstays its welcome. By the end of the game I was bored and sick to death of having to manually move the robot beside objects I wished to grab, pull, push, twist or turn. I was even further enraged at the absolute piss poor performance of the game in general. It was as if the game was having frequent lag spikes, but not lag per se', but rather, the game slowed, and then sped up again, this occurred quite legitimately every 2 seconds. This impacted absolutely everything in the game, from menu's, to puzzles, to movement, to scripted sequences. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed the game on a surface level, but I have definitively no intentions to ever revisit the game. It has its charm, but the brutal nature of the puzzles being mostly guesswork, even down to their location at times, just kinda of dragged the game down to a slog for me. Whilst I actually quite enjoyed a few puzzles, most just felt they got more obscure the further into the game I progressed. I honestly felt the games strongest point was its opening, all the way until you hit the band, then it got harder, quite faster.\n\nPro's:\n- Cute artstyle that stands out amongst the crowd. \n- Diverse soundtrack to fit a multitude of scenarios and backdrops in this quirky little robot world.\n- Some at times, very clever puzzles that are borderline hard, but easy enough to nail down with a bit of thinking. \n- Extremely easy and simple narrative to follow. Save robot girlfriend; escape. \n- Good sound design that adequately portrays the motions on screen. \n\nCons:\n- Non-conclusive tutorial. Shows you how to grow taller to reach objects, doesn't explain that you can shrink, and you will need to for some puzzles.\n- Some completely mind-wracking puzzles.\n- Tedious, drawn out animations and sequences that you will have to repeat time after time. \n- Completely appalling performance.\n\n\nVerdict: Buy on steep sale. Honestly, at $22 AUD, I cannot recommend this game. The price hardly reflects the content of the game. I have 6 hours recorded and that was even including times I got majorly stuck. I have paid far less for far more.\n\nNeither here nor there. I don't believe this game deserves the appraisal that it's the best point+click ever, but I'd hardly say it was a bad experience. \n\n6.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1644929812, "timestamp_updated": 1644929812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492307692766189575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110254588": {"recommendationid": "110254588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001659743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1644875425}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game, beautiful art, interesting and sometimes mind wexing  (in a good way) puzzles.

To this day, I'm not sure where exactly I heard about it, but its distinct art direction immediately caught my eye.\n\nIn [i]Machinarium[/i] you play as a little robot dude (whose name is, in fact, Josef - something I wasn't aware of until I started writing this review) searching a vast, industrial citadel for his kidnapped girlfriend. Pretty standard protagonist motivation, but the game isn't particularly narrative heavy. Beyond an occasional speech bubble pictogram, the story takes somewhat of a backseat to the gameplay. You're definitely heading [i]somewhere[/i] throughout the game, but the puzzles and setting tend to much more predominantly occupy the mind.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are pretty satisfying to figure out. When I played Machinarium back in 2009, I quickly became overwhelmed once the world opened up and the puzzles began to span over several screens. Coming back to it with more experience in the point-and-click genre, it was certainly tricky in places, but no puzzle was frustratingly convoluted. There's even a built-in minigame that allows you to play a retro-styled side scrolling shoot-em-up, the beating of which earns you a hint for the current screen you're on.\n\nMachinarium's world feels alive, which is ironic since the setting is largely a barren metal metropolis. Some puzzles require interacting with the various characters that populate the world, and others require keenly observing what's in front of you. The character designs are simplistic, but iconic, and it's easy to get behind the plight of our cute robot protagonist.\n\nOne last thing. This game's soundtrack is [b]PERFECTION[/b].\n\nIf for some reason you aren't interested in the same itself, I'd go so far as to recommend simply purchasing the standalone Soundtrack + Art book when its on sale. The soundtrack is pure ear candy. It blends the organic and the synthentic, with tremendously crisp production. Whether you're bopping your head or soaking in the gleaming crystalline ambience, each track keeps your ear guessing what unique sound is going to present itself next. Acoustic recordings and electronic elements blend seamlessly, and everything sits just in the right place in the mix. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (the composer) is clearly a very talented dude, and his work here only elevates an already excellent game to masterpiece status.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1644813817, "timestamp_updated": 1644813817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110149534": {"recommendationid": "110149534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990669989", "num_games_owned": 925, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1646576125}, "language": "english", "review": "OLD but GOLD. \nNice puzzles. \nGreat music. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1644763483, "timestamp_updated": 1644763483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110075361": {"recommendationid": "110075361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024947931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1644685973}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best point-and-click games I've played.

The puzzles are enjoyable and with a wide variety of styles. The story is perfect for a younger age. The graphics are cute and nicely done. The dialogue boxes are also a nice touch, and would also be perfect for a youngster playing.\n\nThe music is very mellow. Even the more uptempo music is relaxing. This fits well with the art and game style. The progression is fun, and allows for a more open feel than many puzzle games that I have played in the past.  \n\nWhile this is a kid friendly game, some of the puzzles might require some parent assistance. This would be a great father and/or mother with son and/or daughter game. This is a great short game for a family activity. There are many different mini games with many different flavors of style, as well as a touch of nostalgia for those around my age. \n\nIn all, this game is recommended, but I would consider it more orientated for the young, and plan on gifting this to my niece for her kiddos.

Combine this with the fact that the game also refuses to allow you to use items with an interactable object unless you're right next to it, and this can quickly lead to being stuck through no fault of your own - I was stymied for half an hour because of this as I used the right object at the correct location, but the game decided my character wasn't close enough and refused the interaction, leading me to believe that it was wrong and to search for another solution.

Relying on visual storytelling and forgoing elaborate dialogue and text boxes, Machinarium's plot is simple and straightforward, but sweet and endearing. Given the fact that no refined concepts and ideas are proposed by the game, its primary strength is the cartoonesque presentation of a surrealistic and decayed world populated by different models of robots. As the player progresses in the story, the lives and conditions of these robotic beings are alluded by the short interactions between them and the protagonist. This minimalistic narrative creates a world that, despite its whimsical characters and aesthetic, feels common, familiar and human.\n\nGameplay revolves around the use of the mouse. All actions are performed by clicking somewhere on the screen, whether to move the playable character, employ an inventory item or manipulate something in the area. It's a modest system that works pretty well most of the time, although the inventory bag may be a bit cumbersome to handle. Moving the robot is also slightly restricted, as it is only allowed to walk to and stay on specific spots in any given screen.\n\nBeing a point n' click game, Machinarium challenges the player with a plethora of puzzles that differ in terms of difficulty and design. Most of these obstacles are intuitive and easy to solve, but others may require a bit of thinking in order to be understood. A hint book with the solutions to these puzzles is available to the player, and each explanation is locked behind a simple minigame -- a necessary penalty to be paid, in case one becomes stuck in a particular conundrum. At first, puzzles are self-contained in their respective screens, but they do spread out later on as the game opens up and the player is given freedom to tackle problems in multiple areas.\n\nIn a few words, Machinarium is a short experience that does not overstay its welcome and should amuse players who enjoy a lighthearted story with a sizeable dose of clever problem-solving.", "timestamp_created": 1640932990, "timestamp_updated": 1640932990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106958803": {"recommendationid": "106958803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298973453", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1640925678}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprised by the quality considering how old this game is.

art.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Original and intriguing background setting with interesting plot.\n+ Has a great variety of puzzles. Some (but very few) are purely logic/deduction-based and are satisfying to solve.\n+ No missable achievement. In fact, you will have unlocked all achievements when you complete the game.\n\nCons:\n- Awkward control and interaction.\n- Slow walking speed of the protagonist. This is exacerbated by the intentional design that you can only know whether an object is interactable when you are near it.\n- Tedious and dragging mini-games, which are compulsory to advance the plot or unlock walkthrough book.\n- Only provides one hint per scene. If you need more, the only option is to consult the in-game walkthrough book. However, this book is unlocked on a per-scene basis and requires playing a mini-game.\n- Most puzzles are moon logic kind. Really difficult to proceed without any hints, which are difficult to obtain due to the previous point.\n\nDespite its strength in animation and music, I cannot recommend this game since its puzzle design is atrocious. This opinion is shared by many other negative reviews on Steam, which you are more than recommended to read if you are still on the fence.

Just seeing the little guy dance during one of the puzzles is just pure delight and much cuter than watching videos of puppies.\n\nThe music is also really good, it sets the mood nicely in each screens and some tunes in specific parts of the game will stick in your head being so catchy!\n\nWithout giving away too many spoilers, let's stay the story is quite basic. Even without dialogues, it has its own charm and the characters are all wonderfully designed that you will love each of them. There is an underlying sense of humor in most small cut scenes which helps attach you to them.\n \nThe one important thing to note is that this game is [b]VERY HARD![/b]\nSome puzzles are obscure, the in game hint system can help you a little bit but sometimes you might still end up stuck. A big difference with other classic point & click games is that this one will only tell you if an item combination or action works if in the zone of interaction of your little guy, meaning you can click on an item and select a panel across the screen where you guy is, you have to move him next to it, so it might take more time to find what's interactive or not.\nThere are also various mini games but nothing too demanding action wise, some are simple puzzles while others are really more like small Atari games.\n\nI highly recommend this game since unlike some other point & click classics, it didn't age at all and is a very beautiful and challenging game. You might want to wait a sale to get it cheaper since it can be beaten rushed in less than 3 hours but it will be a very nice 3 hours (unless you drive yourself crazy with the puzzles!).", "timestamp_created": 1638836215, "timestamp_updated": 1638836215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105380479": {"recommendationid": "105380479", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219549485", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1640496653}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buenos acertijos y bastante desafiantes y buen dise\u00f1o de personajes", "timestamp_created": 1638834982, "timestamp_updated": 1638834982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105306665": {"recommendationid": "105306665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972396821", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1638725722}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming game, though I'll admit I was using hints more than I'd have liked.

A continuaci\u00f3n os cuento los motivos:\n\n[h1]Argumento:[/h1] (no incluye spoilers)\n\nControlamos a Josef, un peque\u00f1o robot que se ve envuelto en un l\u00edo por error, teniendo como objetivo rescatar a su novia Berta, que ha sido secuestrada por la Hermandad del Sombrero Negro.\n\nCon este t\u00edpico y simple argumento, que deducimos tras leer la ficha del juego y tras ir avanzando en los primeros compases de la aventura, nos damos cuenta de que la profundidad del mismo es algo secundario en este juego. De hecho, no se dice ni una sola palabra durante toda la aventura, todo se deduce a partir de gestos, \"bocadillos\" tipo c\u00f3mic con garabatos trazados a mano de una forma simple pero que acompa\u00f1ados de las animaciones y gestos dotan de una expresividad maravillosa al juego.\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\n\nSe puede usar mando, pero l\u00f3gicamente para este tipo de juegos se recomienda mucho m\u00e1s el uso del rat\u00f3n. Como en todos los point & click el control es simple, pon el cursor del rat\u00f3n sobre la zona/objeto con el que quieres interactuar y listo. En Machinarium el cursor cambia a la forma de la mano de Josef para poder interactuar, donde no se pueda simplemente no cambiar\u00e1. Es simple pero efectivo, aunque tambi\u00e9n he de reconocer que a veces no responde del todo bien si lo comparamos con otras grandes aventuras gr\u00e1ficas similares, a la hora de marcar lo que queremos hacer podr\u00eda haber estado m\u00e1s pulido y ser m\u00e1s fino, tambi\u00e9n a la hora de deshacer una acci\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\n\nUno de los apartados m\u00e1s destacables de Machinarium. No son unos gr\u00e1ficos que destaquen por su gran calidad ni por su realismo como ya habr\u00e9is podido apreciar con solo ver la portada del juego o las im\u00e1genes, pero el mimo con el que est\u00e1n dibujados a mano todos los dise\u00f1os de los personajes y escenarios es impresionante, que acompa\u00f1ado de unas simp\u00e1ticas animaciones dotan al juego de un aspecto \u00fanico y genial.\n\n[h1]Sonido:[/h1]\n\nOtro apartado genial de Machinarium. La banda sonora es sobresaliente (pod\u00e9is escucharla en Spotify [url=https://open.spotify.com/album/52PLNrXUMtPUZwcueV75J1?si=5NoMnLQeTdOZw2z3bkNsOw&dl_branch=1]AQU\u00cd[/url]), a\u00f1adiendo el sonido ambiental y los que reproducen los personajes, que como os dije antes no hablan pero entre sus gestos, ruidos y lo que muestran sus pensamientos por medio de los \"bocadillos\" nos har\u00e1n saber en todo momento qu\u00e9 quieren expresarnos.\n\nSin m\u00e1s, os dejo mi lista de pros y contras:\n\n[H1][b]PROS:[/b][/H1]\n\n- La est\u00e9tica es simplemente genial, los dise\u00f1os dibujados a mano le dan un aspecto \u00fanico\n\n- La banda sonora es sobresaliente  (pod\u00e9is escucharla en Spotify [url=https://open.spotify.com/album/52PLNrXUMtPUZwcueV75J1?si=5NoMnLQeTdOZw2z3bkNsOw&dl_branch=1]AQU\u00cd[/url])\n\n- La gran variedad de puzles\n\n- Los escenarios\n\n- El carisma de los personajes a pesar de no decir ni una sola palabra en todo el juego\n\n- Est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol\n\n- El original sistema de pistas\n\n- Tiene logros Steam\n\n- Tiene cromos y art\u00edculos en la tienda de puntos de Steam\n\n- Se puede encontrar a buen precio en \u00e9pocas de ofertas\n\n[H1][b]CONTRAS:[/b][/H1]\n\n- Se hace corto, aunque todo depende de la destreza que tengas para solucionar los diferentes puzles\n\n- La dificultad de algunos de sus rompecabezas puede echar atr\u00e1s a algunos jugadores\n\n- Los logros solo son por avanzar en la historia, hubiese estado bien a\u00f1adir alguno \u201cperdible\u201d\n\n- El control no responde todo lo bien que deber\u00eda en algunas ocasiones\n\n- Algo inestable, he sufrido alguna que otra salida al escritorio en una zona concreta (la escena de la c\u00e1rcel debajo de la mesa)\n\n[H1]Conclusi\u00f3n:[/h1]\n\nUna peque\u00f1a joya, ya solo por la forma en la que est\u00e1 contada la historia, el mimo de su apartado visual y su banda sonora, resulta un t\u00edtulo imprescindible si te gustan las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas estilo \u201cpoint & click\".\n\nSi mi an\u00e1lisis te ha gustado o te ha servido de ayuda, agradecer\u00eda que dejaras un voto positivo para que pueda llegar a m\u00e1s gente.

I appreciated that you can complete every achievement just by finishing the main story line. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nEven though some puzzles might be quite challenging, it is pretty clear what the goal is. Except for one case, where it was not clear at all and I just had to take a guess. Although it is quite common to have hints in this kind of games, it's the first time that I see the game itself providing the whole walkthrough for a certain area directly in the game. What I mean is that, if you are stuck in this game, you can simply play a minigame to access the whole solution. I have used once but I felt it was too much detailed and complete, giving me way more information than I needed. I liked a lot that items get thrown away after being used, so, you do not keep your inventory full with stuff that you won't probably need anymore.\n\nI had the feeling from the start that I would see and know more about the surrounding world but the game does not explore what is around the initial city, nor it gives any explanation on why there is a town of robots and why some of them grow plants. But it's just like that. Moreover, there are so many puzzle that I think the point&click game has been built around a puzzle game.\n\nConcerning its duration, I have finished it in 7 hours and personally I feel it was a bit \"too short\" compared to other Point&Click games, but it is just my opinion. \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\nI have really appreciated the decision to avoid any kind of written dialogue by focusing on visual communication. The graphic design is quite particular, someone might like it or not. However, you can immediately see from the start the attention to details and animations.

Gorgeous pencil art with hypnotic Radiohead-esque soundtrack really will draw a lot of your attention. The almost movie-like story-telling is also enamoring. However, below the surface lies a difficult game, one that is not suited for mere casuals. If you\u2019re willing to persevere headache-inducing puzzles, the story-telling, art and music can be rewarding. \n--------------------\n[b]What\u2019s Excellent[/b]\n--------------------\nThe hand-drawn pencil art graphics, character designs and world-building are [u]top-tier movie quality animation.[/u] Machinarium is a looker and coupled with a [u]high-class experimental electronica[/u] gives bleak but hopeful atmosphere. Never have escaping from dystopia been so cute. \n\nEven though the plot is very generic, the [u]clever story-telling[/u] deserves praise as well. There are no dialogue in Machinarium; all the narrative is done visually and it the delivery is splendid. \n--------------------\n[b]What\u2019s Bad[/b]\n--------------------\n[u]Controls are not good[/u] to be honest. For a Point & Click game, the pointing and clicking sure feels clunky. Moving from point A to point B is simply guesswork and once you initiate movement, sometimes you can\u2019t cancel or stop. \n\nThe [u]user interface is also pretty bad.[/u] Your inventory is just a top panel and is tedious to access, while your taskbar sometimes gets in your way when you\u2019re trying to do complex puzzles. \n--------------------\n[b]What\u2019s In The Middle[/b]\n--------------------\nThe gameplay is decent. The puzzles are great but there are varying degrees of difficulty ranging from easy to extremely hard. I\u2019m talking about abstract thinking and mathematical thought processes near esoteric level. If you are an average person, these puzzles are daunting. There is a manual that can help you as well as a hint button. But to access the manual - which only tells you how to solve [i]some[/i] puzzles - you will need to play a short shoot-em-up game. And the harder puzzles such as the Prison Lock puzzle, The 3 Wrenches puzzle, or the Bead Puzzle are not given solutions, rather you\u2019re suppose to figure it all out yourself. \n--------------------\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n--------------------\nThis is going to be a soft recommendation from me.

I didn't really know much about this game before I played it but I became intrigued by the soundtrack, which is made by Floex(Tomas Dvorak) and then promptly fully convinced by what I saw when I looked it up on steam. And man am I glad I played this little gem.\n\nFrom the first time I got into it I was fully absorbed into the rich, beautiful atmosphere and the cute robotic characters that lived in it, as well as the chilled out but engaging point and click game play mechanics. Tomas absolutely does not disappoint with the soundtrack (my favorite track is 'By the Wall'), which stays true to his pretty, often jazzy, ambient electronic style and perfectly backdrops the gorgeous hand made environments that Machinarium offers throughout every level of the game. Most of the experience is spent in a melancholic cityscape brought to life by impossibly charismatic robots, an adorable childlike main character and convincing intractable set pieces, which are used to solve the puzzles and navigate through the city. Nearly every part of this game seems to have an over the top, blunt way of expressing itself to you in place of conventional dialogue and storytelling, making just existing within the game whilst you play it an absolute joy. \n\nThe cute main robot and point and click puzzle game play of Machinarium actually serve to pull you even deeper into it's world by forcing you to think about the oppressing, intense city with a naive, childlike curiosity. I only spent 15 hours on it but in retrospect it feels like much longer. The puzzles are fairly challenging and have a brilliant way of feeling rewarding without being too obvious or too obscure. I personally found the arcade game you have to play to unlock hints a bit grading at first, however, that actually inspired me to try and use it more sparingly. By referencing previous levels and scrutinizing my entire computer screen, I could usually lead myself to that glorious \"aha\" moment. When I did need help, the hints are always just vague enough to lead you down the right path without losing the fun value.\n\nAll in all, Machinarium is a textbook example of the power in simplicity, quality over quantity and a rare, special game that I think almost anyone could enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1621984638, "timestamp_updated": 1621984638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92519107": {"recommendationid": "92519107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014687898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1839, "last_played": 1651967792}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game several years ago and I find myself coming back to this game.

Amanita design are a master in their field, and the stunning scenes they create are truly wonderful to navigate, the city of Machinarium truly feels like a living city,  and your journey through it's crumbling and rusted streets and plazas make you wonder as to the backstory of the setting, something that is never really explained, it is plain however that Machinarium is only a shadow of it's former self, and you get the feeling the city is, if not dying, certainly falling into a deeper disrepair.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and interesting, and if you get stuck don't feel like you shouldn't use the help book, because you actually have to work for your help in this game by... completing a small minigame, this is a masterful way of making the tip book not feel like cheating, along with the fact the book is written in the same odd language the robots use, I love this, as it means that the book is a physical item the main character owns, not just an intangible cheat guide, and therefore there's nothing to make you feel bad about using it if you get stuck, I know I certainly did a few times.\n\nI you want a challenging game with stunning art direction and a charming story, Machinarium is the game for you, and so is Samarost, Amanita's other flagship work, and one you should check out too.", "timestamp_created": 1621270901, "timestamp_updated": 1621270901,

It sat on my backlog for an inexcusable 7 years! I am writing this review to publicly admit to and atone for this mistake. Machinarium is a really good game! You should play it.\n\nEverything about this game is charming. The art is wonderful. In an age where most indie games have amazing art, it really manages to stand out with it's grungy picture book aesthetic. There is an obvious amount of care and detail placed into the animation and the character design. \n\nThe score contains everything from blissed out ambient vibes to funky robot party music. Every song has a wistful, slightly broken sound and every sound effect is perfectly chosen to compliment the score. Every screen is just bursting with personality and life.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, maybe a little easy, but the joy never really came for me from being stumped by an obtuse solution. It was more fun to see something and know that it would be used in a puzzle somehow and remembering to come back to it at the right point. Almost like a Metroidvania, I really enjoyed opening up new areas or interactions that were initially just out of reach.\n\nThe story is an absolute masterclass in telling a simple narrative effectively. There's no dialogue, just a bunch of goofy robots and the occasional thought bubble. You are given the information you need as you go and the game just lets the world speak for itself. A lot of games try to do this now, so many fail, but it's one of Machinarium's biggest strengths.\n\nIf you have this game sitting in your library, just knock it out.

It's able to make a dystopian city that looks a bit run down come to life with the sheer detail that's put into the world and humorous character designs. Gameplay wise it's a decent point and click that I'd recommend for beginners due to the mostly basic puzzles and short game length, however there's not much more upside to that. \n\nA few issues I have is that some of the puzzles aren't exactly intuitive but basic enough to be solved with a little bit of trial and error which I didn't find all that satisfying. The other issue I had involved a puzzle that required to be able to differentiate music notes which isn't really a skill I have and so I had to use the solution book in order to progress that. Lastly there is a puzzle in the game that was broken for me until I discovered I had to change my window resolution in order for the controls to work which was a bit annoying.\n\nAs for the price point I wouldn't buy this game unless it were on sale as I feel $22 AUD is a premium price for a game that doesn't really offer more than a few hours of playtime, but nonetheless if you're a beginner wanting to explore the point and click genre I'd say this is a good entry game at best.", "timestamp_created": 1619495856, "timestamp_updated": 1619496072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558011054992675781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90906806": {"recommendationid": "90906806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844241441", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1675389719}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sinceramente, uno de los mejores Point and click que jugu\u00e9 en mi infancia, tiene buena historia y creo que buenos gr\u00e1ficos, es f\u00e1cil entenderlo y completarlo.", "timestamp_created": 1619368280, "timestamp_updated": 1641237876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90864336": {"recommendationid": "90864336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023243674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 266, "playtime_at_review": 956, "last_played": 1700358309}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1619303255, "timestamp_updated": 1619303255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90755257": {"recommendationid": "90755257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022378098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 380, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1619131589}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice artwork but the gameplay is too cumbersome.

With that said, I really liked it. I was originally drawn toward this game for its art and and that is probably the strongest part of the game and what you should be playing it for (You see the trailer, the whole game is consistently just that good).\n\nI heard some point&click are very story-driven. Not this one though, its story is as simple as stop the bad guys and save your girlfriend. \n\nAs for the item / logic puzzles, I enjoyed most of them, but to my limited knowledge, there isn't anything groundbreaking there. There is nothing I'd really call moon logic, and there was only two times ever I gave up and used the guide. I did really like how player-friendly the game is. I don't think there is anyway to softlock yourself, and any item you no longer need for latter puzzles are always taken away. \n\nSomething I really liked was the hint system. In each screen, you get a hint, which usually point you to what you should work toward doing for that puzzle, without telling you the answer. Thanks to this system, there is rarely a point in a game in which I have no idea what I should do, without having to look up a walkthrough and potentially get spoiled.\n\nThe only problem I have is that sometimes I don't actually know what I'm solving a puzzle for. I mean, it usually always give you an item that let you solve some other puzzle, it's just not always clear what that item is.

If you like the point & click genre, you should really try it out.We play a robot trying to save his lover in a dystopian robot world with beautiful puzzles and a very pretty sweet design style.The game's unique world, pastel color palette, drawings / designs and pretty good music make the game great. On the other hand, it seems like every frame is made for watching, every sound and music you can hear. The story is fluid and intriguing, and the puzzle parts are sufficiently challenging.

Many, many times I dropped my mouse and left the game because of one puzzle I didn\u2019t accomplish, or because I couldn\u2019t find the key clue. I admit I used a guide to solve some of the most annoying puzzles, but still: the game managed to find a way to challenge me with brain requiring tasks or with retro arcade games that I have NO experience with from childhood. The implication is that as beautiful as the game might look with its mechanic, color reduced art style and its melancholic-epic soundtrack, it was no inspiring but rather a stressful experience I didn\u2019t fully complete until today. Probably it is meant to be exactly like that: not every puzzle can be solved just by looking at, it takes several tries and a bit of brain effort, and maybe is speaks in Machinariums favor that I sticked to it as long as I did (over 5 hours in total). But when even the lead leaves me with a big question mark over my head, it saps my motivation to try again and again and again. \n\nI would only recommend it for the really persistent \u2013 and the well-prepared.

It's technological landscape allows both for a great variety of robots and neutral colors, and the few times where there is brightness really pop. Audio-wise, the game also is a success: the music and sound effects are ambient, quirky, and the \"robo-talk\" is delightful. The occasional humorous moments, like the neighbor upset at the robots playing music outside her window, or the robot upset that he lost Tic-Tac-Toe, are quite nice. There's a surprising amount of story and comedic material that the game gets out of its aesthetic and presentation style.\n\nThe gameplay itself is reminiscent of the point-and-click puzzle games of yesteryear, like \"Myst.\" There are a series of objects, levers, and other such things that you can interact with. You gain an inventory as you progress through various rooms and puzzles, and you can also combine items in your inventory to increase their utility. I do appreciate when games do something interesting with the items you keep on you in order to vary up how to progress.\n\nBut alas, there were rather a few times playing the game where I wanted to throw up my hands and just say, \"Okay...now what?\" Assuming you've already clicked most things in the room to see what you can and cannot do, the game does provide a hint system for figuring out tasks, but even then, there's a problem: unlike \"The Room\" and \"The Room Two,\" \"Machinarium\" only provides one VISUAL hint per puzzle, meaning that if you can't decipher what it is that you need to do, or it's something that you've already completed, you don't necessarily get that much of a hint at all. There is a way to get more overt help if you're truly struggling by playing a minigame, but that seems more like the game's way of admitting that some solutions are too obscure.\n\nPart of this obscurity is because you cannot do certain things unless you are standing next to objects that you can interact with. Want to give the robot some oil? Whoops! You have to click to walk next to the robot before you can go to the inventory and select the oil. Want to get the drawer full of slides? Whoops! You have to click to walk next to the desk rather and THEN click the drawer, rather than simply clicking on the drawer from across the room. While this seems like a tiny annoyance, it makes the game more needlessly-cumbersome than it has to be. Especially for some of the more in-depth object interactions, having to place the objects in the exact spot the game demands of you was unwelcome. I'm sorry that I didn't put the ball bearings on the small space where the game wanted me to in the arbitrary time limit. Now I have to waste another minute to set this all up again.\n\nThere are other things gameplay-wise that don't make much sense. While I like the idea of being able to extend and contract yourself, the game allows you to walk while extended. Not only is there no reason whatsoever to do this (as no puzzles require it), but your walking speed is greatly reduced, making me wonder why it was programmed as an option in the first place. Combine this with not being able to easily cancel a walk cycle, and you can feel the seconds of your life getting wasted. The \"Space Invaders\" clone game was another unneeded touch, especially since it was part of a puzzle you had to complete. There are also an odd number of \"middle steps\" you need to take in order to solve some of these puzzles. Congratulations; you found a key! Oh...the key didn't work on the lock? Well, you should have gone back to the elevator and used the key there to open the door to get the freeze spray and then spray it on the lock which you can then smash...why not just have the key?\n\nA good puzzle game makes the player feel rewarded for solving its brain-busters, but \"Machinarium\" left me scratching my head more than I'd like to admit and unfulfilled as I progressed and eventually beat it. I know this game has its enthusiasts, but I sadly am not one of them. The game is not terrible, not by any means! But as an experience, it left my empty.

(this might be a negative)\n[/list]\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n [h1] Review [/h1] \n\nAt this point in time, Machinarium should be revered as a modern classic in the adventure game genre. It stands the test of time as an indie wonder which not only sparked an interest for the minimalist story-telling but brought back puzzle adventure games from the brink of Lucas Arts deathbed. As of writing this review I have replayed the game after not touching it for about 10 years, this time using an iPad. It is not truly an iPad review, neither can I accurately talk about the PC port more than the fact that they are very similar and I can happily recommend both.\n\nI did refer to Lucas Arts, but truly Machinarium does not fully operate in the same space. Instead of dialogue driven adventures, Machinarium is more heavily reliant on puzzles. The inventory and item spamming on any interactive object or character is still there, but so are a good bunch of logic puzzles that take center-stage. This keeps a nice balance of the creative item interactions and the more logic driven brain teasers, without being too farfetched nor high IQ for the everyday player. Interactions with other characters are communicated with what I could describe as \"supply and demand\" thought bubbles that tells you how to progress or how to help out your fellow robot friend, while solutions are often narrowed down to a small amount of options. Even though you several times after finally finding a solution, smack your head because you should have found that solution earlier than you did. It is fun, satisfying and clever. Sometimes too clever for you, which brings me to a nice point. The hints.\n\nGrowing up with the likes of Lucas Arts games, in the time of no walkthroughs available, I think I developed thick skin to the most grueling and downright idiotic puzzles. Therefore I would never be the one to complain when a puzzle gets me really stuck, as I've seen many players do nowadays. Nevertheless the very player friendly hint system at play in Machinarium should be cherished. It consists of a hint button which gives 1 obscure hint (and 1 only) in the screen you're visiting, and a walkthrough book which are unlocked for the specific screen by playing a small minigame. The game thus challenges your patience by a minigame for you to be able to advance, which I think is a cute solution to the hint debacle which plagues present players. Did it have to exist? No. Am I happy it does? Certainly.\n\nWhat about the game in general? The art is delivered in a warm palette, steampunk charm and rusty robotics. It is a city for the machines, where oil drinking, jazz bands, arcades and robot deities and coppers are prevalent. It is a city of ill-doers and bullies, old and young, lonely and lovely, cats and bugs. Spite it's cold robot heart, it is packed with character and adventure feel. Your protagonist can make himself bigger and smaller like an accordion which is easily accessible and if you idle for too long you will receive a flashback to happier times with your robot love. The sound design is delightful, while the story is just about right. The game could have been expanded upon and been given a more resonating ending, but as it stands, Machinarium is a great effort.\n\nSome nitpicks though. If you want to interact with an object you have to move your character first to the spot to reach, which means traversing the world sometime isn't as smooth. Movement can also not be cancelled, so you might be making a wrong step and do a bunch of back and forth in this game, as movement animations can't be sped up either. But all in all these are minor complaints about time saving, which you won't need as the game is at max 4 hours long anyways.\n\nA must play for adventure/puzzle game enthusiasts, a fringe game for those not familiar and a calming game for those that enjoy art and thought exercises. If not for the PC longplays, buy it for the tablet and just enjoy a soothing evening in the sofa.\n\n\n[b]8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1609239749, "timestamp_updated": 1609610239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764200329780578613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83435904": {"recommendationid": "83435904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961586005", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1609202183}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game like a comic adventure.

[/quote]\n\nLet's start with the good things first, you can clearly tell there was a lot of effort put into this game, from the [b][i][u]captivating art style to the sound design and music[/u][/i][/b]. The game itself breeds a lot of life and makes me want to visit that place and meet all those people. To put it simply, [b][i][u]this game is eye candy[/u][/i][/b], but the moment you start playing the game you will realize how [b][i][u]bland and dull[/u][/i][/b] it really is.\n\n[h1]Now, why did I not enjoy this game?[/h1]\nTo move and interact with the world you need to (as the name suggests) click on stuff, which leads to some very frustrating scenarios that pulled me out of the game:\nFirst of all, [b][i][u]there is no clear distinction between what is interactable and what isn't[/u][/i][/b], where you can walk to and where you can't. You need to be physically close to that place for your cursor to tell you, and even then, [b][i][u]you need to have the pointer on top of it[/u][/i][/b]. I spent a significant amount of time just aimlessly moving my mouse to see if I bumped into something I could interact with.\n\nThat leads us to the second issue, which is [b][i][u]the puzzles[/u][/i][/b]. You will essentially encounter [b][i][u]two types of puzzles[/u][/i][/b] in this game. \n[list]\n[*] The first, and most common one is to find something that unlocks what blocks your path. All the \"depth\" these puzzles could have is thrown out the window the moment you realize [b][i][u]you can just spam click on every single asset in the game[/u][/i][/b]. Sure, on paper the way you solve the puzzle sounds interesting, but gameplay wise [b][i][u]you are just backtracking around the map looking for trash just to unlock your path[/u][/i][/b]. And the solutions for these puzzles range from quite intuitive to pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s logical.\n[*] The second type of puzzles were the ones that would be considered challenging, it can be a hit or miss. [b][i][u]Some are pretty good; others are just a chore[/u][/i][/b] where I feel like I am constantly bumping into a wall until I find the solution.\n[/list]\nBut by far, [b][i][u]the most annoying thing[/u][/i][/b] in this game is the [b][i][u]lack of responsiveness[/u][/i][/b]. [b][i][u]Every animation CAN\u2019T be interrupted[/u][/i][/b], so if you do something you didn't wanted to do, you will be forced to watch the ENTIRE animation until your character is finished. \n\nLet's say you want to walk close to a door, but instead click the ladders that are right next to it, well TOUGH LUCK F*CKER, now you have to watch how he walks the ENTIRE WAY, goes up the ladders, and AFTER ALL THAT still be out of control watching the character go down the ladders. Sure, [b][i][u]it doesn't happen that often, and at best you will lose 15 seconds, but trust me, it\u2019s frustrating and piles up fast[/u][/i][/b].\n\nThe game took me around [b][i][u]4 hours to finish[/u][/i][/b], but realistically speaking, it will take you between 3 and 6 depending on your playthrough. And I mean, that's fine, there are plenty of excellent games that are short, but [b][i][u]this game has no reason whatsoever to be replayed[/u][/i][/b]. \n\n[b][i][u]Once you finish this game, every subsequent game plays the same[/u][/i][/b], I could only see myself playing this game again for the art style. But if that's the case, what's the point of buying this game in the first place? You could easily appreciate the puzzles and the art style a lot more by just watching a YouTube playthrough.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you don't like point and click games but are interested in this game because of the art style, [b][i][u]watch a walkthrough video instead[/u][/i][/b].", "timestamp_created": 1608853816, "timestamp_updated": 1608853990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484773725271224976", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83027839": {"recommendationid": "83027839", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000438074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1579986625}, "language": "english", "review": "The first Amanita Developer game I played so I got stuck figuring out puzzles quite often.\nThe beautiful steampunk artwork, the absolutely adorable and lovable characters, and the pleasant soundtrack kept me company while figuring stuff out.\nI do remember checking a few solutions online which were the kinds that takes many trial-and-error attempts so I guess I saved some time there :P", "timestamp_created": 1608803091, "timestamp_updated": 1608803091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83020661": {"recommendationid": "83020661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041012261", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1143, "last_played": 1653163085}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game of all time IMO, everybody should play this at least once in their lives", "timestamp_created": 1608793666, "timestamp_updated": 1608793666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83008044": {"recommendationid": "83008044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400397997", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1608822435}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely Perfect\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1608777151, "timestamp_updated": 1608777151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82998342": {"recommendationid": "82998342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862535238", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1608765140}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice, simple puzzle game.

The puzzles are fair, the minigames, always part of the story and not put in randomly, make for a good change of pace. \n\nI applaud the creators' attempts at changing or refining established features of the genre when it comes to the controls and handling, with two exceptions: restricting your ability to do stuff to where you stand is a bad idea, especially as you're never quite sure whether something can't be done in general or isn't even attempted for lack of reach. You get used to that, however - unlike the other small problem the game suffers from, a brilliant idea actually, with a terrible execution. Each level offers an inbuilt walkthrough, a scribbled storyboard that helps you along if you're stuck - or don't know what you have to do in general. To unlock that storyboard, you have to play an arcade minigame, and that one is a spidery abomination with long stretches of empty space in between randomly generated repetitive stages.\n\nApart from that minor niggle (mentioned only because it is just so incomprehensibly bad in comparison to everything else), this game is a joy, and especially recommended for those adventure fans who need a change of pace from the verbosity and purple prose of others...", "timestamp_created": 1608720373, "timestamp_updated": 1608720373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82826167": {"recommendationid": "82826167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032491327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1608562255}, "language": "english", "review": "What a stunningly beautiful point&click game.

This is a game that would be in my all time favourite indie game list if I had one and here\u2019s why:\n\nUsing  this type of [u][b]artwork[/b][/u] for a video game was a really good idea. The game\u2019s not new anymore, yet it looks like it could have been made in 2020. It\u2019s artistic in a way that makes it ageless. Every scene looks like a painting - if nothing else, it\u2019s just beautiful to look at. Furthermore, bringing in the theme of a machine city, gives it a very Gigerish feel, if you happen to be familiar with the mastermind behind the Alien movie designs. But where Giger mixed horror with eroticism, Machinarium comes off cute and weird \u2013 like steampunk. Machinarium is like steampunk mixed with Giger\u2019s artwork.\n\nMachinarium is first and foremost a [u][b]puzzle game[/b][/u]. The puzzles are strong and tied to logic. I did feel frustrated at times when I was unable to see the solutions, but I always ended up admitting to myself that I had overlooked something of importance and it was not the game designer\u2019s bad choices. The puzzles also help with enhancing the experience in how they\u2019ve been executed. They\u2019re conducted in a makeshift fashion that you would expect from a world that looks like a huge junkyard and solving them feels fun.\n\n[u][b]Sounds[/b][/u] in Machinarium do not carry any articulated messages so any meaningful information is delivered through visual and auditory imagery. They did stumble here a bit with the most obvious case being the usage of the word \u201eOil\u201d, which did stand out as a failure where it was occurred. I wish they had stayed true to the main principle without any exception. It\u2019s usually tricky to pull off, but if used correctly then the effect is very strong and really helps with putting one\u2019s fantasy to work.\n\nBesides puzzles, game obstacles also came in the form of [u][b]mini-games[/b][/u] and here Machinarium pays homage to many classic games including arcade games. Boy did I have fun with the mini games of Machinarium! The only letdown was the one you had to play if you wanted hints to help you with the puzzles. I wish they had made it more dynamic and interesting. Currently it just feels like chores you have to endure if you wish to see some hints.\n\nTo [u][b]sum things up[/b][/u], I wish to bring out the most important: the game feels and looks iconic.

It is worth purchasing even if you have never played the game and it makes for great chill or meditative music, especially when you are in an industrious or contemplative state-of-mind. The visuals are artistically stunning and the puzzles can be challenging while not being overly frustrating. For the most part, the puzzles can be figured out pretty linearly but the hint system is cool as it give you the right direction to head towards when you feel like you've been wandering around too long.\n\nThe best advice I can give is:  Press the Space Bar when fighting spiders.\n\nOverall, Machinarium is a very soothing and relaxing experience. The story is cute, and does an amazing job at not needing a single word to tell it.

I especially like the othello/tictactoe board game in the pub, so I'll be going back for that, I know.  \nartwork            100/100 \ntunage/sounds  95/100 \noverall game     85/100", "timestamp_created": 1597369144, "timestamp_updated": 1597369144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74248215": {"recommendationid": "74248215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042282293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1694451913}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1597335809, "timestamp_updated": 1597335809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74154406": {"recommendationid": "74154406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091595788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1597192609}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent", "timestamp_created": 1597179120, "timestamp_updated": 1597179120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74131647": {"recommendationid": "74131647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037276467", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1597221218}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is just a waste of time.

The art style is really good and cute, it has this picture book kind of feel to it witch I like it\u2019s again pretty cute, and the levels in the game were fun to explore or just stop and look at.\n\nThe story was good, like with the game Dropsy, there is no dialogue spoken it's all just picture balloons which is nice, the game does well to convey its story through that. \n\nThe mini game you can play to unlock the walkthrough was pretty cool and kind of fun. The games puzzle are a mixed bag for me some could be good some could just be a real pain.\n\nOkay now the dislikes. As I said the puzzles are a mixed bag some are good, but others can be a real pain to figure out.  \n\nThen there is the mini game you play to unlock the walkthrough, the problem with that is that it doesn't stay unlocked in the level you're doing, your going to have to play the mini game to see the walkthrough for that level.\n\nIn the game you can\u2019t give a person an item or get an item without being right next to it. You see an other Point and Click games when you see an item or you have an item for someone you click it/them and no matter how far away the main character is they walk right over to the item or person. But in this game it does not have that; you have to be right next to them to do that which can be a pain.\n\nAnd lastly the game is a bit too expensive like it's  almost fifteen bucks it makes sense it was like $9 or 10 but almost 15, is definitely a bit too high.\n\nSo with that all said and done with Machinarium is an okay and cute Point and Click, Puzzle game, with a really good and cute art style, fun levels to explorer and a good story.

(I'd rather not use a guide for the puzzles themselves too.)\n\nThe music is gorgeous. It truly brings the artwork to another level, something I don't see to this extent in many pieces of media. Actually I don't even mind just staying in one spot just to listen to those robot musicians play their song. \n\nAlso, Josef is a really cute character, I especially loved his tiny dances and adorable noises.

I missed a pipe on a screen at some point and was wandering around like crazy, not knowing where to go. Also, the puzzles test different aspects of intelligence (sound, spatial awareness, patterns, logic, reflexes, etc). Although the puzzles are manageable with some effort, some puzzles might seem harder than others. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though.

It is so much above the ordinary! Machinarium is a mixture of pure puzzle (such as solving a moving marble puzzle to open a lock) and inventory-based adventure game (such as picking up a flower stem, which later you will plant in a pot in another building).\n\nSPOILER ALERT : - If you really want to enjoy the game without having any degradation in fun levels and wanna leave it to to your intuitive thinking of solving puzzles, STOP READING and buy this game right away . THE REVIEW BASICALLY ENDS HERE.\n\nYou're in a wonderfully drawn and painted world inhabited by robots. There are no words spoken when robots interact. Rather you see thought balloons with a little video that moves the story along, or a pictogram or figure of an item that a robot wants. The way emotions are portrayed without words is inventive. Reminds me of the movie \"Wall-E\".\n\nThe protagonist is just as cute as Wall-E. He's a little robot who's sweet on a little girl robot. Unfortunately, there are bully robots, and their evil plans must be thwarted.\n\nI thought all of the puzzles were pretty challenging and some of them are DIFFICULT. Wow - hurt my brain and I got tired of me muttering to myself, \"No, that doesn't work. Maybe if I move it this way.\" Only one, to defuse a bomb, is timed, and if you don't make it in time, the game dumps you back to right before you started working on the bomb. I \"died\" the first time, but what was good (for me) is that what you managed to learn the first time still holds true the 2nd time, so the 2nd time I didn't need as much time and defused the bomb.\n\nIf you need a hint, there's a little lightbulb over the scene. When you click on it, it gives you a pictogram of what you need to do next. The lightbulb didn't help me much, because I generally knew what I was supposed to do, I just had trouble finding out how to do it. What was much more useful, however, was the booklet, \"machinarium walkthrough\" that came with this Collector's Edition. The walkthrough is a work of art, itself. The whole thing is in handdrawn pictures/pictograms, such as the thought balloons in the game. It is marvelous! And I had to resort to it more than once, though I'm not sure why I couldn't figure out on my own that bringing bees into the oil pub to distract the bartender was the way to get the barrel out the door.\n\nThere was only one \"puzzle\" that I really didn't like and that was the giant one at the end. It's like a pac-man game where you have lives and after you unlock a gun you have to \"get\" 33 red evil robots in order to finish the puzzle, including finding the buggers as you go from one screen to another trying to make your way through a maze. I don't like games like that and I'm not good at games like that (latter contributes to the former, of course!). Though I could tell that it was much slower, etc., than real pac-man, I still had trouble (reflexes of a slug) and just got annoyed that I had to do this to proceed. Brain-puzzles I love. Reflex puzzles I don't. BUT - I'm sure most people wouldn't have trouble with it, so there you go. And fortunately for me, the booklet that stays throughout the gameplay on the screen has a map of the maze, so at least I could figure out where I was.\n\nRegards,\nA Happy Gamer", "timestamp_created": 1595504824, "timestamp_updated": 1595504824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661070764064788818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73115228": {"recommendationid": "73115228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063995252", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1595428528}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una odisea rom\u00e1ntica en donde encarnaras un peque\u00f1o robot cuyo \u00fanico objetivo es rescatar a su <3.

I'd forget about it at times but it was always in the back of my head as a challenging but pretty, cute and engaging P&C game.\n\nWell I finally got it on steam and.. I really don't like it as much...\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nIt's absolutely beautiful, just like I remembered! The music is nice and calming.\nIt's fluid enough in how it looks and sounds, and has maintained the general vibe/spirit of the demo, which is great!\n\nSo... why is this a negative review?\n\nPUZZLES:\nThe puzzles are kinda irritating.\nI like how you have a hint book, but the method you need to do to open it was... unique.\nI don't like shooter games, so that wasn't a fun puzzle to do to open the book, but it's super easy, so there's that.\nBut then I realised if you leave a room/area, then the hint book is closed again for that room and you need to unlock it again.\nWhy?!\nShooting spiders is really not that fun...\n\nI guess the positive is it's a change of pace from thinking hard about what the puzzle wants you to do.\nAnd yes, it's about what the puzzle wants. Not what is logical.\nI've seen other reviews touch on it and I was glad I wasn't alone in thinking WTF, where is the logic? Why is it so long winded?\n\nIt's really, really satisfying to finish a complex puzzle. But when it's all trial and error, I don't feel mentally rewarded.\n\nEvery time I finish a puzzle, I close the game down for a break. Because I don't feel enthusiastic about the next one I'm just kinda sitting there frowning like 'ok...'.\n\n\nHINT BOOK:\nYou'd think the hint book would help for disgruntled and confused players like me, who clearly don't have the same brand of logic as the game, but the hint book is quite cyptic, often only telling you bits of information, but not clearly and not in the right order, or with missing steps.\n\nThis is great because it doesn't spoil stuff too much and it stops you feeling like you're 'cheating' if you use it. It's a puzzle trying to understand the hints.\n\nBut it's not super successful because at times... I managed to solve the puzzle and would go back to the hint book and still be confused as to how the hint's reflected what I had to do!!\n\nOVERALL:\nI think the game is great looking, the music is nice and calming and it has a wonderful atmosphere. \nHowever, it's suffering from padding. \nThey make unexpected puzzle answers to force you into trial and error, so it takes you longer and in theory, feels like an achievement when you figured it all out.

Puzzles were from easy as 1 2 3 to keyboard crashing difficult. Luckily there is a cheat book that is opened through a mini game that can reveal how solve the puzzles. There is not a single word spoken, only through pictures in speech bubbles. Combined with the wordless storytelling, the unique artstyle and music, point and click genre,  and setting makes it fitting to not only consider Machinarium to be a masterpiece game but also an artistic masterpiece as well.\n\nBuy during steam sale through Amanita Design Bundle to play more games made by same creator; Amanita Design.
