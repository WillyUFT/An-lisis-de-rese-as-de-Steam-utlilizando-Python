HYRULE CASTLE - DAY\n\nKing Harkinian is lounging on his royal throne, surrounded by Zelda, Link, Morshu, Ganon, and Gwonam. A massive screen flickers to life, revealing King Harkinian with a game controller in hand.\n\nHARKINIAN: (with a grand gesture) Gather around, my esteemed Hyrule subjects! Today, we embark on an epic quest in the World of Goo! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udff0\n\nThe group exchanges confused glances, but Harkinian presses play.\n\nZELDA: (raising an eyebrow) Father, are you sure this is a wise use of our time?\n\nHARKINIAN: Wise, my dear Zelda? Nay! But it is a gooey adventure that shall entertain us!\n\nThe World of Goo title screen appears, gooey blobs dancing.\n\nLINK: (pointing at the screen) Hyah! What's that, Princess? Strange creatures!\n\nHARKINIAN: (grinning) These are Goo Balls, my loyal subjects! We shall guide them to victory!\n\nHarkinian starts building goo structures in the first level.\n\nMORSHU: (rubbing his hands together) Ah, yes! Building towers of goo! Perhaps there's a way to sell Goo Balls in my shop...\n\nGANON: (sarcastically) A truly nefarious plan, Morshu.\n\nMORSHU: (with a sly grin) Come back when you're a little... gooier! \ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udc5b\n\nHarkinian struggles with a goo tower, causing laughter among the group.\n\nGWONAM: (stroking his beard) The Prince of All Cosmos would be proud of this goo-rrific creation!\n\nHARKINIAN: (narrating) Fear not, my loyal subjects, for I am the master of goo engineering! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\nThe Goo Balls react with joy as the tower reaches the pipe.\n\nZELDA: (surprised) Father, you did it!\n\nHARKINIAN: (basking in glory) Indeed! Now, witness my gooey prowess!\n\nHarkinian continues to navigate through challenging gooey puzzles.\n\nLINK: (enthusiastically) Hyah! These Goo Balls are more daring than a Dodongo in a dark cave!\n\nGANON: (muttering) I could conquer kingdoms more efficiently than this gooey nonsense.\n\nGANON: (evil chuckle) Enough of this gooey nonsense! I'll create a goo army and rule Hyrule with a sticky fist! \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udff0\n\nAs Harkinian reaches a challenging level, Morshu leans in.\n\nMORSHU: (whispering) Need any bombs to clear the goo, my friend?\n\nHARKINIAN: (ignoring Morshu) The Sign Painter speaks the truth! Embrace the goo, and the goo will embrace you! \ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f\n\nGanon smirks as the group gets more engrossed in the gooey adventure.\n\nGANON: (slyly) Perhaps this gooey world could use a touch of darkness.

Story with a twist. Novel, simple, but addicting gameplay. World of Goo symbolises the best qualities of original indie games. It is a really good game and one of the classics.[/i][hr][/hr]\n[h1]The Three Pillars[/h1]\nIt is difficult to review such games, because they are small, focused and polished. You either like what this game is trying to do or this game isn't for you. There are no complex systems which would not function as advertised. There are no over-ambitious marketing. There is no confusion in a game genre and on what aspects game should focus and to what game's sub-audience it should appeal. You either like what you see from trailer or you do not as you had seen the whole game at that point.\n[list]\n[b][i]Gameplay[/i][/b]\n[*]Gameplay had charmed me back in a day. It was simple, addictive and surprisingly deep. You can use various building blocks to attach them to each other. As your structure grows, you have to balance its weight not to tip over your structure. Likewise, your GooBalls are alive. They constantly move around the structure and in their excitement they can tip your beautiful tower down. Game also tests your knowledge fully in free build mode where you collect gooballs from all the levels and build them into a massive tower or in epilogue with last three hardest levels of a game.\n\n[b][i]Aesthetics[/i][/b] \n[*]To me this game is beautiful. I love such simple, cute looking games. Nothing what isn't supposed to be here is here. Your building blocks are personified and part of living world. Levels represent part of a greater world. Something as mundane as a gap to sewer system is a level in this game. It is not stated as obviously, but a lot of levels do take mundane things and make them into oversized obstacles. This gives game a strong narrative feel. You are not simply doing random things. You are part of a living world. World which is tied to the story. To motivation of your GooBalls. This simplicity of design and adorable artwork is something which I really love seeing in games.\n\n[b][i]Story[/i][/b]\n[*]Story is minimal, clever and with a twist. I do love how it manages to be a meta commentary without feeling forced. I love humour in it. I love how this twist is always hinted through environment, but it is never told you directly. Game does not try to force itself upon you. This is why I had enjoyed this game for what it was.\n\nThere is also a sign. It is a small background element which gives usually a short message. It sits in a background and if you want to press it, you can. As level progresses, you might eventually see more of them scattered across the level. It is a clever way to add developer commentary. I liked humour in it. I liked how story was portrayed through them. I liked consciousness which post sign had ironically tried to portray.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]One of the Classics[/h1]\nTo me this game represents what a lot of games should be. They should try to accomplish one simple thing. They should not be overloaded with unnecessary mechanics. This game is simple. It is as long as it has to be. It does not overstay its welcome. Each design element which is in this game is part of core gameplay. Everything is polished to the mirror finish. It is a game which I'm glad that I came back to play again. I started from start and finished it. It was fun little game to play in short bursts. I'm glad that I came back to play this game.\n\n[i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Calicifer/discussions/0/3726198239758302418/]Calicifer's Reviews[/url][/i]\n[quote]If you are interested reading full review or want to discuss something with me, please follow the provided link.

It's a physics puzzler where you build goo based structures in order to save a collection of goo balls.\n\nThe problem lies in the concept's execution. The OCD challenges are what give replay value to the game but are frustrating to an incredible degree. Some of the challenges require you to finish the level within a certain amount of time, but don't offer you a timer during the game. You have to wait until you finish the level to see your completion time. This means that you have to go back to the world map and then reselect the level again in order to retry. A similar frustration is that you can't retry the level after the base number of goo balls have been collected. Some of the OCD challenges require you to collect and absurd amount of goo balls compared to the amount required to complete the level on its own.\n\nWorld of Goo also has a gameplay mode that lets you build an infinitely tall tower of goo. This would be cool if you got anything for building a taller and taller structure but all it seems to do is allow you to compete with other people. The goo you collect from the \"story\" part of the game gets sent to the Corporation of Goo where you build the infinite tower. It would be nice if building a taller and taller tower unlocked something or other because otherwise there's no motivation to even use this part of the game. The music is good as well, but there's no option to turn it off.\n\nAll in all, this game frustrated the hell out of me. Not because the concept was frustrating or even the gameplay, the UI and overall system built around the gameplay is what turned me off. There are features missing that are expected in modern puzzle games and features missing that are expected in modern games in general. The fact that this is an indie title is no excuse for a lack of a sound/volume menu, or the lack of a timer when challenges require you to finish a level within a time limit.", "timestamp_created": 1645458621, "timestamp_updated": 1645458621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424400269985198975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110490817": {"recommendationid": "110490817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284049644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1679057215}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a wonderful game.

Since they are alive and constantly moving your structures will wobble constantly, making it more difficult to stabilize the whole thing. Keeping your structure from falling apart, slowly buidling monsters which hold together by sheer willpower, is great fun and a wonderfully integrated mechanic.\n\nAnother highlight of the game are the levels, since each and every one of them comes with a unique topic and theme. It never gets boring, since there are always new challenges, ideas, colour palettes, assets, and mechanics to discover and to observe. Many of the levels are downright memorable with their settings - also something quite rare in this genre.\n\nThe difficulty is low-medium, apart from a few levels and comes mostly from the unstable character of your building material than from the puzzles themselves. If things start to fall apart you can click on \"time bugs\" to go back to a previous step. It can happen that you run out of those bugs, but most of the levels are short enough so that a restart does not feel like a total grind. If it is too easy for you, you can try to get the OCD achivements for each level which are more difficult, but also add to the replayability-factor of course.\n\nThe whole story takes place on a planet which was taken over by a giant cooperation. There is not much more to it, since this is just a general frame for the game. The soundtrack and the art-style is quirky and fun, just what you would expect from a whole circus of Goo-balls going nuts together.\n\nMy only real gripe is the lack of an options menu. Resolution or graphics cannot be changed, sound cannot be adjusted etc.. It worked fine for me, still it would have been a nice to have.\n\nOverall, if you have even the slightest interest in the genre, this is an absolute no brainer, and despite its age it will be a great addition to your collection!", "timestamp_created": 1638931229, "timestamp_updated": 1638931229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105224757": {"recommendationid": "105224757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215129204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1715, "last_played": 1695361428}, "language": "english", "review": "Goo", "timestamp_created": 1638634013, "timestamp_updated": 1638634013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517730474472045898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105219205": {"recommendationid": "105219205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402945734", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1669224404}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cool game", "timestamp_created": 1638628997, "timestamp_updated": 1638628997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105202638": {"recommendationid": "105202638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095801665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1381685833}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing the demo for the Wii which was super generous and lets you play most the first world of the game.

However, I loved it and played it for hours. Keep in mind I was not good at the game whatsoever, but it's unique art style, gameplay, and charm kept me going. It took me 2 months to finish all the levels (Keep in note this was with a 12 inch TV and a buggy Wii remote!), and I eventually 100%ed the game with all the OCD flags the next year. After I did that I played it on and off, until our Wii kicked the bucket about 10 years ago. I soon forgot about the game. However, just yesterday, someone mentioned the game in a Discord server of mine, and It all came rushing back to me. I bought the game here on Steam not even 5 minutes later. I've just beaten it (Much faster, thankfully.) and am now planning to 100% it once again. My story aside, this is one of the most engaging and creative puzzle games out there, on the same level as the Portal games even, both in terms of Looks, Gameplay, and Story. Yes, this game has a story, and a surprisingly deep and meaningful one too. It can be difficult at times, but it's not frustrating because you feel like you caused whatever made you fail. I might sound like a broken record but this game is just so damn creative and fun! There's not much more I want to say, just play it already!\n\n(P.S.

Slick and inventive, I saw a lot of promise in a tight package.\n\nInstead what we see here is a port that didn't get the PC release it deserved.\n\n[i]\u201cBut wait a second, OctoberFarts, you actual neckbear. Wasn't this on PC first?\u201d[/i]\n\nYes, yes it was. Which is why I'm so confused about why it was ported so badly from mobile to PC.\n\n[i]\u201cThat doesn't even make any sense!\u201d[/i]\n\nWhat does in this crazy [CURRENT YEAR] world of ours?\n\n[i]\u201cFair enough. Go on.\u201d[/i]\n\nSo World of Goo is a game that plays like it belongs on a phone or tablet but was actually made on PC then ported to mobile which plays better than it did on the PC platform that it was originally built on.\n\nI love the game as a concept. Wandering balls of goo need to get from point A to point B, a bit like another classic, Lemmings. Instead of builders, diggers, blockers and such, you build with the goo itself, different colors having different abilities. They snap satisfyingly together to create towers, bridges, nets, barriers, etc, just to get what unused goo is left to the finish line, or in this case a vacuum of some sort.\n\nYou move goo balls by clicking them and dragging them together to build, often as fast or efficiently as you can, because goo is limited, and you need to help as many as you can escape the stage. Some you fling, some are balloons, and some are hard to explain.\n\nStrategies continue evolving throughout, and I found myself really stumped in some areas, and really impressed with others. Chapter 4 was probably one of the most satisfying for me, but a great example of these puzzles done right is in the first Epilogue stage, which relies on speed, physics, timing, and creativity to overcome.\n\nThis is also where the game's greatest failings shine through.\n\nOne of the game's largest problems stems from unresponsiveness. Some of the already very challenging levels become all the more difficult when the screen won't pan fast enough, or balls would not accept being clicked or put in place quite as intended or as quickly as needed.\n\nThis makes things even harder for meeting any stage's OCD requirements (best or fastest possible solution) throughout the game. Further exacerbating this can be the way the camera doesn't pan far enough to see dangers ahead, resulting in balls lost or misplaced.\n\nIt is a frustrating design decision that could be easily accommodated if the game supported full screen modes for modern machines, or worked around this dynamic rather than crippling the player's ability to view the screen or move balls accordingly.\n\nWorld of Goo makes most sense as a touch interface mobile game to which it was ported after being released on PC. It makes sense when you touch a screen to move a ball with your finger instead of clicking on it. It makes sense to swipe fingers around on the screen to see where you are going or what dangers await ahead. I even tried using my Wacom Tablet and it was still very frustrating. Though I could select balls more easily things still felt loose and unresponsive.\n\nThe music was often annoying and repetitive, and there were evidently no options included, not for volume, or even to turn it on or off.\n\nThis game was played with all settings maxed out using an Intel i7-8700k, 32gb DRAM, Samsung Evo SSD, 1080ti, running in windowed mode on a 3440x1440 monitor. Clicking outside of the window (and thus the game) happened often and easily, and considering the frantic pace this game can play at times, very inconveniently. Holding Alt-Enter will switch to full screen, but on my monitor that meant almost 50% of my view were black pillars on either side.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Novel concept\n    [*]Very challenging\n    [*]Clever puzzles\n    [*]Creative level design holds up\n    [*]Humor?\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Humor...\n    [*]Some challenges unnecessarily unfair\n    [*]Sloppy camera and controls\n    [*]No volume or music options\n    [*]Little in the way of settings\n    [*]Probably a lot better on mobile devices\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 5/10[/b]\n\nIt pains me to give this one a less than glowing review because as stated, I love this game as a concept, and I respect the devs. Soft recommended, however, playing this game on PC with a mouse reminds me of trying to draw in MS Paint with a mouse; [b]DON'T.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1623319595, "timestamp_updated": 1623319595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476666659116744995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93465411": {"recommendationid": "93465411", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993251467", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1623250065}, "language": "english", "review": "I always hated this game even though its a classics, because of it's unrealistic standarts for perfect level completion and mechanics i never got into.

I first played it on Wiiware and fell in love with it immediately. This is the debut game from publisher 2D Boy, (now known as the Tomorrow Corporation) and despite it's rough edges is a wonderful example of the creativity of the puzzle game genre. In this game, you are tasked with navigating a group of goo balls to a pipe, usually on the other side of the level. You can tether the goo balls to each other to create a tower to the pipe which allows the stray goo to exit. As the game goes on you'll meet new varieties of goo that create new and interesting puzzles. The game is a perfect length, at four chapters and an epilogue. It's story is short and straight to the point. I look back fondly on key parts of the story, especially chapter four. It goes in a direction visually and in it's puzzles that is wildly unique and unexpected. All throughout the game Kyle Gabler's compositions complement the interesting world and storytelling, though I wish there were a few more tracks. The OST is a good length, at 27 pieces, but several levels reuse the same tracks and it'd be fun if this didn't have to be the case. On top of this some of the tracks feel a little unpolished, but this can be overlooked considering the conditions the game was developed under. 2D Boy, especially at the game's release in 2008, was a very small indie team. I still think the music is beautiful, even nostalgia aside. I recommend tracks like \"Are You Coming Home, Love MOM,\" \"Ode To The Bridge Builder,\" \"The Goo Filled Hills,\" and \"Tumbler\" to see the wide range of styles this game covers. The soundtrack is free on Steam and easily accessible on youtube, Kyle Gabler's blog, and other platforms :)\nOverall, World of Goo is an excellent puzzle game, an excellent indie game, and well worth it's low price tag.

EVER. I still remember the times where my cousin and I would play this game on his iPad (1st Gen), having so much fun. Remembering this, I gave World of Goo a shot, and boy howdy did I instantly fall in love with this game.\n\nWorld of Goo is a physics game on building Goo structures to reach a certain goal. Usually, this is a pipe that you need to build to, but on the last levels of each world (there are 6, including the Epilogue and the World of Goo Headquarters), there is a different objective to advance the story line. The levels aren't overly difficult, they're just difficult enough to intrigue you, but not to rage-quit the game. I really enjoyed this game.\n\nOn every level (except the first), the Sign Painter (A.K.A. The Sign Writer, SignPaintr4evr, [spoiler]The Telescope Operator[/spoiler]) writes messages on signs. They can either give tips, advance the story line or simply be humorous. If I were being honest, I would not have been able to complete the game if it wasn't for this mysterious, funny and slightly creepy (he can see you even though his messages come in the form of SIGNS. Give me a break) man/woman that is the Sign Painter.\n\nEvery once in a while, you can encounter different types of Goo. Some worlds are completely based on that specific goo. One example is the Green (Ivy) Goo. These types of Goo have 3 attachment 'arms' and can detach from the Goo structure if you so wish to. In the words of the Sign Painter: '[i]Maybe they have commitment anxiety, I'm not sure, but it looks like they can be easily detached from each other.[/i]'\n\nThe story line completely revolves around one company: The World of Goo Company. This is the company responsible for controlling (not making) and modifying different types of Goo. Once you complete a certain amount of levels, you unlock a special world: The World of Goo Headquarters. This is where all your goo get placed when they go into the pipes. Once again, in the words of the Sign Painter: '[i]As you complete levels, the Goo Balls you collect are sent here. How nice to see them again! Though they seem to have lost their essence[/i].' The World of Goo Corporation refine the Goo into a special type of Goo before sending it into the world. The special Goo Balls (which I will call WOG Goo) are kind of a mix between the normal Goo and the Green Goo; they can detach from the structure, like the Green Goo, but they have similar colouring and the same amount of attachment arms as the normal Goo. In this world, you have only one goal: build UP (or do nothing). [spoiler]And you can totally obliterate the Headquarters near the end of the game.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story line is great. The animation and sprites are even more so, and the puzzles in the game are really clever and fun. 2D Boy did a great job with their games (they also made Little Inferno, the game which had the trailer that is scary, Human Resource Machine and 7 Billion Humans). I thoroughly enjoyed this game.

A bonus chapter actually planned for the European market has been postponed until further notice, as the game appeared earlier than planned. Within each level, a certain number of goos must be sucked in through a pipe from a given amount. This is done by connecting the goos together and, depending on the level, building a bridge towards this pipe, for example.\n\nIn the so-called tower-of-goo mode, the goos that have been collected too much in the course of the chapters can be assembled into a tower and compared with other players on the Internet.\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ suitable for both hardcore and casual gamers\n+ very varied puzzles\n+ Chapters tell a story\n+ easy to learn, difficult to master\n+ simple controls\n+ coherent atmosphere\n+ Achievements and trading cards\n\n[h1] Contra [/h1]\n\n- could use more puzzles\n- The choice of goo balls is sometimes a bit fiddly\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nWorld of Goo combines style and substance and also impresses with its wealth of variants.

Ein eigentlich f\u00fcr den europ\u00e4ischen Markt geplantes Bonuskapitel wird bis auf weiteres zur\u00fcckgestellt, da das Spiel fr\u00fcher als geplant erschien. Innerhalb eines jeden Levels m\u00fcssen aus einer vorgegebenen Menge an Goos eine bestimmte Anzahl durch ein Rohr eingesaugt werden. Dies geschieht, indem man die Goos miteinander verbindet und so je nach Level zum Beispiel eine Br\u00fccke in Richtung dieses Rohrs baut.\n\nIm sogenannten Tower-of-Goo-Modus d\u00fcrfen die im Laufe der Kapitel zu viel gesammelten Goos zu einem Turm zusammengebaut und im Internet mit anderen Spielern verglichen werden. \n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ sowohl f\u00fcr Hardcore- als auch Gelegenheitsspieler geeignet\n+ sehr abwechslungsreiche Puzzles\n+ Kapitel erz\u00e4hlen eine Geschichte\n+ leicht zu lernen, schwer zu meistern\n+ simple Steuerung\n+ stimmige Atmosph\u00e4re\n+ Errungenschaften und Trading Cards\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- k\u00f6nnte mehr Puzzles vertragen\n- Auswahl der Goo- B\u00e4lle manchmal etwas fummelig\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nWorld of Goo verbindet Stil und Substanz, und beeindruckt auch durch sein Variantenreichtum.

Although it's a really old title, the devs have decided to update it roughly a decade after its release for enhanced support for more modern systems. It did take awhile to setup as it's default to the OG 2008 version running in a stretched 800x600 resolution locked at 60fps, with the volume of the music too loud, mouse sensitivity too high, and overall image too dark and blurry. After though, one can render it up to 1920x1080 and beyond, disable v-sync and run at the highest framerates possible, listen to music that isn't deafening, and finally have moderately sensitive controls.\n\nThe art style alone is very immersive and appealing - I think it's what prevented me from raging at some of the confusing levels later on lol. Don't be deceived by the simplistic gameplay mechanics, it's quite challenging as making a few mistakes results in losing the level and the accuracy of the controls tends to be questionable; however, one can easily \"rewind\" some mistakes made as a feature, or they can simply restart and even skip the levels. All you have to do is place the goo balls from the beginning to the end for a pipe to suck up the required amount to progress through. Each level obviously changes it ever so slightly with new puzzles and obstacles to overcome, and some vague hints that are a bit helpful. There's only 5 worlds so this game is quite short and can be literally beaten within 5-10 hours, and the only extra game mode you have is to build the tallest goo ball tower as you can for bragging rights. \n\nStory is next to non-existent and I won't spoil it for you readers of course, and the levels individually can take a few seconds to a few minutes assuming no restarts are taken. Oh right, also the devs in the anniversary update added trading cards, wallpapers, and emojis if you're into that sort of thing which I kind of care about. The only achievements there are for those that strive to be completionists, so you won't unlock any achievements for simply doing basic or even intermmediate conditions. I highly discourage people from purchasing this game at full price and to only buy this during a major holiday sale as there are tons of other indie games similar priced that are more worth your while.

Very minimal story, just a cute little post-apocalypse to tie the very bizarrely themed levels together. Basic premise is that you connect little goo balls together to build structures and avoid obstacles like fire or spikes to get to your goal. The challenge comes with limited materials, structural integrity issues, the ability to either reuse or permanently lose goo balls, flammability of goo balls, etc. The puzzles are on the medium difficulty. Usually figuring out what you need to do is the shortest step, and then it's just execution from there. Some of the end-of-level puzzles are much harder, but I feel that this isn't a bash-your-head-against-the-wall difficult game. Definitely a lot of restarting if you were focusing too much on stability and ran out of goo balls in the process.

Building structures by connecting balls of goo together is how you get them to the finish pipe. The unused balls crawl along your structure, and then into the pipe to end each level.\n\nThe physics feel great. The unused balls of goo crawling along your structure have mass, not just the components of the structure. Shifting them around is the key to some puzzles. The structures never break from their own weight, only bend, which saves a lot of frustration. Gravity is consistent between levels, except for a short sequence of levels where unique gravity for the level is the main component of the puzzle.\n\nThe humor is excellent. Your adventure is narrated by a series of signs written by a character identified only as \"the Sign Painter.\" Their exasperated/humorous narration of the goo traveling through the world lends a lot of charm to the world. The game is very self aware that it is a game, breaking the fourth wall multiple times, each time to great effect.\n\nPuzzle design is good. Challenging at times, but very well designed. Each puzzle takes a few minutes at most to figure out a way to do it, with most having more than one solution. Much more time could be spent on this game than I spent if one wanted to optimize the levels.\n\nThere are multiple different types of goo balls introduced through the game, each of which interacts with the environment in a different way. Each one is interesting and unique, and does not overstay its welcome.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game.

Many more recent games have taken this concept and expanded on it quite a bit. Played nowadays, it holds up as a pretty decent puzzle game, rather than the great one it was.

You will not find a more artistically enclined game app like this. It's fun, creative, and one of my favorites.\n\nThe object of this game is to drag goo balls to build a structure or two in order to get to the pipe which will sick the goo balls up. It has a story, but is more focused on the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and you will get the hang of it in no time. It is challenging at times, but not so challenging that you will pull your hair out in frustration. I found that sometimes when I tried to pick up a certain goo ball, it wouldn't register correctly and pick up a different one. You can avoid this by zooming into the screen to make the goo balls appear larger.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding. It has sort of a Tim Burton style which I find very appealing. At one point the game will be very colorful and the next it would be dark and backlit. This, along with the breathtaking music in the background, sets the mood for every level.\n\nGet this game. It is great, well worth $5. Though this game is short, you will enjoy every minute of it.

I recently tried it again on my phone through the Humble Bundle app where I got this in a bundle years ago and I actually managed to complete it.\n\nHonestly there was more to this than I originally thought. I had thought that this was a general physics puzzle game where you go stage by stage through a level map and you had some kind of \u201cget 3 stars to complete each level 100%\u201d kind of thing.\nThose kind of games are alright, but generally I don\u2019t enjoy them as I do tend to be someone who wants to complete each level 100% or \u201cget all 3 stars\u201d. Being a bit of a completionist like that I do end up frustrating myself, so me thinking that the game was like that, I think I put myself off playing it for a long time.\n\nAlthough the game does have a higher level of completion, it\u2019s not the \u201c3 star\u201d set up I thought it was. You can complete levels as normal, being able to move on as long as you have managed to solve it. The higher level of completion is an \u201cOCD\u201d goal, where you have to complete the level again but by collecting a certain amount of goo balls at the end of it.\nLooking at it, it seems as if it makes the game a lot more challenging, but I chose not to even attempt the OCD goals as there were some difficult levels I barely even managed to scrape by completing.\n\nThe game also isn\u2019t as flat as I thought it was in terms of story (or maybe more so moral). There isn\u2019t a great masterful story or anything, but the game clearly has a moral lesson set in it which it brings out in the small bits of satirical dialogue that you read. \nI actually thought it was very witty at times and it brought a lovely charm to the game. It was quite a distinct and unique charm, which I also found in Little Inferno by the same developers.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed the game, I\u2019m glad that I completed this on my phone, as I have noticed the achievements for this game really would have frustrated me! The majority, it seems, being for completing entire chapters worth of OCD goals.\n\nI\u2019d definitely recommend this game, even though it feels as if it is hundreds of years old, and was probably among one of the first indie games around when indie games started to become popular. Despite its age, it\u2019s still a great game.\n\n\nTL;DR : A good challenging physics puzzle game that I played through on android.

Gradually more types of goo balls introduce new mechanics like lift provided by balloons, reusable goo balls, flammable structures, etc. Sometimes you have to build a tower to reach the pipe, other times you have to bridge a chasm or an obstacle of deadly spinning blades. Some stages even have unique mechanics that diverge from the basic gameplay. With 49 levels across 5 worlds the game is short enough where it doesn't feel repetetive, but a few levels are so hard, that you will spend quite a long time bashing your head against a wall, which may get boring.\nA word on the [b][u]difficulty[/u][/b]: The tutorialization is rather slim. There are some advanced tricks that are never explained, but greatly smoothe the experience (nudging of tower, throwing goo balls, etc.). There is a good amount of unpredictable randomness in how your goo balls move around and make everything wiggle and sway. There's a reason most puzzle-builders have a build-mode and a separate execution phase, so the outcomes are deterministic. Only some levels feature an undo functionality and it is very limited in scope. Usually a mistake means resetting the whole level. All in all it took me a little over 5 hours to beat the game, but I spent the majority of time on just ~6 of the harder levels. One of them was particularly nasty and frustrated me a lot. The difficulty generally ramps up, but varies wildly, even in later worlds. Beating all the levels is not trivial, but not incredibly demanding either.\nThat changes when we're talking about the [b][u]optional goals[/u][/b], which took me twice as long (around 11 hours). Every level has an additional target that will give you an \"OCD flag\". Questionable name aside, for about half the levels this actually requires perfection, while the other half allows for some leeway. There are three types of goals limiting you in time, amount of moves or amount of goo balls you can use. None of them are aided by the UI in any way (you don't see how many goo balls you have left and you don't get to see your time or your move count at all before finishing the level). There certainly is a skill component, but notably a few levels actually rely on dumb luck (usually your tower collapsing just in the right way to reach the goal) or on obscure cheese that is never explained anywhere. The game does encourage chasing the OCD goals (6 of the 8 Steam achievements are about OCD flags), but this hunt only serves to really highlight the game's many shortcomings:\n\nMost notably the [b][u]interface is terrible[/u][/b]. Short of counting them manually you don't get to know how many goo balls you have and therefore how many you can use to still meet your goal quota. The goo balls will constantly move around unpredictably, which makes it almost impossible to select one in particular, which can cause you to fail a level in a time-critical situation when your tower might need support from a balloon, but you can only select the normal goo balls covering the balloons. Even worse when you want to deconstruct reusable goo balls, as they tend to get covered by any nearby goo ball. The incredibly minimalist UI certainly looks sleek, but it lacks in functionality. There are also no hotkeys for anything except Esc bringing up the in-game menu. On this menu \"reset\" is the top-most option (which resets your level without any additional confirmation prompt) and \"resume\" is the bottom-most. More than once did I accidentally reset my progress after returning to the game after a short pause.\nThe game also loves to [b][u]waste your time[/u][/b]. Every level has an introductory sequence slowly panning across the level. Many levels conclude with in-game or animated cutscenes. None of them are skippable. For some strange reason there is also no way to reset a level once the minimum goal has been met. These two together make the OCD grind absolutely excruciating. If you come up just one goo ball shy of the OCD goal you can't simply restart the level - you have to first finish it, watch the rating screen animation, potentially watch a cutscene of up to 90s length after the level, go back into the level and watch the level introduction cutscene again. When simply resetting a level takes over a minute I could feel my blood pressure rising. Between having to manually count moves, having to watch certain cutscenes literally dozens of times and fumbling to pick out certain goo balls in time-critical situations, clearing the OCD flags honestly felt like fighting the game/UI more than fighting the challenge of the levels.\n\nThe [b][u]presentation[/u][/b] is actually one of the strong-suits of this game. I very much enjoy the visual style. More the slick aesthetics in-game than the hand-drawn absurdist cutscenes, but they both fit and serve their purpose. The story is quite dark, but endearingly told with a good sense of humour. The sound effects are generally good and the music is actually amazing. It's great and very memorable, which sadly soured on me a bit during the OCD grind, when I would hear the same pieces over and over again.\n\nOn the [b][u]technical side[/u][/b] side we are back to substantial shortcomings. Windowed mode is default and works well, but you cannot adjust the very small resolution short of digging into .ini files. Alt+Enter apparently toggles full-screen but that just left me with a black screen with occasional brief flashes of light (might be my system's fault though). Part of the problem is that there is no settings menu whatsoever. That also means zero volume control, not even a simple option to mute the music. Sometimes the sound effects provide valuable clues (like goo balls dying, lighting on fire, etc.) so it's not wise to mute the game completely. But that also means the music will always be blasting in your ears, even when you replay certain levels dozens of times. For a 2019 title this frankly would be unacceptable and I'm hesitant to give it a pass just due to its age. I also rarely had a few issues with inputs (e.g. holding LMB should whistle to attract goo balls, but sometimes it just didn't).\n\nIn [b][u]conclusion[/u][/b] World of Goo certainly was groundbreaking in 2008. I still have fond memories of it and I appreciate the amazing feat for a tiny indie team of 2-3 people. But replaying through the game a few years ago I already felt most of the magic was gone. Going back to clear the OCD flags in 2019 really highlighted all the many flaws and frustrations for me. It frankly doesn't hold up anymore in 2019. Which means the full price of 10 bucks is pretty ambitious for a game you can finish in 5 hours which has this many flaws. If you have nostalgia for World of Goo, go for it, but if you've never played it, you should probably stay away or substantially lower your expectations.", "timestamp_created": 1555061876, "timestamp_updated": 1555882134, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382346302270889282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50017079": {"recommendationid": "50017079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117598922", "num_games_owned": 736, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1546192187}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1554660179, "timestamp_updated": 1554660179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49926884": {"recommendationid": "49926884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070409993", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 229, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1457136267}, "language": "english", "review": "absolute classic", "timestamp_created": 1554298936, "timestamp_updated": 1554298936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49862467": {"recommendationid": "49862467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324269296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1598076785}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a serious, down to earth, realistic game, this game is not for you.

I have a lot of nostalgia for this game, as I played it back when it came out on the Wii Shop Channel in 2008.  The puzzles are very intuitive, and the art style and music has a very unique charm to it that isn't matched by any other indie game out there.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is the rewind system.  There will be times where you will come across difficult puzzles.

It's a good game, but if that doesn't sound like your kind of fun you probably won't like it.\nAs to what makes it a good game, the level design and the variety of gooballs keep things interesting while being presented well enough to not feel overwhelming, the difficulty is mostly in the sweet spot between boring and frustrating (and you're allowed to skip a few levels if you're really stuck and aren't feeling stubborn), the humor is goofy but entertaining, and the music and graphics are well-suited to the game.\nThe only downside is that it's short with only moderate replayability. My playthrough was probably a bit quicker because I'd played it most of the way through before and remembered a few solutions, but it only took me five hours.

The game should have options for different sizes. When the game runs on a small screen, that means if you accidentally click just outside the box, you end up clicking your own Desktop. The gameplay becomes awkward because you constantly need to alter the view by holding the mouse over the edge of the screen, and if you go too far, you end up outside the game-play area.  It's just a sloppy, half-baked port to PC, and it SEVERELY downgrades the fun of the game. In my opinion, the company that did the port to PC should have taken the time to do it right. Only get this game if you can get it for close to free. Also, I notice there's a \"guide\" you can read to change the resolution. Are you kidding me -- why isn't this automatically a game option? Why does the end user have to jerry rig the program?

The music was great (seriously), the atmosphere was foreboding (also seriously), and the game was often both challenging and interesting.  It's not the only physics based puzzle game out there, but it's a good one nonetheless.\n\nHowever, World of Goo is really much more of a challenge game than a pure puzzle game, and here is where it's problems arise, the most damning of which is it's use of APM as a measure of difficulty. \n\nFor those unaware, APM--Actions Per Minute--is, in so many words, a measure of how quickly someone can do something, usually on the computer.  It works similarly to WPM, or words per minute.  \n\nThere are several puzzles in World of Goo, which is already a fairly short game, that use APM as it's entire gimmick.  What I mean by that is, instead of a having a puzzle to actually solve, the challenge is to just be fast, either in part or in whole.\n\nThis is not an unusual design choice, nor is it an inherently bad one, but it's one that I feel doesn't fit the idea of a puzzle game, and the puzzles in World of Good that specifically rely on design are the ones that feel the weakest, and offer the most opportunity for frustration.  \n\nOther issues like poorly explained puzzles, or just being unable to select the correct slime out of the dozens milling about your screen, among others, can occassionally sour the experience of a particular challenge.  That being said, this feeling rarely lasted for long for me.  \n\nStill, my experience with the game was mostly positive, and there are some particularly outstanding (in my opinion) puzzles sprinkled in that more than make up for the duds.\n\nFor myself, I give World of Goo a thumbs up.

Basically, you had to create a stable bridge while trying to balance costs.\n\nWorld of Goo is essentially a puzzle game version of that. Here, you use sticky goo balls to create structures that get you to each level's end goal (a pipe that sucks up unused goos). The main obstacle here is physics, as you need to keep your structures from toppling over. There's a sort of built in comedy to watching all the ways your creations just topple in on themselves. And conversely, there's a huge sense of satisfaction when you actually complete a puzzle. It's not just that you've figured out an answer; you've used your ingenuity to build a unique solution.\n\nThe controls are unfortunately a bit of a hindrance here. It's often difficult to grab a goo without the cursor selecting one near it instead. This can lead to some frustrating moments where you accidentally destroy an entire level's work with one tug. Some of the game's more satirical humor doesn't quite work either. There's an anti-corporation theme throughout the story, but it's not really cohesive or well delivered enough to work. It comes off as being snarky without any real bite (I've never played Little Inferno, but from what I understand, that satire is built into the mechanics. Here, it's just sort of superimposed onto a puzzle game). \n\nThose gripes aside, World of Goo's mix of construction and puzzles is still incredibly unique all these years later. It's an essential game for fans of the genre.\n\n(Note: I received this game as a gift from a friend.)", "timestamp_created": 1492795075, "timestamp_updated": 1492795075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603902637958526611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31212726": {"recommendationid": "31212726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110717889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1490791930}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun.", "timestamp_created": 1492493297, "timestamp_updated": 1492493297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449005752801895142", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31136258": {"recommendationid": "31136258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055795946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1533902116}, "language": "english", "review": "Too difficult and annoying.", "timestamp_created": 1492179123, "timestamp_updated": 1492179123, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.174514055252075195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31053968": {"recommendationid": "31053968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991399408", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1374513662}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun pass time game.", "timestamp_created": 1491798712, "timestamp_updated": 1491798712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31038240": {"recommendationid": "31038240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012706915", "num_games_owned": 745, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1346137200}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this a long time ago so this will be a simple review.\n\nGreat puzzle game - Essentially you have different types of blobs and you have to construct a structure out of them to get as many as possible to the end goal.

The intrepid soundtrack coupled with a narrative that promises answers just over the next ridge contextualizes this game as one of exploration and discovery instead of just construction and puzzle solving. The goo balls themselves are simple but surprisingly lovable, and the mysterious Sign Painter brilliantly combines context, hints, and humor making these necessities of function into friends that are joining you for a journey into the unknown. It really is fascinating how the tone these elements create makes for a totally different game than what it appears to be mechanically. \nIronically, the 'living building materials' gimmick that gives this game so much personality is also its most obnoxious quality. Once the goo balls make contact with a structure and awaken, they never stop moving. They constantly pulse around the structure both changing its weight distribution and making the selection of an individual goo ball difficult. This becomes a real problem as the goo balls become more diverse in nature, and timing becomes more of an issue due to the need for increasingly unstable structures. Introducing a 'whistle' mechanic in the second of the five chapters seems to have been done to solve this as it draws the goo balls to wherever you're clicking. But, in my experience, it only sped up their movement with a slight preference towards the vicinity of the whistling. The ability to pause and select a ball would have solved this issue, however it also would have taken away from the 'grand adventure' atmosphere that makes World of Goo the joy it is. \nSo I suppose it's best to accept the frustration caused by their incessant fidgeting as a quirk of rather than a flaw, even if that does make the OCD extra challenges even more insanity-inducing than they would be without it.", "timestamp_created": 1489370575, "timestamp_updated": 1489370575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540384411811828613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30480941": {"recommendationid": "30480941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348381799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1497167929}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked this one solid game for most gamers for a night or two, for a lot of other gamers will become a casual addiction.

Not worrying about it, I let the game get to the main menu so I could change the resolution. The main menu pops up, and there are no options. You can't lower the ingame volume or change the resolutions. This game is pretty loud, so I had to turn down my system so that I didn't blow out my eardrums. Then came the gameplay. All you have to do is build structures to get to the pipe. That's all you have to do. A simple concept, and an easy game. As soon as you get started though, the game becomes increasingly difficult. The puzzles are all the same, but the physics are impossible to figure out. You could build straight up, putting the proper braces where they should go, and still have it fall over, because nothing sits still. The little goo's that you have to use to build are constantly moving to where the end of the tower is. This makes the top (or the side) of your tower very heavy. That causes the game to get very hard very quickly. It was a constant battle between the game and I. \n\nThis game could be better, but it is a game that would be fun to play on sites like Kongregate.com or armorgames.com.

So do not hesitate for a second. Just buy it.\n\n[b][u]FULL REVIEW:[/u][/b] First of all, let me state this: [b]World of Goo[/b] is a classic among indie games. 2D BOY, the studio responsible for its creation, has crafted something incredibly imaginative, fascinatingly fun and spectacularly simplistic back in 2008. World of Goo is, simply put, one of the most unique and enjoyable experiences one can have. The gameplay is easy-to-learn yet utterly adictive. (And for all the completionists out there, you'll be pleasantly surprised to discover that the achievements are rather hard to obtain.) The game's design is eternally elegant, the graphics are glorious and \u2013 what surprised me even more \u2013 the story is staggeringly thoughtful, drawing numerous parallels  between our world and, you guessed it, the world of goo. If you reflect on what is being said (or rather being written by the \"Sign Painter\") it is positively possible that the game will leave you in a state of peculiar wonder. That, and many other of its aspects only further prove one very important thing: that World of Goo has aged incredibly well.", "timestamp_created": 1482865884, "timestamp_updated": 1536879647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560083448886871338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28713577": {"recommendationid": "28713577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048710319", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1520088613}, "language": "english", "review": "Seems simple, but it's more complicated than woman's bag.

In 2008, I was homeschooled, and we bought a computer for me to use with the schooling program. As the studious little boy I was, I searched on the computer (which was not connected to the internet) for ways to procrastinate, and one item I found was a compilation of hundreds of game demos, which would allow a limited amount of times that you could open it, 2-3 times I think. While playing the many games that were offered, I eventually stumbled upon this one, and I was drawn to it. I did everything I could to be able to continue to play it, including keeping it open for days, on end, and even creating new profiles on the computer to open it again (loophole!). Eventually, I finished all I could with the demo, with all of the levels of Goo Filled Hills beaten with OCD, and the highest tower I could build completed, I set it away the game and forgot about it.\n\n4 years later, in 2012, I was given a Nook tablet to use for school, and one day as I was browsing through the apps, I saw this game on the app store, and bought and downloaded it as fast as I could. I played the game for hours, working to build a higher tower, or just beat that next level with OCD, and I can safely say, this is a game that I will never become bored of. A few more years later, I became more interested in video games, I downloaded steam, and discovered and bought this game straight away, both for my personal enjoyment, and for the support of the developers of this amazing game. \n\nAlright, enough about me, lets get to the review!\n\nWorld of Goo is a game where you build towers and structures with goo balls to reach a pipe with a certain amount of goo balls left to be sucked up by it. The challenges begin simple, but as you progress you face more difficult and unique obstacles. This game also contains one of if not the most beautiful soundtrack in all video games, with fitting music for each level. The visuals and graphics of the game are very nice, and it runs very smoothly, even on lower end computers.

The end result uses encompasses your construct allowing your \"goos\" to reach the end pipe, with plenty of spare and win.\nWhile super simple, this game can be frustratingly hard to beat. But once you beat the level, you are overwhelmed with a feeling of accomplishment. On top of beating the level, you can do what is known as an \"OCD\" challenge. Typically these result in a time trial, overabundance of goos or the least amount of moves possible. \n\nThis game's physics constantly challenge you and require you to use your own intuition and reasoning to beat the level.\n\nOverall, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

It has no keyboard controls, even though it could have direly used some, such as the ablity to pan the camera with the arrow keys which would have delt with the mouse not locking issue, and a key for undo which would remove the need to click those stupid bugs (or more often, accidentally click one when you're trying to do a quick action).\n\nDid I like it?

There are constantly new elements being introduced, from goo balls that can be detached or float, to environmental obstacles that may interact differently with different types of goo.\n\nGoing along with this, the challenges vary greatly. While the end goal is always the same, the level design means that different levels require totally different strategies. One level may require you to build the tallest tower you can while another may require you to build a small mobile structure while avoiding saws or fire. Another may have you selectively sacrifice some of your goo. This combination of different elements and challenges means that the game never once gets stale or boring. Each level feels wholly unique and the steady progression of difficulty and complexity is finely tuned. I found myself playing World of Goo for much longer sessions than I set out to. One important aspect of this is \"time bugs\" which allow you to go back in time by just a single goo ball placement. This means that you don't have to restart a whole level every time your structure fails and keeps the game from ever getting frustrating.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\nWorld of Goo is a real joy to look at. The game a sort of off-kilter cute but twisted look that is not unlike something in a Tim Burton film. It's a unique aesthetic that I personally enjoyed.\n\nMore importantly, the visuals inform the gameplay in important ways. All gooballs and obstacles look very distinct and little details give you clues about your environment, like leaves blowing around giving you an idea of the wind speed and its effect on your structure. The result is a game that is very easy to understand and interpret, allowing you to simply focus on the task at hand.\n\n[b]Sound Design[/b]\n\nIn a word: excellent. The game features a variety of different tracks with some pretty great orchestral scores. I found that this music really set the tone of each level and left me feeling surprisingly exhilarated for as methodical as the gameplay actually is.\n\nThe sound effects are also great, with many sounds that are simultaneously cute, funny, and gross.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nThe story of World of Goo is very vague and centers around the world-dominating World of Goo Corporation which harvest gooballs to make a variety of products. While it's never clear exactly what is going on, the story goes through themes of oppression, environmentalism, vanity, rebellion, etc. in an effective way. It exists more to evoke a certain emotion than tell a compelling narrative and, when combined with the music and visuals, is very effective in that.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\n\nEvery aspect of World of Goo works and, more importantly, they all work perfectly together. It's a near perfect example of an indie game and there is good reason for it to be considered a classic. If for some reason you haven't played World of Goo, I whole-heartedly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1462815629, "timestamp_updated": 1462815629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677297294139862061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22821898": {"recommendationid": "22821898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013588423", "num_games_owned": 1607, "num_reviews": 183, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1689979245}, "language": "english", "review": "y", "timestamp_created": 1462513316, "timestamp_updated": 1462513316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443880766630172729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22772461": {"recommendationid": "22772461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141924227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1462250489}, "language": "english", "review": "My love for this game is unhealthy.", "timestamp_created": 1462250740, "timestamp_updated": 1462250740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443880766630172729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22744443": {"recommendationid": "22744443", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988229665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1478830936}, "language": "english", "review": "A very unique & challenging puzzle game. this game is worth picking up when it is on sale.

Everything about this physics-based puzzler fills you with that grand feeling you used to have, back when you were 10 years old, playing in the yard. That feeling of Adventure.\nThe game starts very simply. Here are a bunch of cute quirky goo balls, and there\u2019s a pipe up above them.  They make little squeals and pops when you click and drag them.  As you experiment with the balls, you learn how to build a tower out of them, yearning to reach that pipe. Where does it go? That\u2019s a secret. Soon you\u2019re building bridges, and balancing on ropes.  You come across species of goo that behave slightly differently, and let you interact with and build crazy new goo-based architecture, all in an effort to reach a pipe that\u2019s just over there.  For instance, green goo balls can be removed from the structure and replaced, letting your structure climb up trees or snake through tight spaces.  But the difficulty never gets overwhelming. The learning curve here is expertly controlled, to where each level builds on the last. You are never forced to learn something in a totally new situation, not without a little gentle guidance from the invisible Sign Painter. The game seems to say \u201cOK, you understand the basic dynamics here, but what if we do this?\u201d The game adds a simple wrinkle you can immediately understand.  And you will eagerly jump in trying to solve it.\nThat eagerness will be due in no small part to the music. You can get the whole soundtrack for free right here.  The combination of whimsy and epic just fills you with that sense of Adventure and, honestly, it will just make you happy.\nThe visuals here are top notch. The cartoony, Dr. Seussical aesthetic serves the game\u2019s atmosphere well, and each level feels very distinct. One early level makes the entire foreground, goo balls and all, completely black, while the background is a brilliant fiery sunset.  Truly a work of art.  Everything is clear and responsive, and behaves as expected.  One minor complaint is that when there are many goo balls in one area, it is difficult to select exactly the one you want.  This is a minor problem in the later levels, when you have 3 or 4 different types of balls and you\u2019re on a time limit to finish your move.\nThe game is divided into 4 distinct chapters, each focusing on one season of the goo balls\u2019 journey.  There is plenty to do here, but if you think the game is too short then each level has an OCD criteria (Obsessive Completion Distinction) which challenges you to solve it with a certain number of rescued goos, or within a set time or moves limit.  Going after the OCD achievements was a really good challenge! They force you to take your skills and knowledge of the physics systems to their absolute limit.\nWorld of Goo was one of the first mega-hit indie games when it came out in 2008, and its success laid the path to the golden age of gaming we are enjoying today.

When I first played this game it just didn't grab me and I almost gave up the second time too but fortunately I stuck with it and was rewarded with a very enjoyable puzzle game that whilst not too taxing is hard enough to usually require several attempts to complete each level.\n\nThe game is actually quite difficult to describe but the best way I can describe it is to say you have a fixed number of goo balls that you can attach together to form a web like lattice that you can then use to transport the goo balls from one place to another. The idea is that you have enough goo balls left when you reach your destination to meet the level completion criteria.\n\nThere are different types of goo balls; the main ones can be attached together to form the web; some have no special function other than to count towards the count at the end of the level; some can only be shot into the air from the point you grab them; some float and can be used to lift the lattice into the air and others can catch fire etc.\n\nThe levels are relatively short; I generally finished each one in around 5-10 minutes (not counting re-attempts if I failed). There is a handy restart button to restart a level if you realise things are going pear shaped and you won't be able to complete a level. You can also click on the flies buzzing around to redo a move but top be honest I found this facility next to useless.\n\nHints are available by clicking on signs that also provide the game narrative. The hints tended to be pretty cryptic but occasionally very useful. The game narrative was a bit surreal for me ..\n\nThere is an excellent, unobstrusive soundtrack to the game.\n\nThere are 4 chapters & and epilogue to complete, each containing multiple levels. You have to finish one chapter to move onto the next but can replay any level you have previously completed.\n\nIt's possible replay value is in going back and redoing the levels faster or with more goo balls left over or to complete in OCD, which I think basically means you complete at maximum efficiency. I only managed this a handful of times\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Addictive, one more go type game ..\n[*]Short levels\n[*]No time pressures, you can take as long as you like to complete a level\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Took a while to grab me\n[*]Can only be played in full screen\n[*]When the game fires up it re-arranges my other open windows on my multi-monitor display\n[*]The scrolling is very clunky. It requires the cursor to be moved to the edge of the screen and I found the cursor too easily leaves the game and appears on my second monitor\n[*]Clicking on the flies to take back one move is next to useless. If I made a mistake this usually meant re-doing the entire screen again.\n[*]There was a point about midway in the game where a few levels became tedious to complete as often the \"critical\" bit of the puzzle was quite a way into the puzzle meaning if you get that bit wrong you have to redo what quickly became the  boring bit of the puzzle several times\n[*]In levels where you had several different goo balls available to was very difficult to pick the correct type which again at critical times became just plain annoying\n[/list]\n[h1]Marks Out Of 5[/h1]\n\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n[h1]4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase[/h1]\n3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted\n1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\n[h1]Where I got the game from[/h1]\n\nI won this game at [url=http://www.steamgifts.com/] Steam Gifts [/url]\n\n[h1]Platform Played On[/h1]\n\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse. \n\n[h1]My best guess for a PEGI rating[/h1]\n\nUsing [url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33/] PEGI Ratings [/url] I would rate this as a 3", "timestamp_created": 1457814811, "timestamp_updated": 1459780242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21710510": {"recommendationid": "21710510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993673598", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4126, "last_played": 1652388628}, "language": "english", "review": "A unique game which allows itself to be modded easily without problems.

World of Goo is almost instantly addictive for players of all skill levels, with simple controls and play mechanics that are easily grasped.\n\nClick and drag the adorable goo balls into position to construct towers, bridges, and other structures to reach your goal. You only have a limited number of goo balls, and since some of them need to exit the level safely, you'll have to avoid hasty decisions and start planning ahead. You must carefully consider where to place the next goo ball--and (when later goo balls with different abilities are introduced) WHICH goo ball to place. It may take a few tries (and retries...and maybe even MORE retries), but you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once you've nailed the goal. Even after you've beaten the level, you can replay it again later to see if you can figure out method of achieving the goal with less moves and faster times (the \"OCD\" goals in the menu beckon you to try this).\n\nThe art style is clean and colorful. All of the characters and interactive elements are distinctive on the screen, so you can easily focus on the task at hand. The sound effects are simple and cute, and the musical soundtrack is very well done. A large number of levels and a progressively increasing challenge means that you'll be coming back for more for a very long time.\n\nThis highly enjoyable game will put your logic skills to the test and bring a smile to your face.

The premise is elegantly simple: Link the adorable goo balls together to create structures and bridges to allow the rest of them to navigate the structure to reach the pipe at the end of the level - guided only by some mysterious sign-painter, who lavishes this with a quirky mix of humour and ennui\n\nWhat's particularly brilliant is that the levels feel distinctly unique. For a straightforward idea, the puzzles are exceptionally diverse and really challenge you to think. Some are fast-paced, others are ponderous and require meticulous planning. Most are just plain fun. Solving it is also only half of the challenge... executing it is where it gets tricky; as you helplessly watch your lovingly crafted structure teeter and crumple into a pile of oblivious-looking blobs\n\nNew goo ball species are also introduced often, and really add their own distinct flavour to the game\n\nMy only gripe are the OCD flags. Level completion jumps between 'barely scraped by' to 'completed perfectly'. There's no half-way point to encourage players, so I didn't feel motivated to get them half of the time. You either have to do it perfectly or you might as well have not bothered (and the global highest tower isn't something I care for either). But that's a small gripe: The OCD flags are entirely optional (and hidden away) so doesn't detract from the casual element of the game if you want to just play it to enjoy", "timestamp_created": 1432585508, "timestamp_updated": 1432585670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16000970": {"recommendationid": "16000970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014163253", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 380, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1400181869}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][u]-Quick Review-[/u][/b]\nWorld of Goo is an Indie-Physics-Puzzle Game developed in 2008 by 2D BOY. World of Goo is one of those quaint games that you would probably prefer to play on a mobile or smaller electronic device (with touch screen capabilities); in World of Goo you create bizarre contraptions with Goo to get to the end of the level.\n\n[b][u]-Detailed breakdown review-[/u][/b]\n[b]Story:[/b] You progress through the game being guided by \"Signs\" [i](or the \"sign painter\". But I always thought the signs were the side painter)[/i], you'll want to read every single sign in the game because they are quite humorous. The game is broken down into Five chapters, and each chapter would usually have 10-12 levels within the chapter.\n\n[b]Game Play:[/b] Being a puzzle game, you need to spend a fair amount of time thinking, and once you get into the farther difficult levels, at times you'll need to restart the whole level because of one mistake. There is a requirement of how many \"Goo Balls\" you need to save at the end of each level to pass. So that means you can't use all your Goo on construction, you need to be as minimalistic as possible in your building.\nThe game starts out very easily and simple, but quickly gets complex and difficult. To construct, you click and drag a Goo Ball to a certain location near the starting structure to \"add\" to that structure. Generally after using that Goo you cannot reuse it... but some Goo has special properties that lets you reuse them, or have other special effects.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] World of Goo has 8 Steam Achievements, all of which are pretty rough to obtain. [i](They went with Quality, not quantity)[/i] I only have 2 of those achievements at this time, most of them require perfect scores on each level... Getting all of the achievements will require a great deal of determination.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] World of Goo is priced at $9.99, I spent 6 hours playing through the game once. So for me that's not a fair price.... However, I picked up the game on a 90% off sale, so I've actually gotten my monies worth, and then some.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzle and/or indie games, World of Goo was a very fun play through, and it only took one afternoon to get through it, so it's a nice quaint little play through.

I would give it a 5/10 if there was a side-thumb button, but since there isn't I just can't see myself recommending this to anyone.   \n\nThe game is a very simple concept that, like any good game formula, has a lot of depth to it when properly explored (something I think the developers were on the right track with).  After a short time in the game, though, I found myself kind of disappointed with the PC options: resolution doesn't scale (as far as I can see from the UI, and frankly I'm not interested enough in the game to even look for the config files), config options are pretty much non-existant, no windowed mode option, and if you have multiple monitors your mouse can still go off-screen (despite the fact that this is a single-monitor full screen game) and if you accidentally click your game will be minimized (this causes issues when you're trying to edge-scroll from right to left, for example).  If these options exist they were not clearly visible in the main menu as far as I can tell, and with a pick-up-and-put-down game like this I shouldn't have to be spending much time configuring things anyway...Binding of Isaac is a good example of how to do a simplistic PC port.  \n\nPut aside my gripes with the port (the reason I decided to not continue playing the game in the first place) the game just isn't that fun and there are some slightly clunky mechanics that get in the way.  The goo balls are constantly moving along your little wired network so you have to be rather precise with your mouse if you want to pick up a particular one in a crowded area, something that can be a major annoyance with the levels that require you to act quickly.  On top of this it was kind of annoying to discover that when you actually pick up a ball its hitbox is still present in the world, so if you accidentally drag your mouse over a harmful object you destroy the thing.  This turns the game in to one of those stupid games where you drag the mouse pointer through the maze and it detracts from the overall experience I was hoping to get.\n\nTL;DR  it's not a bad game, but when a simple game can't deliver on simple and expected concepts I have no desire to play it.

The puzzles are neat, and I never had to use any skips until the last part (and I normally sucka t puzzles) but they don't feel easy, they feel satisfying regardless.\n\nThe visuals are nice, and they're crisp and good looking, and most importantly they do NOT resort to trying to look like pixel art. However, the game does run at a low resolution and there is no way to change it. \n\nThe soundtrack... Well, let's just say it's one of the best soundtracks in an Indie game ever produced. It is well performed, it is entirely originally composed, and it doesn't resort to sounding like chiptune or 16-bit stuff to try and manipulate nostalgic nerves. One of the best parts of the game for certain, and even better is that all of the soundtrack (the full versions, not the shortened versions in the game) can be found right on Youtube.
