Super fun game! The mechanics are super fleshed out for how few there are. The story is a bit in your face, but it's actually pretty good, so no complaints here. There are two achievements that are actually pretty damn hard, and they're SO FUN, especially the speed run achievement, I recommend strongly for all my fellow achievement hunters out there!\n\nMy only real complaint is that it's pretty short, 100% in 19 h is not that great. For how inexpensive the game is right now I can't complain, but I really wish there was more!\n\nEDIT: There's DLC in the making!

Its pixel graphics are gorgeous, its atmosphere has retro, melancholic vibes, its story is emotional and disturbing, its characters are adorable, its dialogues are well written and sometimes poetic. Battles are fast, kills are rewarding and although overall its action is cool, it fails to stand out. Gameplay is shallow and never really evolves. Attacking is performed by only two moves, platforming sessions are too simplistic and boss battles are unimaginative. Nevertheless, it's storytelling and atmosphere offer a nice experience.\n\n\nManometer: 8/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Beautiful aesthetics. Gorgeous, immersive world with amazing colors and a lot of nice details.\n- It has a unique, dark, retro atmosphere with its neon lights and all these tape, rewind and glitch effects. It has vibes from old arcade games and VHR players.\n- Great story. Despite the initial cheerful impression the plot is pretty dark and  sometimes cruel with disturbing moments but also a few emotional, esoteric scenes of self reflection. Storytelling is even better as it tangles nicely flashbacks with dreams or nightmares and reality with illusions.\n- Gameplay is simplistic and doesn't evolve much, but the levels are nicely designed to constantly add some new ideas that maintain the interest. Battles are fast and entertaining. Kills and slow motion are pleasant.\n- Simple, yet effective and precise control mechanics.\n- Awesome, fluid animations with great transitions.\n- Well written dialogues that get pretty cryptic and poetic at some points. The feature that you can interrupt your intercalator is clever. All these colors, different styles and animations of the text replace some of the personality and emotion that was lost with the absence of voice acting.\n- Adorable characters both visually and as personalities. Some of them are pretty interesting.\n- Amazing electronical music that enhances the atmosphere and battle's rhythm. It fits nicely to the retro, melancholic vibes.\n-  It offers enjoyable replays that are feel very rewarding after a difficult level with many enemies.\n- After finishing the game speedrun and hard mode get unlock for more challenges.\n\nThe bad\n- Although some new elements are introduced gradually inside the levels, its core gameplay is pretty shallow. You attack only with a slash or by throwing objects. There are no combos or complex moves, while deflect could have been more important. You don't acquire new abilities or weapons and the gameplay barely evolves.\n- Platforming sequences are too simplistic. For a sidescroller with battles and a ninja I would expect climbing, jumping and walking on vertical walls to be more important.\n- Boss battles are mediocre and not so imaginative.\n- It overuses music, that plays almost all the time at the background in order to cover the empty of sounds environment.

It's a retro side scroll hack n slash bullet hell / time reset game. Its genres are time travel, sci-fi, psychological thriller, horror, and it's a G** D*** F***ING MASTERPIECE! I had a feeling this game was going to be amazing the moment I saw the trailer, and it still went beyond my expectations in every way. Everything from gloomily depressing, but lovably sleazy old timey hard boiled noir detective movie setting. To the piano music, to the most electronic that electronica has to offer in terms of the most retro futuristic music style a cyber punk dystopia can bounce into your eardrums. The music is one part of what makes this game PHENOMINAL.\n\nAnother thing is that takes you through a heart-warming, and gut wrenching roller coaster that has you questioning the main characters sanity, the continuity of the timeline, the nature of reality itself, followed up by the most emotionally upsetting and real world fucked up bleaker-than-bleak cliff hanger ending I've ever had the displeasure of reaching in a video game. \n\nNo. I'm serious. I don't have another one off the top of my head that comes close for me. It's probably not most people's, but my background probably makes this game hit some nerves for me. . . I am chewing my fingernails for more hoping I we can all do something if we're careful, quick, and clever... Thing is. . . no matter what happens, the game is a emotionally razor sharp dagger to the heart in a masterful way. Most people aren't looking for that in a video game. Most people don't care what a masterful stroke of writing it takes for that to be possible. The game isn't bad because the ending isn't happy, satisfying, or ends on a cliffhanger. \n\nAlso, if in the sequel she's dead or worse . . . & trust me I hope not, or I hope there's at least ways to avert those endings if so... but this is the devs game/work of art. Not our power fantasy. Kids all around the world every day  get violated, and snuffed. I was almost one of the ones that didn't make it. We live in a cynically bleak, and nightmarish world. Always have, and this game doesn't shy away from that. I find that to be oddly comforting. As a trafficking survivor, a recovered hard drug addict, as a veteran with ptsd, and an orphan this game had me in tears. . .

The story is phenomenal, the dialogue portions of the game are almost as fun as the combat itself. It is SO satisfying to cut-off a villain mid-monologue, and it's REALLY COOL to get to watch a replay of your battle at regular speed. It really shows how much of an animal the protagonist is.\nThe story shouldn't take you longer than 4 hours, and is a wonderful adventure to play through. There are a lot of things to explore once the story is over too, and I appreciate the inclusion of a Speedrun Mode.

Every success feels satisfying and leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe story has very emotional moments, and some abstract moments that the player must interpret. It does not throw a bone to the player to make them feel good about what they are doing, it plays out realistically to how the story should progress. The music is well suited for each scene, and amplifies the emotional moments.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, [b] this game must be experienced with audio, and optimally headphones.

Where you end is basically the end of the prelude with the \"real story\" just about to start. There are tons of dangling plot threads. This isn't a \"everything got wrapped up\" kind of Part 1. This is more like Half-Life 2: Episode 2. And it's been 4 years with nothing else.\n\nIt's a problem because what sets this above many of the other Hotline Miami inspired games is the story. But ultimate it ends up going nowhere with no resolution because the game just ends.\n\nThe other reason I lean towards \"no\" is the gameplay has just enough things that are unsatisfying. You see all there is to offer in terms of gameplay reasonably early in the game. You've seen all the enemy types and the general kind of level designs. The gameplay leans a little bit more in the Dragon's Lair \"memorise the events and twitch respond\" direction than I prefer. There are a lot of corridors here and often only 1 or 2 ways to get through them. The way it handles death along with the pixel art occasionally makes it hard to tell exactly what you did wrong. I would have liked to see the option for a slow motion replay. How exactly did I pull those enemies from the second floor that time? A lot of the later levels increase the difficulty by just making the level longer, so a mistake on the 26th enemy means death and resetting to the beginning. I would have preferred if difficulty increased in some other way, since it often got tedious to redo the first 2/3rd of a level 20+ times.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I mostly enjoyed the game.

It's still good enough for me to recommend though.\n\nKatana Zero is a side-scroller, where you need to kill every enemy in a room, before you can continue. Getting hit once means you're dead and need to start from the beginning. So far so good, but the game has a bit too much randomness with enemy placement and their movement for my tastes, so finding that perfect route through a level can be a pain sometimes.\n\nSince you'll probably die a bunch, I believe a game like this needs a really snappy restart of a level / room, like Super Meat Boy, but it takes just a bit too long in my opinion.\n\nThe story could have been interesting, but I just didn't like the way it's told. What is good though, is the dialog system. When your character can say something, you get a timed response you can select. You can either interrupt the other speaker or wait for them to finish and choose from a few options. Depending on your choices, this can really add to the game.\n\nThe game does look great, and the music is very good as well.\n\nKatana Zero is pretty short, and you're supposed to play through the game at least twice, I guess.

That's Katana Zero in a nutshell. Developed by Askiisoft, this 2D side-scrolling action adventure thrusts you into the shoes of Zero, an amnesiac samurai with a deadly task and a unique ability to manipulate time thanks to a mind-bending drug.\n\nAs Zero, you gracefully dodge, slice, and deflect through stages, feeling like a true sword-wielding badass. Bullet time becomes your trusty companion, allowing you to orchestrate cinematic carnage with style. While the gameplay is solid, it does have its limitations. The combat, while polished, can feel a bit restrained due to a limited variety of enemies and environments.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting. The game's repetitive nature isn't a flaw, it's a feature. You'll replay encounters multiple times to perfect your moves, fitting right into the theme of mastery through defeat. There's something oddly satisfying about nailing that scenario after a dozen attempts, but it can also start to feel a bit predictable.\n\nThe story adds layers to this repetition. Zero is no typical hero; he's a loner with a tragic reliance on Chronos, the time-altering drug. It's a double-edged sword \u2013 it grants power but exacts a heavy price. The story deftly explores the choices he faces: endless violence or a plunge into oblivion.\n\nInteractive moments and dialogue choices give you some control over Zero's journey. These segments, while not drastically affecting the main plot, deepen your connection with him and his struggles. The narrative unfolds against a backdrop of dark, meticulously animated scenes that blend seamlessly with the gameplay.\n\nThe game's atmosphere oozes neon-lit grit, with pulsating music enhancing both action-packed sequences and story-driven dialogues. Sure, Katana Zero can be a bit grim at times, and the gameplay variety isn't groundbreaking, but it still manages to captivate. The game's unique style and sincere storytelling make it stand out even in its cynical and sometimes ugly world.\n\nSo, if you're up for a dose of samurai action with a twist of time manipulation and a side of introspection, Katana Zero could be your next gaming adventure!", "timestamp_created": 1693068806, "timestamp_updated": 1693071231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145068562": {"recommendationid": "145068562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304272557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1688398928}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful symphony or blood and what's no longer... or what was never there.

If you liked the music and listened to LudoWic's stuff on youtube or another service, get the game. Katana zero is loved, and it will not disappoint.\n\nYou start the game thrown into the levels of blood you must paint - the only thing the game really needs to tell you is to kill. And you will. But look past that, look past the surface dialogue and the red-painted walls and there's a masterpiece of a story to be told. Did I forgot to mention, you can slow down time? Levels aren't just something to run-through like a madman - later ones are a puzzle you will retry over and over again. As if you're actually experienced in the art of what the game needs you to do, you must remain calm and ordered.\n\nI'm not here to spoil the story. Combat is snappy and satisfying [if you like the blood]. The story is beautiful and runs right up next to it's music. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to the soundtrack outside of the game. There's also a ~secret~ boss, but it's easier to simply play through the (always free) dragon DLC of the game to experience it.\n\nGo have fun, and think about [i]why[/i] you're killing sometimes.

The mechanic of each playthrough being essentially a plan or rehearsal of what your supersoldier protagonist is going to do, with the \"real\" action playing out afterwards without any of the time-slowing effects he subjectively experiences, is brilliant, letting you see how his inhuman reflexes would look to those without them.

Hotline Miami (1+2), ULTRAKILL, Furi, and now Katana Zero. I went into the game expecting a fun little game where you slash some baddies. I did not expect to have an eargasmic experience. My favorite tracks in the game have to be Overdose, Nocturne, and Blue Room (11 minute verson). Sneaky Driver and Third District are also fantastic.\n\nAnd the writing is... surprisingly good! This game has a really compelling story and some genuinely impactful dialogue (and a great sense of humor).

"language": "english", "review": "Don't be fooled by my playtime. I've had the Switch version longer and bought this one recently because I really hate playing(any game) on Switch and for no other reason.... I have 30 hours of playtime with it(this is a very short game, you can complete it in like 4 hours if you don't know what you're doing...like 2 if you do know what you're doing. I have by now completed this game more times than I have completed almost any game). \n\nNarratively this is the best game I've ever played. I'm not being hyperbolic as far as writing is concerned this is as good as any game has ever been imho. The gameplay is good too, combat is more like a puzzle, you're a psychic and when you \"die\" you just say \"that won't work\" and go back in time to plan out your attack again.

Shadows\u2026[/b][/h1]\n\u00bb [b]Katana Zero[/b] is a blisteringly fast indie slash-em-up with action that is an absolute adrenaline rush. Taking more than a few cues from [b]Hotline Miami[/b], it is largely about a drug-addicted neo-noir-inspired samurai who sticks a bunch of needles in his body. It wears its inspirations on the sleeves of its kimono but refines the tried and true one-hit-kill formula in a manner that makes it feels fresh, exciting, and innovative in surprising ways.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\u00bb This game puts you in control of a nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future. In an extremely clever and fun framing of the action, every level is contextualized as being the planning of an assassination. So, instead of your character dying, you are told \u201cNo\u2026 That won\u2019t work,\u201d as your precognition rewinds to the start (complete with old-timey VCR effect), giving you a chance to find a solution that does not end in your death. Every level ends with a security camera recording of what \u201cactually\u201d happened, which serves not only as a way to see your moment of triumph played back but also to subvert expectations in interesting ways later on.\n\nWorking up to that moment is a blast because Katana Zero\u2019s action is fast-paced and empoweringly flexible. Like Hotline Miami, it is one shot, one kill for both you and any enemy that is not a boss. Your character can slash in eight directions, slow down time, use a dodge roll to avoid bullets or reflect bullets back with his sword. There is a great flow and feel to your character\u2019s movement thanks to small touches like how each sword swing gives you a slight boost of momentum, or how you can cancel out of any roll, and the way each kill gives a satisfying screen-shake and pause to the action.\n\nHowever, the most iconic feature of this platformer is the slow-mo effect \u2013 specifically, how optional it is. It never feels too strong; it is on a pretty strict cooldown, and since enemies will hear whenever gunfire rings out, you will rarely have time to stay safe long enough for it to replenish. This puts it in a perfect spot as a powerful ability to get you through a tough situation while still being limited enough to keep the action quick.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\u00bb The story of Katana Zero does not quite hit the high note that its action does, but it is at least carried by strong writing and a few great characters, such as your boss/therapist that guides you through your traumatic past while also providing you with the dossiers of people he wants dead, as well as a psychotic Russian adversary named V. It unfolds in a dystopian neo-noir setting, where you are entangled in a web of conspiracies and government experiments. Exploring deep themes of trauma, identity, and the consequences of one's actions, Katana Zero poses itself as a dark and mature tale, artfully woven into the fabric of the gameplay experience.\n\nFor instance, there is an innovative dialogue system that allows players to choose unique options based on their timing and interjections. By rudely shutting down conversations or patiently listening, players can unlock different dialogue paths, adding entertaining depth to the game. However, while these choices provide multiple playthrough opportunities, the story deviations feel superficial, and later dialogue options can be inconsistent with previous decisions. Additionally, the game\u2019s narrative leaves much unresolved, hinting at a potential sequel or DLC, but the lack of payoff in this first chapter may leave players feeling unsatisfied.\n\nWhile Katana Zero will not take more than four to six hours to complete, it is a very tight four to six hours that cuts out any fluff. It never feels like it is running out of ideas, and every level does a great job of introducing small twists to its simple formula, from an underground minecart level to a motorcycle chase sequence on the city highway.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\u00bb It also helps that everything looks and sounds great. The slick neon aesthetic and fantastic sprite work go hand in hand with some legitimately impressive 2D lighting effects that give this game a unique visual style and personality. Accompanied by a fitting and catchy retro-electro soundtrack, the audio elements perfectly complement the intense action.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\u00bb All in all, Katana Zero\u2019s time-bending samurai action is the star of the show here, but it's unique presentation and entertaining dialogue go a long way in supporting a plot that suffers from feeling like it is saving its best ideas for a sequel. As action games go, the game\u2019s shorter length makes it a quick fix, and I\u2019ll no doubt suffer withdrawal while I wait for the next hit.\n\n[h1][b]Score: 8.7/10[/b][/h1]\n\n[b][i]Was this review helpful?[/i][/b]\n\u00bb If so, please leave a rating.

The ability to shape the main character's path and personality was a standout aspect of the narrative.\n\nThe game mechanics and art design are commendable. Despite some portions being repetitive, it exceeded my expectations overall. I appreciated the challenging scenarios reminiscent of souls games, particularly the boss fights.

It's worth the money.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nFast paced, and very flashy. You kill instantly, but can die instantly too, and in the hard mode speedrun, you're gonna die 500-1000 times at minimum. Thankfully it's portioned out appropriately so there's no worry of having to redo long sections.\n\n[b]Achievements[/b]\nAll achievements are fairly easily doable, although the method to get the keys was quite obscure and I needed a guide for that since there was no in-game indication any of these keys even existed. The 2 most notable achievements were the gold medal and the hard mode achievements. The gold medal was doable, but took quite a bit of practice and using guides on youtube to improve my time. The absolute hardest, obviously, was the hardmode achievement. Getting through this can take literal hours and requires insane amounts of skill to get through, especially towards the end. It's definitely a challenge, if you're up for it.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nVery intriguing story, it seems well integrated into the gameplay itself and peaks your interest by deliberately leaving many things unsaid. I do hope that more will come of this series, as I actually quite enjoyed the story as well as gameplay.\n\n[b]Hate[/b]\nA small criticism might be the lack of spammability with the katana, however you just need to learn the game and get better. A nice addition would be to make each bullet parry not cooldown your slash, something I found to be an annoyance especially in hard mode.

The trailer hyped this up perfectly, and the game delivered everything I was hoping for and much more. Very underappreciated for how amazing the story and gameplay is. While the combat is mediocre the game makes every level feel intense and heart-racing. Planning out how to complete a level based on enemy AI, your own abilities, etc. makes you feel intelligent and makes the gameplay phenomenal. That layer of having to think makes Katana Zero almost feel like a puzzle game. The quick decisions matched with the rougelike resetting once you die allows you to make educated decisions and try different approaches. When you die (Which I personally did a lot) you gain further knowledge and so can try again. Dying doesn't feel like as much of a loss as it does a new step in completing the level. Combine this with the difficulty of the game and a challenging but fun and genuinely amazing new experience is born. It's art style and animation flow perfectly with the gameplay, making everything feel real and stressful. Katana Zero's gameplay, while amazing, is only half of what makes this game worth buying however. Without spoiling the story, all I can say is that you will be instantly captivated and motivated to find out everything. What's great is: YOU can. The dialogue options genuinely feel realistic and allow us to put ourselves into the shoes of the MC flawlessly. Dialogue from NPC's and how they react/how the story progresses is entirely up to you. If you want to rush through everything, go ahead, but there will be ingame consequences. I was able to step into the shoes of our MC and genuinely connect with the story. Choosing dialogue options felt good and felt like a real part of the game. One of my personal favorite parts takes place when our main character is tied up to a chair without his sword (Trying to avoid spoilers so I won't say anything else.)

Also tremendous music and art style\n\nLong Review:\n\nGreat game, although throughout the whole game i kept comparing it to hotline miami because it heavely took its inspiration there. It is the same kind of game even though it's not the same camera and the gameplay widely differs because your character uses katana and throwable items you can find on the through the level and you can slow time and it is heavely linked to the plot (Nicely done not much game try to do that anymore). \n\nThe story unlike hotline miami 1 doesn't propose a real end but an opening for the next game in the franchise, i'm fine with it but it bugs me a little bit. I wish you could avoid killing \"innocent\" cops, there's just people doing their job but to proceed to next levels you have to kill everyone.\n\nThis game is done rather quickly it took me 4 and a half hour, and after finishing it i wanted to do another run to unlock everything like these kind of games usually do, they compensate small time play with replayability but the last levels of the game are really really hard, not as hard as i would get stuck on it for 3 hours but the kind of hard that gets tiring real quick and because of those level which are a bit dumbed down to die and try.\n\nI am not a big fan of this as i prefer some level that require problem solving or finding a boss weakness but jesus the last boss and the one controlling the room or the bike level is what's keeping me from doing it again.\n\nEven though i'm not a fan of the end game i still really liked the dialogues, at the beginning of the game i pissed off the guy on the phone to see what would happen and the result was funny. The option to talk is a huge plus compared to hotline miami and gives another reason to understand fully the whole picture as the game is very vague at the beginning but just like a movie with a plotwist during a new game you can pick up foreshadowing and understand why something specific happened etc. \n\nToward the end i still was trying to block with mouse2 like an idiot because of other game reflexes haha, and by the end i still got fair bit of misinput and this is why this game absolutely need a sequel.\n\nThe Music is great, it's what got me to play this game i knew after listening to Tun\u00e7 \u00c7ak\u0131r - Blue Room (feat. LudoWic) i knew i had to play this game.\n\nThe Artistic Direction is well done it's pixel art but the colours are not picked blindly there's thinking behind it, the picture is pleasing\n\nP.S: I already said that the game includes the game mechanics in dialogues and in the story but it also clearly include the fact that you are dying and coming back to restart a level, with your enemies saying remarks about it or giving new dialog!

This dystopian action platformer mixes difficulty, and and reward extremely well, due to the almost instant retry speed when you fail. Because of that, the game never feels frustrating, barring one forced (optional) stealth sequence that fits in as smoothly as a cactus in the rectum. It feels very... Hotline Miami in that sense, where you can always just throw everything at the wall and something will eventually stick. However, there is a lot more opportunity to plan your play out in KZ than in HM. \n\nI do have a gripe, and that is that you can't... idk, really skip the story parts on subsequent playthroughs. There is a speedrun mode, for sure! However, there is a story specific part of the game that can only be unlocked via specific choices in the story mode. So, if you didn't get it on your first run, you can't unlock it in the speedrun mode. You have to deal with the entire story, as the secret is at the very end. That's not to say the story is bad, or not fun to explore. But it's so omnipresent when I just want to hack up some dudes and find more routes/unlockables. \n\nThe control is crisp as hell, and movement feels really good to execute. Pressing up to jump feels really weird at first, but now it feels more natural than space bar. I tried to go back to a similar sort of game, My Friend Pedro, and found myself pressing up all the time expecting to rocket off the ground. \n\nI hear there was some DLC planned, and a the game has such a sequel hook on it, you could get it lodged in your lip like a sturgeon. But so far... nothing else has materialized for that, at time of writing. I had so much fun playing this, and routinely come back to it, but since the levels are preset, I don't have anything new to do in it. Game is dying for an endless mode, or a procedural floor sort of run mode. \n\nHere, you can watch me hack, slash, and joke my way through the base story on Overlord

playthroughs I can say without a doubt that this is one of my favorite games. The story alone is incredible, I'd say it pays for the game itself. If that isn't enough to sway you, the gameplay is quite good too. Difficult at times, but also allows you to pull off some cool shit (a balance that can be hard to come by). The characters are written very well. For example, lack of voice acting may be an issue in some games, but the effects used in the text can convey emotions just as well as any person. Now is just about as good a time as any to pick this one up, the DLC should be releasing soon and there's (hopefully) a sequel in the works. To be completely honest if you still aren't convinced, stop doubting the overwhelmingly positive rating!

Struggle with some part of the level and boss but overall it was pretty easy and fun to complete.\n\nIt leave me little surprise [spoiler] how it ends with twist and cliffhanger but not sure if the different choice I made will leads to the different ending or I have to wait for sequel or DLC for more.[/spoiler].\n\nAnd other thing I wish was the game to be little longer. The first playthrough only finished in 4hrs so the story itself is not that long. But with $9 I purchased with discount, it well worth the money imo. And re-playable game play with hard/speedrun mode make this well worth the price.\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game very much :) \n\n9.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1687011744, "timestamp_updated": 1687011744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140201152": {"recommendationid": "140201152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028086775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1687034776}, "language": "english", "review": "Harika bir oyun.

Katana Zero has the most impressive story I've seen in a game recently. Even in your short playing time of 4-4.5 hours, the game makes you adopt its characters and make you feel happy, sad, hate and fear for them. At the same time, since we determine all the dialogues of our main character Zero, we create his character completely by ourselves. If you want, you can create an aggressive character who interrupts others before they finish speaking, or you can turn him into a good-natured and kind person. Or, as I did, I created a character who was bored with life and snapped at people at first, but when a little girl whose name I didn't even know joined the game, both me and my character changed. Of course, this diversity makes it extremely easy to put yourself in the character's shoes. On the other hand, the story presentation is very high quality and the side characters are above average. The only bad or missing part of the story for me is that it ends the game without giving the player some answers. Normally I like this storytelling as long as it's in moderation, but in Katana Zero, almost no questions are answered at the end of the game and new questions are added. This makes the ending less impressive for me.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay. In terms of gameplay, Katana Zero is quite similar to Hotline Miami. Katana Zero has a structure that asks you to die multiple times in each episode, learn the episodes completely with a single life, develop special tactics for each episode and play accordingly. The level designs are really impressive and the level variety is very high. There are really 10s of different chapter types. But besides that, the number of chapters that repeat each other in terms of basic logic, if not completely, is quite high. This is one of the cons of the game for me. Although the number of boss fights is quite low, the ones that are there are quite high quality. At the same time, some bosses can really annoy you with their difficulty. This makes the player feel a sense of accomplishment very well.\n\nFinally, soundtracks of Katana Zero can be both moving and exhilarating at the same time and to summarize them in one word: Perfect.\n\nPros\n-Excellent story and presentation\n-Adopting characters\n-Level design\n-Section diversity\n-Fast and enjoyable gameplay\n-Challenging and high quality bosses, each designed differently\n-Perfect soundtracks\n\nCons\n-The story leaves many questions unanswered\n-Some sections in a repetitive style\n-Few bosses\n\nI would recommend everyone to play this truly impressive game.", "timestamp_created": 1686611208, "timestamp_updated": 1690031677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139966222": {"recommendationid": "139966222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378168299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 190, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 499, "last_played": 1686604404}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game.

Play it. It's good.[/b]\n\n[b]Katana Zero[/b] is a 2019 indie stealth action platformer from Askiisoft, of Tower of Heaven fame. Yeah, that old gameboy-themed indie that got really popular in 2009.\n\nIt centers around two main mechanics: [b]Time-stop[/b] and [b]precision dodging/parrying[/b].\nYour moveset is basic; you run, you jump, you can slash in any direction (be it with a mouse or with an analog stick).\n\nYou have a dodge roll button that makes you briefly invulnerable to basically anything (with a few exceptions in hardmode), and can be cancelled into a slash if you need to attack immediately (although that removes your invulnerability as you're not rolling anymore).\n\nYou also have a recharging energy meter that's used to activate the [b]timestop[/b] mechanic; as long as you keep it held (or as a toggle, you can change it from the settings), the whole game slows down to a crawl, as a sorta faux-bullet-time. You generally are not REQUIRED to use it, but it synergizes perfectly with the other mechanic, the [b]parry[/b].\n\nALMOST any projectile in the game (that isn't lasers or similar) can be [b]parried[/b] with a well-timed slash. Depending on your inputs, it'll either go back to its sender or bounce off in whatever direction your slash was aimed, if you're aiming too far away from its shooter.\n(the only catch is you can only parry one projectile per swing, so if you try to parry an entire shotgun blast you're gonna eat every other pellet except the single one you hit).\n\nNot just that; parrying a bullet INSTANTLY removes your dodge roll cooldown, making you able to cancel that slash immediately into a roll... which can be cancelled back into ANOTHER slash, and so on. With proper timing (or with clever use of the timestop to make it more feasible) you can just ZOOM through hails of bullets, rolling through some and slashing others to give yourself another roll to go through even more of them.\n\n\nAt first you'll generally rely on the timestop to be able to time those things well, see when enemies shoot you and react accordingly by immediately bouncing their bullets back in their face.\nBut as you get used to it and master it... you can just STOP using it altogether. Every enemy type has a specific attack pattern that you can learn, and a specific timing to their reactions and firing. So the more you play, the more you'll get used to these enemies, and the snappier your runs through a room will be as you effortlessly roll and parry through everything that's thrown at you while seldom using the time stop when it's REALLY needed. It's IMMENSELY satisfying to master, if a bit obtuse to learn when you're just starting out.\n\n\n\nNow putting that aside, Katana Zero is a pretty short game. It's a cheap indie, so yeah, it's kinda short. Took about 4 hours on my initial playthrough, without skipping anything, and a good bit of it was story and dialogue.\nThat said holy SHIT is the story and dialogue here [i]good[/i]. Almost every cutscene in the game gives you dialogue options, be it for flair, for potential humorous effect, or actually affecting the way other characters treat you in the long run.\n\nTo give an example (kinda spoilers but this happens literally in the second area you visit)...\nThere's a receptionist lady in one of the early levels that you can befriend depending on what you say, and she ends up not just helping you at the end of that stage, but also appears later on and can be talked to again, after she got fired from the hotel you slashed up and got a different receptionist job.\nBut if you antagonize her on your way in, she'll call the cops on you as you're on your way out, and your organization ends up taking her out as she's an unwanted witness. [i]Then the later area just gets a different receptionist instead.[/i]\n\nI know a lot of games love to brag about [i]\"\"\"your choices matter trust us they actually do for real this time\"\"\"[/i], but this game's length genuinely helped a lot in actually making that semi-feasible to do. There's unique secrets to be found depending on how you act and what you choose to do throughout the story, including [i](something super secret you can get at the very end that i won't spoil but it has to do with how your psychiatrist sessions go)[/i].\n\n...The story DOES unfortunately end on a cliffhanger which left me desperately wanting more though, but apparently there's going to be a DLC (?) or something like that coming later to give it closure. Free for owners of the game so, sure, alright. It's [i]definitely[/i] not an Asura's Wrath moment where they just make you pay extra to see the ending, and I appreciate that.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, you have a pretty short game, with a REALLY solid gameplay loop, and a really cool story that gets contextualized into the gameplay too (as every failed attempt of an area is just the protagonist \"planning out his route\" through and realizing that's not the way he should do things).\n\nThe visuals are REALLY good too; pixel art, yeah, which you've seen in a trillion indie games by this point, and the sprites aren't particularly big, but all the backgrounds and actual areas you walk through are RIDICULOUSLY detailed and atmospheric. From jumping through rainy rooftops at night, to climbing through a hotel while taking out an entire mafia's worth of goons, to the lit corridors of an abandoned slaughterhouse repurposed for... other things.\nAlmost all the areas stand out from each other from their theming and visuals, and the [b]synthwave soundtrack[/b] also really helps set the mood.\n\nMind you, I didn't walk out of the 100%ed game actively REMEMBERING many songs, there's not a lot of melodies that I could really say had that... [i]oomph[/I]? that makes game songs stick with me, but trust me, all the songs work really well in setting the dystopic-ass mood this game was going for. They work REALLY well in gameplay, it's just not something I would be particularly inclined to listen to outside of it.\n\n\nAnyway, all that said. It's a good game, get it. It's short but it's worth the asking price.\nMAAAYBE get it on sale if you're not convinced by the short length and potential lack of content (if you don't like finding hidden collectibles and secrets on replays of the story, or the speedrun mode), but either way it's worth a play.\nIdunno if it's worth the [b]100%[/b] for everyone, getting that perfect speedrun in was a pain in the rear end, but it's worth AT LEAST a play.", "timestamp_created": 1686295960, "timestamp_updated": 1686296676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

You're a crazy bathrobe samurai living in a cruddy apartment and you have a dependency for \"chronos,\" a die-and-rewind drug that has permanently screwed up your sense of time.  You gotta have it; if you don't, time will freeze for you and you'll be stuck in a single, subjective moment forever.  \n\nThe feels, the kills:  Cool story interludes in a 32-bit futuristic city after a devastating war.  Psychiatrist is your handler and dope-giver.  Blood flash-sprays everywhere when you kill.  Cartoon goofball humor is mixed in with the serious bits -- anime-like in that regard.  Slow down time to surgically slash and roll past gunfire; fight a few tough bosses who are chemically or genetically modified; choose your dialogue or literally skip it with an imprecation or [i]brusque grunt[/i]; reflect bullets back at gunmen with well-timed swings.  \n\nI really can't find anything to dislike about this super-fun game, other than that the story is not complete -- but the devs are working on free DLC to shore that up.

Most rooms require you to evaluate the situation and find the correct plan of action, and then execute that plan of action with decent window in-between each action. Choosing which enemy to kill first, which barrels to shoot, whether or not you should stealth a section, the game has plenty of variety in approaching situations and its amazing. Some of the situations do offer quite a bit of challenge, especially the boss fights.\n\nThat's just the gameplay though, the small segments in-between each killing floor really flesh this game out even further. The dialogue options you are given when speaking with the \"therapist\", the small talk you can make with the receptionist, it's not necessary at all but the fact that it's there elevates the series tremendously. The story is also fantastic, with you questioning \"What the fuck is going on?\" quite often. I got very invested in the story and I eagerly await the DLC. \n\nThe 2D art style is also fantastic. The blood and gore in the scenes look great. My only detractor from the game would be that the stealth sections are kind of a drag if you choose that route. Dying requires you to keep doing them over again and waiting, but you do always have the option of going weapons loud. It's just you'll have to deal with the potential story consequences later.\n\n[b] I would HEAVILY recommend that everyone pick-up this indie classic!

Hotline miami is dirty. Katana Zero is cleaner, hotline miami is a great game but it hasn't aged as great, probably just due to its age. Katana Zero is pretty recent and will probably feel the same way in 6 years but for now it's a masterpiece and I love it to bits.\n\nAnd controversial opinion: The soundtrack might just go harder than the hotline miami one.", "timestamp_created": 1684844197, "timestamp_updated": 1684844197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138828430": {"recommendationid": "138828430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026073689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 953, "last_played": 1684839073}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si te ha gustado Hotline miami, este te gustar\u00e1 m\u00e1s si eres fan de los otakos con katana.", "timestamp_created": 1684839144, "timestamp_updated": 1684839144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138796863": {"recommendationid": "138796863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822267713", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1132, "last_played": 1697029162}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game, Would erase my memory to play it for the second first time", "timestamp_created": 1684795016, "timestamp_updated": 1684795016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732613265514373779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138793112": {"recommendationid": "138793112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186922787", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 848, "last_played": 1627422989}, "language": "english", "review": "top 2 game osts oat and it ain't 2nd \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc10", "timestamp_created": 1684790546, "timestamp_updated": 1684790691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138780638": {"recommendationid": "138780638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442980831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1685184303}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Awesome combat, deep story and themes.

A great story that presents us with Zero, a war veteran that has been hired to eliminate a dangerous drug to be available on the market. The story goes from watching memories, to killing everyone that comes to your path. Great bosses, also a secret one, and a overall, great campaign. Justin Stander is still working on the DLC, and it appears it will promise what was missing on the main game. However, the main game, music, design and replayability is incredible. Completing the game at 100% is not a so difficult task, however, as every 100% completion, it does take time. To me it took only 13 hours in total to finish at 100%, but it should normally take 10 and a half hours to be completed at 100%.

The soundtrack is perfectly matched with the dystopian future aesthetic. I love that the fighting in and of itself is a puzzle. Trying to map out how you will take care of each room and then applying your corrections only to die and discover something else you could have done differently to yield a different outcome, is very pleasing and lends to a creative side that I wasn't expecting. \n\nGreat game, and I will definitely be replaying it to see what else I can get out of the story, and to see if your choices really have a greater consequence to the way the game plays out.\n", "timestamp_created": 1684523070, "timestamp_updated": 1684523070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138561548": {"recommendationid": "138561548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328368725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 780, "last_played": 1684570104}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games i have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1684519372, "timestamp_updated": 1684519372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138560751": {"recommendationid": "138560751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834034240", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1693110752}, "language": "spanish", "review": "<3\u266b\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1684518470, "timestamp_updated": 1684518470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138557256": {"recommendationid": "138557256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930068867", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1691117910}, "language": "spanish", "review": "DALE LOCO SAQUEN OTRO CAPITULOO ES GOD EL JUEGO Y EL LORE QUE TIENE", "timestamp_created": 1684514171, "timestamp_updated": 1684514171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138550086": {"recommendationid": "138550086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198949299936", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1847, "last_played": 1680435345}, "language": "english", "review": "TL DR: Amazing game 10/10. Music is phenomenal, story is great, game play is satisfying and fluid. 15 euros is a fair price and I just recommend you play.\n\nThis masterpiece easily one of my favorite indie games of all time. Everything about it is amazing. The only issue is that it doesn't go on forever. The combat is really satisfying and getting the achievements for this game was fun as well. \n\nThe game is structured around that fact that you die in one shot. The enemies however die in one shot too. What that means is that you have to weave around bullets and dodge incoming attacks with just your sword. The rolling, time slowing down and throwing mechanics work very well. On normal mode the game can be played reactively with you just parrying and dodging everything that comes at you. On hard mode however, you are forced to learn the layout of the level and find a strategy which will get you through as there are simply too many enemies.\n\nThe story is also amazing as there are many dialogue and in-game choices a player can make to affect dialogue and the endings. \n\nI cant write a lot about it because its just too good.

[/h1]\nSi la respuesta es SI: Compralo. Es as\u00ed de f\u00e1cil. Este juego es muuuuuuy parecido tanto en la jugabilidad, la violencia, la velocidad, las escenas raras y enigm\u00e1ticas, todo.\n\nAhora bien, si la respuesta es NO: pues.... no tienes mucho que hacer aqu\u00ed. Mejor ve a jugar algo mas tranquilo como el Minecraft o que se yo. Ac\u00e1 estamos los loquitos que queremos ver SANGRE, REFLEJAR BALAS, SENTIR LA EMOCI\u00d3N DE LA BATALLA, SEKIIIIIIROOOOOOO *cough cough* y todo eso.\n\n[h1] PERO NO TENGO NI IDEA DE QUE ES HOTLINE MIAMI [/h1]\nBueno, esta es la 3ra opci\u00f3n en este caso, me va a gustar o no el juego?\nPrimero que nada, este juego va de matar, es tan simple como eso. Empezas el nivel tu pj se pone los auriculares como para hacer cardio y empieza a mandar sablaso limpio a todo lo que se mueve (Ah por cierto, no podes usar armas de fuego AY)\nLa GRACIA est\u00e1 en que si te pegan un tiro o te revientan la cabeza te mor\u00eds de una (oh sorpresa!) y no tenes barra de vida.\n\nHab\u00eda una \u00e9poca que eran muy populares estos juegos y esa onda puede salir muy mal como muy bien por suerte Katana Zero tiene una estructura que lo hace ideal y queda espectacular.\n\nParticularmente no soy fan de este tipo de juegos ya que ejercen much\u00edsimo estr\u00e9s en el jugador y si no estas acostumbrado a ello puede hacerte sentir mal, enojarte, ponerte triste, que se yo cosas asi.\nLa cuesti\u00f3n es que KZ lo hizo en peque\u00f1as medidas manejables, adem\u00e1s cuando empieza lo hace despacio como llev\u00e1ndote de la mano, como cuando tu viejo te ense\u00f1a a andar en bici...\n\n[h1] COMO QUE ANDAR EN BICI? QUE FLASHEAS FLACO? [/h1]\nBueno ya, la cosa es as\u00ed el juego empieza suave y tierno como acarici\u00e1ndote la entrepierna, pero antes de que te des cuenta te va a hacer su perra y te va a dar duro contra el muro como puerta que no cierra, as\u00ed que prep\u00e1rate para eso.\n\nHay mucha variedad de enemigos, esa es una parte muy buena que lograron en el juego ya que tenes que adaptarte a cada uno (incluso al terminar la historia destrabas un modo donde agregan un par de personajes extras). Tenemos desde los t\u00edpicos mafiosos a mano limpia hasta agentes de polic\u00edas t\u00e1cticos y cosas por el estilo.\nQuiz\u00e1s, no sean tantos tipos t\u00e9cnicamente, digamos unos 5 o 6 como mucho pero la gracia es que el mapa tambi\u00e9n es variado y acompa\u00f1a perfectamente, entonces no es lo mismo \"Tipito con escopeta en espacio abierto\" que \"Tipito con escopeta detras de tipito con escudo\"\n\nAh\u00ed est\u00e1 el truco que lo hace adictivo! cada situaci\u00f3n tiene una fina estructura que tenes que recorrer casi a la perfecci\u00f3n para que no te maten, a\u00fan as\u00ed varias veces te van a matar pero no solo resucitas super r\u00e1pido sino que encima con cada muerte aprendes algo, lo aplicas, ves que funciona y WAL\u00c1 MAGIA!\n\nUna vez contemplas como hiciste el ejercicio mental de la mejor ruta el juego te recompensa mostr\u00e1ndote como pasaste el nivel, es un muy buen detalle y adem\u00e1s te hace sentir bien y preparado para el siguiente nivel.\n\n[h1] AUN NO ENTIENDO DE QUE VA, DEBE SER RE ABURRIDO SIEMPRE MATAR [/h1]\nEsta es la parte donde entra la historia, lo bueno es que esta secci\u00f3n no va a ser larga ya que te estar\u00eda tirando terribles spoilers.\n\nSolo te voy a decir que tu pj no recuerda un pomo de lo que fue o lo que hizo antes y bueno queda perfecto ya que el jugador tampoco sabe nada entonces mientras vas matando gente y contemplando la vida empez\u00e1s a ver personas que te dicen cosas como \"NULO\" o te tiran nombres de drogas raras y bueno, vos ah\u00ed con tu inteligencia GAMER\u2122 vas armando todo (yo igual no entend\u00ed todo pero hay cosas interesantes en la historia)\n\n[h1] ENTONCES DEBER\u00cdA PROBARLO... HAY ALGO MAS QUE NO ME ESTES CONTANDO? [/h1]\nLa m\u00fasica! LA M\u00daSICA WACHO!!! Dios est\u00e1 buena!!!! est\u00e1 mas buena que tu vieja!!! con eso te digo todo.\nYa est\u00e1 no te digo mas, compralo y jugalo no te vas a arrepentir.

No ten\u00eda grandes expectativas al comenzar Katana Zero, pero result\u00f3 ser un juego impresionante. Con una est\u00e9tica ochentera y un exquisito pixel art, este t\u00edtulo respaldado por Devolver Digital me cautiv\u00f3 por completo.\n\nLa historia gira en torno a un asesino samur\u00e1i amn\u00e9sico que utiliza drogas experimentales para predecir los movimientos en combate. Cada secci\u00f3n del juego se presenta como un plan que el personaje elabora mentalmente para enfrentarse a una serie de enemigos. Esto implica repetir la misma secci\u00f3n varias veces, aprendiendo los patrones de ataque de cada enemigo y descubriendo las mejores estrategias para derrotarlos.\n\nLa relaci\u00f3n con t\u00edtulos como Hotline Miami es evidente, tanto en t\u00e9rminos de est\u00e9tica como en la premisa de repetir hasta encontrar la clave del \u00e9xito. La historia tambi\u00e9n guarda sorpresas y giros interesantes, que aunque puedas prever, no dejan de ser disfrutables.\n\nLa jugabilidad combina elementos de acci\u00f3n fren\u00e9tica y plataformas. Cada error nos obliga a reiniciar la secuencia desde el principio, lo que a\u00f1ade un nivel de desaf\u00edo. Afortunadamente, tenemos libertad para abordar los combates, eligiendo qu\u00e9 enemigos enfrentar y c\u00f3mo utilizar nuestras habilidades, que incluyen espadas, saltos, lanzamiento de objetos y la capacidad de ralentizar el tiempo.\n\nEl control del juego es exquisito, permiti\u00e9ndonos incluso dirigir nuestros ataques en pleno vuelo. Adem\u00e1s, el trabajo de pixel art en Katana Zero es impresionante, transmitiendo detalles sorprendentes a trav\u00e9s de simples p\u00edxeles. Las animaciones son una delicia y la m\u00fasica contribuye a sumergirnos en la experiencia.\n\nIncre\u00edble jugar en la steam deck, que funciona perfectamente y muestra el pulido y el nivel de detalle del juego. Katana Zero es un t\u00edtulo que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su jugabilidad y su historia interesante, destacando tambi\u00e9n por su apartado visual y sonoro.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Soundtracks and the artwork is amazing, the story was better than i expected, i thought it was going to be pretty boring but i enjoyed every bit of it. Gameplay is nice, repetetive but doesnt feel boring, different enemies has different moves which is nice for a game like this. Story is more on the darker side, so it's not really good if you're looking for something to relax. Also you restart the stage everytime u die, so it feels like a souls game somehow. Overall gameplay and story is basically perfect compared to what i expected. Good experience, probably you wont regret. ALSO. U. CAN. PET. THE.

But this review is much more critical than your usual recommended review - hence the thumbs down (Steam should really add \"neutral\" reviews).\n\nPROS:\n\n- A platformer that borrows a lot from Hotline Miami gameplay and difficulty.\n- Beautiful art-style with excellent animations and overall high production values. \n- Some very creative level design. \n- Good music with one track being particularly beautiful.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Personally, I couldn't care less about the story and dialogues. Found it cringe-worthy and try-hard. Various \"edgy\" bits didn't help either. Also why would I care about deaths of others after I slaughter countless people while a cool music is playing and everything about it feels cool? Tone-deaf. Didn't work for me at all. I have also become really allergic to \"cute\" and \"sensitive\" bits in otherwise \"brutal\" and \"serious\" stories. Pet a cat and other really pandering shit like that (not gonna spoil the story). I hope this cheap trend will die soon.\n\n- I fucking hated the acceleration and inertia on the character movement - very frustrating when precision movement was required - especially if you prefer gamepad sticks instead of d-pad.\n\n- Many pointless and illogical \"choices\" in the dialogues and in several actions/interactions - felt really unnecessary at many occasions. One level also required you to go through a dialogue repeatedly until you succeeded in selecting the right order of choices otherwise you fail. It was a simple trial and error. Boring, tedious and empty. Hated that.\n\n- Randomized enemy positions and movement after each level restart lead to the player waiting/idle times. It's such a momentum killer. A way to get you off your adrenaline high. I consider this to be a design flaw in a game like this and yes I hated it in Hotline Miami too.\n\n- A level editor with Steam workshop support would be nice (again a comparison with Hotline Miami).", "timestamp_created": 1683404954, "timestamp_updated": 1683411723, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137904090": {"recommendationid": "137904090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815934388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1683598545}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Plot Twist: Katana ONE.", "timestamp_created": 1683404740, "timestamp_updated": 1683404740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137900482": {"recommendationid": "137900482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088320593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1683400256}, "language": "english", "review": "Emotions running high with this one.

Ultraviolent psychopath main character having trouble discerning reality from hallucination, retro 80s aesthetic, girl supporting character that brings the good out of you, synthwave soundtrack, evil Russian guy, switch to playing an antagonist character, one hit death, forcing the player to walk back through the level after massacring everyone, sending the player back to their apartment after every hit. It's all there and more. There's even a part where our protagonist is asked if he likes violence. The issue I have is that it doesn't do it as well as Hotline Miami. \n\nHotline Miami is a tight consistent experience. Katana Zero is sold as a fast paced action game yet has a handful of stealth sections that just slow the game down to a tedious crawl and just lead to a loud bloodshed anyway making me wonder what the point of it was. Mark of the Ninja, this is not. The soundtrack fits the tone nicely and is well-composed, but is mostly forgettable. A lot of the same beats you here in most synthwave is featured here. I feel like this genre is getting a bit too samey. I've listened to it fully outside of the game as well and few tracks stood out like equivalent synthwave offerings in games like Brigador, Furi, and obviously Hotline Miami. The game is extremely short, like 4 hours tops and that's taking my time, which would be fine if it was complete, but this game has no ending. It ends on a cliffhanger with a \"To be continued...\" message right as it hits its peak. This is a terrible approach as there's no guarantee any game would be enough of a success to even afford a follow-up. Hopefully, a conclusion is added here or in a sequel since the game is quite popular. That said, making your ending DLC would be awful. No one should have to pay extra for an epilogue. \n\nI found the story compelling enough, but nothing that left me pondering my actions like Hotline Miami did. That game was transgressive and didn't hold back on its dark exploration of violence. It managed to accomplish character development for Jacket without a single line of dialogue spoken from him. This game feels more like treading old ground. What hurt my enjoyment of the story is just how often it interrupts gameplay. Most missions are finished in a few minutes even with dozens of death. Don't worry. This game isn't that difficult and before anyone says to play on hard, you can't until you beat it once on its default difficulty. The prison level was especially egregious about this length problem. Way too short and underwhelming with more forced shallow stealth gameplay that basically never reappears in the rest of the game. Once done, I get more long conversations with dialogue options that have little effect on the outcome of the story. It seems to be only worth doing for achievements. If the story segments only came after the mission's been completed, this wouldn't be so bad, but there are instances of dialogue appearing mid-mission and it just breaks up the flow too much.\n\nThe level design feels like a missed opportunity more often than not. When they're more expansive with multiple routes/floors, I feel encouraged to experiment and plan my attack. However, many levels feel on-rails, ironically with there literally being a minecart level that's on-rails, and it's these levels that make me feel like I have to do things one way since there aren't any other approaches. Again, compare this to Hotline Miami where almost every level is basically the entire floor layout full of connected rooms allowing for numerous approaches. The tutorial is straight up deceptive. There's a part where you have to use bullet time to get past a fan without getting chopped up. This made me think there would be more environmental hazards where you have to slow down time to get past, but no, this never appears at any other point in the game. You could probably beat the entire game without bullet time. I didn't use it most of the time and just relied on trial and error to beat levels. Bosses are also fairly lackluster. With the exception of the final boss, they're extremely easy and predictable.\n\nI sound negative, but I actually really liked the game and still recommend it. The core gameplay is the selling point for me. Rapidly cutting down foes and deflecting bullets is just too satisfying and addictive for me not to recommend it. I just thought it could be better. Nonetheless, the pixel art graphics are beautiful and this is one area where Hotline Miami just does not compete. I think if they borrowed less from Hotline Miami and added some meat to the game's lean offering, I'd be all for singing this game's praises. As is, it's another good Hotline Miami-like that's comfortable sitting in its shadow. I give it a 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1683265410, "timestamp_updated": 1683265410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

In gameplay, aesthetic, music and story, Katana Zero is just 2D hotline miami. If you have played hotline miami, you have already played this game. (None of this is a bad thing, mind)\n\nKatana Zero is a brutally difficult action game where you die in one hit and have to clear out all enemies from a set of rooms in one go before moving on. It's the tried and true hotline formula with some added weeb shit for good measure. The gameplay does feel a bit strange at times where your character randomly won't attack when you needed him to or will get stuck on a wall when you desperately needed to fall, but reloading after death is instantaneous and nothing is more satisfying than finally nailing that perfect run and leaving without a scratch. Melee weapons are always more fun in games like this in my opinion, and getting up close and personal to hack some poor sap into mincemeat as the screen shakes and bassy synth music blares in your ears is amazingly immersive.\n\nThe story is so predictable that it's almost upsetting and it does nothing new with the 'cyberpunk dystopia' trope. Mentally troubled main character [spoiler] moonlights as an assassin and falls deeper into insanity while trying to redeem themselves with a new connection [/spoiler] with plenty of glitch effects and psychedelic dream sequences. As soon as a new character appears, you know exactly what's going to happen to them. As an aside though, when the credits rolled and 'to be continued' lit up my screen, I was so confused that I genuinely believed that the game was doing a bit and faking me out. At the current \"end\" the story barely feels like it has moved past the first act, ending on a massive cliffhanger. Nothing on the store page said anything about the story being incomplete or episodic, and having to now wait for the rest of the story in the form of (admittedly free) dlc is kind of a dick move on the devs' part. Just put something on the store page to let people know that the game's story isn't finished and it wouldn't be an issue.\n\nAll in all though even if the plot is nothing special, the gameplay alone makes this game worth dropping a couple bucks for 4 hours of gory fun.", "timestamp_created": 1682740079, "timestamp_updated": 1682740079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

violent people, but I'm five minutes in and I crave blood\" -Alpharad, about a very different game. It still applies here.\n\nSeriously though this game is an absolute adrenaline rush filled to the brim with hidden dialogue, secret options, and tons of replay value. As somebody with 25 hours in a 6 hour game, I can also verify that it's an absolute blast to achievement hunt and speedrun this game, as the mechanics allow you to be expressive in your playstyle to the absolute max. Think slowing down is lame and for weak little babies? You can deflect bullets in real time like a GOD. Hell there's even an option in the speedrun menu to turn off the mechanic entirely. \nSpeaking of replay value, once you beat the game you get access to an entirely reworked hard mode with new enemies that make you have to adapt and change the way you think. Every time I go through this game, both in hard mode and in regular mode, I'm blown away by surprisingly detailed environments that you blow right through, actually funny dialogue options that you could completely miss, and even the ability to pet cats.\n\nOn my first play through I thought the story was a bit corny, with one or two unnecessary characters and an unsatisfying conclusion, but then I went back to explore options that I felt I might have missed and was proven very wrong. The game is full of blink-and-you-miss-it moments that can make your second time through feel like an entirely different story. If you were an absolute menace to everyone around you in your first play through, if you go back and e nice to them you'll be rewarded with a different side of these characters.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is that it is very clearly incomplete, and the devs actually made that abundantly clear in the credits where it's stated this is the \"first act\". Still, for the game coming out in 2019, it's disappointing that what we've gotten in hard mode and speedrunning mode aren't meant to expand on the genuinely interesting story and characters that we spend a criminally short time with. I'm just praying the DLC that they're making comes out soon enough to get the attention it deserves.", "timestamp_created": 1681436475, "timestamp_updated": 1681436475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136656995": {"recommendationid": "136656995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999984176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1681704706}, "language": "english", "review": "Very based game, I have it on shreksbox and pc and always seem to come back to it after a while.
