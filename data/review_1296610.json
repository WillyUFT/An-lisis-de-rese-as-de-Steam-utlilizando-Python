It is incredibly visually charming, with consistently cute graphics; satisfying sound design; great catchy, music; and endless puns. It is also incredibly easy to keep playing with the cycle of battle/event -> move to next area -> battle/event being very seamless. I see a lot of influence from Slay the Spire and Peggle as well as Enter the Gungeon. The interim gameplay and layout of the game is structured very similarly to Slay the Spire, but with Peggle-like gameplay and Enter the Gungeon's penchant for making every name a pun (seriously, nearly every orb in the game has 'orb' or 'ball' or something similar wedged into the name. I love it!).\n\nWhen Peglin sees the opportunity to Peggle-ify something, it does. You navigate by firing your orbs at the end of fights. You collect money from pegs in the middle of the fight instead of having a random RNG roll at the end of the fight. You choose rewards in some events by shooting at pegs. The peg layout during navigation is affected by the outcome of the event. I love seeing games go all-in on their \u2018thing\u2019 like this. \n\nHowever, it is not without it's issues. These issues are big enough to hamper my enjoyment of the game, but I also believe they are mostly the product of being an early access game.\n\n[h1] 1. Only Peglin (the default class) getting a choice when reaching a chest. [/h1]\n\nThe default class, Peglin, has access to nearly all relics and orbs; the other 3 classes get narrower subsets based on a loose theme. To offset this, 90%+ of the time Peglin gets an extra option when choosing relics and orbs. When reaching a treasure chest, Peglin gets a choice of 2 relics; the other classes get only 1 option. Regardless of balance, losing this choice just feels *bad* on the other classes. On the default Peglin, treasure chests vs regular fights vs elites/minibosses feel like they have meaningful tradeoffs. On the other classes, taking a treasure chest feels like a trap.\n\nIf Peglin got 3 choices and the others got 2 choices this would be fine. Peglin would still have the edge, but you have a choice regardless of the class you\u2019re playing.\n\n[h1] 2. Classes don\u2019t feel very distinct. [/h1]\n\nThe only unique difference in classes are: the starting relic, 1 of the 4 balls in their starting deck being different (although each class can get each other\u2019s \u2018starter\u2019 ball), and 1-5 dropped orbs (out of ~100) and 2-3 dropped relics (out of ~100) being unique to each class. Each class has 80%+ overlap in the orbs and relics they can receive. So despite each class having a \u2018theme\u2019, they all get a bunch of things that are irrelevant to their theme or directly opposite to the theme. The non-crit class still gets a bunch of crit-only stuff. The crit class still gets a bunch of non-crit-only stuff. In StS terms, it would be like if Ironclad was given a few random poison or shiv cards, or the Silent was given cards that scale with the number of orb slots you have. As a result, each class wants roughly the same rewards and plays roughly the same. \nThe exception is that the Balladin gets a damage bonus for stacking armour that the other classes can\u2019t replicate. But this isn\u2019t always the best strategy; depending on the run the \u2018right\u2019 play is to play it just like the other 3 classes.\n\nThe default class, Peglin, gets by far the most powerful starting relic. Balladin sometimes has his unique build going, but the last 2 classes just feel like \u201cPeglin, But Worse\u201d. Ironically, because of Peglin\u2019s choices, it\u2019s often easier to get a \u2018themed\u2019 run going on Peglin than the class with that theme as their whole shtick.\n\nFix: remove all the clutter from the \u2018themed\u2019 classes and make their relic/orb pools much smaller/more focused.\n\n[h1] 3. Act 3\u2019s map [/h1]\n\nAct 1\u2019s map is kind of a blob where all the paths are mostly the same length. That\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s the first act.\n\nAct 2\u2019s map is great: there are many different paths of different lengths you can take, which makes navigation and planning more interesting. \n\nAct 3 abandons this with every path being the exact same length. It\u2019s boring and makes navigation and planning far less impactful on the run\u2019s outcome.\n\n[h1] 4. Not enough content variety [/h1]\n\nI put this last because it feels like cheating to say this on an early-access game. Only act 1 has 3 different elites/minibosses. Only act 3 has 3 potential bosses. It feels like there are only 4 or 5 layouts for the regular fights for each act; you will see repeats of multiple fight layouts in almost every run. This will obviously be fixed with time as development continues, but currently it does contribute to the samey-ness feeling. More stage gimmicks would help. A lot of events feel quite same-y too.\n\n[h1] 5. Other misc. gripes [/h1]\n\nShops can appear on the second floor, before it\u2019s possible to get enough gold to buy even a single thing (unless you have amazing luck with the first fight). Shops should only appear from floor 3 onwards at a minimum.\n\nRefresh pegs should move like crit pegs; bad placement of refresh peg can make a fight way harder than it has any business being.\n\n[b] The backwards elite in act 3 is RIDICULOUSLY overtuned. [/b] I have a harder time killing him than any of the act 2 or 3 bosses, even if I only see him right before the act 3 boss. He\u2019s easily killed me more than all the other fights in act 3 combined, bosses included.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nThis does feel like quite a negative review but it\u2019s not a bad game. The visuals are very cute and charming and the core gameplay is solid. I don\u2019t regret my purchase. I just see the potential the game has to become a classic like Slay the Spire or The Binding of Isaac.

This is disappointing, because a LOT of what this game does -- from the ball abilities to the visuals to the music -- is great, but without that element of control in your play, it stops being a roguelike puzzle game and, instead, turns into an experience where all you can *really* do is pick abilities and hope they work out.\n\nBefore the changes I got multiple completed runs in the game.

I think it's fun and offers a fun unique spin on the rogue-like genre. Granted I haven't played many rogue-likes (which may be where some of my frustration stems from) but I've seen gameplay of enough to know that this is fairly unique. I also really love the simplistic art design and un-intrusive sound effects. I've experienced some frustrating parts of the game which are even more frustrating because they really dont have to be.\n\nThe game is fun and can be addicting. Some of the boards are oddly frustrating (oddly for the reason that... they shouldn't be). I'm reviewing this in early access so I understand that the overall quality has room for improvement and that the game length can be considered pretty short. I think a full run through at normal speed can be completed in around 25-30 mins depending on your build. Currently I'm okay with it because I usually play while watching a movie/youtube so I don't care. I like the possibility of potential variety of combining orbs and artifacts to customize your builds but some of the artifacts are a bit perplexing in that their negative effects do not outweigh their positives, especially considering there are artifacts only with positives which you will most likely hunt down and pick no matter what every run.\n\nI understand that in early access there is still a lot of work that should be done to make this experience truly great and fun and I purchased after playing the free demo to support the devs in hopefully, someday, releasing the full product.\n\nI like the challenging enemies and bosses, but it's annoying that your success essentially hinges on very specific items and sometimes nearly killing yourself to burrow through to a damn refresh peg. Currently I don't see a ton of build variety.\n\nMy suggestions for the devs off the top of my head:\n\n- Please rework some of the boards or the physics as they can become incredibly frustrating, like beating your head against a wall smashing 1 peg per turn to get to a refresh peg that too often end up in some of the goofiest and trickiest places. It especially sucks when I've got 1 or 2 good orbs and 5 lvl-1 pebballs (the game's version of a basic bitch orb).\n\n- Add more maps and board variety for certain encounters. \n\n- Rework some of the negative artifact effects.\n\nMy suggestions for the customer:\n\n- PLAY THE DEMO to see if you like the game\n\n- Buy the game if you feel like this game adds enough of a unique spin on roguelikes and support the devs to see this game to its full potential. \n", "timestamp_created": 1700031313, "timestamp_updated": 1700031313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150154179": {"recommendationid": "150154179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264365771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1200, "last_played": 1690858308}, "language": "english", "review": "What if peggle was a deck building rougelike?

There's some caveats I'll get into, however. I will also be using Slay the Spire as a reference point since this game takes a lot of it's structure and underlying mechanics from that game.\n\nBeen playing this ever since there was just one class to play as, and now after all the updates and everything I feel like I have a lot to say about where I stand on the game:\n\nFor the first few maybe 10-20 hours of runs, experimenting with the different classes and climbing up to around Cruciball 5-6, you'll generally have a good time, it can be a bit more RNG heavy than your usual rogue-like/lite, but for those first few hours it's not too egregious. I cannot say it stays that way, unfortunately.\n\nAt around the Cruciball 7-ish area the game goes from \"Fun experimenting with different builds and making the most of what you've got with each class\" to \"If you don't have a very hyper-specific build going for your class, your chance of winning is 0%\" and it's like the flip of a switch. Then you hit Cruciball 10+ and it becomes \"If you don't get an even more hyper-specific build going IMMEDIATELY, you're not even going to make it through Act 1, or even halfway through it\"\n\nThere's no real difficulty curve, it just does a vertical spike every 4-5 difficulty levels. Compared to something like Slay The Spire, where it does the same sort of thing with it's difficulty, but each character has much more viable build varieties and is overall just much better balanced in that game.\n\n[h1] Issues With The Game [/h1]\n\nTo get into more specifics about the problems with this game, I'll break them down here:\n\n[h3] Orb Rewards [/h3]\n\nIn STS each class has their own set of starting cards, with a few generic cards shared by everyone and 2 unique cards to them that [b] will not appear in any rewards [/b] outside of one specific random event that can happen. This is important because in Peglin, each character has the exact same number of starting orbs, and 1 orb that is different for each class (except Peglin and Roundrel have the exact same loadout), every one of these orbs can still be found again as a reward for beating a fight.\n\nThis creates a problem of just adding more bloat to the item pool that is already too bloated. No one is realistically ever going to take these items as a reward either, so they're literally just there to make getting a viable build harder. Add this on top of the fact that 2 Cruciball levels add even more useless junk to your starting loadout, and it's just not fun to see yet another stone or daggorb in your rewards when you desperately need something to get a run going.\n\n[h3] Build Variety [/h3]\n\nThis is most likely the biggest issue with the game, or tied with another issue I have. As stated before, from Cruciball 0-5/6 you can get away with actually experimenting with new things and have a lot of builds work and this is where the game is at it's best. Anything past that though, you need very specific builds to even have a chance of winning.\n\nThis wouldn't be as big of a problem if not for one thing: reward bloat. Way too often will you get entirely useless rewards, or orbs/relics for builds that just straight up have no chance of actually winning, and as cruciball gets higher, less and less become viable and everything in general becomes harder to actually obtain. \n\nAs it is at the time of this review, each class has 1, MAYBE 2 viable builds to go for in Cruciball 7+, except for default Peglin because he has access to nearly everything, which creates the bigger issue of the item pool being so bloated you'll almost never get any kind of actual build going.\n\n[h3] Level Variety/Quality [/h3]\n\nThis is the other biggest issue with the game, there's just not enough variety in board layouts and the game becomes far too same-y much too fast. On top of that, a lot of board layouts are just really badly designed. You can very often find boards that can have your refresh option be near impossible to reach, meaning you'll be wasting shots just to dig it out of some corner. \n\nThe game has one and ONLY one relic that can cause the refresh pegs to move, and you can add more of them through other relics, but this is still an issue that can occur unless you have, again, a very specific build to curb this issue.\n\n[h3] Navigation [/h3]\n\nAnother issue I have with the game is the way navigation is done. After you beat a level, you have to shoot a ball into the area that goes the direction you want to go. Sometimes there are fire-pits that do damage to you for misnavigating. As an idea, I like it, however, a lot of board setups and other various issues very, VERY often cause you to go a direction you don't want to go.\n\nThis kind of navigation works for something like STS as you can plan out a route, weigh risks vs rewards and decide on last minute branches on what you want to do depending on how well a particular floor went. In Peglin, you can very desperately need to go one direction and either the board is set up in a way that makes that impossible/entirely random, or you could shoot your ball and it just so happened to shoot a bit harder than usual this time and bounce off a peg so hard it bounces in the other direction with no real control, and every time you misnavigate it almost never feels good or like you could have prevented it.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nOverall with all of these issues, I can't in good faith recommend the game. It is fun for those first few hours, but once you start digging into the harder difficulties and challenges the game offers (which is the only real extra content waiting for you after beating it the first few times), things become just entirely unfun and frustrating and just gets exponentially worse in that regard the further you go.\n\nI do hope the devs fix a lot of these issues the best they can because the game does have a lot of potential and can be fun under the right circumstances. I wouldn't have put 93 hours into this game if there wasn't something there hooking me, after all. But to anyone looking to get into it, be warned, either wait and play something like Slay The Spire instead, or if you do choose to get this game, just be prepared for the frustration that will eventually happen.\n\nIf things change in the future i'll update my review and recommendation, but as of now this is where I stand with the game for anyone looking to get into it.", "timestamp_created": 1698916305, "timestamp_updated": 1698916305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620846748352050781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149345027": {"recommendationid": "149345027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099139011", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1699147607}, "language": "english", "review": "its good", "timestamp_created": 1698887840, "timestamp_updated": 1698887840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149326854": {"recommendationid": "149326854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851721750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1699481269}, "language": "english", "review": "cool", "timestamp_created": 1698864105, "timestamp_updated": 1698864105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149323826": {"recommendationid": "149323826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044191951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_at_review": 1507, "last_played": 1700761143}, "language": "english", "review": "just a fun time, really would recommend if you liked Peggle", "timestamp_created": 1698860916, "timestamp_updated": 1698860916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149308204": {"recommendationid": "149308204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006477147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "playtime_at_review": 2612, "last_played": 1700416379}, "language": "english", "review": "just pegging with the bros", "timestamp_created": 1698843578, "timestamp_updated": 1698843578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149279441": {"recommendationid": "149279441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098468205", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1389, "last_played": 1698985029}, "language": "english", "review": "Too much rng it becomes annoying and a slog to play", "timestamp_created": 1698792578, "timestamp_updated": 1698792578, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607669830322265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149274707": {"recommendationid": "149274707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008332774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 457, "playtime_forever": 3716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3567, "last_played": 1699027282}, "language": "english", "review": "A good Peggle-like roguelike game, but the overwhelming rng of every aspect in the game is not particularly fun longterm.

I ended up taking a break after beating my first run since certain items/orbs were either completely useless or insanely broken. Coming back after a few months, the game feels easier in the best ways possible. Encounters feel challenging, yet possible, encounters like the ballista encounter is far easier with amount of piercing orbs or orbs that get around hitting the enemy in front, and frankly, I love the new gameplay options.\n\nAs an example of a glowup, the Gambler's Chip used to be significantly worse, since two of the zones were 0x. So if you were running orbs with multiball and a single one hit a 0x, your entire damage shot didn't actually matter anymore. Now, since the 0x was changed to 0,5x, you still get punished for taking it and not getting the shot lined up so it hits the 2x, but now multiball actually works in a way that doesn't completely invalidate your Gambler's Chip. \n\nBuilds feel easier to craft, the orbs feel powerful and honestly, I really like where the game is at in terms of balance.

[/b]\n\nMany runs will fail based purely on unpredictable and uncontrollable factors. Again, at lower difficulties this problem is not a problem, but this is not because the difficulty modifiers introduce it, simply because the lack thereof grants a sizeable buffer to random punishment that makes it manageable. Most of the game's problems are built right into its core. It would benefit greatly from a minor reduction to the difficulty of the modifiers and a serious overhaul of many of its random attributes to be more reliable.\n\nI will amend, however, that the game is still in beta so my concerns may be addressed, and, for some, they may just be an aspect of the rogue like experience. My specific complaints may come from a dissonance of how much control I wish to have in a style of game that hinges inherently on random factors. I believe it could be much better, but perhaps that is just me.

It combines the adictive fun and randomness of Peggle with a strategic gameplay that makes this game way deeper than the old Peggle games. \n\nThe game in its core is a roguelike, and you'll lose and start over a million times, but if you manage to beat the game (3 worlds with around 10-13 \"levels\" each), you can start your new round with a twist, that keeps adding. So after you beat the game the first time, maybe enemies will be a bit stronger. And if you manage to beat it that way, then you also start with less gold. And if you beat it like that, then next time you'll also have less special pegs on each level. And such, and such. This means you always have a new challenge to beat. After 80 hours, I'm at Cruciball level 9 and there seems to be at least 15. And you can also change the character at some point, which brings new game modes into the table.\n\nReally, it's worth every penny.

First thing I noticed that drove me nuts is my cursor doesn't actually line up with my shot trajectory.  Got used to that, kept playing for a couple hours. Only my first run was not frustrating at every turn. Most of the relics are garbage that requires you to take a debuff to get a buff that may or may not be useful, bad enough when you're picking one (assuming you can even get one that doesn't just straight debuff you given the rest of your build), but really bad when it is just straight given to you from a ? tile.  (FYI - the coin that makes the bottom slots do 0.5x / 1x / 2x damage, and makes one of the 0.5x slots do damage to you, is just straight terrible)  The explanations of the orbs are bad. Some of them aren't too hard to figure out, but others just have an icon for what it does, and some tell you it applies some condition but doesn't tell you what that condition does. The game doesn't even tell you how your damage works to start with, you just have to click stuff and figure it out. (not that it's complicated - just cumulative based on how many pegs hit / whether you have crit active - but it's hard to be confident whether I understand the implications of various orbs' special abilities since it doesn't really explain anything)  \n\nShops seem like a complete waste of time since I generally get enough gold per level to buy one orb and upgrade one orb, or upgrade and heal. If I'm lucky and don't just miss all the coins while trying to just hit that dang bomb to deal with the swarm of enemies....  I never have any gold to save. \n\nThis could be a really fun game with a little more polish and less bad RNG consequences, but as it is now it isn't, it's just frustrating.

I'm a big fan of roguelite titles, and I have lots of fond memories of playing Peggle. At the time of review, I've beaten the game, reached the Mines several times, etc. and generally don't find the difficulty to be an issue. There are times where you'll be at the edge of your seat, preparing for your inevitable pegging death, but the triumph you will feel after combat is relieving. Every bit of the game feels extremely rewarding, and due to the short length, I have no issue with dying and picking back up where I started.\nThe visuals are simple, but stunning and work extremely well. The colors are masterfully chosen for each level. The gobbo's are saturated, easy to see on each level. Everything is simple but placed with purpose. Nothing is too messy (which is an issue I often find with pixel indie games, but not here.)\n\nIt feels like a soft casual game to pick up and play whenever you please, with the added bonus of constant replayability due to it being pretty easy to buy orbs, collect relics, and build the OP gobbo champion of your dreams. The sound design is very pleasant, with each peg hit feeling very satisfactory (save for one loud noise) and the OST itself is calming, leading to an overall good experience. The UI is easy to understand, pick up, and play. \n\nThat being said, I did receive the game for free. And while I do see myself playing this again and again in the future, it IS in early access. The price tag currently seems a bit hefty for the amount of content in the game. While it seems like there's several builds you can make, several characters you can unlock, there's 3 levels and only a few bosses. There's lots of different interaction events, but you'll be finding repeats pretty early on in your playthrough. I enjoy this game a lot, but I'd say to wait for a sale, or perhaps if you need to feast your eyes on some golden Peggle roguelite gameplay, take the dive and become one with the gobbos.", "timestamp_created": 1692390695, "timestamp_updated": 1692390695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506726443767547607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144510232": {"recommendationid": "144510232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271935808", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1694580912}, "language": "english", "review": "played it for a bit and im hooked. worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1692386861, "timestamp_updated": 1692386861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493273526430130005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144501800": {"recommendationid": "144501800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044965045", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 905, "last_played": 1692378539}, "language": "english", "review": "all random. every sinister hint to agency is a lie\nthere are no builds no strats. just luck", "timestamp_created": 1692378605, "timestamp_updated": 1692378623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44638824462890625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144474355": {"recommendationid": "144474355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838373484", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1038, "last_played": 1697418797}, "language": "english", "review": "i loeb gobin game", "timestamp_created": 1692351407, "timestamp_updated": 1692351407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493273526430130005", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144465247": {"recommendationid": "144465247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298002408", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1695433213}, "language": "english", "review": "I like to play this game sitting down with a tall glass of wine in a smoky dark cabin.\nWhile I smoke my cigar in my wooden home with bear, lion and deer pelts strewn about I think to myself\n\"By god, those bastards they've done it!

Plus it's canonically self defence! (Referring to the Good Slime relic) \nSo if you like Peggle, Goblins, A complete monopoly on all forms of purchases in their Peglin society, or goofy little guys you'll like this game.\nTLDR: The game is good and unique.\nThe gameplay's good, it's pretty much a Peggle rogue-like with deck building.\nIt has an entirely controllable level of difficulty so no matter if you chose \"I'm too young to die\" on DOOM (The wrong choice) or master mode on Terraria (The wrong choice) or even if you're a normal person, it'll have something for you.\nIt has 3 unlockable characters not counting Isa-Peglin, the Balladin, Roundrell and Spinventor.\nThe base Peglin is a Jack of all trades, you can get most orbs and relics making for the most diversity.\nThe Balladin is centred around Ballwark aka shield, a Magdalene or tank of the Peglin world.\nThe Roundrell is like the rogue class, based around debuffs and generally being a nuisance to whatever he's fighting.\nThe Spinventor is a way to almost force diversity, the orbs you have get stronger if they are one of a kind, but can be not-but useless if you have many of them.\nIn conclusion: If you have $20, like balls and rouge-likes. Tf you waiting for? Peglin is peak rogue-like design, it can be enjoyed by literally anybody on the face of the Earth.

well there are still pegs on the board sometimes that can push you to a different route, and while that sounds inherently negative, i kinda like it because it adds spice to the game. and even if you do fail most of the paths just diverge to themselves anyway.\n\nthe actual balls themselves are designed to be fun and used in unique ways which i love. my personal favorite are anything with multiball, which adds multiple balls on the screen, the lightning ball, which destroys multiple pegs at once, and the summoning circle, which puts 3 of whatever ball is up next in your ball ring. \n\nand finally, there are also upgrades in the game called relics. relics are where the game starts to get good because there are some really overpowered/fun upgrade in here. one of them will give every ball in your deck multiball at the cost of a couple attack, theres one that spawns a squirrel (which is just another ball) after every 40 pegs you hit, and so many more. \n\nthis game is a ton of fun, and i think that the main problem is that there isnt too much content in the game yet. there is absolutely still enough to play and enjoy the game for well over 50 hours, but there is still a lot to be desired here, which is fine because its in early access anyways. 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1691210969, "timestamp_updated": 1691210969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475938677787780762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143432639": {"recommendationid": "143432639", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000862639", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1580, "last_played": 1698669208}, "language": "english", "review": "gud gam", "timestamp_created": 1691210817, "timestamp_updated": 1691210817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475938677787780762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143428033": {"recommendationid": "143428033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164110089", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1699511922}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1691203607, "timestamp_updated": 1691203607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475938677787780762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143427323": {"recommendationid": "143427323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012852077", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1700592907}, "language": "english", "review": "oh god i love pegging", "timestamp_created": 1691202581, "timestamp_updated": 1691202581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475938677787780762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143426821": {"recommendationid": "143426821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449861013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8534, "last_played": 1697463294}, "language": "spanish", "review": "probablemente uno de mis rogues mas jugados, no recomendarlo es criminal.

preface this by saying that I have played this game mostly on mobile and have hit Cruciball 8+ (its challenge modifiers, about halfway through) on each of the four characters. \nI enjoy Peglin, I think the game has a great fundamental concept with some interesting mechanics, but I would not recommend this game on PC taking its price into consideration. \n\nYou will be purchasing a heavily unbalanced and frustrating yet cute and sometimes satisfying roguelite. If you enjoy roguelites, you will enjoy Peglin. If you are looking for a polished game that feels fair with every loss/victory, constantly encourages you for trying new strategies, and makes you feel like you're improving your game skill, Peglin is not a game for you. If you feel like trying Peglin's full version, purchase it on a mobile device. It is not worth the price here. \n\nThe Good:\n- I like the core concept quite a bit. A Peggle roguelite is just neat, and how its implemented here is also that - it's neat. The physics are consistent enough and many in-game boards are interesting. This is not perfect by any means and certain boards/enemy combinations are downright terrible (Spiders, Dark Encounters, certain Shielded Knights, Slime Elite, and more). But for the majority of boards, they feel interesting.\n- Good runs are very satisfying. The rare times where you make things work feel fantastic. There's many intentionally designed synergies between orbs and relics in this game that feel great to use when pulled off. \n- The presentation is very cute. The pixel art is simple but enemies are stylistic and interesting, visual effects are fun and flashy, and all the little sound effects that play with each attack feel great as you build up power. \n\nThe Bad:\n- The early game is quite awful. Every single character has a nearly identical starting set of orbs (and two have completely identical sets? I don't understand that one bit) making every early game run equally boring with every character. This is a game where you have to heavily lean into the relics you get if you want a chance to win. But even with this, in the early game, many encounters are complete slogs of you shooting your orb at a refresh peg or bomb over and over while being forced to listen to the damage sound effect constantly. All while the game is at 3x speed. There's no interesting deviation and this 15 minute part of the game feels like you just waiting to start playing. \n- The in-game economy is counter-intuitive. After winning a battle, you have a couple orbs you can purchase, the option to upgrade orbs, or the option to heal. Nearly every run where you feel forced to heal, you've already lost. That option feels like you're being laughed at. Spending money here also stinks, since if you run into a shop, prices are so bloated that you feel unable to influence your run there in any way, shape, or form. Early prices are so steep that you cannot influence your run in any massive way early on. Lategame leaves you with so much money that you just look for a shop, buy every relic, shrug, and move on. It's not fun having to ignore orb after orb, upgrade after upgrade, and then losing to some unfortunate refresh peg spawn.\n- Character unlocks take way too long. The unlock prerequisites are downright confusing. I've unlocked every character, and to do so, I had to do specific runs for them over and over to hope I hit some... big \"50\" number the game wanted me to land at. I didn't win a single one of those runs. This wouldn't really be a big issue to me if the rest of the game was as fun and balanced as I'd hope. \n\nPeglin struggles from an overall lack of player influence. For many reasons listed above, you dive into a run hoping to get out of the first act so you can start playing. The game makes most decisions for you, although it doesn't feel like that at first. In a sense, the entire game is like a pegboard, shooting your little orb down and hoping for some sense of success. And hey, sometimes it hits. But other times, you're running through \"?\" rooms denying events that have nothing to do with your run, mashing the fire button hoping for the board to change, or doing the same exact strategy that you won the past 8 times with because, hey, why try anything else if they're all worse?\n\nI do not recommend this game in its current state. However, if the development team focuses mostly on rebalance and absolutely overhauls most of the early game, this could absolutely be a gem. I'm not too stoked there, seeing the developers sell plushes of characters and push out more content on top of deeply flawed systems.

New runs take a long time before they start being fun. Early pegboards and orb options make the gameplay slow and unfun and it kills my desire to play again.\n2. The RNG on enemy encounters is a little too random. Some runs you'll cruise from chest to chest and stroll up to the boss. Other runs you'll get several encounters with a ton of enemies each. In the case of the latter, it will often end a run before you can really even get going (which means back to the slow, boring first area.)\n3. There is no sense of progression. It feels very difficult (and up to chance) to achieve any of the character unlocks, and otherwise there's no way to start with better starting orbs, fast-track through the boring first area, or get some other kind of consistent character improvement.\n4. Bosses that spawn in the same area are not as weak/strong as others meaning sometimes you'll get the boss you can actually hope to beat, and other times you're facing something with way too much health and way too much damage or that can only occasionally be damaged.\n5. I strongly dislike the \"lanes\" mechanic where you can only attack the enemy closest to you and everything else is protected by the meat shields up front. Especially the tree enemies that turn into logs and block attacks after they die. It is not a tricky mechanic to play around--it just means your next couple of turns will ultimately be pointless (unless you are lucky enough to draw the right orb at the right time.)\n6. Many of the orbs in the game are nearly useless unless you happen to get the perfect combo of orbs over  your playthrough. It feels less like the game is pushing you to step outside of your comfort zone and try fun new playstyles, and more like you are constantly just doing the best you can with a combination of orbs that don't complement each other.\n7. I am ALWAYS out of gold when I get to a shop. Shop tiles should be removed, and you should be able to visit the shop between each encounter. Instead of just 3 meager orb options, upgrading, and healing, you could get more orb and relic variety to be able to actually have some slight control over your playthrough. \n8. The appeal of these games (to me) is the satisfaction of seeing the ball go on some crazy never-ending combo down the pegboard. It seems like most of the pegboards in this game are designed to inhibit players from hitting the perfect angle to get a crazy combo, or they'll just be schockingly empty. I understand designing them to be challenging, but a lot of the design philosophy at play seems to be \"funnel(s) for the ball to get sucked into.\"\n\nThis game needs to give more ability to the player to make you feel capable and let you actually have fun. It's like a rhythm game where you only have to play one note a second and if you try to go crazy and do something cool, you'll just be penalized. You are too limited in what you can and can't do when you're already relying on some unrealistic and unpredictable plinko physics to try and fight battles. The player's resources are spread far too thin between how little gold is received through the course of normal play and how much gold you must funnel into new orbs and upgrading orbs in order to have any hope of facing a boss, not to mention any gold you might find yourself having to pay to heal since there are so few other ways to meaningfully regain health. \n\nMy experience with the game so far is that even on my best runs, I feel like there was nothing I could have done to avoid dying at the end. It doesn't feel like something I can get better at and learn to have an edge to counter poor RNG luck, it just feels like I get really invested in runs only to lose because the game decided it was time, which is very frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1690827015, "timestamp_updated": 1690827015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499747604131698608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143153514": {"recommendationid": "143153514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042519325", "num_games_owned": 1550, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 4502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1627, "last_played": 1698210395}, "language": "english", "review": "Random pachinko RNG game, fun cause i dont think there's any other like it", "timestamp_created": 1690820872, "timestamp_updated": 1690820872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143130489": {"recommendationid": "143130489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040081653", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1691120789}, "language": "english", "review": "time for your pegging session", "timestamp_created": 1690788268, "timestamp_updated": 1690788268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143119118": {"recommendationid": "143119118", "author": {"steamid": "76561199083199692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3968, "last_played": 1699068137}, "language": "english", "review": "IF THIS GAME IS COCAINE THEN IM ADDICTED TO COCAINE WAHOOOOOOO", "timestamp_created": 1690766999, "timestamp_updated": 1690766999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143118690": {"recommendationid": "143118690", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123376638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1700609526}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had this game for less than a day and I have already clocked 11 hours.

I feel like you get to a point where it doesn't matter how much skill you have. You just win or lose on pure RNG. Did I get a relic/ orb that can actually beat a boss in the first couple levels? No? Oh well. Hey you wanted to go on the obviously good path that has a bunch of treasure? Nah, have fun misnavigating 10 times in a row. Gee I can only get 1 relic no matter what path I take. I hope it's good. NOPE. Hey, got a good build going on and there's an elite you wanna kill? Lets have the refresh peg spawn in the worst spot humanly possible so that you have to throw 4 orbs doing 3 damage just so you can refresh a board to actually do damage. Oh you're actually starting to figure out the game and get further up the cruciball ladder (levels of difficulty are called cruciballs)? Welp here's 5 more cruciball debuffs to your game that make it absolutely brutal even with a good build.  OH you got a fun bomb build going? WELL super sapper is your last boss so have fun dying because you exist. Don't have any orbs or relics that let you take out a bunch of pegs in one shot? Here comes the Dragon where you helplessly bounce off the side of the mountain and do 50 damage to a 15k health pool. The refresh you need? Yea that's in the bottom of the middle of the mountain that you'll never hit without special abilities or orbs that never showed up in your run because of RNG. NGL, I bought this game once, got pissed off by the RNG and refunded it, but watching other people play it I gave it another chance. And yea, if you don't care about losing 10 times in a row to things that aren't your fault at all, this game is a 10/10. But holy nutballs batman will this game make you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty melon baller if you want any modicum of control over what happens after you click fire. It's already super RNG in the fact that it's a pachinko rogue like; Why do I have to get d!cked by map travel, crap peg spawns (crits, refresh, etc), orb selection, relic selection, end bosses that completely counter certain builds that you could never know they're coming until it's too late, and super brutal difficulty modifiers? They've added so many different orbs and relics alone into the game that just getting a build that does one thing going before act 2 is pretty hard. Especially when you have 4-5 orbs that are useless (unless you decide to keep all the stones and get god like RNG)(ASSUMING YOU EVEN GET THE OPTION TO REMOVE ANY OF THEM BECAUSE RNG). All in all, it just feels really bad the more you play this game. If you want fun, never go past like cruciball 3 or pray to RNGesus for a good run. Hopefully they change the game up in some ways with some serious quality of life changes. I'm floating around cruciball 13 with all current characters and I just want to stop playing again after like 2 tries of getting absolutely decked by RNG. Make cruciball progression modifications less brutal, make builds slightly less RNG somehow (like being able to select x amount of different orbs/ relics that show up in the run since there's so damn many), and or let us know what the last boss is at the beginning so we don't waste an hour of our lives just to lose because OH WELL YOU GET TO FIGHT THAT GUY...

The physics on the balls makes for very lackluster shots. Every bounce the ball gets extremely heavier to make sure more bounces are less likely. The levels are sometimes okay, but most of the themed levels are just designed to look like something and are not well thought out level designs for a Peggle-like experience. Peggle has various mechanics that make the game feel better to play and makes it more exciting to hit a lot of pegs in one shot.\n\nChoosing where to go on the map requires shooting a ball into a hole with pegs blocking them in various ways, but that will often mean you don't get a choice in where you go. On top of that, there is often a fire pit hole where you will just take damage if the ball goes into it. Both of these mechanics are just anti-fun.\n\nRandom encounters will often have \"take damage\" on all possible choices. If you have too low of health, choosing any of said options will just straight up kill you and end the run.\n\nRanged enemies shoot you every shot and is incredibly unfair.\n\nThere's a small number of ball types that are fun, but the rest are not.\n\nAfter every fight you can choose to get a new ball, upgrade a ball, or heal. All of these options cost money though. If you have no money, you get nothing for beating a level and it feels terrible. There is a shop you can visit on the map that lets you buy balls or remove a ball, but the cost of everything is expensive, so you will rarely be able to buy anything. You are likely to buy a ball or upgrade a ball every time you are able to after a fight, so you rarely will have money for the shop. Healing and upgrading could stay as a cost after fights, but the balls should be free.

It's unusual in the genre because of it's Peggle setting, but that adds some charm to the game, and frankly makes it less RNG and more execution-dependent than most deckbuilders, which in my eyes gives it more longevity. It's simple, polished, has a surprising amount of run variety, and will give you your money's worth.\n\nLong version: Peggle is a very simple and straightforward game in almost every sense. It's easy to pick up and understand, it has simple rules and mechanics that are quickly understood, the artstyle is simple and low-demand (good.) It offers little beyond what it says on the cover: a deckbuilder roguelike crossed with Peggle. Weird idea, but it honestly works surprisingly well. Your 'deck' is the orbs you use to pop pegs, and they come in a wide variety of effects and even shapes. This variety is what differentiates your runs, for the most part; there's only so many different stage layouts per level, so eventually you will have seen every enemy combination, elite, and boss, and figured out more or less how to play the board itself. But adapting it to the orbs you have in question? That's where the game's longevity lies, because depending on what orbs you are offered and which ones you choose, you can have radically different playstyles. It's not always about clearing as much of the board as possible, and some orbs interact directly with the board in strange and novel ways.\n\nSo how is all of this executed? Frankly Peglin is very polished. For the most part, the mechanics are well-thought out, well-rounded, and clearly a lot of care has been put into making a large amount of playstyles both fun and viable. Bugs are very few and far between, and the devs have been good about quickly addressing them. Aesthetically, the game is really simple but that works out in it's favor; the visual style is consistent and fun, a lot of creativity has been put into the details of making almost every orb have wordplay of some sort, and the soundtrack is hardly amazing or memorable, but it's never annoying or disruptive, easily above average.\n\nThe devs are very responsive; early in the development cycle, I sent a letter detailing some findings about the game, and was more than pleased to get an answer that was clearly not a canned HR letter about appreciating support; instead the developer addressed several points of the feedback and hinted at how they might be resolved in future patches (and they were indeed.) That's a rare gem. Since then, updates have not been frequent but they have been of consistently high quality and added quite a lot of content to the game.\n\nSo are there any downsides? Yes, two major ones to my taste. Firstly, some encounters are in my opinion poorly thought out and cause unnecessary frustration. The most egregious example of this is the third level featuring some stages with portals on the board that cause your shots to gravitate towards them. Now, at times this allows for some clever play with curveballs, but most of the time, it takes away one of the core components of the game, which is controlling your shots and trying to make sure they hit what you want to hit, when you want it hit, and instead add a heavy dose of randomness to your shots (technically, portals are not random, and in theory you could perfectly calculate every impact of four portals on your shot at any point, but if you seriously try to claim that you could do just that, I'm calling you a liar.) Taking control away from the player when in all other cases it's heavily rewarded, does not feel good.\n\nThe second, and much more damning in my eyes, is the difficulty scaling. Like any roguelike and especially deckbuilder, this game has NG+ levels, the equivalent of say Ascension levels in Slay the Spire. In this game they're called Cruciball levels. And I have to admit, they embody the worst of difficulty design in deckbuilders in my eyes, particularly egregious in this game. At first it is simply a challenge, but rather quickly the Cruciball levels start taking so much power away from the player that they make certain builds and playstyles simply mathematically unfeasible. It gets to the point where each playthrough feels less like a test of skill and decision-making and more an RNG grind fest of resetting chests and elite fights until you get the relics that would make up for how terrible your starting deck, health, and gold have become. Now, take this with at least some salt, I am hardly amazing at the game by any stretch of the imagination. But I did give all of this a fair shot, I got up to Cruciball 15 (the maximum currently available,) but frankly about 5 of those Cruciball levels were forced. I did not particularly enjoy getting through them because every game felt like I was fishing for very specific things, otherwise I was at the mercy of a single piece of RNG going wrong on any given stage for 30+ stages (the crit only spawned in places you can't reach? Too bad, it's mathematically impossible to kill this elite before he removes 80% of your health.) On early levels, it takes a serious streak of bad luck to end your run. With the limitations each new Cruciball level after around 7 or 8 imposes, it could just take a single instance of bad luck which makes the game so RNG-dependent that it is no longer fun. More importantly, the game starts removing a lot of the mechanics that so much thought went into. You just get to play around and enjoy the variety the game has to offer a lot less, because you get so much less resources and so much less leeway. This all to me adds up to tedium and frustration, not difficulty. It's a shame because this game format offers a lot of ways of creatively adding difficulty, such as making individual encounters more intricate with different enemy types, debuffs, etc, but instead the chosen path is letting the player do a lot less.\n\nI am probably being unfair to the game by dedicating so much text to the very few negative points. I truly think the game is a lot of fun despite the difficulties being flawed. Even if you only do a few playthroughs of each character's different builds, and go up the first few Cruciball levels, which feel challenging but not crippling, the game still offers a lot of hours. The core loop is really satisfying, the variety is fun and engaging, and player ability matters much more than RNG. Peglin is definitely worth the price IF you are already a fan of deckbuilders. Even if you aren't, it's quite a good place to start, and I would strongly recommend this game's base difficulty and the first few levels to anyone looking for a good, light game to pass the time with. My own playtime will very likely increase, especially with new updates, and I hope that the development team continues to be as creative and polished into the future.", "timestamp_created": 1690005765, "timestamp_updated": 1690005765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142563332": {"recommendationid": "142563332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256854551", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1696716790}, "language": "english", "review": "Peglin Poglin", "timestamp_created": 1689999303, "timestamp_updated": 1689999303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142558113": {"recommendationid": "142558113", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196776051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1694482172}, "language": "english", "review": "Peglin :)", "timestamp_created": 1689990467, "timestamp_updated": 1689990467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142552098": {"recommendationid": "142552098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154359902", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 509, "last_played": 1693346363}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

Really glad I did - the game is fairly extensive, full of charm, and has a ton of fun relics and balls to get. What I really like is how responsive the devs have been, regularly patching to help improve balance, clarify descriptions, and add new items and characters. Peglin has a few oddities - the way the map pans when you start in particular is just kind of awkward - but it's a fun game with almost always something new to discover or try.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it mixes plinko/pachinko/bagatelle with Break Out mechanics, all set in a roguelike setting. In a lot of ways it reminds me a bit of Slay the Spire, especially the way the map is set up.

There's not a big sense of speccing into a specialized build each run like you might have with StS or similar.  It also bugs me that a lot of the orbs are basically just pebbles that do something extra on fire, like apply poison or shield, which leans away from the concept of having cool interactions with the peg board rather than towards it.  The music is pretty stale, encounter variety sucks, and metaprogression is limited to a few character unlocks and arbitrary challenge upgrades.  And the puns are cringe, sorry.\n\nBut really the big thing is the passivity on the part of the player during fights, I think something needs to change fundamentally with how the player interacts

Squeeze in the lime juice and set aside.\n\nSTEP 3\nMix the salsa ingredients in a small bowl. Heat a griddle pan or steamer and quickly griddle the tortillas or steam a stack of them to warm up. Reheat the bean mixture.\n\nSTEP 4\nTo serve, put 1-2 heaped tbsp of beans on a tortilla.

It doesn't help that the balance of the game is way off, some builds simply suck and others are unbelievably overpowered. The rewards for finding synergies are dubious. You can spend an entire game searching for a combo and never get it, or if you do, it just sucks, and even if it doesn't suck, the aforementioned unearned death could occur. This game design discourages trying new things.\n\nA few pegboards are simply awful, which funnel your thrown orbs into death traps where they do little damage. This is made worse when your refreshes are trapped in difficult-to-reach places where the best you can do is chip away at each individual peg in the way to get to it, all the while doing tiny amounts of damage to enemies who relentlessly chip away at your health. I'm looking at you, Slime boss, Dragon boss, slime+bat fight, etc.\n\nA few specific relics and orbs have hard counters which are impossible to predict. This issue is somewhat limited, but the worst example of this is the Gift That Keeps Giving, a BOSS RELIC, which makes it virtually impossible to defeat the dragon boss on the final stage (whose appearance is up to chance).\n\nALL of these issues are exacerbated when you play on Cruciball, where the game takes away the little saving grace it has. Some of the time, gaining a Cruciball level will simply increase the overall game difficulty, such as increasing enemy health and damage, which is a good way to amp up the challenge. The rest of the time, however, it severely cripples you by taking away vital game mechanics, such as refreshes, crits, gold, etc. You either get lucky and find an orb or relic to compensate, which has an opportunity cost, or you die miserably. I like that the game has progression and a goal to reach, but Cruciball makes the experience far too unforgiving and unfair. And without progression, the game gets quite stale. The best description for Cruciball is a series of compounding roadblocks that you must spend money (and luck) to remove before you can focus in on building your deck. It's a giant middle finger to people who want to have fun with the game still being replayable.\n\nIf you like heavily luck-based games, then Peglin is for you. However, if you've seen the popular YouTube videos of extremely fun or overpowered builds/synergies and want to replicate them on your own, prepare to have your patience tested. Of course, you can always relegate yourself to the custom run sandbox mode, but, in my opinion, where's the accomplishment in that?", "timestamp_created": 1687045069, "timestamp_updated": 1691273092, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140245533": {"recommendationid": "140245533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025643220", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1698872316}, "language": "english", "review": "Children's pachinko game with deck building", "timestamp_created": 1687044131, "timestamp_updated": 1687044131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140243446": {"recommendationid": "140243446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355319878", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7139, "last_played": 1698595206}, "language": "english", "review": "satisfying", "timestamp_created": 1687041131, "timestamp_updated": 1687041131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140231288": {"recommendationid": "140231288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870767119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1689369350}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to write a joke review of this game but I can't because it needs to be said that this game is actually the  most RNG based roguelike i think i have ever seen. Not in a good way.\n\nYou can't try to get a certain build as well as you can in other roguelikes eg Slay The Spire, and it's not like you can work with what you have as well as in other roguelikes eg BoI, Gungeon. Each of the orbs you are offered do fun and unique things, sure, but they are severly unbalanced in terms of power. Same goes for the relics you pick up. You can pick up a relic at the start of the game that  genuinely causes your run to be lost on the first turn of the last fight. \n\nPlus, the game has 2 unlockable characters. This would be good, if it didnt take hours of specifically trying to get them. The conditions you have to meet to unlock them arent things you would just end up doing in a normal run, you have to go out of your way to do a build that probably wont win the run, and hope along the way you dont get killed and get the right relics or orbs to complete them. The fact that less than 10% of players have one and about 5% have the other is just poor game design. There isnt even a real reward for unlocking them either, the character choice barely change how the run plays out. There are no real unique mechanics for each character, no unique orbs, no unique relics. \n\nThe game isnt inherently awful by any means, it's fun and cute and its definitely unique, and has huge potential to be really fun, but it just falls flat and feels really empty after playing over 2 hours. Hopefully once it's out of early access it gets improved and is rebalanced with more content, otherwise it just wont be worth it. \n\nTL;DR : Fun enough game for a few hours.

One and a half, really, since if you didn't use bombs, you were shooting yourself in the foot.\n\nI remember hearing some news from the devs pretty early on in its life cycle, where they outlined their desire to turn it into a high-skill Spirelike game, where they kept careful track of balance. I was disappointed to hear that at the time, since the Pachinko mechanic that the entire system is built around is not nearly as manipulable as something like a deck of cards, and I was worried that they were going to miss out on the inherent fun of Peggle's mechanics for the sake of some nebulous \"balance\" that was never going to be terribly possible to achieve.\n\nWhether it was a change of artistic direction, or me misunderstanding the quote, I'm overjoyed to say that that is NOT what this game has become. I'm incredibly impressed at the amount of content Peglin has these days, from new characters to new bosses, to dozens upon dozens of orbs, each offering unique playstyles that you can mix and match. The core mechanic remains fun, and important, but has become more manipulable than it used to be, thanks to the addition of things the like electropegnet, morbid, or the concentrication. The game has fully retained its charm though the incessant use of spherical puns, cutesy art, and has an added challenge system for those brave enough to face down Cruciball 15. Personally, I'm still working on the Roundrel and Balladin's ascensions, and their identities are JUST distinct enough to keep it interesting, particularly the Roundrel.\n\nI truly love this game, but it's not perfect. I think my biggest gripe would be how short it remains. Despite all they've added to the game, it still rigidly clings to the three-act structure popularized by Slay the Spire. As with all rogue-likes, I think the best fun you can have in this game is exploring combos and finding ways to break the game, which, while possible, usually only comes online maybe halfway through Act III. The most prevalent thought I tend to have after playing a game of Peglin is \"I wish I could keep going with this.\" The announcement of the dragon boss excited me, since I thought it heralded the addition of an Act IV, but sadly, it was just an additional third act boss. Say what you will about the mechanics of Backpack Hero, but its loop system is incredible, using old locations and enemies, but ramping up the challenge SIGNIFICANTLY. I'd love to see something like that Peglin.

enjoy this game as you can see from my playtime, but I can't recommend it. The game has alot going for it on the surface but in reality that's just not the case.\n\nThe game's severally suffers from being in early access. It's a rougelike with little replay-ability which in my opinion is its biggest sin, and the base game can be beat in less than an hour, and you can probably experience all the enemies and bosses in 2.\n\nAnother gripe is the gameplay itself. They have a whole lot fancy effects with the orbs and the relics that seem to be unique and cool but they all end up doing very similar things and leads to no real build crafting and without that you're left with peggle with extra vfx. I will admit some of the orbs are pretty fun to use but they are a very small few in a sea of dull unoriginal power ups you would see in a similar game. In the end you'll probably end up going into every run looking for the same orbs and relics as only a few are fun to use.\n\nThe game updates very slow as to be expected from a small team so there's no ill will there, but the amount of content added with each update tends to be able to be experienced all in a fresh run, so you are looking at a good 20 minutes of new content on every release. I thought this wouldn't be the case with the huge update that just happened, but sadly it didn't live up to the hype they were giving off.\n \nMy last gripe is the price. As the game currently is I'd say it isn't worth it and I feel it'll never be worth the $20 dollar price, as the dev has said they won't be adding any new areas so the game will have a total of 3 areas and the content they add to the game is very minuscule compared to other games out there with similar price ranges. \n\nIn conclusion the game has a solid core and some good ideas behind it, but sadly they don't live up to what they could be and end up being dull and frustrating due to the fact you know they could do better. Maybe one day the game will be fully released and I can come back and change my review, and I'll gladly do it if the game becomes the game I know it can be. Until that day I can't recommend this game as someone who's been playing since the beta.\n", "timestamp_created": 1685650408, "timestamp_updated": 1685650408, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762600541114807129", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139384144": {"recommendationid": "139384144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151957441", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1133, "last_played": 1693871605}, "language": "english", "review": "i feel like the game is deceiving with giving you the idea that it wants you to try to be creative and find ways to win through unique strats, such as offering cool artifacts and such but if you want to win you cant use them. if you try anything other than the big damage strat you will lose games just built that way but it is fun", "timestamp_created": 1685643428, "timestamp_updated": 1685643428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6810646653175354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139374562": {"recommendationid": "139374562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064180018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1494, "last_played": 1685565517}, "language": "english", "review": "get PEGGED idiot", "timestamp_created": 1685631453, "timestamp_updated": 1685631453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465517252683639526", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139369900": {"recommendationid": "139369900", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131230817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 804, "last_played": 1696816762}, "language": "english", "review": "BEST PEGGING GAME", "timestamp_created": 1685625242, "timestamp_updated": 1685625242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452773451805114746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139364796": {"recommendationid": "139364796", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180736632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4382, "last_played": 1699075297}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1685616897, "timestamp_updated": 1685616897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139340731": {"recommendationid": "139340731", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023481234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1545, "last_played": 1685569529}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't buy this game.

Your Peglin run will easily be decided for you within your first few rooms. The adding of new orbs and events does not help if you want to 'progress'. Progress in this case is The Crciball which only makes the game harder, not easier. Playing with it will result in your deck be just made entirely of stones, and with the changes to shops, removing them will not be easy. Some encounters upon starting the game can result in death, no matter what you do, depending entirely on rng. It's just very punishing. If you find being hit with a club entertaining, then you'll love the current game a ton of fun.\n\nLow Replay-Value. You will get bored fast.

The bosses for each zone are always the same. There's only 4 zones.

Not every seed is meant to be winnable, but it is still extremely addicting nonetheless.\n\nThere's a few builds that you can set up throughout the playthrough. There's builds centering around: poisoning the enemy, dealing crit damage, utilizing a very overpowered orb to deal extreme amounts of damage, building defense, stacking buffs, and lots of double edged sword relics that can spice up the run. I would love to say that all of these builds are pretty fairly balanced, but I've ran into a few of the builds where even if I had the build pretty dialed in, I still found the game way too difficult and unfair. \n\nThe two biggest examples of the games sheer lack of balance is the defensive builds and the crit builds. The defensive build in particular suffers from not having any reliable way of building up defense. The best orb is only 1 per every 4 pegs hit, which is pitiful on a lot of stages where you're getting hit multiple times per turn. It is made much worse that the tank builds give you no way of dealing strong damage; which is understandable, but you can't tank very well so it's a pain. The crit builds just suffer from not having a super reliable way of getting crits. You have to get way luckier with this build compared to others to take advantage of this build. It's kind of frustrating.\n\nI feel like they could just introduce more orbs dealing with crit damage and then buff all the defensive orbs; then it'd be more balanced. The class that is centered around defense is so hard to unlock. You have to get 100 defense to get it, and the most I've gotten is around 50. It's really annoying.\n\nDespite all this; I am very addicted to this game. It's extremely fun, and the builds that are actually good, are super fun to play with.

It doesn't go on sale for much off but I wanted to try it out so bad I caved in, and it's awesome!  I can't stop playing this game.  I play it several times a day.  I hear the music in my head all day.\n\nThis is a game that you replay many times, not one of those games you only play once.  So if you don't like playing the same thing only randomized so it's different each time you play, then this game might not be your cup of tea.  But for fans of games with high replayability factor it's a no brainer.\n\nSo what's this game about?  Well, have you ever played Peggle by Pogo Games?  This is kinda the same thing only the amount of pegs you hit determines how much damage you deal out to the enemies above.  First, there's no real story though I imagine a little Peglin on an adventure and he starts in the Forest.  There is a layout of pathways between 3 different icons: pirate-looking skull & crossbones which means a battle, Question Mark which means some kind of random scenario like \"You come upon a large tree with something in a hole in the tree.  Do you reach your hand in? (take 8 damage) or Shake the tree, or Leave? \" and you choose one of those options, the third icon is a large G enclosed in a circle which stands for the Store, where you can purchase randomized selection of balls and relics.  Stores can sometimes make or break your game.  I plan my route and try to get to the stores, if I have money that is.\n\nBattles consist of a special arrangement of pegs (not randomized but always the same for certain enemies) that you aim your balls at and hope it bounces around and hits lots of pegs before dropping down into the abyss.  Each ball has different attack numbers.  There's regular attack and then crit. attack.  Most balls also do something else, like attacks all enemies or can attack any enemy (choose before loosing the ball) instead of the default: the one that's closest to you.\n\nThere are 3 areas: The Forest, The Castle, and ...I think it's called the Mines.  There's about 20 or so places (I'm guesstimating, I should really count one of these days) to move to in each one.  At the end of each area there is a boss.  In the Castle there are two bosses that it chooses from and 3 different bosses to choose from in the Mines.   Some of the bosses are harder than others (the Dragon!).  \n\nOnce you beat the game you go into game+ where you have unlocked the Cruciball Lv. 1, and Custom Game where you can choose which relics and balls you start with, though you don't get any achievements when playing a custom game, nor can you unlock the two extra characters.  Yes, there are two unlockable characters!  And who knows what the Devs will add to the game next.  They just did an update and added new balls, relics, and enemies.\n\nMusic is great.  There are different tunes for each area and battles have their own music.  It's got a lot of variety to it so it's not boring and it's a long repeat too.\n\nThere are Achievements.  I have not looked at them yet to see if there are any super hard ones or not.\n\nOverall I am super happy with my purchase.  I think it's worth full price but you can also wait for a sale to save a bit if you want.  So far 20% off is the highest discount I've seen.

Like many of the other negative reviews, it's just hard for no reason. \n\nFor example: One of my favorite powerups is durable, but there's a map, the Pyramid when you're fighting the dragon, that is literally impossible if you have durable, because you'll rarely break a peg so you can't actually hit the center of the pyramid. So if you don't have a good refresh build or something else, it's just a guaranteed lose.\n\nThis game got a lot of its \"hype\" from the fact that so many creators played it early on. And it was fun to watch, because I could speed up the video. But the play is slow. Even with 1.5x speed, let's be real with each other - it's not that great.\n\nThey tried to capture Peggle but ended up just making me miss actual Peggle and realize that this is not Peggle, even if it's heavily inspired by it.\n\nLastly, there are interactions which don't really make any sense. Like the ability to get bulwark but the orb deals no damage. So if I didn't get any upgrades to actually give Muscircle or Spinesse, then the run is just over. I'm tired of seeing, and sometimes playing, games where the ability to win is deterministic on specific factors. And, what's worse, you have no way to know what you might face. Sometimes it's the Wall. Sometimes it's the crossbow. Sometimes it's the dragon.

Well, \"Peglin\" might just be the new ticket. It's a little game that came out on Steam recently, and it is garnering quite the attention. I have to say, it's one of the most exciting releases I've seen in a while.\n\nThe game is a fascinating synthesis of two major gaming pillars: \"Peggle\" and \"Slay the Spire.\" It perfectly meshes the fun of physics-based gameplay with the intrigue of strategic deck-building. It's got an addictive loop that speaks volumes about the depth and complexity of its design, something that might not be obvious on the surface.\n\nTake the way you can synergize orbs in \"Peglin\". It's a small detail, but one that I find quite intriguing. It offers the player myriad ways to engage with the game, making each playthrough a unique experience. The game also features relics, which add further layers to the strategic gameplay, a bit reminiscent Risk of Rain. It's a feature that adds a lot of replay value.\n\nNow, let's talk about the game's aesthetics. Its visuals are bold and colorful, delivering that sweet dopamine hit every time an orb strikes a peg. And the soundtrack? It's catchy, to say the least. It's one of those tunes that just embeds itself into your subconscious, continually luring you back into the game.\n\nDespite its many merits, \"Peglin\" does have a few areas that could use some polishing. The game feels a little short and left me wanting more. It desperately needs a level loop (repeat from the beginning after defeating the last boss at an increased level of difficulty) or additional levels to maintain the challenge and excitement. Plus, more unlockable characters, items, and orbs would be a significant boon, adding an additional layer of depth and personality to the game.\n\nAlso, I can't help but feel that once you master the mechanics, the runs become significantly easier. This can lead to a dip in the overall challenge, making the game feel a little less satisfying for seasoned players. This is an area where the developers could surely improve.\n\n\"Peglin\" is an intriguing title that any fan of indie games should seriously consider. It's an exciting blend of strategy and action, with a few hitches that keep it from being perfect.

The game is currently far too easy and far too short, the 3 worlds fly by ESPECIALLY when you have a half decent relic or two.

there are a wide variety of generally interesting orbs and builds but balance is all over the place so you rarely get to experience the orbs and builds in a meaningful way. \nA total victory makes you want to play again, though losses rarely feel like they're earned.\nThe new unlock-able characters are behind overly chance-based conditions so by the time you get to experience what should be a new and original play-style, the system they should be introducing is used up.\nThe system of risks vs rewards feels unequal, for every event room you enter there's a slim chance for something great but a much higher chance of just being outright punished.\nFor each enjoyable aspect of Peglin, there seems to be no shortage of shortcomings to take away from them.\n\nPeglin has all the potential to be

Firstly, the devs allows nerf everything that is at all fun, and just make the game an annoying thing to play. Instead of there being tons of runs, at the highest difficulty it just becomes formulaic; if you want to win, pick this, then this, and so on, this makes the game dull and creative for people who like to play with a challenge. Second, the disparity in power especially for relics is palpable. for example the highest tier of relic, boss relics, contain incredibly OP abilities, like a +2/2 buff on all orbs for the cost of losing a reload, and then you also have one where all gold you get is doubled, but all upgrades are also doubled, which is practically useless in comparison. This is a rouge-like, therefore there is a large amount of RNG, you can see this good or bad, I think it's a generally good thing, however if you don't like rouge likes, the RNG will feel awful. (Duh) In conclusion, this game can be fun, but the high difficulties are just repetitive and annoying with there being a large disparity in power between items, hopefully in a while updates will come out which will improve my decision, but for now I just can't recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1684110351, "timestamp_updated": 1684110351, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Why is it so hard to unlock 2 more basic characters? Why do you have to go far and beyond for that? Not to mention if you just play ingame and don't read stuff, you would maybe not even know that there are 2 more characters to unlock! And the new possible builds feel more than underwhelming. Having a orb giving you ballwark that maybe helps you block 5 dmg? When there are literally tons of items who can easily heal you up for more. Why would anyone want that. Ballution might have potential, but still you need to stack 5 to do even the same amount of dmg than a bomb (which would also be aoe while ballution only targets one).

Each level presents a new set of obstacles to overcome, and there are plenty of power-ups and bonuses to help you along the way. The levels are well-designed and progressively get more difficult as you go, so you'll never get bored.\nOne of the things I love about Peglin is the sense of satisfaction you get from completing a level. It's incredibly rewarding to watch the pegs disappear and rack up points, and the game does a great job of keeping you engaged and motivated to keep playing.\nOverall, I highly recommend Peglin to anyone looking for a fun and addictive puzzle game.

Game got better. New, useful, relics were added and tons of new good orbs were added, effectively solving its issue of rng and uncertainty leading to unfun gameplay at higher cruciballs, you dont need as many resourches if you need to buy less orbs to be more effective than before.\nCruciball 15 is now difficult, but doable if you spend a good few runs (if you dont cheat that is, otherwise its like 4-8 or so games) \n\n-------------REVIEW BELOW IS FROM TWO BIG UPDATES AGO, THE PROBLEMS ARE GONE. --------------------------\n\nI'll be blunt, this game is (can be) pretty fun, but ultimately badly designed. There's way too much rng; the worst kind of rng.\n\nI'm talking about the higher cruciball levels (the game's difficulty modifiers; 15 lvls). which the game is not at all designed around. Why? It's because a single bad thing can ruin an entire run. This includes even a single bad shot (though this is an extreme example, it happens, and enough times that its a problem). \nMuch more common is a terribly placed refresh/bomb/crit, which happens too often.\n\nEven if everything is and is going perfectly a single rng based bit of unluckiness can screw everything up, this remains the case the entire run. \nAnd since you need a good setup to have a shot at winning, you're probably going to have to rely on the random events. That adds even more rng. As normal fights are often not really worth the cost/risk.\nI should also mention this is with constantly going in and out of the run so i can constantly be, resetting fights, rerolling artifacts, pegs, orbs and other things obsessively, which probably isn't intended.\n\nWhile the rng, which governs every espect, the map, enemies, loot, peg placement, cycle of orbs you'll be firing, etc., is a problem, what makes it unbearable is all the 'checks'. \nIn other words, 'you don't have the counter/solution to a problem you're extremely likely or just garenteed to face, you're dead.' These include: can you deal with shields and/or multiple enemies (multi target and pierce), red bombs (requires great healing or a lot of hp), multiple sources of dps checks (the Wall bossfight, the castle mage elite, in the castle killing enemies fast enough to get to the archers and mages before they deplete your health, 4 boxes final bosses).\nThe games expects you to have everything while giving nothing.\n\nAnd there's a few more rare checks, like the third floors invisible enemies or how you can deal with your orbs being funneled into a single hole (looking at you dragon).\n\nSince it's a turn based roguelike theres's no getting around bad rng with skill like, taking a populair roguelike(lite) as an example, hades or something.\n\nThe central problem revolves around not having enough resources (gold, dmg and hp) and having to constantly deplete them. This leads to constant early deaths (and deaths in general) even with good setups and thus a LOT of frustration, because of something completely out of your control. That's why i call it badly designed.\nA bonus/free chooseable or in the beginning of a run, much like the free relic you get would go a long way to make it more doable. That or along with a reroll button (that can even reroll random events and what you're fighting, 'cept the bosses).", "timestamp_created": 1683496262, "timestamp_updated": 1693412019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524098575115203857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137967455": {"recommendationid": "137967455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017324408", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 900, "last_played": 1683495024}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been a player of Peglin for a while.

Now the game feels like the balls fall faster then they should, don't bounce enough, and you now have to consider spending gold coins on life vs upgrades. The fun curve significantly reduced. The game left the casual category and went more into every turn and decision requires considered strategy. The game is still good, but i'd be lying if I said Peglin since launch has retained the \"fun factor\" it had when it was first launched in early access.

But while there's a greater spread of orbs and archetypes, your ability to actually control the composition of your deck hasn't scaled to match--with the base class Peglin, you'll have four orbs to choose from after a fight, but they're completely random without any kind of reroll available--if you're shooting for something specific, you can easily just have no good options available to you.\n\nAnd while you do have all of those potential builds (if you get lucky enough to actually get the pieces for them)... the game doesn't really actually *reward* most of them. Ballution, the new poison build, gives you... mediocre-to-decent guaranteed damage on orbs that are otherwise hot garbage, with only one AoE option (which is admittedly good but also Quite Rare). Ballwark, the defense mechanic, comes in frankly *piddling* quantities. Your common option, at max level, gives... 1 Ballwark for every 6 pegs you hit. You are, optimistically, getting like 4 Ballwark. That is *nothing*. There's an uncommon that gives 1 for every 3 (so... 8 Ballwark)... but does zero damage no matter what. Wonderful use of a turn. And there's a rare one that actually gives you a decent-ish amount, but provides other disadvantages. And *none* of this helps you kill  the enemy because they exchange having good offense for a defensive gimmick that the game actively discourages. The later levels are so bloated in what they ask of you that you really need to have stacking offensive synergies to stand a chance.\n\nBut wait! There's classes focused on these gimmicks! Surely, they'll be better suited to making them work, with a narrower orb pool and different starting loadout. Maybe! I don't know! Because to unlock either of them, you need to do the unlock achievements--which require *50* Ballution on an enemy (a *ludicrous* number that frankly *requires* multiple of the orb that doubles Ballution, on an enemy with *high* HP, so basically specific Part 2 and 3 bosses), or *100* Ballwark, which doesn't have the benefit of a doubler, and goes away when you take damage, making it even *more* restrictive to pull off. You have to have a hyperfocused build, get the right boss, and *make* it to said boss with a build that is actively discouraged by the game. To *maybe* manage to unlock the new content. ALL WITHOUT ANY REAL ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR BUILD. There's no rerolls, *extremely* sparse deck thinning, and in *all* of this you're at the mercy of the refresh orb RNG not hiding itself in a place that takes multiple turns of negligible damage to reach.\n\nI want to like this, but difficulties are cranked so high for no good reason, even without going into Cruciball.

I've heard Peglin be compared to Slay the Spire - pools of relics, bosses, classes, etc wrapped in random run goodness - but despite costing about the same somehow that's about as generous a comparison I can make.\n\nIt's fine. It's a Peggle knock-off. Fair enough. I'd say, maybe about a 3 out of 5 mobile game. Which is fine! For a 3 out of 5 mobile game.\n\nThe much praised \"deck\"/ball building system is still as shallow and prone to crippling random chance as it was far earlier in development. The replay is near non-existent, with the pool of \"random\" encounters being so shallow they might as well be openly labeled. You face the exact same very few bosses in the exact same very few worlds. You pick from a surprisingly small pool of relics, few of which being worth remembering. Ultimately you work to grind out special achievements that secretly unlock alternate classes in a desperate bid to find something different even if only briefly...only to discover the much promised classes are borderline identical.\n\nPlay the demo. Do not assume further playthroughs will be particularly different if at all. If you're dying for a 3/5 mobile Peggle knock-off still at that point, well, congrats.

I do believe we have received quite a bit in the way of even more peg upgrades, status effects, and RNG in some of the levels. I'm changing my review to a slight positive for the time being, but I'd really like to make this a strong positive. What we need now is more variation in enemy types, new enemies, a bigger lineup of potential end-level bosses (think maybe 5 would be good enough for each level,) and some variation in each enemy's HP.  Also, more achievements would be nice, if we can come up with some clever ones that aren't the run-of-the-mill \"checkmark\" type achievements.\n\nP.S.--I've read some notes in previous reviews that you guys weren't going to add any new areas. Are you sure that's the right move? I would think four areas, perhaps even five, would seem more well-rounded and about the right amount of time to get through the game. Three areas may be a couple too few for the price point, and again, replayability is a HUGE factor in a roguelike's potential and popularity. Thanks for listening.\n\nThanks for all your hard work devs, we're going in the right direction.\n(Original Review Below)\n\nThis is my first negative review. That being said, this is not a hard negative, but more like a slight thumbs-down.\n\nPeglin has many positives to point towards---wonderful artwork, a catchy soundtrack, and an overall spirit of lighthearted fun.\n\nHowever, there are several things related to the gameplay itself that leave more to be desired at this point in time. While the game is still in early access, I do leave Peglin open to changing the rating to a recommended status after more polish and content have gone into the game.\n\nCurrently, I really enjoy the Peggle-esque nature of the games rules and content. Peglin also adds roguelike elements into gameplay during every run, so you can start off with performance-boosting perks like adding bonus damage to pegs you hit, adding Overflow damage to your arsenal, (overflow means damage doesn't just affect one enemy at a time, but additional ones in the lineup) among many other relics that make each of your runs through the forest and castle unique.\n\nThe feeling I'm left with after ending a run in Peglin is one of not wanting to go back and try again, and I'm not quite sure why that is. The game does not have an addicting gameplay loop for me, and it could come down to several factors: one, there is not enough enemy variation and board layout variation in the levels to create a sense of RNG. I would think having maybe three different potential board layouts for each enemy encounter should be something to add. As it stands right now, when you get a specific loadout of enemies, they are exactly the same each time. Enemies also always have the same amount of HP, so you know what you're getting into. I feel this is too predictable, and feel like there should be a percentage range variation on each enemy you come across. For example, if a typical slime has an HP of 50, perhaps there should be a reasonable variation in those enemies HP, anywhere from 25 HP to 75 HP. Sometimes adding this variation can make the game slightly easier or slightly more difficult. It also adds to the RNG feeling of the game, and slight unpredictability which would give me a feeling of \"oh well maybe I'll get lucky this run.\"  The way the game plays right now, you just don't feel that.\n\nThere's a few unrealistic animations in the game, but one that bothers me the most is the bomb mechanic. You can literally hit two bombs on a board in the same turn, but the bombs always land in the same place on the battlefield and they always do the same amount of damage. At least make the bombs centered around the enemies in the lineup so it looks a bit more realistic. This is a very minor nitpick from a gameplay perspective, but it is a glaring issue.\n\nThe Slime boss in the game is unnecessarily overpowered and is almost completely a surefire way to end a run. These types of issues crop up and can cause balancing issues for the player. A well-polished RNG roguelike game should have a feeling of incremental progression, where the difficulty ramps up gradually, with a few unknowns to keep you on your toes. But instead of being excited or a bit apprehensive about a boss battle, your immediate thought is, \"well, here's the Slime boss. Guess this run is over.\"  This is something that should never happen in a roguelike.\n\nI would also appreciate more enemy variation. We have a lot of orbs (attack weapons) in the game right now and I feel like we're doing a good job there. However, new status effects, new enemies, new attack patterns, and overall just a bit more randomization in the way the enemies behave would make this feel a lot more polished.\n\nAs it stands right now, I cannot recommend the game for anyone who is looking to get a bunch of playtime out of it, as quite frankly, it's just not addictive enough--and an addicting gameplay loop is a hallmark of this genre.\n\nKeep up the hard work, devs. I'll be watching the game as it progresses, and if satisfied with such progression, I shall change my recommendation.\n\n-GameJudgeJames-", "timestamp_created": 1682877046, "timestamp_updated": 1687053337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550561785697937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137566789": {"recommendationid": "137566789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052055182", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1682362352}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Peggle with roguelike elements, so greatly replayable.

It seems like now theres rarely enough money to really buy anything worthwhile, and shop spaces are a waste of time altogether. The game might be more accessible or even fun if the first world had better boards - the three flowers elite, the minotaur, and the goo boss have horrible boards that will often leave a player trying to waste multiple shots on one or two pegs trying to just refresh the board, while bosses like the minotaur do excessive 20+ damage in one hit.\n\nIf you can get past the first world, then it feels a bit more fair, though final bosses do have just far too much HP - unless you're going for specific orb builds you simply can't do the damage you need to in order to not be instakiiled by the BIG WALL or BALLISTA enemies.\n\nIt's a fun game in concept - there is a lot of potential for something truly fun and enjoyable, but it seems like the developers want to build a punishing experience - something that I don't think fits very well with the cutesy styling and casual game mechanics.\n(edit) They updated some since I first reviewed, adding some classes, items and orbs, but really none of this helped or mitigated the main problems I had with the gold-based everything, the truly awful boards for some bosses/minibosses, and its even less likely you will be able to pull a build together for end bosses (they added a new one, that makes some of the previous better items you could get into 100% game over scenarios if you happen to get that boss in the final zone)\n\n\nIt's worth checking out on sale, at least.", "timestamp_created": 1682831421, "timestamp_updated": 1689120220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599434733390808105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137526770": {"recommendationid": "137526770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026432377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1690760125}, "language": "english", "review": "FUNNY BOI", "timestamp_created": 1682825352, "timestamp_updated": 1682825352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137520872": {"recommendationid": "137520872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363587284", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3217, "last_played": 1699330765}, "language": "english", "review": "poglin", "timestamp_created": 1682816727, "timestamp_updated": 1682816727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611025512218475342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137515515": {"recommendationid": "137515515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046466279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1680749653}, "language": "english", "review": "There's the skeleton of a good game in here... and it's visible because there's hardly any meat.

It's essentially a run-based rogue-like infused with turn-based combat, with different stat and ability altering accessories that vary game to game. Your balls' abilities also vary in some really fun ways, from magnetically charged balls that will seek out special pegs on the board to behemoth boulders that smash their way through enemy ranks.\n\nBut the game falters hard in execution, particularly balancing. Experimentation in a game like this should be the fun and focus, as there are a lot of balls you'll want to try adding to your \"deck,\" for lack of a better word. But at the moment, there's really only one viable way to play and still beat the overpowered bosses beyond the first map. Oddly enough, that way of playing not only discourages you from adding more balls to your setup - it actually hurts your chances of survival.\n\nWant to go for a defensive run? Tough. The enemies will do so much damage that even if you max your defensive abilities, you don't stand much of a chance. Want to try for a technical build? Sorry, you're not doing enough damage to wipe the monstrously huge HP of the bosses in time to avoid their equally monstrous attacks.\n\nThere are also some glaring technical problems with using a controller, at least in my case. When it comes to artifact or ball selection, sometimes moving the left stick does nothing and the cursor won't move. Other times, pressing A seemed to do nothing. On very, very rare occasions, it's even canceled out of the thing I wanted to do, as though the cursor were aimed at \"exit\" as opposed to \"select.\"\n\nThe UI is also something of a mess. Why I have to click and drag a ball into a garbage can instead of simply pressing a button to get rid of it is beyond me, especially since clicking and dragging will at times launch the ball into play. I'm also not seeing any easy way to look at my artifacts apart from their nondescript logos on the side of the screen. Little things like this add up quick.\n\nThat leaves Peglin very much a mixed bag. But with patches, maybe there will come a better sense of balancing and basic quality of life issues.

Decided I didn't pay that much (on sale) and even though it was short, I'd still support them.  I did play a few more games, but also left the menu open for a few hours, so I probably have more like 4 hours of play.  \n\nThe good:  It's a fun and unique twist on a classic game (Pachinko / Peggle / Pin Board, the thing from before pinball).  Kind of reminds me of puzzle quest in that way.  \n\nThe bad:  \nThere's 3 zones which don't really cut it in a game like this.  Like Hades has a similar amount of zones, but the variety and content for each is far greater.\nKind of tries to have \"rogue-lite\" content but doesn't really succeed at it.  Plus, they give you a total cheat-mode option after you win once which really cheapens the experience. \nSuper swingy on luck, which you can even save skim if you want.  But the result is you either get great things or bad things, and not a lot of agency in that.   It doesn't feel like there's much skill in building up a winning combo, as individual items are insanely good or insanely bad (and not much between).  I see evidence of combos that could exist, like stacking crit, but I doubt it's better than just picking strong individual items.  \nPlaying some more, I did see some new content, but overall, it didn't feel meaningful to play again.  Contrast to roguelites like Hades, FTL, or Gunfire Reborn, which tricks you into replaying the same levels hundreds of times without feeling stale.  \n\nSuggestions to address my issues I mentioned:\nGet rid of custom/cheat-mode and introduce actual rogue-lite mechanics. \nChange Cruciball from being debuffs on you to buffs on enemies. New Game+  is always going to feel better than \"Beat the same game but with penalties.\"  Beating a boss with 10mil health is going to feel better than beating the boss with the same health but you have -1 to damage.  \nBalance the orbs better, but introduce rarities where you could have a better version of the same thing to encourage you to do different strategies each game instead of making the same choices (ala Hades). \nMaybe have some kind of orb synergy or merging mechanic.  Like, perhaps an Orbelisk lvl 3 and a Orblation lvl 3 give you an ability that makes all stones and boulders be burning.  \n\nLengthen runs (either more zones or more content for current zones) to allow some of the \"build-planning\" seen in games like Slay the Spire or any of the other roguelites I already mentioned.  Again, I see \"builds\" that in theory exist, but with no real time or incentive to actually pursue something like relics and a bag full of Orbelisk boosting orbs, or crit boosting orbs.

It combines elements of chance through Plinko with deck-building and dungeon-crawling akin to Slay the Spire, which is as refreshing as it is unique. The enemies are challenging, and the unlockable levels of the Cruciball mode add further challenges after each successful run. In addition, the option to speed up the entire game is a nice touch that helps with the grind.\nNegatives are few and far-between, outside of the normal frustration of difficult battles. I may argue that more goblin classes, relics, or more orb types could add further variety to the game, but there is absolutely plenty of variety in the current state.

however i feel there lacks a certain continuity between them with thing like the minotaur being quite realistic and your character being a really cartoony gobling . and that's really the only thing good i can tell about the game because the rest is just really lacking . first of all the most important part about a game . it's gameplay . it is for me the main reason why i dislike this game . the gameplay is repetitive . all you do is throw a ball wich after like 3 bounce max you got no clue where it's gonna go ; there is very few skill involved . it really just feels like a point and click most of the time . but that's wouldnt be such an issue if my next point didn't exist : the game truly lacks replayability . every single ball in the game works in the same way : throw it rack , rack up damage and heal/deal dmg . sometime with an extra  thing on the side . there isn't anything that changes the gameplay fundamentally . like there isn't an object that makes the balls act differently from any other ball . at the end you trow the ball at the peg and wait for it to end . and while some object try to fix that . with thing like the pie thingy . all it does is add another layer of randomness . because when you don't have a lot of skill based gameplay rng is all you have to rely on . and i don't say that because i find rng based game bad ; they can be really good . it's just that there needs  to be something more then pure random luck . and this is only intensified with the cruciball . the only replayability this game gets . and the only reason  why it makes it replayable is because it's hard as all hell  . and that's quite shit. because  now instead of having a decent amount of different build you can pray to get and slightly influence yourself to get . you just need to rely on a few easy to get one that works consistantly . also the lack of level is a really big inderence to the game's replayability . i think instead of focusing on adding more balls and doing more collab the game should have more level and other thing that make it replayable . for example what about a daily challenge where you get a specific build and need to win with it . or even better item that fundementally change the gameplay ; like one that transforms your orbs into a beam meaning you destroy a straight line instead of bouncing . that'd fundementaly change the gameplay in a new way . or what about adding an item that makes you able to redirect your orb after each bounce with an addition of a force . it'd make it so good player can get really higt damage and make more unique runs . and i feel like i strayed a bit too far from my point so let me get back to it ; while those problem are really something that make me not like this game . there is still something to take from it . it is a unique concept ; and i'd just wish it was executed better .", "timestamp_created": 1679404262, "timestamp_updated": 1679404262, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS AFFECTING THE GAMEPLAY.\n\n90% of the time, my ball isn't even stuck, it's just going too slow for the game's liking and then the pegs disappear. This is a problem because it affects a whole slew of things like combos, drop locations, and overall damage. \n\nThis mechanic WILL have a negative impact on EVERY. SINGLE.

If all you're looking for is \"cute peggle roguelike\" then you'll be satisfied. \n\nPeglin follows the Slay the Spire formula, but isn't finely tuned enough to make it shine. Instead, the StS formula holds Peglin back from achieving its potential. The overall systems encourage deck building and shifting your strategy as you go, but Peglin's combat seems to actively punish going all-in on a single strategy. This is because the game has so much inherent randomness that no matter what \"build\" you aim toward, the best strategy will always include the same few items. \n\nThat randomness is also applied to the map navigation, which can be incredibly frustrating at times. \n\nYou could argue that it's not \"randomness\" because yes, there are ways to mitigate it. That is, get Unicorn Horn to expand your \"aim line\" and clear each battle stage more completely to maximize your chances of going where you want to go. There are times though, like right after a \"?\" stage or a chest stage, where you really are just up to The Lord's Mercy.\n\nThere's also a NG+ system similar to StS Ascension: The \"Cruciball\". However, the first few levels have done nothing to noticeably change the game. \n\nAgain, I really don't know why they chose to mimic StS systems so much. StS works because you are given incredible amounts of information, and lots of agency to act on that information. Peglin gives you that information, and acts like you're supposed to use it to your advantage, but your ability to do that is restricted by RNG, and the difficulty isn't high enough to warrant the risk of specializing into a specific strategy. \n\nI had fun for a few hours, but given whats out there I don't think it was worth my money.", "timestamp_created": 1679139679, "timestamp_updated": 1679139679, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647194981575012207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134859782": {"recommendationid": "134859782", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177655156", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1696200497}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeet", "timestamp_created": 1679113164, "timestamp_updated": 1679113164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134850243": {"recommendationid": "134850243", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014995540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4422, "last_played": 1696750942}, "language": "english", "review": "this is worth the money and i can describe the stratighees", "timestamp_created": 1679100120, "timestamp_updated": 1679100120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134812167": {"recommendationid": "134812167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993252138", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1662, "last_played": 1695305676}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is perfectly balanced and best played with a cup of Yorkshire tea", "timestamp_created": 1679058633, "timestamp_updated": 1679058633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646198809146881104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134797391": {"recommendationid": "134797391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010800409", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1208, "last_played": 1689436482}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid little game with quite a bit of promise but currently lacking a bit of variety due to only having 3 worlds and 6 primary bosses.\n\nI have really started enjoying cruciball, game mode that stacks multiple set negative modifiers to make the game harder.

There is a bit of replayability with there being multiple possible bosses per floor, and there is a challenge feature where you are able to play the game with harder settings. However, there just doesnt feel like enough of it so far. if you've played for 3-5 hours, you've seen everything. There are more games out there with hundreds of hours priced at $15. I feel like it would be more fair to price this at $5.\n\nSo far this review sounds like more of a down vote. But don't get me wrong, this game is EXTREMELY fun and addicting. There are a ton of combinations of weapons you can use, there is text based events which i personally like a lot, the music is calming and descent, and the game is aesthetically pleasing. A very good option if you want to play a rogue-lite but want it a bit more relaxing. There is a ton of potential to this game and the devs are still adding content every month. This game deserves a bit more popularity than it has now honestly. There are more classes being added to the future and more relics thankfully.

For all you classic peggle fans, this scratches that itch and i only see it getting better as development continues.\n\nFOR THE DEVS: The only things id love to see out of this game is community content for custom balls, enemies, and UI changes as well as more peg layout variation. some item and ball descriptions might also benefit from some rewording or a more indepth look at stats. Im sure you might have some of this stuff in your mind already but those are just my suggestions. keep up the amazing work!", "timestamp_created": 1677451076, "timestamp_updated": 1677451076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133682991": {"recommendationid": "133682991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290332653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2011, "last_played": 1694717259}, "language": "english", "review": "I came for peggle, and was surprised that I bought this game instead.", "timestamp_created": 1677433646, "timestamp_updated": 1677433646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133662859": {"recommendationid": "133662859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060156609", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1982, "last_played": 1695254166}, "language": "english", "review": "and I thought Slay the Spire could do with more content!\nGood game, but the fun doesn't last long enough. w8 for sale!", "timestamp_created": 1677415923, "timestamp_updated": 1677415923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133641300": {"recommendationid": "133641300", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993279869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1069, "last_played": 1698552906}, "language": "english", "review": "great game to play while listening to a podcast", "timestamp_created": 1677391047, "timestamp_updated": 1677391047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133573502": {"recommendationid": "133573502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016948488", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 13642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 911, "playtime_at_review": 4713, "last_played": 1700762429}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game I find myself coming back to times and times again.", "timestamp_created": 1677326508, "timestamp_updated": 1677326508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133567419": {"recommendationid": "133567419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013690537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 3204, "last_played": 1699607542}, "language": "english", "review": "Later difficulties are way way way too RNG dependant unless you know specific shots for specific stages, takes all the fun out if it.

Especially for the final bosses on the higher Cruciball levels. You can have a near perfect run through each level, but then be taken down by the final bosses as if you had no upgraded orbs or relics. \n\nThere are alot of different orb types and offensive, defensive, and special relics. This could be just my luck, but unlocking some of the special relics through specific events seem to never happen. I can get through part one or two of these special events, but never reach the final part. And on the next three runs, I run into the final event over and over but not get the first part.\n\nI don't think the game is too expensive.

There's a lot I would personally change:\n\n- Shops are too expensive compared to ball upgrades and purchases, when you can upgrade balls anywhere and get relics for free from chests, especially since you won't be fully upgraded until the final zones. A lot of the time they feel like a dead space, which is a massive penalty.\n\n- Too many relics are far too weak to be worth taking, as you need good relics to win a run.\n\n- There are a few relics that are too strong (Electropegnant and Molten Mantle spring to mind as the two clearly gamebreaking ones)\n\n- The game ends at what feels like it would normally be the 1/3rd mark.\n\nDespite these flaws, I've been having a ton of fun.

If you shoot badly you can kiss your run goodbye;\n5 - 80% of orbs are terrible and don't work very well;\n6 - Combat mechanics are awful in a sense that if you don't pick up a pierce orb or splash orb you won't scale fast enought at later stages;\n7 - You don't get incentives for getting into normal fights because you gain nothing but gold and paid orb upgrades or healing. Always run from combat to shop, chest or question mark.\n\nThis game is very fun in the beggining but it has a lot of glaring issues. 90% of relics are garbage or uninspiring, 80% of orbs are garbage, a lot of tilesets are terrible.

It's something else entirely. There are a lot of unique games and concepts, and especially in the roguelite genre, variety is plenty already. Yet Peglin manages to take things to a whole other level. Obviously, pinball is nothing new. It's a classic arcade game, and even though I have never been very interested in pinball as a concept, Peglin still intrigued me...\n\nAnd it doesn't disappoint. At least, not in the important aspects. Let's start with the very basics - the gameplay. Peglin takes Pinball to its extreme. It combines concepts like crits, busted balls, and different relics that help diversify your gameplay and take it to another level. As long as a run goes well, there is a chance you will be incredibly busted by the time you beat the final area. Amazingly, it feels as though you are 'cheating' the game in a way, as though you're not meant to be dealing thousands of damage by just hitting a 'Matryorbshka' enhanced by the relics you picked up along the way. It feels like 'cheating', but I feel like its designed to be that way. Power trips like these are truly beautiful.\n\nSpeaking of 'Matryorbshka', word play is literally scattered all over this game. Even after hours of playing this game, some of the names still put a smile on my face. Down from the different orbs you can collect, to the relics, all the names are pretty clever. It is clear the developers put a lot of thought into that aspect, and though it may not seem like much, I really appreciate it.\n\nWith the addition of gold, and other updates to the game, Peglin keeps getting better and better. It feels fun and fair, and though some relics are far better than others (excluding the boss relics that are meant to be even more powerful than regular relics), they all have a place in the game. Some builds can be a lot harder to properly set up - like bomb builds or morbid builds, but they're that much more rewarding once you get the ball rolling.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a real challenge, the game has got you hooked up with that, too. The Cruciball difficulty settings that you unlock as you beat the game on the previous difficulty get progressively harder and make for a truly difficult gaming experience. Personally, I find the game is best enjoyed on Cruciball 4-5, that way its not too challenging but also not a ball in the park.\n\n I need to stop mentioning balls.\n\nIn all seriousness, Peglin is a terribly fun game that I can see myself playing more of, especially as the developers put so much effort into expanding the game and improving it. I do know that there was a time when players were generally unsatisfied with the changes being made, however I didn't own the game at the time and couldn't see it for myself. From what I see now, none of the changes or additions seem to be anti-fun. As long as this continues, I don't see a reason not to recommend the game! Hell, despite the game still being in early access, I am already incredibly satisfied with the way the game as it is right now.", "timestamp_created": 1674410560, "timestamp_updated": 1674410560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131351566": {"recommendationid": "131351566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056105154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1696288480}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool concept, great replayability, can't wait to see how it develops.

I'm a longtime fan of roguelikes, Peggle, and similar games combining the concepts such as Roundguard. There really is something addictive and enjoyable about the gameplay even as it is now. I DO believe that Peglin could be improved and refined enough for me to recommend the game at some point but as it stands currently there are a few too many issues I have with it. \n\nFor starters, many of the item descriptions are just too vague to understand. On multiple occasions I've picked an item to try and figure out what it does because I couldn't discern that information through the description alone, only to find myself equally confused after using it. Simply put, things need to get explained better. \n\nSecondly, it's too easy to screw with the game if you don't like the outcome of a battle, your rewards, or the options given to you in a chest. If you quit out of a game like Slay the Spire you will resume exactly where you left off, with the same items offered to you. I definitely think Peglin would benefit from that kind of design since it's just too easy to redo any situation you don't like.\n\nFinally, I realize the game is in early access right now, but there's just not a lot of content available yet. I hope that the developer(s) can iron out these issues soon and I'll be returning to the game sporadically to see if things have improved enough to where I feel comfortable recommending the game and changing this review.", "timestamp_created": 1674149912, "timestamp_updated": 1674150400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131144851": {"recommendationid": "131144851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121135807", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1696877548}, "language": "english", "review": "SLAY THE SPIRE but with pegging", "timestamp_created": 1674134492, "timestamp_updated": 1674134492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131144683": {"recommendationid": "131144683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198917162057", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1697487492}, "language": "english", "review": "matryorbshka is the best orb, it cured my dads cancer and made me taller (previouly 2'1 now 9'6) and it also gave me a debug panel that made me kill everything instantly and popping corn made me immortal to anything that doesent one shot me thank you matryorbshka you are my lord and savior", "timestamp_created": 1674134248, "timestamp_updated": 1674134248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131129769": {"recommendationid": "131129769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183733047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1697029936}, "language": "english", "review": "goated", "timestamp_created": 1674109876, "timestamp_updated": 1674109876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131126121": {"recommendationid": "131126121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983495899", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 1379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1697605219}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little roguelike.\n\nIt really fulfills the promise of being like... a coffee break game.

Figured I'd leave some feedback and suggestions, I'm not too sure what's already confirmed to come and what's not, buuut hey. And yes, I realize this game is still in Early Access.\n\nOverall flow of the game is great - so are all the pegs and powerups so far! Clearly many different ways to play it, but not gonna lie I veeery, very often gravitate towards some sort of \"upgrade the board\" and/or \"refresh to heal\" sort of build. I always make sure to have atleast some sort of way to heal, whiiich is probably fine and obvious to have, but it did leave me hoping I could just use more money to heal more. Too often I just find the orbs and relics I know that will work, upgrade em, and then just... fiddle around with the rest of the money. Especially if and when the game decides to not give me a single shop (a single guarantee, please? might already be the case though).\n\nMy first run was a cakewalk. Aaarguably I had some information from the mentioned Youtubers/streamers sure, but there were still many new things I hadn't seen before, such as the whole Morbid thing. I had some sort of Electropegnet + Defresh potion setup going combined with pegs or relics that upgrade pegs whenever a hit is made, There were definitely a few moments where Morbid and the peg upgrade working together felt real cheesy, but hey, that's kind of the name of the game with all these Roguelikes, finding fun \"broken\" interactions. Still, it left me thinking there are deeefinitely some things like that I feel like could be balanced a bit better. Maybe adding a floor or two more between the current ones could do the trick, to make the difficulty curve a tad less steep.\n\nI'm also definitely hoping not every peg type or relic will be available from the start in the final game. I'm assuming this will be the case, but it does feel weird it isn't the case in the Early Access version. Still, I'm looking forward to unlocking new things and playing around with them, maybe be forced to use the weaker orbs instead of just passing on them each time.\n\nOther than that a few small things I'd also like improved. The fadeout between screens sometimes gets stuck when the game starts to load the next screen but the screen isn't 100% black (only like 80-90%), and it would be great to see how many bombs I've hit in a turn instead of trying to guess from the goblin fella throwing tons of them. The minotaur miniboss whatever also has a little glitch, if it gets both a chargeup and attack turn during your reload the damage will happen before it actually does the attack animation, actually happening when it starts charging up. Other than those things I'm hoping there will be relics to influence the enemy attack and movement patterns, stuff like slowing their movement down or making them attack more rarely, stuff like that.\n\nMore everything from playable characters/classes to floors to boards to enemies to pegs to relics and this game will be amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1673958542, "timestamp_updated": 1673958542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50740736722946167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131005316": {"recommendationid": "131005316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138456663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 727, "last_played": 1674187907}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so cute and fun i cant even", "timestamp_created": 1673921069, "timestamp_updated": 1673921069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492592573165893555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131001797": {"recommendationid": "131001797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044006135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 509, "last_played": 1674350474}, "language": "english", "review": "Works on Linux Ubuntu pop!_os 22.04 using proton.", "timestamp_created": 1673915508, "timestamp_updated": 1673915508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492592573165893555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130993722": {"recommendationid": "130993722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272581740", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1689627184}, "language": "english", "review": "whee", "timestamp_created": 1673903668, "timestamp_updated": 1673903668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492592573165893555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130974403": {"recommendationid": "130974403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152867906", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1647, "last_played": 1698967481}, "language": "english", "review": "i LOVE this game. even in its earliest stages it's a ton of fun to play, and doesn't get stale easily.

One main issue you will probably run into is getting rid of orbs you no longer want. It is possible but not consistent so be careful about what you choose.\n\nAs it stands, there is only 1 character to play as and 3 stages.

You are awarded with gold each coin peg you shoot and various balls you can unlock/buy through progress. Any relics unlocked in the campaign are unlocked for the custom run mode as well allowing you to master your skills outside of the campaign. Each ball type has different stats and abilities allowing you to focus your Peglin build however you choose to defeat the enemies.
