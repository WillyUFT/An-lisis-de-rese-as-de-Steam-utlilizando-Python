Well, it is not just not it, unfortunately it\u2019s not a good game at all in my opinion.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been captivated by visual style and brilliant soundtrack - well, that\u2019s because these are the best parts of the game. Narration and voice acting in general is top notch as well. Everything else is unfortunately underwhelming.\n\nCombat system is a mix of real time battle with tactical pause option. Protagonist moves very slowly to the point where you can\u2019t evade a shot fired from across the map, all strikes have long startup and even worse recovery, this makes it feel sluggish. Acting during tactical pause imposes a cooldown where you can\u2019t do anything, which hurts especially since the basic movement is so poor. This makes both modes just not fun\u2026 I ended up not using tactical mode at all until later in the game I was able to assemble a combination of functions to one-shot anything during the pause - this actually added to my frustrations since it eliminated any difficulty. The idea of functions changing properties depending on their use seems brilliant at first, but I felt some combinations were much better than others and theoretical variety of approaches just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nStory is slow as well. Mystery is sustained by characters purposefully not telling you what they know. You\u2019re driven forward by curiosity, you gradually uncover new elements. The disappointing part is that elements you uncover turn out to be mostly irrelevant and promise of answers - unfulfilled. Often you just get another line of cryptic dialog and a next checkpoint. I also struggled to develop a connection with Red as she does not speak. This is a purposeful choice of authors and I respect it, but her motivations or role in the grand scheme of things are not clear, you just don\u2019t know her. She is portrayed as a victim you\u2019re supposed to sympathise to, but that\u2019s about it, for me that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe city aesthetically looks great, it is a significant part of the story and the world, the problem is it fails to develop properly. You visit different parts of the city (some of them - multiple times) and yet they all look the same. You move from one tiny arena where you fight generic faceless enemies to another, the story explains that you\u2019re somewhere else but you don\u2019t feel it. \n\nThe game also suffers from disjointed elements - you get a hideout where you have to do missions, like time attacks. Why? There is no incentive to play these (especially considering the fact that the core gameplay loop is just not fun) or explanation why these are important. Limiters too - all seem like attempts to extend gameplay artificially.\n\nI\u2019m a completionist and yet I dropped the game half way. I only picked it up recently (it runs great on Steam Deck which I took on a flight), but as soon as the plot actually started developing and something interesting began happening - the game ended\u2026 so you can add underwhelming ending to the list of other underwhelming things this game offers.\n\nVery sad.", "timestamp_created": 1697494765, "timestamp_updated": 1697494765, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148356719": {"recommendationid": "148356719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078431170", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1697491511}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice Story :)", "timestamp_created": 1697491578, "timestamp_updated": 1697491578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148322612": {"recommendationid": "148322612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217583332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1693650656}, "language": "english", "review": "Weird fucking game.

I also had problems running the game at resolutions above 1080p (Still is a problem, though technically its on purpose as everything is hand-drawn and then mastered @ 1080p). This was before refunds were really a thing on Steam, and I kinda digged the soundtrack, so I let Transistor sit there in my library. \n\nCome 2023, close to a decade later, I decided on a whim to boot the game up on my Steam Deck. And the game finally clicked for me. Absolutely no problems running the game on Deck (as the screen is only 800p) and the Linux port is superb, bar a few things that I touch upon in my report on [url=https://www.protondb.com/app/237930] ProtonDB. [/url]\n\nGameplay-wise the game is still a little clunky (I kinda already hate turn based games for the most part), but you need to push through and attempt to understand the clunkiness to actually get anything out of this game. Finding out new combinations of abilities as you progress through the game is fun and rewarding if you take the time to get out of your comfort zone, with the added reward of extra lore for mixing up your abilities. I think I would've liked this game more the first time I tried it years ago if the tutorial was more upfront about how you probably should play the game. It is best practice to never fully deplete the Turn() bar (unless you are about to end the fight), otherwise you will be stuck in the horrible debuff status of \"Recharging\", where you become a headless chicken attempting to remove a bunch of ants crawling up your legs. Not sure why the devs just didn't either A. have some sort of punishment other than complete revokation of player agency when fully depleting the Turn() bar or B. make the narrator say something like, \"You're really living on the edge here, maybe hold off on exhausting me\" or something of that nature to lead the player away from doing that consistently. I don't think it was obvious that Turn() bar recharge time was proportional to how much you used it, when I first played the game this really caught me out and was quite frustrating.\n\nJust about everything else other than that is well thought out, from the lore within the character interactions and mini biographys to the general cohesion of the game thematically. Knowing more about programming now than I did then I can see a lot of little tongue and cheek jokes scattered throughout the game, and its all very endearing. Hopefully when I get to playing Hades at least some of the DNA from Transistor is in there.\n\nEDIT: Typo and extra clarification", "timestamp_created": 1695374248, "timestamp_updated": 1695374355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146619479": {"recommendationid": "146619479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042207293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1695168919}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Beautiful game.

It's a masterpiece of storytelling and aesthetics that leaves an indelible mark on your soul.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the artistry that permeates every inch of this virtual cityscape. The juxtaposition of a neon-lit dystopia against the ethereal glow of the \"Transistor\" itself creates an atmosphere that's both chilling and captivating. It's a world that seems to exist in the twilight of a dream, where the line between reality and illusion blurs.\n\nAnd then there's the music, a hauntingly evocative soundtrack that's the heart and soul of the game. The humming, mournful notes of Red's voice as she wields the Transistor as a weapon is both mesmerizing and melancholic. It's as if the game itself is pouring its emotions into your ears, a somber serenade that echoes through the digital void.\n\nThe narrative is a poignant dance between the characters, their past, and the haunting uncertainty of the future. Red, a singer who's lost her voice, and the Transistor, a sentient weapon housing the consciousness of a fallen friend, form a duo that tugs at your heartstrings with every word they exchange. Their journey through the fractured city is a tale of sacrifice, redemption, and the profound connection between humans and machines.\n\nThe combat mechanics are a symphony of strategy and finesse. As Red wields the Transistor in real-time or activates its tactical functions in a pause-and-plan mode, you feel a sense of empowerment amidst the digital chaos. It's a dance of power and vulnerability, much like the characters themselves.\n\nBut perhaps what lingers the most is the bittersweet beauty of the game's themes. \"Transistor\" explores the price of progress, the consequences of our choices, and the inevitability of loss. It's a reminder that even in a world of artificiality, the most human emotions persist.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Transistor\" is a work of digital art that resonates deeply with those who venture into its enigmatic world. It's a solemn, bittersweet beauty, a digital requiem that leaves you haunted by its elegance and entranced by its narrative. It's a reminder that even in the realm of ones and zeros, the human experience finds a way to shine through, and it's nothing short of mesmerizing.\n\n[b] > Be me\n> On a quest for a new game\n> Stumble upon Transistor on Steam \ud83c\udfae\n> A cyberpunk world, a talking sword, and a protagonist who can hum her way through battles \ud83c\udfa4\n\n\ud83c\udf06 Transistor: A Beautiful Data-Drenched Dystopia \ud83c\udf06\n\n> Boot up the game, and I'm instantly blown away by the art style \ud83c\udfa8\n> It's like I'm inside a futuristic painting, and it's breathtaking \ud83c\udf20\n> Red, the protagonist, is a singer who's been silenced but can still hum her heart out.

This game is made by the same developers who made HADES who are called Supergiant Games. The game is a enigma game. You start as a amnesica female named Red. You have no idea how you got there, what has occured, and where to go. While looking around, you find a talking sword. Perhaps it will help you solve the mystery of what happened to you. Not only did you lose your memory, but it also seems like the city itself is having a identity crisis. Can you help solve these mysteries before you or the city is destroyed? Anyways, here are my PROS and CONS list:\n\nPROS:\n\n- A beautiful world with interesting characters.\n- The enigma of the story is part of the game's charm.\n- Talking sword.\n- Rogue game.\n- Ability to make the game harder with limiters.\n- Ability to combine powers to create different weapon power combinations.\n- Works on Windows 11 OS.\n- Works with controllers. I am using logitech F310 fine with this game.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The story can be confusing. Although it adds to the charm, it also makes the whole game a mysetery..where does it take place? In cyberspace? In a PC? In a world so advanced?\n- Some parts can be difficult to defeat. If you have limiters on, try turning them off to get around the difficult areas.\n\nI definetly recommend this game. I fell in love with it playing it and the story, even if im confused about the story.

I was so entranced that I played through it five times in a week. I got 100% achievements after the second play-through, but I just couldn't get enough. The art direction and music are beautiful, as is the story and dialogue.\n\nThe combat is surprisingly deep and challenging, especially if you use a few \"limiters\" (in game difficulty modifiers). There is a New Game+ mode that lets you keep your level and your unlocks. It also gives you the opportunity to get two of each ability, though you likely won't have \"everything\" until your third play-through.\n\nI have very few gripes with the game, all of which are negligible in the grand scheme of things. There are a few abilities that are super good and some that aren't amazing. Limiters are a bit too punishing at times for the reward they offer. There are some enemies that stay cloaked or shielded and force you to wait for them to become vulnerable.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. I played it in 2023 almost 10 years after its release and I think the experience holds up very well. I have never had a game that compelled me to play it five times in a row before, though I admit I am an outlier in this regard. If you get this game on sale, its less than $5.00 which is an absolute steal, but even at $20.00 its well worth it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683397179, "timestamp_updated": 1683397179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137894217": {"recommendationid": "137894217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057855826", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1683461974}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Supergiant Games.", "timestamp_created": 1683393284, "timestamp_updated": 1683393284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137890143": {"recommendationid": "137890143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099119357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1683388627}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmosphere, music, and art.

Supergiant is known for its distinctive art style, and here it does a phenomenal job of conveying the game\u2019s atmosphere: beautiful and isolating and melancholy \u2013 but without an over-reliance on the color gray. True, as the game progresses, white overtakes the city, but the changing color palette really helps convey the story.\n\n[i]Transistor[/i]\u2019s story is straightforward and linear, and, honestly, I found it rather weak; it relied a little too much on an air of mystery without fully delivering. However, the relationship between the Transistor (voiced by the immensely talented Logan Cunningham) and Red was poignant, so I can forgive the storyline.\n\nI struggled with the gameplay controls and the cadence of combat. Unlike [i]Bastion[/i]\u2019s simple controls or [i]Hades[/i]\u2019s more complex ones, both which can be mapped to one\u2019s preferences and then forgotten about, if you lose a Function in [i]Transistor[/i], the gameplay controls change. I\u2019m sure this was in service to the multiplicity of ways to combine Functions, but I found it frustrating. \n\nThe game provides a Sandbox for experimenting with ways to combine Functions, but even so, as a casual gamer, I found it difficult to figure out which ones synergized well together. Unlike in [i]Bastion[/i], levels are not designed to show off a Function\u2019s best uses, and unlike in [i]Hades[/i], it felt like there were a lot fewer effective synergy options.\n\nUltimately, I consulted a combat guide. If you\u2019re a casual gamer like me, I urge you to look up a combat guide to save yourself a lot of frustration.\n\nThe combat itself: I found the cadence of [i]pause, take your turn, then watch it play out in real time[/i] jarring and difficult to get used to. And, frankly, frustrating, when I couldn\u2019t avoid a hit (and I took many). I wished more than once for [i]Bastion[/i]\u2019s No Sweat Mode or [i]Hades[/i]\u2019s God Mode.\n\nYet I got to the end of the story and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.

Great visuals and OST as well as a beautiful story.\n\n[Spoilers Ahead]\n\nWhen playing through Transistor, for the first half of the game I felt like I didn't *get* it. The story felt bland, the talking sword would not shut up, and the gameplay felt clunky, despite the joy of clearing an entire room with a successful turn(). I liked the art style and music, but with Supergiant and Darren Korb (as well as featuring the ever-talented Ashley Barrett on vocals), that came as little surprise. I wanted to be invested in the world, I really did, but then around halfway through, it clicked. \n\nI was thinking of it like Hades, not, well, Transistor.\n\nTransistor's point isn't the grandeur of the story, its not the minute backstory of side characters mentioned once. It's Red and her...husband? Around the section leading up to the Spine boss fight, every single thing I felt confused about locked into place and made me appreciate the game with new eyes. Hades, while dealing with the underworld and family trauma, was still genuinely optimistic. Transistor is not that. The world is dystopic, dying. The supposed main villains are equally out of control as you are. And yet, Transistor shows that if anything else, it is a game about the fierce love that Red and her husband share.\nHer husband is constantly talking both as a way to fill the silence left by Red's stolen voice, but as a proof that \"You're still there, and I'm still here.\" And Red herself is equally invested, using a terminal to tell her delirious husband that she will \"find what is doing this to you and break its heart.\" \n\nThe world doesn't matter. The Camerata doesn't matter. The bosses don't matter. The story is not about any grand scheme, it's about how when literally nothing else is left, love persists. And I think that's damn beautiful. \n\nSo to all those people like me who love Hades to bits, know that Transistor is not the same type of game, even though it seems like it. Transistor doesn't have the polish, the detail, the sheer mass of Hades. What is does have, is far more abstract, and I would argue far more transient.", "timestamp_created": 1682350467, "timestamp_updated": 1693417955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602329790592193604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137220256": {"recommendationid": "137220256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046051002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 2049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1603, "last_played": 1684635914}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the real gem in Supergiant's library of games.

It's gorgeous and I adore the sound track. \n\nOh boy, where to start. So going in, I assumed it was going to be Bastion 2.0, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it wasn't. Transistor is weird with a capital W. You continuously move from point A to B with some flavor text to inspect. Battles happen in arenas where you use a combination of clunky and slow abilities, and then those abilities sped up in a turn based, planning format. \n\nAt the onset, I loved the exploratory nature of it. It's different than anything I've experienced and there were ideas that had promise here. The game's biggest sin is the inability to build on those ideas in true RPG format. The game scales sideways. You get variety upon variety with slight variation as you level up. Different abilities with different passives you collect. And while that might sound like exactly what you want, it's really not. \n\nThe game play is thin with essentially nothing changing as you progress, only variety of choices mounting. Each ability caps at two passives attached, and those aren't game changing. While it's nice to have four intrinsic passive abilities as you go, they aren't game changing. The construction of combat makes your abilities flavor with your basic strategy and rhythm you establish being 99% of the execution. It fundamentally lacks any sense of progression or deepening. Once you establish how you like to play, then bam, that's it. (And the game shows you global player pick rates. Spoiler: People play in a very similar way because it's easy).\n\nThe game tries to encourage you vary it up with some lore unlocks, but even that is kind of sad. It literally requires you to use abilities once. Even then, it's not a good system by player engagement alone. Half the people who started the game have used five abilities to their fullest. Five. You can equip four at once. Either the core game play feature is so uncompelling that people don't adequately explore it, or people lose engagement so fast that they give up before getting there. \n\nAnd let's go further into that. The unlocks are related to level and story progression. You are on the rails with only a tiny hub that feels like a bonus world that lets you do trials for a tiny sliver of experience. It doesn't feel there is anything to explore or any reward for that. \n\nAnd if you're going to put us on rails, then it needs to be an exciting journey. The story is. . . very barebones. You're given the barest amount of plot to get you going then it's ready set go. Bad guy tried to kill you last night. Go kill him. There isn't enough to be compelling, and in the biggest sin of all: Your sword is boring. That sword on the artwork is a character and your chatty companion that makes up 95% of all dialogue, and he's surprisingly boring. If you get nothing else out of Supergiant games, it's not boring writing. \n\nOverall\n\nSadness. I appreciate the attempts at creativity and adventure in game design, but no level of aesthetic appeal can carry this. The vast number of positive reviews is for the looks and music; I assure you. For that, I too am happy this exists. But like, I'd never recommend it. 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1681706839, "timestamp_updated": 1681706989, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555926859378814697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136678143": {"recommendationid": "136678143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065706517", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1681311044}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game with surprising depth.", "timestamp_created": 1681475787, "timestamp_updated": 1681475787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136673992": {"recommendationid": "136673992", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993609973", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2246, "last_played": 1575983993}, "language": "english", "review": "Top Notch", "timestamp_created": 1681469158, "timestamp_updated": 1681469158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136664606": {"recommendationid": "136664606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086763216", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1681449103}, "language": "english", "review": "Not only is the soundtrack beautiful, but this title brings an innovative take on combat with a wonderful,enchanting art style.

You can use your spells \"in real time\", or set up a planning phase, where your character will queue up actions (each spell and action taking a certain amount of a \"time\" resource during the planning phase).\nI would recommend trying out new spells and combinations, as I believe it's one of the main \"fun\" aspects of the game.\n\nStory-wise, your character doesn't talk, somebody else does the narration.

And returning composer Darren Korb. Comes with an all-new game from the studio called Transistor. Where you follow a young female protagonist by the name of Red. Who has lost her voice and finds herself alone with a greatsword nearby who can communicate with her. And together the duo will need to work alongside one another as they combat the robotic enemies called the Process. Discover what has befallen their city, how to recover her voice, and unravel the mystery of the Process.\n\n[h1]Function, Evade, Attack, Repeat [/h1]\nUnique Gameplay\n\nThere\u2019s something quite remarkable about playing another Supergiant game. Not only are you treated with a gorgeous visual style along with a different plot from Bastion. But the gameplay and soundtrack is also something entirely new. Its refreshing, bold and tackles new territory. For combat it\u2019s more tactical and you can attack in real-time or use a special mode called \u201cTurn()\u201d that allows the player to create a zone where enemies are frozen and you can queue attacks and configure your direction to attack one or multiple enemies. \n\nIt took a bit of handling, but I found the process similar to how the old fallout CRPGs were done. You have an action bar and this represents how many actions you can do. Any movement, evasion, and abilities used will decrease the bar. So plan carefully. \n\nI found the feature very strategic in that there are a multitude of ways to attack your enemies, with backstabs rewarding you with more damage. And equipping different skills. The game gives you new abilities to choose from as you level up and I found this mechanic pretty nifty since you can choose which skills you want for your build and more. \n\nMaking the combat fresh and enjoyable since I could switch different skills, augment them, grant different effects, and even passive skills as well. There is a limit though, so don\u2019t expect to be smart and think you can be overpowered from the start. You gotta work for it. \n\nAside from the combat. There are plenty of interaction points in the game to gently feed you lore and I found these points enjoyable and not sparse. Just enough to hold your interest, but not spammed in every zone to the extent of hitting an upper limit. Each piece of information given from terminals is intriguing enough to enrich the world-building, and I loved that. The narrator, this time speaking from your sword is excellent and I have no complaints about his soothing voice throughout the game. \n\n[h1]The Voices in the Machine [/h1]\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\n\nThroughout my playthrough, I didn\u2019t experience any bugs or crashes. The game played pretty well, with no egregious slowdown. Despite the praise, I\u2019ve given to the game above. I did wish there were more tutorials in the game or at least a dedicated tutorial settings page where you refresh your memory on new and old features. And the beginning of the game could be a bit of a struggle for newcomers since there is no exposition given right at the start. You jump right into the game and have to piece the narrative yourself. This isn\u2019t a problem for me, but for others, I feel it could\u2019ve been tweaked a bit more to provide some context on the world and to make the players become invested in Red\u2019s character in the beginning. Just a minor critique. \n\nBeyond that, I feel the game is a unique take on a different theme the developers wanted to tackle than their previous work. I was impressed at how the beginning, middle, and end finally coalesced and the themes demonstrated here I feel were executed strongly. I rarely see this theme in other video games. And I could only recall one film that displays the theme in a similar vein. But I won\u2019t say anymore due to spoilers. You\u2019ll have to play the game to find out. Just know I found the story and ending to be very well done. I had an enjoyable experience throughout my playthrough. From the tight combat to the fitting electronic post-rock soundtrack lends itself well to the cyberpunk setting. It is a solid new game after Bastion\u2019s original release. And I can\u2019t believe it took me years before I finally got around to it. If you\u2019re hungry for more Supergiant games.

A booming voice then came from the sky and said \"hey, that's pretty cool\" and proceeded to explain the secrets of the universe. I saw reality for what it really is. I transcended time and space and saw the webs of the cosmos weave themselves and break apart with great flashes of cosmic energy all simultaneously.\n\nThen I awoke. My roof was back and I felt famished, parched and chronically depressed. My powers were gone. But just as I thought all was lost my leg brushed against something cold and metallic. I reached under the covers and to my surprise pulled out a shining golden trumpet. One of the exact same trumpets I had been serenaded by in my dreams, but this one was different. Something was engraved across the side. Upon closer inspection I realised it read \"hey, that's pretty cool\" and then I knew...

The story is fun and interesting even though it's a simple \"revenge\" plot, the overall presentation is beautiful, and the characters are cool, I love both Red and Transistor even though one of these characters doesn't even speak.\n\nIt has really fun combat that mixes action combat with real-time strategy in a unique way, I found the strategy part to be really fun, but it falls short when it comes to the the action combat, because the enemies are so fast, you'll have a pretty tough time waiting for your turn meter to fill up, especially considering most abilites are locked while you recover your turn. The most frustrating part of the combat is that when you lose all your health instead of dying and restarting the encounter, you instead lose some of your abilities and have to continue the fight without them, and you don't get them until a couple of encounters later, making it annoying having to play with suboptimal abilities because of one fuck-up\n\nSpeaking of abilities, the upgrade system in this game is really cool, you can have up to 4 active and 4 passive abilities (or functions as the game calls them), and up to 2 upgrades for each active function, the really interesting part is that every function you unlock can be fitted into any slot, making a variety of interesting builds; for example, there is a function called Help(), when it's active it allows you to summon a dog companion which has turns of its own (if you slot Split() into its upgrade slot, you get two dogs!), when it's an upgrade slot it has a chance to prevent enemies from respawning, if it's in the passive slot, it gives you a chance to replace all your active functions with one super powerful function that deals massive damage, every turn. There are about 20 functions that you gradually unlock throughout the game. However, in challenge rooms, you don't have all your unlocked functions, and you have curated functions for each one, this made some of them really frustrating to clear, especially when they give you functions you haven't unlocked yet, and you have no idea how to use them, as there is no inventory menu to check what they do.\n\n\nDespite my grievances with the game, I would say this is overall an 8/10 game!

Yet every session ends with me raging over stupidly designed gameplay. \n\nAside from the silly and irrelevant story that tries to play in the background. Game mechanics and interactions truly suck. \n\nEnemies that have stealth and can dart around incredibly fast. Spawn Aoe bomb familiars, and cannot be attacked in stealth. Which they only leave for about 0.5 seconds to spawn said familiar. \n\nHow about the s'hite Snapshot that fires a fast as hell volley of bolts. And, they're usually 3 or more in their section. \n\nThe imbecilic satellites that provide immunity shields. That have their own shield to boot. \n\nLet's touch on how irritating the upgrades and limiters are. \nWhy is the main attack (Breach) so weak? Why is making the game insanely hard by enabling limiters even a thing? Why are some nodes or whatever their called, so useless? \n\nLegit making the game hell mode just for a 2% exp boost, that doesn't make any notion of sense.  Breach feels like a useless slam or hit that does jack all. Ping, Charm, The Dog, The long blue strike does nothing. Oh and Jaunt, so I'm supposed to have super reaction time to even make use of it outside the planning mode? Feels so cumbersome to switch between abilities. Mousewheel doesn't even go in order.\n\nThe rage I felt to just be F'kd in a single fight, have aoe flying at you, suppressing los firing. Kill one of them, the damn limiter makes it so enemies spawn shielded cells when they die. So you just stand there looking and taking damage as the enemy you just killed respawns in your face. So, earn exp at a snail's pace or gain normal exp and have the game intentionally trying to screw you over. Decisions, Decisions. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think I know why I've only ever seen this game played once on Youtube.

Transistor is one of the best examples of video games as art, with its gorgeous styling and art deco influences, but it's also a phenomenal game experience as well. \n\nThe game's sound and music are exceptional. To this day, 8 years later, the Transistor soundtrack still gets plenty of play in my home. Absolutely buy the soundtrack, bundled with the game. Transistor's mechanics of combining various attack \"functions\" to combine effects is really fun and creative, and while there are definitely more optimal or effective ways to play, it provides a lot of options and customization for the player's preferred combat style. The plot is brought along somewhat slowly and a little circuitously (if there's a criticism of the game, its this), but it does a masterful job of building a world, while simultaneously tearing it down.

I understand why it's so often ignored: Bastion was a phenomenal debut, and these days who wants to talk about anything but Hades, but Transistor happened in between those two and deserves more credit (that's true of Pyre too, but it was less my speed).\n\nDoes the gameplay always work? Frankly, no, often it's a bit clunky, and the balance is hilariously busted, with some builds being borderline impossible, while others trivialise >95% of all combat. Considering how intuitive and engaging both Hades and Bastion are, this is something of a issue for Transistor, but in my personal opinion, it's pretty much the only one.\n\nEven now, eight years after release, it looks absolutely gorgeous, the soundtrack (by the inimitable Darren Korb) is positively genius, and the narrative still stands out as one of my favourite in all of gaming. In particular, Transistor messes around with player agency in ways that to this day I have not found matched anywhere else - more specifically, it denies the player agency and in so doing, empowers the protagonist, Red.\n\nI don't want to say too much about the events of the game, as I believe Transistor is best experienced without too much knowledge, but that note is worth hitting upon: there will be moments when you don't have even the illusion of choice, and those moments are because the protagonist is making the choice for herself - the player is merely there to see her safely through her story.\n\nIn short, I love it. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1670921314, "timestamp_updated": 1670921314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128466198": {"recommendationid": "128466198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141540746", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1670905808}, "language": "english", "review": "Long time ago, I pirated (kid with no money at the time) this game and finished it.\n\nI loved it so much, and I felt so bad and so I'm debt for pirating it that I bought it twice on steam, one for myself one as a gift, once on Switch, bought Bastion, Pyre when it released (even tho I haven't played it), and of course Hades, and I still feel in debt with the developers.\n\nSupergiant games deserves all love and support, and I'm so happy Hades has finally brought them what they deserve.", "timestamp_created": 1670906936, "timestamp_updated": 1670906936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798630595207214355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128459261": {"recommendationid": "128459261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151822647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1670896364}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story, mind melting music, refreshing new type of game-play that's familiar but still has a unique taste.

That's why it pains me to not recommend Transistor, no matter how much I REALLY wanted to like it.\n\nGetting the good out of the way quickly, Transistor looks and sounds amazing just like every other Supergiant game. The art is excellent, the voice acting is great, and the music is crisp and somber. The artistic direction in the game is top notch.\n\nThe ideas behind the gameplay are extremely interesting. I really enjoyed how much customization was crammed into so few buttons and it really felt like the game was created with the intent to let a variety of playstyles be fun and effective.\n\nThat's it for the good. Now for the bad. The gameplay does a great job hooking the player in the beginning but it becomes clear that there's virtually nothing here beyond an idea. Combat is clunky, the balance between abilities/upgrades is terrible, you are forced to play in small areas with a ton of visual and physical clutter, information is not accurately relayed to the player (especially when using the game's primary gimmick, the Turn() function), and the enemies lean more towards irritating than actually challenging. Even worse, a few enemies/encounters feel genuinely unfair because of how stiffly you control and how \"dodging\" some attacks is only possible when using the \"optional\" Jaunt() (dodge roll/dash) or standing behind breakable cover. Despite this unfairness, the game is generally very easy.\n\nExploration is nearly non-present. There are some optional things to take a look at or optional challenges right off the beaten path but the game is essentially just a series of rectangular rooms with or without enemies one after another. It's all dressed up well and the city environment is beautiful but any sense of wonder is stifled by your limited traversal options. There are also no puzzles to speak of, making the game little more than walking from room to room triggering encounters.\n\nThe visual design of the enemies does not hold up to the art direction everywhere else. There is nothing inherently wrong with them, but they are bland and uninteresting compared to everything else around you. This might be alleviated if there were any interesting characters to interact with but there is very little dialogue or proximity to anything actually alive/sentient save for the \"soul\" of the character in your sword. I liked listening to my sword speak (and he speaks somewhat incessantly) and he may have been one of the only things that compelled me to complete the game.\n\nSpeaking of completion, this is an approximately 4 hour game. Nothing wrong with something short and sweet but something about the brevity and flatness of the experience screams \"half-baked\" to me. There is a story beat where you will realize that rather than just getting started you are closer to 75% done with the game. I am still unsure if this was meant to be subversive or if Supergiant ran out of time or budget but i'm leaning towards the latter.\n\nI know some people like the story and even cried when they played. I am not one of those people. I enjoyed the characterization between the player character and the voice in her sword but my motivation to learn more about them slowly died as I learned how underdeveloped the story and the setting was. Frankly, I think the story is contrived, rushed, and at times nonsensical. The ending, which should have been poignant, wound up having no effect on me. The drama of the acting and the music were nearly comedic in juxtaposition with how baffingly unengaging each story beat was. I genuinely expected much, much better.\n\nOverall, Transistor is deeply forgettable. It has all of the Supergiant charm and beauty on a surface level but it fails to meaningfully deliver in the end because it feels plain unfinished and, at times, uninspired. I would skip this game unless you are committed to playing through everything developed by Supergiant.", "timestamp_created": 1670128753, "timestamp_updated": 1670128753, "voted_up": false,

It's a pretty middle of the road game gameplay and story wise, and is worth getting on sale perhaps to kill a day or weekend.\n\nPROS:\n- as always, the aesthetics are nailed by supergiant. Music, art, tone, everything is so beautiful\n- highly customizable combat system which is fun to tinker with, but..\nCONS: \n- the combat system, though in theory should be fun, in actual execution, is a bit tedious and dull. You get to have 4 attacks mapped to ABXY. You slot in your attacks. Each attack also functions as an upgrade to another attack, or as a passive buff (for example a cloak functions as a toggle ability when mapped to ABXY, but when used as an upgrade provides cloak to be triggered with the attack). This sounds awesome, but the combat system relies on a freeze frame, queue up attacks, and then hit execute method. You will wish you were running around button mashing and enjoying your cool customizable arsenal, but instead you just wind up watching it do it for you. Is is satisfying to plan out your stuff ahead of time? Maybe, but the drawback is that you basically watch it do the fun stuff for you.\n- despite how much people love the story, I will argue the story here is very dull, cliche, and predictable. You follow the story of two lovers with no context as to why they are lovers. You just are supposed to root for them I guess? There's an ending I won't spoil, but I found that to be trite as well. I will give the story credit in one way, which is the tone of it is really nailed. The universe seems really interesting. There's a lot of lore going on here. But the characters themselves were begging me to relate to them, when they gave me no real reason to. Still, some people may love the story and the ending and really care for the protagonists; I just am not one of them and I'm sure others will feel the same way that it's a bit hamfisted.\n\nAnd this may be a pro or a con depending on your perspective, but the game is short. You can finish it in 6 hours without really trying to speedrun or anything. I personally like this in a sea of 20+ hour games in my backlog, as I'm more likely to play a game these days if it's shorter. However, it may not be worth the price.\n\nSo the verdict? I doubt anyone buying this will regret it, as there's obviously a lot of care that went into this game, and it's not unplayable or anything like that. Most people will like it, others will love it, and a few will just kinda go \"eh\" at it. If anyone does hate it, no doubt it's the combat system. \n\n(my play time doesn't reflect the game, I have it on switch and finished it there)", "timestamp_created": 1662780327, "timestamp_updated": 1662780484, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472997963428497314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121991002": {"recommendationid": "121991002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010084778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1662739336}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I can appreciate this game and would love to love it, I can't say I'd actually recommend Transistor.\n\nTL;DR: Well put together game with great aesthetics and interesting ideas, but the gameplay design takes most of the ideas in the wrong direction, fighting against the player instead of working with them.\n\nSupergiant went on to fix pretty much all of these issues in Hades though, so I'd love to see them take another shot at this game's combat system with their new approach!\n\n---\n\nI'd probably have given this a strong positive review if I finished it back when i purchased it in 2014, or if i was a story-first gamer, but after playing Hades & a replay of Bastion I feel that Transistor's gameplay is constantly fighting against the player by comparison. This game's 2nd boss has a lower completion rate than the FINAL boss of any other Supergiant game, and after playing this through today I can see why nearly 70% of people decided to put this game down less than halfway through.\n\n- Picking up enemy \"Cells\" to finish them off feels like a mechanic that was put in place as a bandaid to keep long range builds in-check. It's not a bad idea, but nothing is done with it so it adds nothing to the game. Hades does this much better with its \"Cast\" system. Not a huge fault on its own, but this is the first of many mechanics that feel designed to work against the player instead of for them.\n\n- The game has a habit of disabling its own systems, rather than leaning into them like Hades does. The Cells mentioned above are a good example. It would be great to have more synergies like perk that makes Cells explode, giving you some extra bonuses on being picked up, but instead we have a perk that gives skills a chance to disable the Cell system. Waste of potential.\n\n- Other good examples of this are the crowd control mechanics used by enemies:\n\nOne disables your ability to use Turn() while standing in the area, completely disrupting the flow of combat and getting you killed if you tried to enter Turn() without realizing and end up standing there. Why does it not just apply a penalty to the amount of time skills consume while in Turn() mode instead of disabling your inputs? This enemy ability makes me feel stupid as a player for whiffing a bunch of Turn() attempts, rather than feeling like I used or failed to use my strategies to overcome an obstacle.\n\nAnother blocks out random chunks of the screen. The goal is to memorize the enemy locations, either by spamming Move & Undo to scout the area, or spamming Pause & Unpause to view a snapshot of it. I'm not sure which one of these was the \"intended\" one because both are so obnoxious to do that whichever one you stumble upon first is probably going to have you react with \"that's probably not how you are supposed to do that, but it works\".\n\nAnother blocks out your camera with a snapshot. I'm okay with a game having a only a few different types of enemies, but that smaller number comes with an expectation of better and more meaningful mechanics than this, not filling 20% of the very limited slots with different variations of \"now you can't see the game\".\n\nThese enemy designs are annoying, not engaging. They would probably draw a lot more criticism if this game was released today instead of in 2014.\n\n- Another point on disabling its own systems; Losing abilities to save you from death sounds like a neat way to force players to change their setup on paper, but in practice it just encourages a bunch of unfun gameplay patterns to try and circumvent it. Restarting combat encounters, using expensive scapegoat abilities to burn first, or accepting your fate and wasting 5 minutes in a menu re-allocating a slightly weaker version of your existing build are all poor outcomes.\n\n- Despite this, the game balance completely breaks in half against the power of the status effect that turns enemies into allies. You can permanently lock down every single non-boss encounter in the game like this with such a low amount of investment and effort that it feels more like cheating than coming up with a clever combo. Encounters with large single enemies may as well not exist because of this, because they are unable to take any actions for the entire battle.\n\n- Having nothing available to do between Turns() by default really hurts the pace of combat. While you are not truly 'forced' to use Jaunt() or a Jaunt() supported skill, the game design feels like it was built with a mindset of \"of course they are using Jaunt()\". This game is begging for a default attack that you can use to recharge your turn faster, like in Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\n\n- Interfaces are clunky and information is spread across multiple screens in ways that force you to have to flick back and forth in menus. Information is not present when you need it, like being given a pre-made loadout for a trial with seemingly no way to check what the loadout's skills actually do.\n\n- Skills frequently do less damage than they say they will due to things like enemies changing position or orientation. I personally think the game should have fudged the hitboxes behind the scenes in order to keep the damage reports honest and adjust the balance accordingly, instead of surprising the player with a lethal attack from an enemy that was expected to die.\n\n- Enemy attacks are extremely unforgiving in their timing, but not in an engaging way like Sekiro or Devil May Cry. The way this game is balanced leads to one of the more extreme cases of \"abuse or be abused\" that I've seen in a game, but not in an exciting way.\n\n- Limiters rewarding extra EXP while including a limiter that reduces your Memory feels like another wasted opportunity, and seems like it is designed backwards. I would rather gain increased Memory instead of EXP, giving me increased customization options to handle the increased threat.\n\n- I don't have a problem with any of the individual effects from the Limiters, but the way they combine ends up encouraging you to use builds that are truly balance shattering. This would be fine if these builds were still interesting to use, but instead enemies are either deleted instantly or permanently disabled from status effects.\n\n- Annoying environmental damage sometimes happens before combat, adding nothing to the game except a click of the reset button so you can climb the staircase properly this time. This is another thing that makes me feel like a stupid gamer being punished for taking a hit from a random non-combat wall-tentacle. I'm not sure where they were finding the fun when designing these sections. It's a relatively minor thing, but when you experience it alongside everything previously listed it sticks out as another moment that makes you ask \"Why did they design it like this?\"\n\n- The final boss is extremely polarizing towards different builds. Many builds suffer horribly due to the \"mechanic\". 4x Defense passives with Cull() + Mask() backstab walks through the fight like it's a tutorial. Not very engaging regardless of which side you end up on here. As cool as the idea of these types of fights are, this one is all style and no substance when it comes to being an engaging boss fight.\n\nThis boss mechanic mechanic needs to be thought out in a more interactive way in order to work properly, rather than giving up on the idea of being an action hybrid game. This boss design goes fully into the turn based aspect of this game, but it is a very poorly designed turn based battle. Action gamers will be disappointed that the game has given up on one half of its promise, and turn based gamers will be disappointed at the lackluster mechanics.\n\nWith all of these things combined together into the same game, the gameplay systems feel like they have been kneecapped by a design approach that asks \"How do we make sure this isn't too strong\" instead of the Hades approach of \"how do we make sure this is fun to use, and works with other systems\".

It turns real time strategy into a puzzle and organically makes you change up your gameplay on your first run through to get as much lore as you can.

The second run through or as the game calls it recursion allows for new game plus and remains challenging for the most part even though you have everything unlocked already. Admittedly it is easier the 2nd time through but you can easily put on limiters to increase the difficulty. A good part of that however is knowing what combinations work nicely for your preferred playstyle. Oh and don't even get me started on the music. By far the best soundtrack these guys have put out to this day in my mind. Still blowing Bastion, Pyre, and Hades out of the water by a landslide on the OST. I highly highly recommend this game. There are community guides if you're struggling to grasp mechanics that are unique to this game but I promise you everything is available to try out and the game is satisfying to play.

I remember when I first saw this, I scrolled by it multiple times on my steam page before finally deciding to get it and play it, and I'm so glad I did. Even after Hades and Pyre, this is still my favorite game by Supergiant- and considering how phenomenal Hades and Pyre are, and how much I love those two games, that's extremely high praise in my book. \n\nThe combat is unique and refreshing- it's turn based, and was a learning curve for me when I first started playing, but once I got the hang of it, there was something so satisfying about destroying the Process bit by bit. The system of 'death' is one that is also really well done- you don't die, but instead, you lose one of your powers for a battle or two. It makes those battles harder, and it really feels like a consequence. It's also far less frustrating than dying immediately and having to do a battle over and over again, which I appreciate a ton.\n\nOf course, another huge part of this game is the immersive nature of the world around you sucks you into a story rich with tiny details that, if you pay attention, have so much meaning. Telling me that a passage way down to another platform has 36 steps has no impact on the gameplay, but it is actually those tiny details that make the world draw me in more. There's so many layers, packaged in a way that's satisfying to the brain. Not only that, but the characters are unbelievably powerful in helping to tell the narrative too- the voice actors in this game do such an incredible job of really putting so much into their lines. All of this is of course accompanied by gorgeous, painting-like backgrounds that shimmer and glow as Red runs around in them.\n\nI really could ramble about this game so much more, but this review is already sort of long- and besides, this is something you really just have to experience for yourself.

But one night everything changes, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on a popular singer, [b]Red[/b], the whole world goes to hell. A woman in question loses her voice, but gains a powerful ally, the titular [b]Transistor[/b], a talking sword that looks like it was cut out of a computer chip. Together they will take revenge on these villains while also saving the world from a mysterious power called [b]The Process[/b]. The story isn\u2019t particularly complicated, but the charismatic companion makes the adventure interesting to follow. The game doesn\u2019t explain everything that happens, but it has lots of subtle details and hidden pieces of info that will provide insight into the world\u2019s inner workings while also leaving a room for interpretation. There aren\u2019t any unpredictable twists, but there are a lot of dramatic moments and the ending is sure to make your eyes wet.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nEven if you weren\u2019t caught by the story, you would probably be sucked into this game by its combat mechanics. It features a unique mix of action mechanics and turn based tactics. The game is played like a regular hack and slash, but you have an ability to stop time and plan your actions. After exiting the planning phase, your character will execute those actions almost instantaneously. However, there\u2019s a drawback: this ability has a cooldown and while it\u2019s charging, you can\u2019t use any of your other abilities with a few exceptions, which leaves you vulnerable and makes you think about how you want to approach things. Sometimes it might be better not to use a planning phase at all, and the game actually encourages you by providing an enormous set of abilities to fit your playstyle. There are 16 abilities in total, which you will unlock during the course of game. Each ability can be used in three capacities: as a weapon, as an upgrade, or as a passive ability. I\u2019m not going to count how many possibilities for a character build it gives you, but it\u2019s easy to see that it\u2019s quite a lot. The game also encourages you to experiment with your abilities by unlocking pieces of information after you use an ability in all of its capacities.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s one problem I\u2019ve noticed with this system, that becomes really obvious on a second playthrough. Certain abilities are much stronger than others, which limits your choice of build to a couple of most powerful ones. Although it\u2019s not that big of a deal, since the game allows you to tweak the difficulty with Limiters, they\u2019re unlocked one by one like abilities, but instead of giving you the advantage, they will buff enemies making them stronger, more resilient or enhancing their abilities. And enemies in this game aren\u2019t killed that easily, they spawn white cells after death, that you have to collect, or the enemy will respawn. The enemy variety is great, while 10 enemy types might not seem like much, each of them requires a unique approach and each enemy has a level from 1 to 3. It doesn\u2019t mean their health bar grows with the level, instead they usually gain new abilities, forcing you to switch tactics and surprising you with unexpected challenges that will keep you on your toes most of the time.\n\n[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]\nThe game\u2019s visuals are breathtaking, there are lots of little details in each location. Enemy design is top-notch, you can guess their strengths and weaknesses just by looking at them. The animation looks smooth and watching the protagonist perform her attacks is very satisfying. The voice acting and the music are complementing the visuals nicely. Your helpful companion will never miss an opportunity to comment on the things you see around you, and the music always fits with what\u2019s happening on screen.\u00a0\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nSpecs: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB, 32GB RAM.\n\nAt 1080p resolution, the game runs at 60 FPS without any drops. There are, however, some issues with the game. If you use Alt-Tab to change between windows, the game would reset its resolution to the lowest minimum one, and after you reset it, it will run with a noticeable input lag. I\u2019ve also experienced a crash one time when the short cutscene was supposed to start. Thankfully, autosave checkpoints aren\u2019t that far from each other.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]Transistor[/b] is an interesting adventure with charismatic characters that you will probably come to miss after finishing the game. And what\u2019s more, the combat mechanics are a great fun, with a vast variety of possible character builds and enemies that require unique approaches.

The man in the transistor is very interesting as your narrator and gives you entertainment in between combat, helping immerse you in the world.\n\nVisually breathtaking, one of the GOAT gaming OSTs (not hyperbole, seriously it is unreal how good most of these tracks fit the game) and it's audio design in general is just incredibly enjoyable: Red seamlessly humming the current song when pausing for turn based combat always impresses and immerses me no matter how many times I play the game. \n\nGo in blind, experiment with the combat system and immerse yourself in a world.

You can hear your partner from inside the sword and he narrates the story as you play. The narrator tries to guide you to safety, but Red (the girl you're playing as) has a better idea.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, it's isometric and you don't target enemies to attack them, rather you just face the right direction and use the skill. The skills you use are earned through defeating bosses or levelling up, though some are from story. You can equip your skills as active, passive or upgrade, changing how they work, leading to endless ways to murder your enemies.\n\nThe story is fairly emotional, and has a happy/sad ending that'll make you want to play again. The NG+ (called recurse in the game) lets you start the story over but with everything you gained before. The soundtrack is fantastic.\n\nThere are a few side challenges you can do for some extra exp and limiters you can enable to make the game harder.\n\nI believe my original playthrough was 11 hours, so it's an ideal game to just smash through if you fancy a change from what you normally play.", "timestamp_created": 1658236206, "timestamp_updated": 1658236206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119061828": {"recommendationid": "119061828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930515950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1658212453}, "language": "english", "review": "Completely different concept that came out perfectly!\nThe Story follows Red, a singer in the city of Cloudbank and her journey to find the Camerata and put a stop to their on goings while exacting revenge on them trying to assassinate her with the neon sword by the name of the Transistor. The characters in this game are all intriguing with their voice acting coming across as very ominous and mysterious making the player think about their motives. The other way of learning about characters is through gameplay (which i will talk about later in this review) and i think that this works really well in both experimenting with gameplay and advancing the backstory. The story itself can be very basic and easy to follow for those who prefer a less complicated story, however there is enough in here that allows players to explore and learn more about the world and narrative and it makes for a really engaging experience. It manages to take a simple story and tells it in a more impressive way. \nThe setting of Cloudbank is just gorgeous with it being this cyberpunk utopia that soon becomes more and more corrupted. I also really like how each area you go to has its own look and the game takes its moments to show off the world that you the player traverse within and allows for their to be commentary on it. \nVisually it looks stunning. Graphically, it ran perfectly with a smooth, constant frame rate and never had a single crash or bug. The Art Direction is truly beautiful and is definitely an improvement on what Bastion had layed down with animations being more smooth and backgrounds having a lot more flow to them. I really love the colour pallet that the game uses as it never shy's away from showing off its neon lights. \nSound and Audio are also a major improvement and are some of the best parts of the game. The soundtrack is this mix of industrial, drum and bass, beutiful singer songwriter melodies, guitar riffs etc. and with all of this and the inclusion of the beautiful vocals of Ashley Barrett, it really makes for a memorable experience. The sound for things such as the process, transistor abilities and even booting up an OVC terminal all have their own character to them and really adds to the experience. \nIn terms of gameplay, I really loved it but i can understand why some people may not. This game takes on a different approach in terms of combat as it goes for a turn based style instead of a hack n slash kind of style that games such as Hades and Bastion are known for. I must say though that the combat system is very fleshed out with there being multiple abilities to mix and match with, giving the player the opportunity to play they want to. There is a wide variety of enemies and offer the player many challenges to overcome. There is a system that pretty much all Supergiant games that i played have that allows the player to make the game harder but offer larger rewards and this game also implements this too which I think is great with there being different challenges and de-buffs that really make the experience that much more intense. The only think i wish this game had was a longer run time because its truly amazing, however there is a new game + mode for those who want more. \nOverall, Transistor was another bold step from Supergiant Games that paid off in the best way possible and had me hook from start to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1658219236, "timestamp_updated": 1658219276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119060133": {"recommendationid": "119060133", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059682774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1658285994}, "language": "english", "review": "Great music, dialogue, and voices.", "timestamp_created": 1658215488, "timestamp_updated": 1658215488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119045225": {"recommendationid": "119045225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186899349", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1658186587}, "language": "english", "review": "Worst game by Supergiant, by far.

I believe its shortcomings stem from its incomplete turn-based mechanics and a story that not only loses me in the first 30 minutes but fails to really explain anything worth pursuing for another 6 hours. \n\nCombat was made janky through its mix of real-time and turn-based combat. Few games are able to fuse both styles well, and its process of plan-execute-survive for a period of time felt very clunky. Your ability to survive depends on if you have the dash feature on hand, if there is sufficient regenerative cover, and if you're able to walk away from your enemy fast enough (there are no sprinting features). You're also unable to use abilities while you are on a cool down before your next execution phase. These limited means of defending yourself before going back into turn-based modes just sucks the life out of combat. \n\nYou can lose your evasive abilities that you gain as you lose lives/die. There was an instance early on in the game where you can lose your ability to dodge and not gain it back in important battles. When you treat that mechanic like any other ability that you can lose, it feels like you're kicking the player while they're down. \n\nIt eventually got to the point where I thought about what I was really trying to fight for in this game, even though stunning isometric city vistas and other watercolor dreamscapes from their art department did their best to prevent me from thinking that I'm some singer/city planner hybrid that somehow found herself with a giant sword and a vengeance for taking down some quasi-Illuminati group. The narrator isn't explained, or charismatic - the main character only seemed to sing on cue, which felt like a missed opportunity to develop some characters early on to sustain engagement. Perhaps these story questions are better explained if I continued, but I couldn't rationalise the struggle.

It has a flexible system for mixing-and-matching the different skills that you develop. Typically in these types of games I settle on a particular combination that seems effective and keep using it without much further experimentation. Transistor had a neat idea to prevent that: when you lose all your health you lose temporary use of a skill. This forces you to substitute in a new skill, and keeps the combat feeling fresh. I'd like to see this implemented in more games. Add in an decent narrative (revealed slowly and indirectly) and it equaled a rewarding single-play-through game for me. If you prefer your story told directly and clearly then you might not enjoy this game.\n\nThe only negatives for me were that the combat system wasn't explained as well as it could have been at the beginning, it started to drag a bit towards the end (but not that badly), and I found the voice acting for the bad guys to be kind of irritating (the voice acting for the \"Transistor\", on the other hand, was great).", "timestamp_created": 1656559378, "timestamp_updated": 1656559378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117891768": {"recommendationid": "117891768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029894415", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1302, "last_played": 1655476289}, "language": "english", "review": "Total spoilers ahead\n\nIn the past, I spurred Transistor for being more complicated, more convoluted, significantly shorter, and perhaps a tad pretentious when compared to Bastion, the title's predecessor. This view stuck with me for many, many years... it's only recently that I've come to appreciate Transistor's unique perspective on pure democracies and tactical semi-turn-based gameplay. Bastion, and more recently Hades, are still more straightforward and superior games, but Transistor has since pulled itself out of my \"strictly avoid\" category, and I now consider it a proud addition to the Supergiant game collection. \n\nTransistor is a layer cake of increasingly sophisticated ideas. On the surface it's a game about a seemingly digital utopia being upended by a robotic invasion, with Red (the PC) being the only one who can stop it. Wielding an advanced sword that can absorb the digital souls of fallen citizens (including Red's companion at the start of the game, who travels with you from start to finish), Red must travel through an increasingly deserted & corrupted city, find those responsible for the robotic outbreak, and stop the Process before there's nothing left to save.\n\nHowever, beyond the surface of Transistor lies a multi-faceted story magnitudes more complex than what initially meets the eye.\n\nIt's a story of the issues a pure democracy still contains... something that sci-fi in general tends to overlook, as many stories end with an authoritarian system being overthrown, a democratic one being installed, and everyone expecting every problem to be instantly solved.\nIt's a story of an artist trying to express themselves in the world, but having to watch as their works inspire radicalism & conflict without meaning to. \nIt's a story of love, how a distant companion can only watch their lover struggle from a distance and are seemingly powerless to help. How in the end, one is given enormous power & responsibility, but gives it up in order to be reunited with said lover again.\nIt's a story how, in a pure democracy where everyone is given a voice, nobody seems to have one. Some who want change/stability feel entirely muted (to paraphrase one of the antagonists: \"how could only 4 voices make a difference in a city where everyone has one?\"), while others are given unexpected and unprecedented amounts of sway with the crowd, but inadvertently inspire change & radicalism they themselves don't agree with.\nIt's a story of a city, and indeed culture, constantly changing at the fleeting whims of the people. It's a story about the voiceless taking matters into their own hands, turning to authoritarianism in the attempt to introduce some stability into the system, but end up causing bring destruction upon everyone around them, including themselves.\n\nTransistor can be many things to many people... personally I find it fascinating how an increase of real-world knowledge and broadening of perspective can change one's view of this game. In my youth I considered it convoluted and a bit pretentious, over the years however, I've come to appreciate it's unique plotline and the message it tries to send.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the tactical semi-turn-based style again felt a little complicated/convoluted compared to Bastion's, but it's also something that's come to grow on me as I've advanced in age. There's an enormous amount of different attack styles & synergies to experiment with, some of which cause disgustingly powerful combos and can even merge with themselves in New Game+. Despite not all moves being treated equally, or having perfect synergy with each other, there's enough variety to keep things interesting even on NG+, and the side challenges forcing players to experiment with unique playstyles makes them more appealing & overall help pad out the game's otherwise short runtime.\n\nOverall, Transistor's a game that took many years to grow on me, but now that I've advanced in age & worldview, I've come to appreciate it's more tactical combat system and unique storyline. I won't say that it's perfect, nor argue that Bastion & Hades aren't better/more straight forward games, but I am glad that I gave this one another chance.", "timestamp_created": 1656544337, "timestamp_updated": 1656544337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513627231121063232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117810476": {"recommendationid": "117810476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198434047899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1657806043}, "language": "english", "review": "Transistor is one of the best games I have ever played. The gameplay, story and presentation all come together to deliver an experience that quite literally left me stunned upon completion. \n\nThe combat in this game is comprised of 'Turns,' where you freeze time and plan out your next series of moves, before executing them and having to dodge all the enemies' attacks while your Turn function recharges. This gives the gameplay a wonderful ebb and flow as you alternate between unloading as much damage as possible on the enemy army, before running for your life as they do the same to you. You also have lots of ways to customise your build, as every attack can be used actively, as one of your 4 main damage dealers, passively, to make your character more powerful, and as an upgrade to one of your active attacks. This provides you with the freedom to experiment with many. many options, most of which are more than powerful enough to succeed in battle. \n\nAs good as Transistor's gameplay is, the aspects most deserving of praise are the game's story, visuals and soundtrack. The city of Cloudbank  is beautiful, and the game's use of lighting, as well as  its layering of 2d effects makes it even better. Darren Korb's soundtrack and Ashley Barrett's vocals add to the lonely atmosphere of the world, and help accentuate the more emotional beats of the story. And what a story it is. I was not emotionally prepared for how this story would make me feel, and I don't think many pieces of media will be able to get a similar reaction out of me. This game made me feel a stronger bond with a silent protagonist and a voice without a body in just 8 hours than most games could do in hundreds.

A pretty creative use of digital and programming themes masterfully woven into a noir-style love story. As far as the story goes it is pretty good and definitely gives you the feels if you pay attention. The graphics are very stylized as can be expected from the makers of Bastion. Where the game falls a bit short is the gameplay. The entire game feels like a quick rollercoaster, which leaves very little time to actually browse the beautiful world and enjoy. It does create a sense of urgency, but because you cannot return to any previous areas it felt precisely like a Disney theme ride where if you look to the left you risk missing something to the ride because a few seconds later you've already moved on. The combat is creative in the way skills are made to combine into a multitude of effects, but aside from that it is pretty bland as some skills are very clearly better than others. Not to mention that the isometric point of view often causes certain skills to clip things which do not look like they should be clipped. \n\nThat being said it's a short but enjoyable playthrough with some unique elements.

But, hear me out. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n---\n\n[h1]Positive[/h1]\n[b]+ Art[/b]\nThe art style, animation, colour palettes, effects, characters, general atmosphere.. It's BEAUTIFUL. I'm personally not a fan of \"humans in an epic tech future\" setting, but despite that, Supergiant rocks with its art and doesn't fail at it in [i]Transistor[/i] whatsoever.\n\n[b]+ Music[/b]\nS'good and fits with the game. I listen to a fuck ton of music, but I never really know how to describe it properly for a game lmao. It fits and is good, what else my guy!\n\n[b]+ Narration[/b]\nMakes you feel like Red & the narrator have a [i]reeeeeaaaaal[/i] relationship.. Which is the point.\n\n---\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[b]/ Story[/b]\nIt's better than [i]Bastion[/i]'s, that's for sure. But I still had to read through other folks' interpretations & explanations to really understand what was going on. The only things I understood from just the game:[list]\n    [*]This city kinda shit\n    [*]Red 'n Sword can't do the kissy kissy anymore\n    [*][i]DO something about it, Red!!!![/i]\n[*]Dead people get transported into the sword..\nAt least it's a new trope?\n[*]Sword = key to fixing city\n[/list]\n\nThe story itself is... I don't know. The usual shenanigans happening in a future tech world for humans, things just have unique terms. I think the most attention-grabbing thing was the sword, really- Where else do the dead get transported into a sword for fuck's sake? I didn't particularly care too much for any NPC introduced though, as most of them are just text files you can read. The only thing that was established and remained the same throughout, is Red & the narrator's relationship.\n\n-\n\n[b]/ Combat System[/b]\nBit awkward to put this in neutral when it's the prime gameplay loop. However, it's.. Okay? There's a mechanic that pauses, and you can plan your moves ahead to then swiftly execute them like you're a time-traveller. This mechanic, I like!\n\nWhat's also nice, is that there's a good amount of abilities to customise your style. These abilities can be used as that- Abilities, but you can also use them as upgrades and as passives. Each ability has a different effect depending on how you use it. This customisation is pretty neat and allows you to tinker with your stuff.\n\nHowever, and this is where I get neutral about it, is the fact that I either DID like abilities, or didn't. It's about 50/50 for me, in terms of using it or dump it as an upgrade/passive. In my experience, a lot of abilities were short or long range, and just had a different wind-up animation & effects. I didn't feel like the majority of abilities were particularly [i]unique[/i].\n\nAnother point is, when you die, you lose access to an ability. You have to restart from the last checkpoint if you lose all your abilities, so you can die like 4 times. Okay, fair penalty. But, here comes the annoying part: If you're a slowpoke like me, and you know, die a lot to Mr. Big Chungus Boss.. You're going to have a fun time using your least favourite basic ability for the rest of the battle. \n\nAnother fun time is finding like 1-3 further checkpoints to ''reset the cooldown'' of your lost ability, so you can use it again. Okay, now I'm temporarily changing up my [i]entire[/i] deck, or at least 1 significant ability. I don't want to be [i]forced[/i] to experiment, you get what I mean?\n\n---\n\n[h1]Negative[/h1]\n[b]\u2014 The Exploration Feel[/b]\nAlright, there's several ways you can go in a level usually. Some will lead to a random room with enemies, and you get a new ability or some shit. Some will just allow you to look at the room and appreciate its art. Some others will make you observe a statue and your sword boyfriend goes googoo gaga. I didn't feel like there was any real incentive to exploring, so I didn't much. Normally, I'm a sucker to look for nooks 'n crannies, but when I can expect one or the other, I can't be bothered. This is also probably the prime reason I finished this game in 3.5 hours, which is [i]way[/i] shorter than I hoped it'd be.\n\n[b]\u2014 The Tests[/b]\nThere are several tests in this game to prove eg. your speed, your stability, you know, be The Best Of The Best. I don't really care for these normally, but to accidentally enter one and then be [i]forced[/i] to do the test, in order to leave? Don't pull that shit on me, man. At least I could kick a beach ball before the test, I guess?\n\n-\n\n[b]\u2014 Enemies[/b]\nThe general few enemies you fight are:\n[list]\n    [*]Some robot\n    [*]A chicken that shits out explosives\n    [*]A man that goes invisible sometimes\n[*]A dog\n[*]A big jerk\n[*]Woman\n[*] Probably some other little guys that I forgot about\n[/list]\n\nWhile the enemies vary in mechanics, it doesn't feel like it'd be enough to keep someone engaged for hours at a time. Fights are usually over extremely quickly, so in the 'heat' of battle you don't really look up. The only enemies that you have to pay [i]real[/i] attention to are bosses. With these fights, you make [i]real good[/i] use of covering, the planning mechanic, etc. Now, there's a mechanic to make 'fodder fights' more difficult through Limiters, but I didn't see the point of it. Especially if I wasn't enthusiastic enough about combat in the first place.\n\n-\n\n[b]\u2014 Price[/b]\nI cannot recommend this at full price, especially if you can finish the game as quickly as I did. On sale, sure why not, but I think there are better similar games out there to begin with. [strike]Like [i]Bastion[/i] lol[/strike]\n\n---\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\nFinished the game way too soon for my taste and wasn't particularly enthusiastic about anything. The main gameplay, the combat, is okay, but I feel there's better alternatives out there for a better price. I recommend getting this in a sale if you want to try it.", "timestamp_created": 1652583336, "timestamp_updated": 1652639008, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488754957914352417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115469632": {"recommendationid": "115469632", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999366289", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1467684010}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was only engaging enough for me to dump 15 minutes into it.", "timestamp_created": 1652573070, "timestamp_updated": 1652573070, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491483151912689209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115371882": {"recommendationid": "115371882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054165162", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1406684403}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are on the fence about this game, do yourself a favor and buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1652414020, "timestamp_updated": 1652414087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115348396": {"recommendationid": "115348396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031528760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1652644680}, "language": "english", "review": "Supergiant can't put a foot wrong; fun af combat, a story that forces you to explore and be intregued.

The combat is difficult initially, but take the advice of the tutorial and never move until you know exactly what you want to do with your movement.  The fights only run while you as the player are actively doing things. \n You can literally plan out your combat and let the game run whatever you've finalized, then retreat while your meter builds up so you can plan another attack.  \n\nThis game is beautiful to the ears and eyes, and tells a quasi-noir story I found entertaining.  I've only played it through once, so I still haven't done everything the game has to offer in terms of their upgrade system, which amounts to selecting programs and running them in one of three different tiers for different effects.  Running each program enough on each tier unlocks additional side-story content that's interesting background material to the game.  \n\nThe soundtrack is stellar as always.  If you liked their music from other titles (Bastion or Hades), you'll enjoy these songs too.  \n\nIt took me about 10-12 hours to run through my first playthrough, but that includes about an hour of just playing around in the first act or so, learning how to use the combat system.  That seems a bit shorter than Bastion, but the game also has a new game plus mode, where you can keep your old programs and thus earn second copies of them through the second playthrough, allowing you to make even more interesting combinations.  \n\n(Sadly, that's where I petered out because a Steam sale came through and I bought about 4 or 5 new games.

Good game.\n\nA couple notes on the game: It was challenging for me to get into the game and appreciate the combat until two things happened:\n\n1) I had to play through and beat the campaign once.\nHonestly this isn't that bad. The campaign isn't exceptionally long. What this gives you is access to all of the base functions (combat abilities).\n\n2) I had to practice using a TON of different builds. \nThere honestly is not \"a build\" that is good enough to carry you for the entire game. I used probably seven or eight different \"builds\" that focused on accomplishing a specific goal. These goals generally came down to three broad categories:\nFirst: a build that maximized burst damage on a single target. If you play around, it's easy to make a build that allows you to burst a target with nearly 6000 damage.\nSecond: a build that maximized AOE damage. This usually was a build that focused on doing about 1000 damage to enemies within a certain area.\nThird: a build that emphasized NOT using the Turn() mechanic. There are certain parts of the game that I COULD NOT clear while using Turn(). Contrary to certain reviews, it is absolutely possible to formulate builds that bypass Turn(). They are not easy to use and will not provide the results of the first two builds, but they maximize up-time and allow you to play (relatively) very defensively.\n\nGood luck!

Plenty of interesting builds you can make that keep the game fresh and exciting. The story is really good with a strong progression and understanding as you delve further into the world. A lot of miscellaneous lore can be found and the dialogue has depth and meaning. \n\nThe art direction is fascinating. Another great isometric game that encompasses tasteful design while simultaneously providing fast pace fighting and atmosphere. The soundtrack blew me away with incredible vocals and outstanding instrumentals that really set the tone of the game. I expect nothing less from the utmost talented, Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett. Truly an honor to experience any of Darren's scores. \n\nI really don't have anything bad to say about the thing.

But there isn't much of the world to be discovered and it doesn't have much in the RPG department.\n\nThis entire game feels like a second half of a game we didn't get to play. From the very beginning we're thrown in the middle of a situation and we're sort of taking things from there. It's apparent that there were important events that led us to where we are, so the logical assumption is that the story will later explain how we ended up in this predicament. But it doesn't, at least not really. There is one flashback that gives more questions than it answers and that's it. Our companion is constantly talking about the city we are in and from the actions made by the main character it is apparent that she also knows it really well. The game keeps trying to sell the importance of the city to the player and why is it so critical that we save it but the player knows absolutely nothing about it, and doesn't learn much about it throughout the game. Hearing the companion talk about certain places or lifestyles of the city, carries the same emotional weight as reading random words from the dictionary without the definition. It definitely is a thing and it means something, you just don't know what. Same goes for the main antagonists. They barely exist in the game yet the companion won't shut up about them. Camerata this... Camerata that... And by the end I still had no idea what even they were. A secret society? A government agency? Some fancy club? A family? Dunno. I feels like the writer skipped the entire 1st act of the story, and half of the second act. Which is a shame because after playing through it twice now I can definitely tell that there is potential for a good story here, it just needed to be a whole story and not the last part of it.\n\nBesides the story, I'd say that the game doesn't do good job with introducing mechanics to the player. First few fights can be confusing but it gets better once player figures it out on their own.\n\nAlso the transistor itself has got to be one of the most annoying companions in the history of gaming. He just never shuts up. Just keeps yapping and yapping and yapping about everything  and about nothing in particular, for the whole game.\nIt feels like the studio had the voice actor do lots of voice lines for each one situation with the intention of deciding which one will be used later but for some reason they added all of them. How it would regularly work is: \n\"something happens -> companion reacts by saying something catchy-> end of the situation\". How it works in transistor:\n\"something happens -> companion reacts by saying something catchy -> and again -> and again -> and again -> end of the situation\". And it's not a part of one long catchy text, but just lot's of short disjointed ones, one after another. Just makes me imagine him with the book \"catchphrases for dummies\" going through a checklist of what to say in any given moment, It's really vexing.\n\nSometimes camera won't move during the Turn, leaving you sort of handicapped. Sometimes attack won't properly register in both Turn and outside of it. Sometimes the damage numbers are incorrect, leaving you in a situation where the game tells you that if you fire everything you have on an enemy you'll kill it and after doing so he's still alive with 20%hp and you're left wide open with nothing to attack. Those happened often enough to be noticed but not often enough to be gamebreaking or even really annoying.\n\nOn the more positive side the Soundtrack is amazing and the visuals are beautiful. I thought the ending of the story was strong, and the combat system is really fun\nThe ability system is the highlight here. You get access to plenty of skills which you can combine and mix with others for different effects creating a lot of possible play styles. The game even encourages you to try and at least test every ability in different ways, as it unlocks all of the info about it only when you fought with it in every slot. The game can also be really challenging if you want, because of the limiters.\n\nI'd say that if you ignore the story, get through the confusing start, and get used to the annoying companion. There is enough fun to be had here to recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1649206478, "timestamp_updated": 1649207006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113332156": {"recommendationid": "113332156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021498969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1675815678}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is an Old Friend of mine. While I've only done one run on Steam, I've logged 40+hrs maxing out the level system on Nintendo Switch. (Just a qualifier explaining I've spent more than just 8hrs in-game)\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal. It perfectly accommodates the cyber-dystopian universe and sets the mood for each district aptly. I highly suggest playing with headphones on and you'll pick out all the details they went into crafting the score. Certain sections drop out a particular musical element. Familiar tunes re-appear as re-mixes closer to end-game levels. Hell, even pausing the game turns down the treble to really give a sense of \"we'll be back after this short intermission\". \n\nThe graphics and artwork are exquisite. \"Cyber-Art-Nouveau\". Each level is a painted picture. The lighting isn't over-done. The design is immersive. It's a foreign universe with familiar elements. Not too abstract, yet not so plain and down to earth. An accurate representation of a world in between digital and physical.\n\nThe gameplay is rewarding and creative. Mixing the concept of turn-based with real time is wildly difficult to execute. With the isometric design, it feels almost like Advance Wars mixed with League or Dota or Diablo. The leveling system is well balanced. The variety of powers and their variations provides excellent replayability-\n\nWhich leads to the story. No spoilers: If you have just even an ounce of coding knowledge this entire story is a love-note. Games with silent protagonists are normally difficult to relate to because the purpose is to simulate yourself in their place. \nRed and [USER REDACTED] are quite the lively pair. This is more than just Navi following Link around. He's your commentator with some witty lines that gives you an insight to what Red's thinking. Admittedly, Red is a cardboard cut-out, but she's *our* cardboard cut-out with flair. The narration isn't a simple \"I'm going to sit here and tell you what's going on then express my feelings on it.\" The story follows, almost like detective-work, where you piece together key elements and characters to expand your knowledge of the universe. (Or at least your interpretation of it)\n\nAn altogether excellent game that can get overlooked for something flashier.

This at first can seem like it would cause some frustration, but in reality, forces the player to seek new combination of the abilities that it earns, otherwise a comfort zone would be found and we would use the same build for the entire game. When I found myself forced to come up with a new combo, I would very often have those eureka moments, some of the ways that the new skills introduced changes are super clever, amounting to an enormous amount of combinations.

Another successful game since their first game Bastion.\n\nAnother great game that also included on my favorites list. Visual artwork is different from Bastion in my opinion. The gameplay mechanics are awesome. Voice actor Logan and singer Ashley from Bastion are also there. Soundtrack is bit okay. Storyline is great, the downside however is the duration of the game is quite short. Challenges similar from Bastion is often focuses on strategic/tactical turns. Also the difficulty modifiers (Limiters, similar from Idols from Bastion) are much harder now. Game is not perfect due to encounter on some bugs/glitches during gameplay, but that didn't affect me at all. No leaderboards included.

This game has all of these features and I feel is an even better example of what defines them as a studio than Bastion did, and still holds up to modern game standards set by their later titles such as Hades.\n\nMake no mistake, this game is not Hades. Transistor is more about planning, as your playable character is slow and the attacks have a lot of windup and end lag. The game compensates for this in two ways - The Turn() function and the customization system. Customizing your skill loadout in this game is unique in a way that I just haven't seen in other games, before or since Transistor. Each skill stands alone as a usable ability but each one is also designated purpose as a 'sub function' or essentially a skill modifier for all of your other skills. They also can all be equipped in a passive skill slot, further allowing for alterations and customization that lets you design specific combinations or strategies - Singular massive hits, large powerful AOE setups and hit-and-run backstabbing builds are all viable and have lots of room for tweaking and tuning in of themselves.\n\nTurn(), a major feature and necessary function of the game gives you a moment to essentially stop time, breathe and work out a plan. Given a limited meter for any activation of Turn(), you can move and execute skills at the expenditure of this meter to zip around foes and execute skills in succession. The more of this meter you use the longer it will take to cool down and allow you access to your full skillset again so it's sort of a front loaded approach vaguely similar to Braving in Bravely Default but with a firm grip on working within a real time action game such as Transistor. Experts at customizing their loadouts and utilizing their Turn()s will be able to polish off encounters with grace, though the self imposed Limiters the game allows you to turn on add an additional challenge and wrinkles to enemy behaviors in exchange for more rewards for a victory.\n\nFrom top to bottom the game is meticulously crafted to engage with it's design, keep you gripped on the story and flesh out the world all in just a few hours time. Aiding this is the game's fantastic soundtrack and gorgeous visuals that leans towards an artsy utopia of sorts with a splash of clinical calculation. I'm entirely onboard with the aesthetics of the game. My one major warning is the story length since the game itself isn't exactly a long one, but it does feature a clean progression into a New Game Plus mode that has plenty more to do and see in it with remixed enemy placements and further customization of your skillset for a real test of your planning and wits.\n\nI can't recommend the game enough, and I've bought it so many times on different platforms and for my friends right here on Steam.

It feels like a bad mobile game. I literally have no idea what I am trying to do; what I am fighting for (if anything); and the story comes awkwardly and at a slow pace. It is also told backward; slowly revealing its purpose over time, and, again, taking away agency by having you not know what happened to your own character for seemingly no reason.\n\nMany people praise the music, but, again, all of what I heard was somewhat lo-fi, hipster, bluesy-stuff-sounds-cool music that doesn't lend itself to describing any action, story, or thematic elements at play aside from complimenting the game's cyber-art deco style. Not to mention, that the music devolves into droll humming while executing a turn-based move; making such moments feel punctuated with blandness and bore, rather then excitation and stimulation for being clever and creating impactful results. In fact, I don't even clearly know what the world of this game is supposed to be, as I was never given any description - so I can't tell if I'm in a computer or not, nor what the relevancy of an art deco style would have if I WERE in a computer.\n\nThe strategic element of this game is nice, albeit mostly composed of simple skills to utilize, and repetitive-feeling combat. Each encounter does not feel meaningful. \"NPCs\" - as they do not exist and interactable people, seemingly - are also useless, as they are ENTIRELY flavour text - there is nothing to do with them. The only thing that can be done is to \"use\" them in combat as a skill, which is interesting in concept, but hollow in execution.\n\nThe animation of the main character and cartoony style is stiff aside from bespoke animations, and cheapens the potential quality of a neo-noir-type/avant-garde-style that could have been served better with more a more mature design. Presentation can also look cheap with how cutscenes play out. Combat feels stiff and oblong; albeit with some occasional fluidity.\n\nLastly, the broken, stacatto dialogue, and pretentious voice acting is highly irritating. The way the sword describes the player's actions as if it is in control of the game also takes agency away from the player; sabotaging the meaning and significance of their actions as they're doing them... and the sword doesn't SHUT THE HELL UP! The droning, trying-to-sound-sexy-and-deep-and-mysterious quips and incessant, unrequested statements is INCREDIBLY grating. It sounds like dialogue made for girls that want to have a fantasy boyfriend that is there to keep them company while relying upon on them as they are helpless to help themselves. It's suffocatingly embarrassing... and harassing! I was listening to the sword quip as I was trying to read for over a MINUTE STRAIGHT while trying to read something in the same intermittent, incessant style; preventing me from concentrating on what I was even reading. It even talks as you are simply progressing through the game; feeling less like a partner, and more like a pest... which it is.\n\nTo me, this game screams female, Young Adult (YA) content that makes me cringe to partake in... not that there's anything wrong with that when done with maturity and better/proper delivery.\n\nA style-over-substance game, with *an* interesting idea (the turn-based combat). Would need a complete restructuring to become a good game with the same combat and artsyle in mind. If it had at least one outstanding quality, I would rate it higher, but it wouldn't let me find out with how little it gave me to hold on to at the start.\n\nDropped. 1/10", "timestamp_created": 1646286532, "timestamp_updated": 1646363353, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436507940292358398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111424667": {"recommendationid": "111424667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024630439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 973, "last_played": 1473547689}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVE IT", "timestamp_created": 1646281767, "timestamp_updated": 1646281767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111420002": {"recommendationid": "111420002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843680978", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2104, "last_played": 1644114525}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say...

It has quite unique style and gameplay, it it fun to play, but it lacks the only thing I adore in turn-based strategies - ability to [i]not rush[/i]. I'm not that good of the gamer, my reaction is probably below average and I'm pretty anxious most of the time, that's why time to think, to overlook the map, to create a strategy based on all the details is very important for me. And even if Transistor have its Turn() feature, it still leaves you with the constant fear of loss. If you die, you'll lose your heaviest function, what in my stile of playing practically means losing the battle at all. This game have only autosave, which is frustrating as well. At the moment of level-up you can choose only one function without any detailed explanation, and I still didn't get if you can get another one further, so you may be left with no use for new fuction just because it looks practically useless at this point of game. Turn() at one moment ends up and you are left to rush panically trying not to die.

I loved Hades \u2014 there were so many things I enjoyed about it. What impressed me the most about it though, was the attention to detail and level of polish the game had, as well as how much love and soul was poured into the game. When playing a game, you can feel almost immediately if it has a soul or not and... well, Hades had a lot of it. This is what got me interested in Supergiant in the first place.\n\nI picked up the rest of their games and decided to play them all. Transistor was next on my list. I didn't think it would be possible but I actually enjoyed Transistor even more than Hades. You can see the early influences of Hades in this game \u2014 most obviously in the isometric view but also in the combat moves (called functions in Transistor) as well as the enemies' combat moves.\n\nWhereas the ending of Hades feels somewhat open-ended, Transistor plays like a fully closed loop. In the case of this game, the scope of the game feels just right \u2014 not too ambitious nor lacking. What the devs wanted to achieve was perfect for the ultimate capability of the game itself. It's always very pleasing when this happens (rather than the writing team, etc. biting off more than they can chew).\n\nThe lore of this game is abstract, yet it is very easy to empathize with the characters. I am grateful to Supergiant for not attempting to explain every detail of the lore here, unlike in some franchises where the plot has gotten extremely convoluted to the point of nonsensical. The story in Transistor is perfectly intriguing. The characters are relatable. The predicament is understandable and does not contradict itself. The gameplay requires patience but is never boring. The combat is so unique and innovative.\n\nThis is a near perfect game. Having studied math and computer science in college, I loved all the mathematical allusions placed throughout the game. There are very few creative works which attempt to marry computational science with fiction, and do so in a believable way \u2014 most sci-fi requires extreme suspension of belief but the science in this game is sound. I really can't think of anything in this game I didn't like. Controlling Red felt clunky at times, but even that was justified since she's lugging around a huge sword the whole game.\n\nThe choice to make the protagonist female just elevates this game to legendary status in my eyes. I haven't tried the recursion yet, since I just binged the main storyline. I have little doubt that new game+ will be awesome though, along with the other two Supergiant games I have left to play.\n\nThere's even more I'd like to say but maybe next time.

I have it in my library and I might give it another try sooner or later. However, Transistor was quite the opposite, it caught me from the first musical notes when I pressed the play button, and the voice acting, visuals and gameplay kept me playing non-stop for over 5 hours. I have completed it 3 times in 4 days, last run took me only ~one hour to complete.\n\n\n[h1]Atmosphere, Visuals and Music[/h1]\nVisually speaking it is the type of game that you could make a beautiful wallpaper with every single screenshot you take.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2708849079\n\n It was clearly inspired by the works of art of Gustav Klimt and other Art nouveau artists, the obsession with gold leaf and divinized elegant womens is unmistakable.\n\nGiantgames managed to combine it with a (definetly not a Cyberpunk) brand new aesthetic to develope a genuine world that is closer to a painting than it is to a video game. Can we come to a consensus and call it CyberTransistor aesthetic? No? Ok.\n\nI didn't quite liked the music in general, but it fits the game in the good way and I loved the two main themes, which are perfect.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql8K3KJyWgY\n\n\n[h1]Plot overview (spoilers free)[/h1]\nI can't speak too much about it without giving some spoilers, since the plot is really simple on the surface and can be explained in two lines. However, I can say that it is a beautiful yet tragic love story between a singer that lost her voice and a boxer's voice that has lost his body in a world where everything that the majority votes for becomes the \"reality\" of that day.\n\nYou could try to find the real meaning hiding behind this game for hours, which is what I most liked about it, so I won't ruin it for you.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nI expected it to be a classic hack 'n slash game, which is ok,  but thanks to its \"Turn\" system where the next moves can be planned and with a considerable cooldown before you can use it again, it achieves a dynamism that makes it probably the most unique game of its kind.\n\nThe objective is simple, defeat the so-called \"Process\" which are the enemies.\n\nYou have 16 skills called \"Functions\" that you can combine however you want to create tons of different effects to suit your playstyle. Equipping the functions requires MEM, which is the equivalent of capacity.\n\nThere are also 10 debuffs that you can apply to strengthen the enemies while you gain more experience by defeating them, these are called \"Limiters\".\n\nHere you can see some of my favorite combinations that carried me through new game+. They worked even with all 10 Limiters activated at the same time. (You will have to remove a few to have enough MEM if you turn on the Limiter that drains MEM.)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2708836585\n\n\n[h1]World and Exploration[/h1]\nCloudbank is a linear city that has no collectibles or anything that can distract you from your main mission. It is a world that feels close to a Communist Matrix/Tron world, since the reality is designed by the votes of the people thanks to the Transistor as I mentioned.\n\nThe only thing that can distract you is a door that appears in certain places called \"Back Door\", which is a sandbox with, well... sand, literally. It is a beach where you can practice combos and overcome challenges to unlock new soundtracks and some achievements.\n\n\n[h1]Misc[/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*]The game can last approximately 8 hours in your first run.\n\n[*]It has replayability potential.\n\n[*]Achievements are fun and easy to accomplish.\n\n[*]It has New Game++.\n\n[*]You can use \"Humming and Flourish\" by holding down the LB and RB button respectively on your controller.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The lack of some quality of life characteristics to quick equip your builds or even save them.\n\n[*]Enemies in the Back Door Sandbox practice can't harm you, so you can't test healing Functions.\n\n[*]The Limiters doesn't complicate the combat at all, what they do is mess up your quality of life, which is not worth it for only an extra 32% of experience that has no real use when you get to Max Rank anyway.\n\n[*]Whenever your health bar is depleted you lose one of your Functions instead of dying, forcing you to play without that specific skill for some time, thankfully you can get back to your last save.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nTransistor is a game that requires testing dozens of different builds and investigating the effects of each one, if you like to experiment and try new things up, this game is for you.\n\nIt is a beautiful minimalistic short game with an unforgetable immersion and an emotive love story that might give you goosebumps and even make you cry at some points if you are immersed enough into the story.\n\nI had plenty of fun playing it multiple times and each time I was astonished by its visuals, gameplay and story, it is a game that has everything you will ever ask from a perfect game.\n\nIt may seem short, but each frame is like watching a different painting.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nYes, Highly recommendable.

The style of gameplay, while sometimes a little finicky with a controller, was fun and challenging in a way I hadn't experienced before in my somewhat short gaming career. I enjoyed learning about the backstories of the people who ended up in the Transistor, so much so that I didn't really mind having to switch up my load-out sometimes in order to gain that information. Halfway through the game, I was imagining myself occasionally booting up Transistor just to listen to Red hum along to songs while in her hammock. That's probably my favorite part of the game and I was really looking forward to doing that. \n\nBut on the other hand, this game falls prey to two tropes in the last two hours that honestly disappointed me and put an end to the dream of me playing this game again anytime soon. \n\nSo if you feel you can handle disappointment, give this game a try, but don't be surprised if it does in fact disappoint you.", "timestamp_created": 1643299793, "timestamp_updated": 1643299793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108882962": {"recommendationid": "108882962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196397928", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1643292458}, "language": "english", "review": "The whole game is obnoxious, pretentious, and boring.

Superb on all those counts.\nI'll address 2 problems that come up often with the red thumb reviews: the story/plot and combat.\n\nCombat is an easy issue to talk about. You're doing it wrong. There, problem solved.\nIf you're treating this game like your favorite hack-n-slash, ARPG, you will get rekt. Think of it more along the lines of a tactics game. One round goes to attacking, one to defense/evasion. The key is to think about which functions and combinations will give you the most efficient use of your turn. Put simply, \"git gud\".\n\nThe story is, by far, the weakest aspect of this game. Although it starts off intriguing, many things will be left unresolved, many questions will remain unanswered.\nIs Cloud City real? Virtual? A representation of computer mumbo-jumbo ala \"ReBoot\"?\nThe City is dying... so? Can't it just be rebuilt? Are these real lives and locales being erased? \nIs this the only city? The game talks about one other place, \"the Country\" and they reference it in the same manner your mom talked about your childhood dog going to \"a farm\". If other places exist, are they in danger?\n[spoiler]The population supposedly evacuates from the corruption, but a reporter makes it seem like they didn't get far or had no where to go. Are they alive? Did I screw them over by the definitive actions I take in the end? I take no effort to save or restore them or their home. If I could and didn't, that makes me the bad guy, doesn't it?[/spoiler] \nStakes and motivations are important, and it would make Transistor a \"great game\" instead of a \"great-looking game, but...\", especially if you, like me, are not the NG+ type. There's no real reason to return to this after the end because you've seen it all.\n\nEven questions you may have about the Transistor (your sword) are barely addressed, and the NPC that can give you insight, delivers his explanation when you aren't there and wraps up upon your return. Cheeky.\nSpeaking of, your sword talks non-stop and it won't be until about midgame that you'll find out if he's annoying your MC as much as he annoys you.\n\nNot every game needs a message, but I feel like this one could've benefited from a clear one. Cloud City is 100% democratic. The people vote on everything, including the sky color. The game paints this as idyllic, but there's still groups being unrepresented, rights needing advocacy, and crime/mysteries that need to be solved. So what you get is a pretty city that makes 51% of the people happy, but has no stability, structure or order \n\n[b][i][u]A NIGHTMARE.[/u][/i][/b] \n\n\"Did you need that bridge? Sorry, it was just voted out of existence. It's disappearance will eventually frustrate enough people and it'll be voted back into existence one day. When? [i]*shrugs*[/i] Just chill until it pops back sometime.\" Not sure the devs wanted me siding with the antagonists, but we're reaching extreme \"did nuffin wrong\" levels here. What exactly am I fighting to bring back?\n\nAll in all, this was a fun 6-8 hour game, and I do recommend it for what it does handle well.

The game is set in a beautiful pastel, hand drawn, [i]art nouveau[/i] inspired utopian megacity. While the city is empty of other people, the little details scattered around the world succeed in telling the story of how things were and how they are going to be due to the events of the game.\nThe stellar music contributes to the storytelling. The tone and lyrics contributes to narrating the story of the characters you meet and the feelings of the protagonist towards the world and the events. A second, focused listening is suggested to fully appreciate the carefully crafted narrative without the threat of enemies on the screen.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit more involved compared to Bastion, with two main new elements. \nFirst, attacks can be improved with multiple modifiers (instead of the couple alternative routes present in Bastion) chosen by the user and unlocked through the entire game. Straight skillshots, debuffs, modifiers, status effects can all be mixed and combined in many different variations. The loadout can only be changed between battles at specific points (frequent enough to not be a problem) without having to respec the entire progression.\nSecond, the real time isometric brawl can be transformed in a sort of turn based combat. Time can be frozen to plan several moves ahead, creating an alternating pattern of rushing enemies down and avoiding counterattacks while waiting for the next turn to attack. Again, the system is very free flow, and pretty much never boxes you in a single playstyle.\n\nI don't want to talk about the story too much because the way the game builds the world through decrypting character logs and interacting with the environment is fascinating and a very important part of the experience. I feel it left me with as many answers as questions, which may or may not be your cup of tea.\n\nJust long enough to not overstay its welcome, with a NG+ mode with tougher enemies and more skill combos, and a set of optional challenges.

In the artistic sense a very pretty game all around.\n- The combat is pretty unique. It mixes turn based with action rpg. \n- The option to combine skills to create a customized movelist is nice. That abilities get disabled for multiple encounters if you take too much damage is also interesting, forces you to get creative.\n\nCon: \n- The plot/story is weak. Characters are forgettable. I felt like it exists more as an excuse for art and metaphors than as a story to get engaged in. At the same time, much of the game is dedicated to the story - the narrator keeps talking over everything and the majority of explorable/interactable objects are only there for lore dumping.\n- Very short. 6 hours for a first playthrough. There are some optional combat challenges and a little bit of NG+ replayability, but it's not much.\n- Combat is lackluster. Attacking without the time freeze is bad since many enemies dodge automatically or blow you up faster than you can hit them. Meanwhile your own dodge skill is underpowered. I found that the stealth and charm skills are the way to go, since they let you safely wait until the freeze comes off cooldown. Once I had figured that out, I just used the same hit-and-run strategy for every encounter all the way to the end of the game.\n\nMy verdict is that Transistor isn't a good video game. I can forgive boring gameplay if the story is great and vice versa, but Transistor doesn't offer either. That it looks and sounds good is neat, but that alone doesn't make it worth playing.

I expected them to be a bit rough around the edges, but Transistor completely blew me away.\n\nIf you play Hades, you can see a bit of Transistor's influence on the game. Isometric view aside, both games have rich atmospheres with worlds dripping in lore and details that show a deep love for world building.\n\nThe combat is extremely unique, combining turn-based and real-time combat into an interesting middle-ground. The balance between the two is interesting, since you cannot participate in real-world combat for a short time after entering the turn-based style, forcing you to avoid enemies until your turn-based meter refills. However, do to the awkward aiming, this led to me largely relying on \"Turn()\" as it's called for my damage dealing.\n\nThe story and art are both absolutely stunning. What you see is what you will get, the entire game focuses on using light as a set piece instead of detailed graphics and effects.

Hey. Hey [i]You[/i]! Yeah [i]You[/i], the one with the face... Do [i]You[/i]...\n- like isometric action RPGs? \n- cherish easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master game mechanics? With a user-decided adaptive difficulty curve to boot?\n- enjoy exploring a different, colorful, and interesting world in the recent wake of a cataclysmic event?\n- feel drawn to morally-grey villains and cute-but-deadly scores of enemies that are too adorable to stay upset with?\n- appreciate getting to piece together original deep lore without being forcefully spoon-fed bland exposition?\n- want [i]Your[/i] ears to tingle as a charismatic voice keeps a silent protagonist company?\n- yearn to play a game with a soundtrack that's so good, you'll be trying to low-key share songs with non-gamer friends and family for years?\n   Then [i]You[/i] should play [strike]Bastion[/strike] [b][i]Transistor[/i][/b]!\n\n   In a 'nutshell' here's a bit of the story:\n   Cloudbank is a virtual utopia. Citizens democratically vote on everything, from the next big building project to what the weather is going to be. When the polls end, administrators execute the changes from behind the curtain.\n   Choice reigns in Cloudbank. Large changes occur daily. And \"when everything changes, nothing changes.\" That's the motto of the Camarata. They're interesting because they see Cloudbank as a dystopia.\n   Grant was an administrator. He executed changes voted by the majority. He also had to ignore his own opinions and feelings on the changes. This drained him to a point where he could no longer go forward.\n   Asher was frustrated with Cloudbank's shoddy historical records. When change is instant, and everyone lives in the present, historical records become impossible to maintain.\n   Royce was irked by the fact that everything could be changed on the whim of the majority. None of his designs were allowed to have any permanence, regardless of how much effort he put in them.\n   Grant, Asher, and Royce no longer wanted change to be a majority vote. They wanted change to happen when it was needed, not wanted. By using his supernerd math skills, Royce found his way to the Process, the entity/source-code used to shape and re-shape Cloudbank. As Royce further empowered the Process, he also worked on a way to control it - the Transistor (hey, that's the name of the game!)\n  The Transistor is the key to controlling the Process, therefore the key to low-key being God, at least in the virtual world Cloudbank is part of. And in order to be the best possible key, the Camarata decided that the Transistor required several Functions. Functions are obtained by... letting talented people be partially Processed... and then killing or absorbing them with the Transistor.\n   Cue Sybil, the last person to join the Camarata. As the social scout, she finds and approaches said talented people. And the Camarata abducts them...  And then kills them... And forever imprisons a part of their sentience... for the greater good of Cloudbank.\n   Red, the protagonist, is a talented singer. The Camarata want her Function. What ever could go wrong?\n\n   ...this is just the prelude of the game. Yeah, the story and writing are actually awesome! Going through the game also serves as some rich food for thought for anyone with a bit of a philosophy itch. \n   And it's not just the story that's awesome. In terms of visuals, the character design, Cloudbank's many stages, the cinematics, the UI, the HUD, the particles - awesome. In terms of audio, the voice acting, the music, the sounds - awesome. The variety of skill customization, and the way the user gets to set their own difficulty level - awesome.\n  [i]Supergiant[/i] put in a lot of attention to detail in order give us both a game and a one-of-a-kind work of art. While [i]Transistor[/i] is [i]Bastion's[/i] successor, it is not a sequel. It shows the growth that the devs at [i]Supergiant[/i] went through.\n\n   Lemme just quickly touch up on what I didn't enjoy that much - the combat. As soon as I unlocked a limiter I enabled it, and I do not recommend this. I did it for the XP boost and while level-ups always felt nice, the many fights did not. I went through the whole game and the recursion without finding a build I was perfectly comfortable with. Having Turn() off cooldown and being forced to run around is not fun. Spending 3 MEM to upgrade a Function with Jaunt() or to just equip it as an active or a passive also is not fun.\n   I found that Purge() upgraded with Crash() and Breach() let me spam a lot homing, long-range, stun-locking DoTs. However, it dealt almost no damage and the stun doesn't work on bosses and masked enemies.\n   I liked Void() upgraded with Bounce() and Get() but swapping out Bounce() for Crash() had better results overall. This is a great CC and debuff but it deals zero damage so I threw in a Load() passive whenever I could and just kept spamming until a packet spawned.\n   I tried out Cull() upgraded with Load() and Void() for good damage but found Tap() upgraded with Breach() and Void() to be more reliable overall.\n   Get() was a must-have as a passive for me though.\n   As I gained more Limiters and enemies got harder I found it harder and harder to use Turn(), so I stopped using it. Jaunt () and Ping () became a lot less important after that.\n   I found the boss fights to be more than just challenging in the Recursion with all 10 Limiters on. I'd advise against that.\n\n  [i]Transistor[/i] came out in 2014 and it neither looks nor feels its age. It doesn't suffer from outdated graphics or narrative or a done-to-death gimmick. It doesn't rely on community mods or a community patch for the best experience. It features minimal RNG and no grinding. It doesn't have expansions, DLCs, loot boxes, or micro-transactions. Even the achievements feel right...\n   Yeah, recommended. 5/5 cells, would review again!\n   [i]See you in the Country. --R[/i]\n\n*No Sea Monsters were hurt in the playthrough or reviewing of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1640569873, "timestamp_updated": 1640569923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719372570514678955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106591664": {"recommendationid": "106591664", "author": {"steamid": "76561199052550767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1640539565}, "language": "english", "review": "the visual, Story, gameplay, and soundtrack are amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1640539827, "timestamp_updated": 1640539827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106591504": {"recommendationid": "106591504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173464733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1641403975}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game nice graphics super worth it !!!", "timestamp_created": 1640539688, "timestamp_updated": 1640539688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511671483516693115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106567564": {"recommendationid": "106567564", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978428196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1671303581}, "language": "english", "review": "While everyone raves and talks about Hades - Transistor will always be my favourite Supergiant creation.", "timestamp_created": 1640517457, "timestamp_updated": 1640517457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106547442": {"recommendationid": "106547442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202463876", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1633885180}, "language": "english", "review": "The most boring top down game to date", "timestamp_created": 1640492500, "timestamp_updated": 1640492500, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438835740089416504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106531686": {"recommendationid": "106531686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047874595", "num_games_owned": 1389, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1640474289}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story, fantastic soundtrack, beautiful graphics and awesome mechanics.

When I call it art, I'm not implying in the expected sense of the game having achieved a level of greatness that transcends its genre; there are probably countless other games that have been made that provide as much, if not more, intellectually stimulating and emotionally hard-hitting experiences. Transistor truly stands out among the pack. It's uniqueness, from the combat system to the worldbuilding style and exposition, never failed to dazzle me at every turn. Supergiant Games have truly pulled through, putting in the care and effort to craft this truly superlative, creative, and bespoke experience. The fighting system was a breath of fresh air, both figuratively and literally; with a push of the right trigger button. I could catch my breath from the stakes and anxiety of the live combat, and carefully plan out my next course of action, whether it be evasive or offensive, or both, with the player's limitations still maintaining a sense of constant, underlying tension. The beautifully drawn \"rest\" areas provides the player with an option to escape to a paradise, a little corner of beach and wonderfully animated skies all to themselves to relax in-game, just sitting there immersing myself in its phenomenal soundtrack, to rest on a hammock and simply stare at the skies, with optional but accessible rooms below that provide a sandbox to test out the game's deep combat mechanics. The story and characters are intricately designed, giving life to the sorrowful emptiness of the game's world.

The combat might feel a little clunky or slow at first, but it becomes second nature as you continue to play, culminating in what has to be one of my favorite final boss fights in anything ever.

There IS a lot of lore hidden is descriptions and optional text, but these are largely about side characters and are overall unimportant if you just want to understand the general story. \nThe voice acting is on point, your main companion throughout the game talks constantly and for me at least it never got annoying, which is an impressive feat if you consider other games that have tried to do the same thing and failed miserably simply because in those games the voice acting was sub-par.\n\nThe visuals are breathtaking, the amount of times I stopped in my tracks just to absorb the magnificent shapes in colors displayed would be too many to count, my finger hovering over the screenshot button anytime a cutscene started playing. \n\nI absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is even remotely interested in indie games, and if you have ever only played AAA experiences then this is a fantastic choice for your first dive into the amazing world of indie gaming.

Tl;dr: story and soundtrack are on par with Bastion, even if the gameplay itself is not.\n\nThere are quite a few downsides to this game. It has limiters similar to Bastion's idols, which can be toggled on for extra challenge/XP at checkpoints, but they start to feel cheap at times (one of these limiters wrecks any functions you uninstall and renders them unuseable until the next checkpoint you configure your sword at, and another limiter causes enemies to drop cells on death that inflict damage onto you upon absorption, and it's hard to quickly tell the difference in the heat of the moment). It has a Turn function to let you freeze combat and queue up actions/functions with the threat of enemy bombardment minimised, which can also let you outrun enemies to get away or line up shots to hit them before they can evade, but the downside is that you're locked out of using any functions until your Turn() function has recharged, and enemies can move while you perform your attacks, meaning you might waste a Turn aiming and empty space because a Fetch moved an inch to the right. During combat your fight area is usually tiny as well with a border you can't escape, so you can't run far enough to be safe from enemies using the remainder of your Turn cooldown chasing you into a corner and shooting at you. Losing a full bar of health causes your sword to consume one of your (up to 4) active functions to refill your health, making the fight and subsequent game harder, as you can expect fights to get progressively challenging. I gave up on the game for a week when I got to the final boss fight, after facing several groups of cloaked enemies that remained invulnerable for 99% of the time, only showing an opportunity to strike for half a second at a time.\n\nI started to have fun with the game right at the end of my first playthrough, when I discovered effective builds to beat the final boss and generally survive Recursion (NG+) without having to call on Turn(), which as it turns out, becomes a crutch that slows you down if you keep relying on it beyond your first playthrough. The game's Steam Community Guides really saved me many headaches there. Not being distracted by the awfully-thought-out combat system meant that for my second playthrough, I could experience the story and music the way the developers intended, and I began to enjoy every minute of it.\n\nAs for the story itself, it's similar to Bastion. Person in dead/dying world, first order of business is trying to survive, and somewhere along the way, they [spoiler]find the power to shape their reality[/spoiler]. No point in sharing fan theories about the nature of the Process and Cloudbank here, but it's a fun read. It has a more mysterious, intriguing, and subtle atmosphere compared to Bastion which does help.\n\nBottom line, I think it's pretty fun IF you can manage to get past the very experimental-feeling combat system.", "timestamp_created": 1635046557, "timestamp_updated": 1635046557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596765339374542236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101526800": {"recommendationid": "101526800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021643308", "num_games_owned": 1296, "num_reviews": 291, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1635039999}, "language": "english", "review": "Sort of a \"turn based\" weird RPG.

Transistor plays like  a realtime w/pause tactics game. You get fucked pretty quickly if you don't use the queuing system well. It runs on a stamina meter of sorts that's drained based on your inputs. The game does a great job of letting you customize your moveset. It's very malleable, reminding me of the flexibility of the brawler Godhand. You can take a basic melee attack, and stack different modifiers, like damage over time, or an AOE effect that chains its damage to nearby foes. I do feel like the game is a bit on the easy side, such that once you find a favorite tactic, you can pretty much spam it for the rest of the game. Stacking on difficulty modifiers helps tremendously with this and encourages you to experiment with your inputs, as \"dying\" here means losing temporary access to a specific module. I had a much better time with the combat as I kept stacking these modifiers against myself and continually engaging with the new modifiers to find what worked best for my playstyle. In sum, if you don't care for the game's story whatsoever and are just interested in the combat, I think the game succeeds in providing a deep enough toolset to find new ways to change your play. I do wish the game's enemies not only had more personality, but had more moves that encouraged you to change your tactics. Considering you can equip a generous amount of inputs at one time, the enemies don't have enough moves themselves to force you to change your tactics all that much.  \n\nSpeaking of story, I really disliked that much of it is relegated to menu screens that unlock piecemeal as you change up your inputs. You never engage with a majority of the cast, so it was hard for me to give a fuck about any of it. At the very least, the connection between you (Red) and the Sword is well done. I thought it was a neat detail to have Red communicate with the Sword via the News Terminals, but I do wish there was more player choice there. \n\nThe game's aesthetics are strong. The artwork is easy on the eyes, the enemies are easy to read, and the game some cool \"travel\" cutscenes as well. I enjoyed the inclusion of the \"safe room\" where you can attempt unique combat exercises using specific inputs. In sum, I wish the combat was deeper, as all you really need to do is kite to win. I wish there were more enemies that could entrap you, or restrict the playspace. That said, I appreciate the unique combat experience.

I thought it might be boring, but I never tired of planning the actions and watching everything develop in accelerated frame rate, as in an action movie! Also, had some high adrenaline moments where enemies attacks were getting very close and I  needed a few more seconds to activate the turn planning and get out of a stick situation. Nonetheless, the game is quite forgiving on combat, as it takes a lot for your to actually fall, but you lose your attacks as you take more and more damage. This way it might be easier to brute force some combats (but not all), but, when you grasp the system and create some good combinations, it is a joy to plan combat and see how a seemingly hard enemy can be taken down easily. \nOne feature that might annoy players is that leveling up have you choosing your rewards, which means that, sometimes, you have to choose between two good abilities, or upgrading different capacities, both of which are very good. Anything not chosen at a time will be available on later levels, but it is unlikely to get them all in a single play through.\n\nThe art of the game is gorgeous: visual style, music and voice work, all top notch. \nThe world build was also very inspired. If you like some science fiction, there is a lot to enjoy there. Even unlocking all the profile info for the characters whose your powers is based on was a joy, as they were well written and intriguing. \nThe plot of the game is very good, but there is not a lot of hand holding. I mean, if you don follow closely, it might not make that much sense, with some events and motivations being implied and not stated. This is good writing for me, as the reader use his own thoughts to make sense of what happened. Having followed the stories of the people associated with each of your abilities also helps to paint the complete picture. \nAlthough the game was great, there low point for me are the enemies. The bosses were good, but there were a few of them. The regular enemies are nice, but there are little variation. Again, this is a small point on the overall quality of the game, it is not even bad, just not as memorable as the other highlights I had.\nAlso, the game is rather short, at least compared with time I spent on other Supergiant games. Nonetheless, given the mechanics and the story, I think it has a good duration, and more than this would risk adding boring times. There is an option of a new game plus, that might be good for people wanting more of the combat, challenge and/or hunt for achievements. I have not tried it, but might come back to this challenge mainly for experimenting the abilities I had not used and maybe try some additional limiters. Also, as the enemies are stronger, there could be some new ones, who knows?\n\nFinally, there are a ton of references to computing, specially for people used to terminal commands and networking, which I appreciated.\nOverall, a great game, keeping on par with the high standards of quality and innovation I came to expect from Supergiant.", "timestamp_created": 1633443578, "timestamp_updated": 1633444380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100410201": {"recommendationid": "100410201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028317360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1633230527}, "language": "english", "review": "AMMMAAAAZZZING.", "timestamp_created": 1633230589, "timestamp_updated": 1633230589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100405623": {"recommendationid": "100405623", "author": {"steamid": "76561199041486494", "num_games_owned": 1789, "num_reviews": 232, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1633223559}, "language": "english", "review": "Supergiant is overrated.", "timestamp_created": 1633223577, "timestamp_updated": 1633223577, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.268245220184326172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100359107": {"recommendationid": "100359107", "author": {"steamid": "76561199035562513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1594299769}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1633169986, "timestamp_updated": 1633169986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100343088": {"recommendationid": "100343088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405689348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1633146544}, "language": "english", "review": "I 10/10 recommend this game.

I absolutely love this game. Music, story, visuals. voice acting and combat are all top tier. At first i was put off by the turn-based combat but once i got used to it, i fell in love. Both Hades and Transistor are games i've completed 100% of and it's all thanks to Supergiant's amazing team. I'd say Transistor is my favorite of the three Supergiant games i've beaten. In terms of story and music anyways. I'd definitely recommend this if you like turn-based combat but honestly even if you aren't you should still give it a try. I first got it on the epic games store for free so i wasn't too interested in it but once i played hades and bastion and started loving Supergiant games, i found transistor again and bought it here. I'm a challenge lover so the tests in the sandbox and the recursion aka new game plus was really fun for me. the functions and limiters were also fun to mess around with and see how hard or easy you want the game to be. I also like the way death works in the game. instead of dying when you reach 0hp, you lose one of the three functions you have equipped. functions act as skills that you can use for combat and just to survive in general. so once you lose all three then you have to retry. it really puts the pressure on and makes you rethink your build and change up your style since you have one less skill. i was really enjoying changing up my build to learn more about the characters. that's another thing i like. they encourage you to change your build to learn lore like in hades. all i can say is give it a chance. 9/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1632689661, "timestamp_updated": 1632689661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99980976": {"recommendationid": "99980976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044070506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1632646376}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

We're not going to get away with this are we?\"\n\n[i]Transistor[/i] is a science fiction action role-playing video game developed and published by Supergiant Games.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nSet in futuristic Cloudbank you play as Red, a famous singer. Due to a series of unfortunate events, she ends up being attacked by The Process, robotic force controlled by a organization called Camerata, and ends up losing her voice. During the escape she aquires Transistor, a powerful and mysterious greatsword-like weapon which she uses to fight back and retrieve what has been taken from her, while learning more about events that occured, and her new powerful ally.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nSimilar to first Supergiants Games game [i]Bastion[/i], Transistor is played from an isometric point of view and is a linear title, with main difference being lack of option to replay areas you have already completed. Travel through a series of locations while battling The Process and improving along the way.\n\nMain part of the gameplay, combat, features Red and Transistor teaming up to take on their enemies using abilities called Functions. Those come in different shapes and sizes but being pain in the neck of the Process is their shared goal.\nMajority of them is nothing unusual, with melee, ranged, or area of effect attacks being mixed with options such as setting up traps or turning enemies into allies.\n\nGame contains both real-time combat where you can take Process head on, but after few areas you will realize it's not the best way to fight as you are outnumbered and overwhelmed, and a main focus of it, a turn based twist as Red can use Transistor to enter frozen planning mode called Turn(). In this mode time slows, Red hums, and your get to plan out your moves. Here you can create function combinations to deal massive damage or move away from danger and find a safe spot, depending on your current needs. Each action in Turn, from movement to function use costs action points, which will refill after you are done using said mode. While your points refill, you are defenseless so all you can do is find a cover and hope those few seconds can quickly pass. Game does contain an option of dodging, but it is a \"Not that good and needs to be unlocked first\" function.\nIf enemies hit you, you recive damage. Recive more than you can take and...continue to fight? When you lose a healthbar, instead of usual Game Over screen, game blocks you from using one of the functions you had in your loadout and restores your health. However if you will lose access to all functions you currently use, that will be the end, obviously.\n\nAfter done fight you reap the rewards, here them being experience points. Gathering enough xp levels you up, allowing you to unlock a new function, additional slot in Transistor, or a limiter.\nLimiters are similar to Idols from Bastion. They make your life tougher, but using them gives you XP bonus, allowing you to level up faster.\nWorth mentioning that as you level up and progress in the game, Process also improves, whether by adding new types of enemies, or pulling out better versions of previous ones with new abilities.\n\nOutside of combat you can find Access Points which serve as checkpoints and allow you to customize your loadout. Here you can go wild with all functions and slots you have unlocked, enable/disable limiters, or learn more about different characters from Cloudbank, if you will unlock such information.\n\nWhile you can use functions however you desire - by putting them as primary abilities you will use in combat, secondaries that can improve functions in primary slots, allowing you to upgrade powerful functions even further, or as passive bonuses - limitation comes in form of MEM. Every function uses specific amount of Memory, and you have a limited amount of it available. So besides having to think about which function you want in different slots, you have to look at the MEM count. Amount of MEM you can use can be increased, as a reward for leveling up.\n\nBesides access points, while exploring you can interract with few enviroment elements including terminals, stop by and listen to Red humming, or occasionally find doors to a peaceful location where you can train or challenge yourself in tests for xp and unlockable music tracks available to listen in-game!\n\n[b]Playtime, replayability and other modes[/b]\nIt took me 7 hours to beat Transistor, that is with spending time on function mixing and completing all tests possible during first playthrough, so you can drop that time to 6, even 5 hours if you will haste.\n\nGood news lies in Recursion Mode, which is a New Game+ where you keep your progress, while game from the start features every enemy you encountered before, plus unlocks further tests that were unavailable previously, adding a necessary replayability aspect to the game.\n\n[b]Pros and cons[/b]\nStrongest elements of Transistor are audiovisual design and combat.\n\nSoundtrack composed by Darren Korb and featuring lovely voice of Ashley Barrett is not only outstanding, adding personality and life to the game, but lyrical songs add a piece of storytelling as those are \"composed\" by Red, expressing her thoughts and memories through it as she can't do it herself in the game. \nOne of my personal favourites when it comes to soundtracks in video games. \n\nCharming soundtrack goes well with beautiful Cloudbank as walking through this futuristic city is a pleasure of it's own, and also is a factor in understanding the story and events that happen in the game.\nAnd when you can't enjoy the city due to Process, you can appreciate beating them!\nSheer amount of different combinations you can make from fight to fight will allow everyone to find preferable playstyle, and thanks to good progression system it's never overwhelming you. Game constantly wants you to experiment with functions and rewards it with more lore about the game, never putting too much pressure on a player during combat yet not going easy on you, making fights a fair challenge, with limiters adding difficulty for those who want it, plus constant addition and improvement of encountered enemies constantly force you to adapt. \n\nWhile far from being bad, storytelling is one of the more \"mixed\" points of Transistor, especially for those who might attempt to \"rush\" through the game. Tied to worldbuilding which some might miss out on, bittersweat ending that won't satisfy everyone and quite often game due to narrative leaves more questions than answers in specific topics. Personally I found it good enough, however I understand why some players will not enjoy it, as I found flaws in my second, slightly rushed playthrough.\n\n[b]Final words and conclusion[/b]\nDue to me being late as always and playing 2014 game..a bit later, quality of Supergiant Games titles is already known at this point, especially after Hades, which I also had the pleasure of recently dipping into it for more than few hours that I cloaked at the release, resulting in Supergiant Games really going up on my virtual, would-make-it-if-not-lazy list of favourite developers, proving how quality beats quantity and I cannot wait to get my hands on Pyre. \n\nTransistor proves that Bastion was no one-hit wonder. With wonderful audiovisual design, flexible combat and great progression system, this outstanding title can only be highly recommended! \n\nCheck out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page for more reviews!

I gave it a go for an hour a few years ago and decided I wasn't a fan. Came back to it recently and boy, I was wrong.\nTransistor is a gorgeous looking game, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. I think the main reason I wasn't invested in it initially was the gameplay, which I can only really describe as a hybrid of real-time and turn-based tactics planning. I really suck at these kinds of games, so I was losing fights quite a lot. However, I was finding that a lot of the losses came about from overuse of the limiter system, which increases the overall difficulty of encounters at the reward of a minor XP increase. Would definitely recommend for a first playthrough at least that you keep the limiters to a minimum unless you really want a challenge. \n\nAs you progress, you unlock more abilities to slot in and the level of customisation you get with these abilities is pretty absurd. It breaks down into primary, passives and upgrades and all of these can be used interchangably. Once you get a good combo that you like (Personally for me I really liked Jaunt() + Crash() + Breach() coupled with Void() and Tap()) it can give you a good leg-up over the harder encounters. Don't expect to be able to do everything in a single playthrough, but once you get to the end you can \"recurse\" i.e NG+ with your level and abilities carrying over so you can do it all again but properly equipped this time.\n\nThe story is a bit abstract, and as someone who doesn't focus too much on story I didn't quite get what was going on. So I was pretty stoic throughout the game, however the ending had me tearing up out of nowhere, and I'll recommend a game off that emotional factor alone!

It is also a side scrolling, checkpointed, tactical combat, cyberpunk action-adventure. Yes, you read that right.\n\nAn interesting but short story, the game feels a lot like a convention demo, it drops you almost directly into the action and worries about story telling later. You play as Red, a singer with a stolen voice that has, for reasons that are never quite explained, managed to acquire a weapon of extreme power that seems to have sucked out the soul of a guy that appears to have been stalking her. She then goes on a robot murder spree to end a threat that\u2019s never properly introduced for reasons we\u2019ll probably never know. \n\nBut anyway, onward!\n\nPros:\nThe game is beautiful, very well scored, and atmospheric. The music and art somehow blend the 20\u2019s noir and cyberpunk elements incredibly well.\nThe game has a lot of choice in terms of skill lay out, meaning a large number of play styles are catered for, it\u2019s just a matter of exploring and finding your own flavour of play.\nThe world building and little extras really give the game a nice well thought out feel. The \u2018back doors\u2019 provide a nice rest and some additional challenges, the little alcoves with extra information, the ability to see how others have played. These little isolated mechanics tie together nicely to help give the game a much needed feeling of depth.\n\nCons:\nThe skills are gated by level, and while there is a huge variety, once you find your First Order Optimal Strategy a huge chunk of the game is lost. It simply becomes a puzzle to see how much of the lore you can mine from the different slots they can occupy while maintaining efficiency.\nThe story is paper thin, as are the characters. There is a huge volume of room to manoeuvre though, if what is laid down as bones were fleshed out.  Thing is, this really does make the game forgettable at best and not really replayable, though the NG+ mode adds a splash of challenge in. \nThe game grows quite stale by the end. The above two con\u2019s add up to quite a repetitive and predictable experience. Everything you do and learn in the first 10 minutes underpins the entire 8 hour experience.\n\nSuggested improvements:\nThe game is full of good ideas, tight mechanics, and has a fun core gameplay loop. Keeping this fresh with limitations throughout, and not just in the challenge sections, could really help the game feel fresh the whole way through.\nThe game doesn\u2019t really have any challenge. At the time of writing I\u2019d just had my fill, about an hour and a half into the NG+ mode. Some better control over the limiters, perhaps with sliding values could have injected some excitement. \n\nOverall recommendation:\nThis game will take about 2-3 evenings to complete if you work full time. It\u2019s fun enough and short enough that it doesn\u2019t grow too old too quickly. It\u2019s pretty accessible and extremely forgiving, with combinations of skills that can make it even more so.\nThat said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the 15 quid asking price. If you see it in a bundle with other stuff you want? It\u2019ll add value for sure. If it goes on sale for less than 10 quid?

It's like opening a book which guides you along the path of a cyberpunk Armageddon.\n\nThe combat style is fantastic.  It is a format which challenges and rewards reflexes, pre-planning strategies, tactics, and experimentation.  It encourages you both [b]to slow down[/b] and [b]to act on instinct[/b], striking a healthy balance between agency and urgency.  It is this game's #1 draw to replayability.\n\nThe visual style is absolutely gorgeous.  It is so polished and thematically sound that it will slip under the radar until you stop to appreciate it.  Then, it blows up your senses with a feeling that this world has been building and evolving for years before your visit.  From the general UI, to the combat UI, to the environment, to the combat interface, to the particle effects:  the whole experience is an expertly polished treat.\n\nNearly every sound feels [spoiler]BARK![/spoiler] properly engineered and appropriate. [spoiler]I found it especially pleasing to open OVC terminals... such a rich and deep fanfare.[/spoiler]  The FX processing and dynamic musical elements are top-shelf.  While most battles do not pose a problem, insanely large battles, however, do seem to lack high-quantity-channel support.  It may be due to cross-compatibility issues or a lack of forward thinking, but this instance of channel-dropping is rare.\n\nThe star of the show, however, is the soundtrack.  It is, without a doubt, the thread which holds together the theme and feel of this game.  Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett (along with the programmers who [i]dynamically integrate the music[/i]) change what could have been only an \"adequate\" sensory experience into an [i]engaging journey[/i].  Listening to the soundtrack alone will not surpass the experience of the game and playing the game alone will not surpass the soundtrack.  I <3 this so much.\n\nThe story seems to fall short on some people, but there's enough in there to keep driving the narrative forward.  I wouldn't call this the strongest point of the game as it still seems to leave some questions unanswered and motivations unexplored.  I will say that the premise is intriguing and capably integrated into the experience enough to not totally fall apart on itself.  There's a fair bit of in-game reading involved for some of the backstory, as well as audio logs, but overall, the experience is well paced.\n\nThe achievements are not particularly in-depth, but there is a good logical progression to them.  I found myself actually achievement hunting (to 100%!--unusual for me) with this game because it was an excuse to continue enjoying the combat.  They offered a moderate challenge, as well.\n\nNot every game is going to sate every craving, so, here are some things I'd have like to have seen:\n-An \"endless\" mode where you could take on droves of ever-increasing-numbers of enemies in larger, more complex battlefields.  [spoiler]The in-game limiters are somewhat challenging, however, as some situations may result in a \"nearly infinite\" battle might take place.  Proceed with caution[/spoiler]\n-Longer story.  I wanted to see more of the city and meet more occupants.  It could have drawn out the combat, fleshed out some of the character motivations, and made it feel a little more like an RPG.\n-A little greater variety of enemies... maybe with some interactive or environmental dangers (like traps).\n\nI definitely recommend this game.  I've played through it twice and while editing this review, a third time.  Now, it's your Turn().\n\nEdit:  3 playthroughs now.  I just can't stay away.

An accomplished isometric brawler with a fun slo-mo tactical twist, the beautiful visuals and scintillating music you\u2019d expect from a Supergiant Games production, and an intriguing plot, Transistor contains all the ingredients for success. And yet. The difficult second album following Supergiant\u2019s lauded debut Bastion, Transistor perhaps tries to do too much, and succeeds only diffusely, never quite bringing it all together into a successful whole.\n\nMINOR SPOILERS AHEAD. You are Red, a famous singer, living in the post-scarcity utopia of Cloudbank. Your lover is now a sword (and it may be here that things become slightly difficult to follow), which has also stolen your voice, and the city is being absorbed and / or overrun by the Process, a sinister AI unleashed by the Camerata. The Camerata, you see, want\u2026 something? Probably power. Let\u2019s say they want power. And they hate Red, because\u2026 she\u2026 Well, anyway, the Process definitely is out of control, and its ultimate aim is\u2026 to turn everything into white cubes\u2026 because\u2026\n\nLook, you may call me a dolt for failing to understand what on earth is going on in Transistor. It\u2019s a plot-heavy campaign, with plenty of Logan Cunningham\u2019s top-notch whiskey-and-leather voiceover work as well as lengthy cutscenes and reams of text. But what it all adds up to, I couldn\u2019t tell you. Cloudbank is a novel setting for a video game, an upliftingly utopian science fiction reminiscent of Alistair Reynolds\u2019 Blue Remembered Earth, sadly under-utilised and quickly overrun by a fairly generic evil horde. Red\u2019s vocals are beautifully worked into the haunting soundtrack, and any game with a button that lets you hum along deserves at least three bonus points. But the wonderful individual artistic contributions are ultimately let down by Transistor\u2019s script, which feels both loose and verbose. Difficulties in establishing who Red is, what her relationship is to her talking sword mate (never named), and what either of them want, gives the first half of the game in particular the irritatingly abstract feel of a creative writing student\u2019s mid-term project. Development limitations, I imagine, cut Red off from ever actually meeting any of the game\u2019s sizeable cast, who have always just died, or just escaped, prior to her arrival. You only ever interact with the Process. It leaves the world feeling empty and unreal. SPOILERS END.\n\nCombat, at least, is fun, and workable with a keyboard and mouse. Your talking sword mate comes in handy for battering the Process, as well as firing off energy-bullets and lightning and whatnot. Better still, if things are getting hairy, you can enter slo-mo Transistor Time, called TURN() for reasons known only to the developers, which allows you to set up and execute a highly-satisfying series of attacks and manoeuvers. As you progress you\u2019ll acquire and set up powers, modifiers and buffs with names like JAUNT() and PING () and MASK (), using the weird premise of integrating dead personalities into your sword\u2019s suite of abilities. It\u2019s a highly customable, somewhat fiddly system that\u2019s perhaps a little too freeform, capable of concocting both broken and overpowered builds. But it does lead to plenty of variety in the game\u2019s many combat encounters, and lets you feel smart when you successfully design a custom build to overcome one of Transistor\u2019s fun optional challenge missions.\n\nOverall, Transistor offers satisfying combat, gorgeous visuals and music, and an incomprehensible plot. How much the latter affects your enjoyment will be a matter of personal taste. I\u2019d cautiously recommend this game to an interested player, but would happily suggest both its predecessor Bastion and successor Hades to be superior showcases for Supergiant\u2019s unquestionable talent.", "timestamp_created": 1630135528, "timestamp_updated": 1630135528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98354178": {"recommendationid": "98354178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025441701", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1194, "last_played": 1491183480}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, and it's soundtrack, stuck with me for a long time after I played it.

This is a unique game... Is it turn-based? It can be. Your choice. Does it have increasing difficulty? Again, that is your choice. This game is different in that for a game that isn't terribly long by itself, it truly is what you make of it with a combination of unusual game mechanics.\n\nThe game is based around a weapon called the Transistor that can stop time and absorb Functions left from things called traces. This transistor also is sentient and is the narrator for the game as you find out that your voice has been taken from you. As you level up, you can combine different Functions in one of three ways - base, upgrade or passive. Each time you use a Function in a different way, you learn more about the entity that spawned its trace (additional world lore). The same is true that you can unlock Limiters that will help you level up quicker at the cost of debuffs in each encounter. The balance between Limiters and Functions is what makes this game really interesting.\n\nSure you can play real time but your actions are slow and clunky. You can freeze time which will allow you to move quick and attack without issue... But the Process evolves. You will face enemies that can't take damage as they are masked. You are pushed out of your time stop because some enemies create disruption areas that knock you out of your Turn that you couldn't see because other enemies blinded you with a fog of war. There is a lot to this game but you learn quickly or else.\n\nPros:\n- Visually stunning and I purchased the soundtrack since it was worth every penny\n- Combination of Functions makes gameplay a unique style all your own with all the various combinations\n- Limiters increase the difficulty or challenge rating to a level of your choosing\n- Story is amazing and voice actors were great choices even though the game didn't really use facial animations\n- Trials in the hideout were enjoyable fairly difficult which made for a great test of skills\n- Replayability was a requirement for achievement hunting and to unlock new trials in the hangout area\nCons:\n- Final boss was weak unfortunately... It would've been better to have some minions each time you knocked him out\n- Nothing really new was introduced on replays...

Dazzlingly good art, top-notch voice acting and thoughtful audio design come together to paint a living world. \n\nThe action combat isn't the game's strongest aspect - yet, it's nothing to scoff at either. Transistor's movement and combat actions have aged well, feeling just as crisp now as they did over half a decade ago. The ability to pause, enter Turn() and plan your future actions is a solid twist on an otherwise fairly standard top down action game, creating interesting strategic opportunities for the player.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how much attention to detail was paid in the development of this game. In contrast to its digitized city setting, the game's story is told organically through its world through one-liner descriptions of the objects in the level, interactive terminals that poll passers-by on random topics, and the Transistor's ever-present narration of the events unfolding. While the narrative itself wasn't the most compelling for me, I absolutely loved how the game tried to communicate it to me through all these little details.\n\nTransistor still holds its own among the other isometric/top down action games released in the past two years, despite being seven years old.

The music ranges from catchy to deeply melancholic depending on the needs of the narrative and melding of real-time and turn-based combat from an isometric perspective is incredibly well done allowing for a lot of different strategies and truly compelling the player to experiment. However, Transistor is also example of the difference between writing lore and writing a story. The lore of Transistor is well-made. The city of Cloudbank, the villainous Camerata and all of the processed people whose stories you gradually uncover through using abilities are really cool. However, the story itself is not nearly as strong as the foundation it is built on. Red gets rare opportunities to communicate through the terminals, but is otherwise mostly given a personality through what other people think of her. Arguably, her actions speak to her personality, she is given the option to flee Cloudbank but doesn't, for example. But these moments are rare. The transistor itself, or the man Red can hear, does get a strong personality. He is protective over Red, somewhat conflict averse and somewhat restrained in his ability to showcase emotion (except when in his equivalent of being drunk). The issue for me is that the transistor mostly just responds to the environment and Red cannot speak. It gives opportunity for the player to really connect to these characters. And, most damningly, it makes the ending feel unearned. I will not spoil it here, but the ending left a rather sour taste in my mouth, it made Red even less of a person from my point of view. \n\nTo make a very long review shorter, Transistor is a great game with impressive visuals and strong sound design that could have used a bit more development in the story department to make it a true classic.

Every one of their games attempts to break the mold in their own unique way while still carrying those Supergiant signature design choices, and this game is certainly no exception. Transistor embodies Supergiant's unique visual and auditory style almost excessively. Every aspect of this game just bleeds a sense of aestheticism unique to Supergiant art direction, from the character design to the environments to the lore to the UI. At pretty much every point in the game you are looking at something overall aesthetically appealing. Of course, all the flash can't make up for the rather large drawbacks that make this game less well-rounded than their other titles or other polished games; but the unique combat and visual/audio style define this as a must-play title for any fans of [b][i]Supergiant[/i], cyberpunk settings, modular spell systems, turn-based combat, female-protagonists, good music/ambiance[/b], or just [b]indie classics[/b] in general.\n\n\n[h1][b]Pros: [/b][/h1]\n+ pervasive sense of [b]aestheticism[/b] can be seen in every visual element in the game\n+ fantastic [b]OST[/b] by Darren Korb feat. Ashley Barrett that the protag can hum along to at any point in the game\n+ [b]modular combat system[/b]. each ability has an active form, passive form, or can modify other active abilities qualitatively, making for a very diverse (albeit finitely so) set of builds. the player can also switch to a hybrid turn-based system on a cooldown.\n+ [b]maximization potential[/b]. there is a way to get maximum damage output and you are encouraged to achieve it, rather than it being artificially muddled by RNG or \"equally viable\" builds.\n\n\n[h1][b]Cons: [/b][/h1]\n- very [b]short[/b], and ironically [b]lacks replayability[/b] despite having a thematic focus on recursion. the story combat does not change and there is a limited number of combat challenges that are done when they are done, on an independent timeline of how often you complete the story. \n- [b]combat potential overshadows its necessity.[/b] this is the same problem Pokemon suffers: it created a much more expansive combat system than the actual game requires, creating this pervasive feeling of [i]\"I could be doing more.\"[/i]. easy and accessible shouldn't translate to [b]wasted potential[/b]. i think i spent more time in the ability customization screen than actually using those abilities.\n- [b]unsatisfactory writing[/b] / drawn-out storytelling with little payoff. the pacing of the story is definitely too slow for what it ultimately reveals, which isn't as noticeable until the second playthrough (which comes unfortunately quickly)\n- [b]deep lore has little draw.[/b] the character blurbs that get unlocked with the abilities are nice, but there is little connection between this fictional character that doesn't exist anymore and can't be interacted with to the ability it is connected to.\n\n\nIt's usually a very good sign when the only drawback of a game is that there isn't enough of it, but in this case the pervasive feeling of this game not having enough of itself for itself actually hampers the experience. I wanted to see more of the characters moving, more in-game use of the music and Red's voice, more intense combat challenges, and more interaction with the environment. There's so many diverse tilesets being used and yet not enough battles to use them for. They definitely could have drawn this game out with more of itself and it wouldn't even seem diluted like it would for a standard grindy JRPG. This game honestly feels like Supergiant had a very set idea for the look, setting, and combat but figured they'd fill in the story later. It's still a fantastic experience and one of my favorite games, but it doesn't pull itself together enough to be a well-rounded experience. \n\nVisuals: +++\nCombat: +++\nAudio: ++\nFeeling of Power: +\nFeeling of Significance: -\nStory: --\n\nOverall: [b][h1]B+[/h1][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1625675706, "timestamp_updated": 1625676423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95265546": {"recommendationid": "95265546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073019164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 957, "last_played": 1683759969}, "language": "english", "review": "Very entertaining and atmospheric game.

Really enjoyed finding all the optional dialogue and terminals. The voice acting is amazing, the guy who did the transistor managed to make me care about a literal sword which was great. My only hang up was that I didn't get super affected by many of the emotional punches it throws at you and I found (at least for my first play through) that the game was fairly competent but hasn't super challenged me ((yet) perhaps that's what the new-game plus is for). The enemy variety, although in reality fairly shallow, feels very intricate when playing because of the ways they work off each other, the environment, and your extremely malleable attack list. Though I was off put at first by how uncomfortble it was to use, I quickly got over this and had a great time. I really hope I see this sort of system shamlessly ripped in another game because I really feel it has a lot of potential.\nThe world building was effective. You really get a sense of the city through the areas you explore (and the terminals if you bother) but where it really shines is in the attack descriptions. God, each move is asocated with its own character and you learn more about them as you use it and they are all super unique and interesting three-paragraph little short stories that tell you a bit about the world. You really miss out if you don't take a look!\nThe story telling was not as predicable as I thought it might be. (Minor spoilers) It feels after the first hour or so that the game is going to follow a very liniar fight-through-area kill-boss repeat format, but pleasently surprised me. This also lead, however, to some stuff sort of seeming to go nowhere? You'll know when you see it.\nGod I nearly forgot to even mention the music! I actually learned about the game through seeing its sound track of Spotify. They made in universe pop songs for the character you play and its great! Only pop songs I'll ever enjoy. General music regarding combat and action is fitting as well, complements the weird style of combat great by being just as weird!\n\nCool game. Bought it on sale because I'm cheep, but would have payed full price.

Also, the inclusion of a button to hum along with the music, combined with all the viewing locations really allows you to take in scenery. I pushed that button in nearly every level.\n\nNow, I don't do well with games which required speed and quick reaction times. Luckily with the turn() mechanic that isn't an issue. If you want, you can play the a slow as you like. Only thing you have to do is run around frantically long enough for your turn to recharge. The gameplay itself is a lot of fun, requiring a fair amount of strategy.\n\nMy only criticism is that I got lost once or twice. It isn't always clear where you're supposed to go. Also, all the attacks being on number keys makes the controls somewhat unwieldy on a laptop, but I suppose those can be rebound.\n\nAnyway, play the game for the music alone.

It's moody and jazzy and cool, like if TRON were designed by Gustav Klimt. Every screen is just gorgeous, every track a treat.\nThe game also immediately confuses with its combat system, which seems at first like it should be a top-down action game like Ys or Zelda (or like the devs' previous game Bastion), but which turns out to be a very unique and hard to describe semi-turn-based RPG system like... well, like nothing else out there. Once you've wrapped your head around how it works, the system becomes incredibly fun and rewarding. As you progress through the game, obtaining more equipable attacks (which can also double as passive buffs or modifiers to other attacks), you'll find yourself experimenting and changing up your entire playstyle as you go along, recombining your mix of skills and passives to suit the situation at hand. It's great stuff, and one of the only games that really made me try to get every achievement. It feels great discovering all the possibilities the battle system offers!\n\nThe weak point of the game is its story and characters, which are both overly morose and unclear. The ideas the game hints at are pretty good, but it never really does anything interesting with them. On top of this, the way the game uses its voice acting, dialogue and tone to try and make you get invested in a world you never really get to know or in a central relationship between two people who you never learn anything meaningful about, feels forced and manipulative. The game wants you to FEEL, by giving you something that looks and sounds emotional, but is ultimately a bit hollow. \n\nOverall, it's a mechanically unique artwork of a game, even with the unsatifying story.

It has a few framerate issues, mostly due to the game using it's own graphics engine (separate from DirectX or OpenGL -- I'm assuming since I couldn't get SweetFX installed or anything). It doesn't have any options but resolution either, sadly, but the framerate only really gets so bad when you're pretty much at the last hour or so of the game.\n\n I definitely liked the small touches, being able to hum to any background song (and that playing through Turn() segments), the Limiters were a fun challenge though some of the Tests were a bit unfun. This game manages to make even inspecting things fun, the small added details when you get close to something you can interact with -- from how many times you kicked a beach ball to random access codes. The Terminals are also a nice touch, I didn't exactly catch it the first time around but by the second Terminal I realised she was using it to communicate -- a really small detail that was also noteworthy.\n\n The story is something I'm not going to mention too much, it gives a lot of hints earlier on so you can kinda guess -- but I didn't see the particular ending coming myself. And it was an emotional moment.\n I'm not exactly sure when I bought this game, or even how it got into my Steam Library, but I'd recommend it if people haven't tried it yet. Even if it doesn't exactly start strong, it's worth getting through it to see the rest of the game.

The ability to mix and match every single function was also really interesting and fun to play around with. But I was a little disappointed with some aspects of the story and gameplay. \n\nSpecifically: [spoiler] I didn't like that the game encourages you to recurse through the story (with unfinished achievements & character profiles, the empty top branch of the tree in the sandbox, plus the fact that the story seemed like it had room for more), and then the story in the second playthrough is the exact same. Especially with Royce's voice instead of the narrator's voice at the beginning, I was really thinking that was a teaser for a different or expanded version of the story in the second run, but nope. \n\nI also didn't like some of the limiters. I know they're optional but I feel like they're supposed to make the game more challenging, and some of them were just plain annoying and/or seemed to contradict the essence of Transistor gameplay and what makes it fun. \n\nThere was another review that mentioned the turn-based system can be awkward since in between turns you're basically just running for dear life, and that's true. There are ways you can start to work with it like using Jaunt on active and upgrading it with damage-dealing functions, but besides that it can get a bit awkward. \n\nThe Sandbox area felt kind of empty and detached from everything else. The music player was neat but I didn't really use it much because there isn't anything to do on the little island except run around and bounce the ball, so I didn't find myself sticking around there for long anyway. It'd be cool if the area had more purpose/meaning. [/spoiler] \n\nThose are most of my issues with the game. The art & music are phenomenal, but my disappointment I had mentioned above with the story left a bad impression for me: I initially wrote a negative review before taking it down to write this one instead.

However, if you're familiar with the genre already, I think you'll find this game boring. If you have played Bastion (their first published game), it doesn't automatically mean that you'll enjoy this one, since the settings and gameplay are quite different. Now some details:\n\nThe story: Content wise it's nothing special or new, though the setting makes it enjoyable and entertaining for sure. But in general the stories in games suffer a lack of substance, so I suppose this isn't a particularly weak point for this game. I suppose for a kid the story would still be interesting. But for someone who is fairly well-read, these stories are just regurgitated material from age old themes, repackaged and watered down.  \n\nSetting: The theme is sci-fi with a touch of romance. I think the screenshots and trailer do a better job at telling you about this than mere words.\n\nCombat: Realtime with pause. Nothing new. Although I appreciate the streamlining, which allows for a very smooth gamepad experience. It does get repetitive at times, and at times I find myself playing only because I'm trying to finish the game, rather than enjoying the gameplay. \n\nCharacter skill system: Quite simple. You have a fixed set of skills that you can use and combine for certain effects. However, some skills and combinations are obviously far more useful than others. It's not balanced, and in particular, it's not designed to be played with your custom style. But then again, this isn't a substantial RPG in any way. So don't expect it to give you that. \n\nGeneral system: the waypoint system is often just tedious. It doesn't add anything other than acting against the very streamlining of the game, which is supposed to be the appeal of this game. It's a short game, no need to be pretentious with the fake sophistry. \n\nVisuals: The best part about this game. The art style suits the game well, But this is subjective. In general, I like the studio's visual choices. \n\nMusic: All right, nothing special. You might like it though if you're not a fanatic about music. \n\nReplayability: None. As I said, you'll find it already repetitive on the first play through.\n\nAchievements: Grind fest. If you're a completionist, you won't enjoy this game. As I have already noted, the game has no replayability. I find games that have poor replayability yet makes you replay the game for achievements obnoxious. For this reason alone I would thumbs down the game. However, that's not to say I wouldn't recommend it to those who don't care about Steam achievements. \n\nFinal verdict: Short casual gamepad game with a smooth and enjoyable gameplay, though quite flawed in many aspects.The lack of replayability and the requirement of grinding for achievements is disgusting, but beside the point.", "timestamp_created": 1620937054, "timestamp_updated": 1621122311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91943016": {"recommendationid": "91943016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060548426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1579289081}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10", "timestamp_created": 1620932589, "timestamp_updated": 1683429723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91942566": {"recommendationid": "91942566", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993765610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 176, "last_played": 1497771405}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just one of these games, you will remember for the rest of your life.", "timestamp_created": 1620931989, "timestamp_updated": 1620931989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91869382": {"recommendationid": "91869382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019700712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1515903218}, "language": "english", "review": "play it", "timestamp_created": 1620817880, "timestamp_updated": 1620817880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91867751": {"recommendationid": "91867751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372421801", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 250, "playtime_forever": 1882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1397, "last_played": 1621783691}, "language": "english", "review": "Red shows us, how strong, wild, sad, and beautiful, mutual love can be.", "timestamp_created": 1620814895, "timestamp_updated": 1620850167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697948038578033447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91853950": {"recommendationid": "91853950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130654911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 935, "last_played": 1458913894}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite of the Supergiant trilogy.

Lately when talking about different styles of games, I've used Supergiant as the example for \"Having a self contained video game experience\", where you play a game for 6-8 hours, finish it, and then think about and remember what you've experienced. It's a rare experience in the video game industry actually.\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] You start the game being dropped right into the middle of the story. You've got this talking-green-sword-thing called the \"transistor\", and you play as a mute-lady named \"Red\", who used to be a singer but has had her voice stolen.\n\nThere's a lot of open-endedness left to the player's interpretation actually... it all takes place in a futuristic sci-fi city which is slowly being corrupted by something known as the \"Process\".\n\nHonestly the less you know about the story going into Transistor the more you'll probably enjoy it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2476386495\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay is unique. You unlock moves known as \"Functions\" which seem to reference programming, like Crash(), Breach(), etc. Those functions can be used in three different ways: As an active attack/ability, as an upgrade to another active-function (thereby giving it a unique upgrade), or as a passive upgrade to your character.\n\nThe interesting part about Transistors gameplay is mixing and matching different Functions. One of my favorites to use early on was Spark() as active, and upgraded with Crash() and Breach().\nThe idea is: You learn what a Function does, and then apply it to another function to make creative combo moves together. It took me several hours to get the hang of it, and even then once a new function was added I was slow to actually learn the new function.\n\nBy the end of the game you should have a pretty solid idea what you're doing, but even then you have a New Game + feature where you can replay while retaining your levels and unlocked moves.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2477399170\n\nThere's one more key gameplay mechanic which deserves recognition, at any point during combat you can take a \"Turn()\", which essentially pauses the game, and lets you map out a sequence of limited functions.\n\nSometimes I could get through a fight without using Turn(), because once you finish your turn you're vulnerable and can't attack until a cool down finishes where you can take a turn again.\n\nIt might sound kind of weird, and it definitely was another learning curve for me, but all of these little differences are what created an unforgettable video game experience.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Speaking of unforgettable experience. How about that ending? Someone came into my apartment and chopped a truck full of onions.\n\nAgain, Supergiant Games is one of my all time favorite developers because their games are so creative and inspiring. The visuals in Transistor are stunning and colorful. The Music itself is worth the purchase; I'd be tempted to just let the game idle to use my computer as a jukebox.\n\nBastion, Pyre, Transistor, each one fantastic and worth checking out and playing on any platform you prefer... There remains but one Supergiant game I haven't played yet: Hades.

The pacing is outrageously awkward, and I find myself enjoying the simple exploration far more than the actual *game*.\n\nJust go play Bastion or Hades, they're better games.", "timestamp_created": 1619756783, "timestamp_updated": 1619756783, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91143473": {"recommendationid": "91143473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042167799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1735, "last_played": 1619740185}, "language": "english", "review": "Stunning game.

Below is my Steam Review for Transistor, thanks for reading as I wish you well in all your gaming adventures...\n\nSTORY/LORE - 9/10\n\nThe story hooks you right in when it comes to Transistor and it\u2019s something that develops as you progress through the game. I wish there was a bit more of an expanded tutorial at first as the game can get a bit complicated in the beginning but you\u2019ll pick things up after the first few levels. The overall story between Red, the Transistor, and the various enemies/bosses you\u2019ll face is brilliantly done. \n\nTransistor is one of those games that you\u2019ll never forget after you finish, it\u2019s that epic. Also, please keep in mind, this is a very short game and one you can probably beat over a long night of gaming or during a weekend.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 9/10\n\nOnce you get used to all the different abilities and general gameplay of what Transistor is all about, it ends up being pretty fun. The way you can mix and match main abilities with other abilities is very well done which opens up a lot of replayability. Timing is everything and being able to pause time to deliver whatever attacks and combos you want is fun once you get the hang of it.\n\nYou can replay this game in various different ways and have a completely new experience depending on what you want to try out each time. There are a ton of combinations to use based on your playstyle and that\u2019s another great aspect of Transistor to try and beat the game in other ways. It\u2019s also a lot of fun mixing and matching different abilities if you\u2019re into doing multiple playthroughs of Transistor.\n\nGRAPHICS - 10/10\n\nThe graphics of Transistor are absolutely amazing! Considering this game was made back in 2014, it still holds up incredibly well to this very day. Seeing all the innovatively designed levels and areas in the game and how fluid everything was truly makes Transistor shine.\n \nIt\u2019s also pretty visually amazing when you hold TAB and see Red humming in all these different levels which amplifies the lighting, music, and tone. Supergiant Games know how to make beautiful looking video games, I can tell you that after playing Bastion and working through their other titles.\n\nSOUNDTRACK - 10/10\n\nThe overall soundtrack of Transistor truly makes it stand out and has become a staple these days of Supergiant Games. It reminds me of being in a local Manhattan cafe in New York City where you sit back and enjoy some incredible music that touches on many awesome genres. \n\nEach level has a unique soundtrack to it and there even is a level where you can change up the music to listen as you go through various challenges. It\u2019s just all really well done and undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression once you beat it.\n\nMULTIPLAYER - N/A\n\nThere is no multiplayer aspect to Transistor as it\u2019s not really needed. This is a single player game as there is no point to add multiplayer. If anything, after you beat the game, you can replay the game again with the abilities you\u2019ve earned in your first playthrough. You can continue leveling up, earn more abilities, and more in the Recurse mode.\n\nFINAL SCORE - 9/10\n\nOverall, Transistor is a great game. It\u2019s short, sweet, and to the point. The graphics are amazing and the soundtrack truly adds a uniqueness in the game that you\u2019ll remember for years to come. The story is a fantastic one and without getting into too many details to ruin anything, will be one that you\u2019ll enjoy as you continue playing.\n\nThere is some good replayability to Transistor if you want to get multiple playthroughs in for more Steam Achievements to experience the game using more combinations of abilities. Transistor is a unique sci-fi kind of game that is just one of those \u201cmust play\u201d titles you need to experience at least once in your gaming life. What are you waiting for?

It's been languishing on my pile of shame for years and I only decided to finally pick it up after being impressed by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/recommended/1145360/]Hades[/url]. Best decision of the month. This is like a holotype of what indie games should aspire to be. The skill system is complex, with a lot of choices to make but it's entirely logical and it doesn't feel like there are \"wrong\" combinations. Combat is an ingenious mix of realtime and pre-planned (think VATS in the more recent Fallouts). Difficulty level is not adjustable but it isn't terribly difficult, especially once you find some skill combinations that work well for you. This is not a game to rush through. Take in the sights, the sounds, the VR-noir ambiance. Let its atmosphere - its greatest [i]forte[/i] - take root in you. Appreciate the detailing of news console interfaces, stop and hum a tune (there's a dedicated button for that), lay on a hammock and admire a sunset which may or may not exist. In my opinion this atmosphere is more important, more central to experiencing the game than the action-gameplay proper itself.  Art direction, writing and voice acting are all top notch. The main story is relatively short so normally a value-minded person such as myself would frown, but this warrants an exception. Wait for a sale if you must, but do try it.

An odd synthesis of active time battle and isometric combat to allow for a combat style that rewards creative combining of skills, well spaced execution, and careful planning based on opponent health and buffs/debuffs that can be applied. As you complete the game and have skills stack on top of each other it allows for some interesting combinations with the duplicates to come in and gives you at least another fun round during NG+. Limiter system allows for an extra level of challenge during NG+ or those looking to make the game difficult but after you get a comfortable combo of functions you get into a somewhat comfortable gameplay loop and things become a bit more mindless but it's at least an enjoyable loop that doesn't feel like it dries out too long. \n\nArt is quite lovely; Art Deco inspired backdrops and character art give the city a sort of steampunk vibe and some rich colors that somehow feel oppressed by the white and red of the Process. However, the budget of this game cannot be denied and although the voice acting, music, and the sprite work are top notch, you can feel that limitation in the cutscenes. Is it a weird pace when a jpeg with some effects comes into play, a bit, does it come up often enough that it's a deal breaker, nah. \n\nI'd also have to knock it for its storytelling, the game chooses a more environmental storytelling feature relying on terminals, character bios, and some story beats to build the city, the antagonists, and the existential nightmare of The Process into place; but I feel these could have used a lot more fleshing out. I still can't tell you specific details of the Camarata's motives or how the Transistor works. It's a blemish but quite honestly the good really outweighs the bad here and I recommend you pick this game up if it's on sale.

The soundtrack encompasses a variety of moody cyberpunk tones as well as more lighthearted, upbeat tracks, and the detailed artwork mixes perfectly with the sound design to make for a consistently atmospheric experience.\n\nThe odd, yet exciting narrative has the dramatic undertones of an emotional love story and the style of a streamlined action game. And as a side note about the story: I love the symbolism of Red's voice and how it ties into both the game's artistic direction (with the soundtrack and narration) and the subtle, yet effective message about political corruption and the voice of the people.\n\n[h3]Transistor is every bit as unique mechanically as it is artistically.[/h3]\nThe combat is built around the Turn() mechanic, which combines real-time action with time slowdown segments reminiscent of turn-based combat. It's strategic, streamlined, and satisfying, with very little waiting or guesswork.\n\nThe game also has a unique \"Function\" system where any unlocked ability can be used actively in combat, as an upgrade to another ability, or passively to grant boosts to the player. (Notes about ingame characters are tied to these Functions, and these notes are unlocked as different functions are used - encouraging the player to experiment with their loadout.)\n\nPlus, Transistor has some fantastic balancing mechanics for its combat that I haven't seen in other games of its kind. For example - losing all your health doesn't instantly kill the player and send them back to the last checkpoint - rather, it overloads and disables the player's most upgraded ability, which decreases the pool of available functions for a short time.\n\n[h3]Overall...[/h3]\nThere isn't much for me to criticize about Transistor. The linear design is sometimes brought off track by less important story beats (like the OVC terminals that don't really do anything). The enemy design for the main \"Process\" robots that are fought throughout the game are relatively unimpressive compared to the artwork and sprites for everything else. And the narration, while well-acted and vital to the story, goes off on some unnecessary tangents.  But overall, I think Transistor is a fantastic action RPG that's every bit as emotionally moving as it is streamlined and fun. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1616505187, "timestamp_updated": 1684607221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88918539": {"recommendationid": "88918539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165752208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1616460883}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game a few years back and just decided to play the game on a weekend.

Transistor is the weakest Supergiant's game, both gameplay-wise and story-wise.\n\nThe story lacks something I can't even describe. It's not resonating on a subconscious level. It feels like a generic bittersweet love story that wanted to be something more than that. But it fails, fails hard. Mostly because we don't get much feedback from Red, she's mute and can only hum. And all the conversations we have with Transistor (the guy) are at terminals. All the other times you listen to monologues and it's hard to get Red's perspective like it's not even her story. Maybe that was intentional and Red is not a protagonist, but the guy lacks something too. He's just too distant to feel something for him. It feels like Transistor has no protagonist at all, it's just a story, somewhere about someone.\n\nThe gameplay is bleak. It tries to be a tactical game, but there are too many missing pieces. I bet it was fun on paper, and the skill system is definitely an interesting concept: it was nice to create some interesting builds and try them out. But...there are a few types of enemies to experiment with. If you are playing NG+ you'll face even less diversity, they all be at their max level and there will be no way to spice their movesets even for a bit. They had the same problem in Bastion, but they had rapid gameplay and it wasn't so noticeable.\n\nOf course, the game has a great soundtrack and art, but it's not enough to make a good game.

Out of the gate, the atmosphere is really top notch. \n\nAbout a couple hours in, you've seen the whole game. Every setting looks and feels the same. The colors never change. Enemies and combat get repetitive and laborious. The story is impenetrable, pretentious, over-serious and detached. It sounds like it was written by a 14-year-old who writes lots of poetry.

From rugged, wild west inspired setting and action RPG, to slick, urban aesthetic and gameplay style is a unique mix of real-time combat with pause and action RPG. But did it manage to best Bastion?\n\nThe presentation is striking visually,with fantastic artworks and art direction by Jen Zee. All characters have fantastic designs and stand out from another easily. The urban setting has a jazzy, sleek look to it and fits the atmosphere perfectly. It's a clear step up from Bastion with its simple art style. Audio-wise, the soundtrack was made to reflect visuals, with more\nelectronic music as well as more vocal tracks, such as \"Paper Boats\" or \"We All Become\". This time around it's the sound that's less to my taste, especially the combat music is much weaker. Logan was reduced to smaller role this time around, while still good, it's not as good as The Narrator in Bastion.\n\nThis time, Logan voices The Transistor, or rather, the lover of Red trapped inside the titular sword. After one of her musical performances, Red was attacked and barely escaped alive thanks to her lover. You play as Red, going after the people who made attempt at her life, making it clear she wasn't the first person that was targeted this way and getting mixed in the fate of the City. Story itself is more abstract, more metaphorical than Bastion and it deals with the dangers of democracy in ultimately humane way. And it's more of a downer, really, not reaching the heights of Bastion.\n\nGameplay is where it gets truly unique. Your sword Transistor supports 4 functions, which can be further modified with other functions to amplify or change how they work. How many functions you can have at once is limited by the Memory stat, which you gain as you level up. You can play the combat in real-time, but it's rather clunky and far from optimal. Then you also have the \"Turn phase\", which allows you to plan your actions in quick succession, allowing for much more damage. \n\nBut the issue is, after using your turn, you can't attack or use your abilities other than invisibility and similar. So you get this weird gap in the flow, where all you can do is just run around, waiting for turn bar to refill, allowing you to use turn or attack in real time again. Which is the crux of the issue, that while this sounds interesting, it's interesting only on paper. It's not so much fun to play. This weird gameplay flow gets tiring even before you finish the game, and that should take you 3 or 4 hours. That might be partially caused by the levels all looking almost identical, it looks good, but blends together.\n\nBottom line is, that while Transistor is still a good(/decent) game and has some fresh ideas, the execution in certainly lacking in some aspects. It's clear though that developers do clearly care and are passionate about making games, as well as the game having higher budget, but I don't think this one panned out that well.\nNonetheless, I think it's still worth playing if for nothing else than for trying to do something different.

The singing of the main character is more like a haunting hum and that was a cherry on top. The artwork in this game is just gorgeous and I really enjoyed every minute.\n\nThe game-play is equally fluid as it is chaotic. I wasn't sure I would enjoy it after watching some videos but I really thoroughly did. It allowed me to make the decision to play a semi-turn-base or go real time or (most often) mix the two to fit my play style. The twists in the story and the added nodes of self-inflicted difficulty added to the fun. The abilities are very enjoyable to use and customize. I like minion/pet builds so getting a Charm and Minion ability was excellent, and finding ways to use them to their full potential with extra abilities was really enjoyable for me.\n\nI will be buying more of these games in the future.

All it has going for it is some nice songs.\n\nAttempting to mesh hack-and-slash gameplay with turn based strategy is a concept that might work. But it doesn't here, first and foremost because using the pause function to plan your next move stops you from instantly returning to the realtime action because your abilities are prevented from working for a cooldown. Meanwhile, you lack any good mobility. Balance and difficulty aside, this creates a very disjointed flow.\n\nThe various abilities you can unlock don't feel like they do anything to help your options - everything feels very similar as you just try to optimise your damage during the frozen time, before helplessly running from whatever enemies remain. You don't have to worry about being damaged during the turn, so basically the game can't help but be easy. There are some extra mechanics to think about, but overall nothing that impacts gameplay significantly. Also, some abilities don't always meet their planned mark because enemies move slightly, almost unpredictably, when you execute your turn.\n\nFinally, the story is some generic edgy dystopian ASMR clown festival. Kind of appealing sounding, but it's just slow and obvious and it really needed more world development to make the ending anywhere close to even acceptable, let alone good. Then again, for a 4-5 hour main line, what it managed to do story-wise is pretty impressive.\n\nAnd it looks decent, and sounds even better.

A great game by any metric, with most of my complaints being that I just wish there was more. I have it pegged as slightly worse than Bastion right now, but I still think it's absolutely worth playing. Gorgeous game.\n\nInteresting world; just wish we saw more of it. Great story, if hard to follow at first. Wish there was more exposition / world building. As with Bastion, it hits its climax quite well and you get very invested. \n\nGameplay has a lot of variety, but I could never get it to be challenging. Somewhat repetitive if you choose to use the same skills/spells in every fight; need to go out of your way to explore more options. Game was quite short, which is a shame because there's so much about the world I want to know. In the 7 or so hours it takes to beat the game, even if you experiment a ton, you won't feel like you've scratched the surface on all the combinations of spells your character can do. Which is cool in one way (lot of depth), but sad because the game didn't last long enough for you to see it. But you can also win quite easily with just about anything (I died maybe 5 times the whole game? And I had every Limiter available on at all times) so it feels like maybe the depth is pointless? Enemies are varied, but never in such a way that you have to actually have the right load-out to beat them; there isn't much strategy outside of fights.\n\nVisuals and music were beautiful, as expected of SuperGiant. Love it.\n\nCan't wait to play Pyre and then Hades. These guys are exceptional at what they do, and a true inspiration.

In my [b]Bastion[/b] review I've already explained why these guys are my most favorite video game developers in the entire world. Feel free to check it for more details, but long story short, these people? They treat their games like an art. So, what we get from them is... absolutely unique and beautiful. Every single time it's a unique experience. The one that stays with you. Forever. An experience that includes some unique gameplay elements, godlike narration, fantastic music and the atmosphere that can and [i]will[/i] make you cry from how beautiful and sad it is. So... yeah. Here's their second game. And it's called [b]Transistor[/b].\n\n[b]Supergiant[/b]'s first project, [b]Bastion[/b], turned out to be a big success. It wasn't the biggest or most complicated game out there. But when people dived into the dreamlike world of ruined [b]Caelondia[/b]? [b]Logan Cunningham[/b]'s narration and [b]Darren Korb[/b]'s soundtrack instantly swept them away. And when you \u201cwoke up\u201d from that beautiful dream? You were like \u201cThat... was... [i]awesome![/i] I want more!\u201d. But here's a thing about [b]Supergiant[/b] \u2013 they don't do sequels. Or prequels. Or spin-offs. Every one of their games is complete piece of art. So, first thing first, [i]do not[/i] expect [b]Bastion 2[/b] here. Even though ruined city of [b]Cloudbank[/b] do feel a little bit like [b]Caelondia[/b] and you sure will notice some similar motifs here, it's a completely different game. But obviously, gameplay is not the most important thing here. It's pretty awesome, but we'll return to it a little bit later. First, I want to talk about the most important thing in every [b]Supergiants[/b]' game \u2013 the atmosphere.\n\nSee, since pretty much every single [b]Bastion[/b] review praised [b]Darren Korb[/b]'s music and [b]Ashley Lynn Barrett[/b]'s singing, [b]Supergiant[/b] decided to focus on exactly that. [b]Transistor[/b]? It's all music. Our hero this time is a young singer who's called just [b]Red[/b]. And [b]Red[/b]... she just lost everything. She lost a person who was ready to sacrifice everything for her. And she lost the only thing that helped her to stay strong \u2013 her voice. They took everything from her. And now? Now it's time for them to pay for it. Ever thought what if [b]Quentin Tarantino[/b]'s [b]Kill Bill[/b] wasn't that cheesy and provoking... thing with tons of blood? Well, here's [b]Supergiant[/b]'s take on the concept. Like in [b]Bastion[/b], you instantly dive into that certain state of mind where it begins to feel a lot like lucid dream. And the attention to details? Dear Lord... For example, guess who voiced [b]Red[/b]? Yep,  it's [b]Ashley Lynn Barrett[/b]. The same [b]Ashley Lynn Barrett[/b] who voiced [b]Zia[/b] in [b]Bastion[/b] and performed pretty much every female vocals in soundtrack. And now... she's a broken character. With her voice trapped inside the mysterious sword called the [b]Transistor[/b]. Together with a soul of the person who wanted to be with her more than anything. He can still talk to her. It's just... she can't answer. All she can do is to hum her songs. And listen to the voice in her sword. Begging her not to go...\n\nOK, I'll just stop here, since that's pretty much where our game begins, but seriously, [b]Supergiant[/b] did it again. [b]Transistor[/b]'s setting, writing and presentation? It's a bloody masterpiece. Just listening [b]Logan Cunningham[/b] (because yes, our narrator from [b]Bastion[/b] returned, only this time his narration would be even more heartbreaking since his character really, like, [i]really[/i] won't want [b]Red[/b] to do what she's about to do) talking to [b]Ashley Lynn[/b]... and her humming softly to the sky (most of the tracks in this game have humming versions because yes, [b]Ashley[/b]'s humming deserved to be included in soundtrack) with [b]Darren Korb[/b]'s music playing on background... it's just... I dunno, [i]I love[/i] this game. Even though every single game from [b]Supergiants[/b] is beautiful in its own way, this one? So far, it's the most romantic one. [b]Logan[/b]? [b]Ashley[/b]? [i]Bravo![/i] Just following you two for six hours? It felt absolutely beautiful.\n\nGuess, it's time to talk a bit about the actual gameplay, right? I mean, we all know that [b]Supergiant[/b] can create the atmosphere. [i]The[/i] atmosphere. But how does this game actually plays? Well, like I already said, gameplay here is pretty great. Again, it's not the biggest thing out there, but core mechanics became way, [i]way[/i] more complicated. It's still an action [b]RPG[/b] kind of thing, only this time, it comes with... turn-based element. A bit like what we had in good ol' [b]Baldur's Gate[/b]. You know, that certain thing that allowed us to pause the game, give our characters their commands and then see things happening in real time again? That's pretty much it. Only here? It's more complicated than that. See, using such pause also brings some sort of grid to help you planning. And you [i]will[/i] want to plan. Because very often good planning will be your only way to survive, while bad one may lead to quick defeat, since using this feature will put all of your attacking powers on pretty long cooldown. You use tactical mode? Be ready to become helpless for some time. Sure, you can always spam your attacks in real-time, but like I said, good planning will often be your only way to win here. Just because otherwise you'll never be fast enough to outsmart your enemies and perform stuff like backstabbing. In other words, even though this game may look a lot like [b]Bastion[/b] on screenshots and there's even some sort of alternative to [b]Bastion[/b] itself, where you'll be able to do challenges, the core mechanics this time is way more tricky and will require some time to get used to.\n\nSame goes to the skills. Every single skill in this game can be used as both main thing and enhancing modification. You select one skill to be used as an actual attack and then you select two other to modify it in different ways. It sounds pretty simple, but what you can actually achieve with that is absolutely incredible. Experimenting is very important in [b]Transistor[/b]. At some points of the game you'll be like \u201cWow, this game is [i]hard![/i]\u201d And then you'll experiment a bit with what you already have and be like \u201cWhy didn't I do that hours ago?! I'm so strong now!\u201d. Even though there isn't much stuff in this game, it's absolutely awesome what [b]Supergiant[/b] achieved with what they had. Which is also... pretty smart, really. I mean, with [b]Transistor[/b] being a game about sacrifices and treasuring what wasn't taken from you? Having gameplay to actually fit the moral of the story? Fantastic stuff...\n\nSo... yeah... You know how it is. [i]Of course[/i] I recommend this game. It's [b]Supergiant[/b] title. You see a game from these guys? You buy it. Complete bundle. With soundtrack. Because there's no other way. As long as you feel like there's a place in your heart for something more than just another empty online shooter? As long as you want to dive into something real? Something that matters? Something that can be considered as an art? Something [i]to remember?[/i] Don't you dare to miss this game.

Supergiant runs a masterclass in audiovisual design and the sheer amount of work they put in. It sets an unreasonable standard for games as art, and evocative gaming in general.

I was stuck in one kind of playstyle for a while, thinking it was the only viable one, when I started trying out new skills thanks to the decryption element; wherein you have to use a skill in combat in the 3 separate slots (active, passive, modify) to unlock more data. This made me swap them up, and I found it rewarding to learn new styles and combos. \nThe game also gives you second chances, at the price of temporarily losing some of your skills. I found this out when I \"died\", and lost my dash. Losing that was like losing the ability to walk, and I found myself fighting tooth and nail to get it back, swapping up some skills to work better without it before it could return. I was leery at first, but it did create intense moments where I really felt regret and fear of losing. \n\nAll in all, if you can appreciate art, you can appreciate this. I cannot say it enough.

Especially when it is on sale, because it\u2019s quite short (but powerful) so it can be quite expensive with standard price when comparing time/price ratio. Brilliant soundtrack, interesting world (but quite hollow), charming story and characteristic art style of the developer will make you remember the game for long. \n\nArt: \n The game is set in future-styled, world with heavy inspiration from art-deco and some minor cyber elements. This, with unique Supergiant\u2019s geometric isometric brush, is making quite memorable visuals coherent to the topic and plot. \nMusic composed by Darren Korb (he created OST for Bastion and Hades as well) was the first thing that caught my attention. Not only \u201cTransistor\u2019s\u201d OST, but all developer\u2019s games are polished in this area. Definitely helps with immersion. Main protagonist is a singer, which unluckily lost voice. We can although hear when she sings them via Ashley Lynn Barrett lungs. Those tracks ended in my top games\u2019 music pieces playlist, simply because it left me awestruck. \nThe plot is interesting, but I don\u2019t want to make spoilers. All additional elements about the world are presented in small chunks like skills or difficulty modifiers descriptions and narrator throwing one or two sentences here and there. It is left for you to compile it into a unified story. When you are willing to drill into interpretations, game turns out to be a discussion about changes vs status quo in ever shape-shifting world. Additionally, you can develop bonds to the characters, so it can get very emotional later.\n\nGameplay:\nI would say it is turn based roguelike, but it would not be a precise description. It has closed combat arenas when you traverse though story like in \u201cHades\u201d, \u201cEnter The Gungeon\u201d, \u201cThe Binding of Isaac\u201d, or other pure roguelikes. You can use your skills to make your way in similar manner, but later on it will be virtually impossible. From the second challenge you are given \u201cturn()\u201d ability to plan your actions in turn (something like Frozen Synapse, but when you are executing turn enemies are standing still). New abilities are adding new possibilities to play with, so you won\u2019t be bored though all the playthrough. Game incentivize you with changing active skills by showing you additional chunks of history. \nIt is quite an easy game when played purely without modifiers. It\u2019s getting more interesting when you master the mechanics and recurse though the story in new game+ mode and adding so-called limiters. There are as well challenges, but they gave me minor troubles. There is interesting mechanics twist in the last enemy (because there are no bosses in traditional meaning), but I wouldn\u2019t spoil it for you.\n\nOverall:\nFor me, it was a nice, interesting title. Even though it is quite short, it\u2019s well polished in any aspect and deserves more attention. I haven\u2019t played Bastion, and Hades yet, but this game is living in their shadow which is quite upsetting, because it was one of the best games played by me in some categories. When you\u2019re less into action (which later can be pretty intense) but more into story, and have some spare money I would definitely recommend it. \n\n7.5/10\n~adiabat", "timestamp_created": 1612373022, "timestamp_updated": 1620724910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85877014": {"recommendationid": "85877014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357185081", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1681850006}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello world.

Supergiant Games has a way of making things breathtaking in every aspect. The visuals, audio, and game play are all superb.

The story is compelling and tragic. The story is also told through interacting with the world, and it's quite immersive, though there are some glitches when two sets of dialogue are queued up to play at the same time.\n\nTransistor is a third person, 2D, Tactical RPG with a real time and turn based combat system, and has a NG+ feature called recursion.

Let's first talk about the appearance: The art style is amazing, and with the tilted angle that Supergiant Games uses the atmosphere in the game is really well crafted. The audio too. They added some controls that you don't have to use often yet I use them on occasion because it's so fun/beautiful. \nThe audio of the enemies almost gives them a personality and is an indicator on what you can expect from them. And then the voice acting! The fact that so many things get narrated, or commented on is amazing, and although in some places it can get repetitive, it is always good to hear it to break the 'silence'.\nThe music in the game is probably one of the main things why it feels so good to play this game. You can hum to the music and although there is no heavy metal band or an entire orchestra playing, it has an incredible power.\n\nThe story and characters in the game are incredible. It raises questions all the time, and this world looks like something from the past, yet it feels like it's from the future too. The characters are really well thought through, and the mechanics boosts this as well:\n\nThe game allows you to really create your own build and you can change it whenever. It stimulates creativity as well whenever you 'fail' a battle, and as annoying it can be, it's also fun to see new possibilities.\n\nThere is a downside too. This is mostly the fact that there is a lot of reading involved if you want to know more about the characters and world. And this is a normal thing, but while it sometimes get told by a character or just bit by bit, in my opinion, some things are pretty annoying to just go through, although i want to know.

Transistor is, in comparison to those games, underwhelming.\n\nAs usual with Supergiant, the art is great, the music is fantastic and the voice acting is a pleasure to listen to. Everything else in Transistor, however, is a pain. The entire game is painfully linear, the lore and story are vague at best and confusing at worst, and the ending of the game is an absolute insult. The worst part, however, is the gameplay which is so bad that words could not possibly describe it.\n\nThe gameplay, aside from walking, consists of fighting enemies from the process in a hybrid of real time and turn battles. You have two choices; attack enemies in real time with attacks while youre stuck in the same animation over and over and enemies can freely attack you without penalty, or activate the turn mode where you can walk around and plan moves. The real time mode is incredibly frustrating because of the animation lock that many moves have, and the turn mode is blatantly overpowered. The devs realized this, probably, because after every turn action, you have to wait a good 5 seconds  before you can attack (or just use the turn mode) again. In those 5 seconds, you are defenseless aside from the dash, if you even chose that as an attack.\n\nThe battles that result from this are so incredibly janky that I find it hard to believe that someone looked at this and said \"yeah, this is good\" and it might be one of the worst battle systems I have ever seen in a game. Neither \"mode\" really feels satisfying and some of the later battles have some of the most frustrating enemies ever, that are just permanently invisible and can kill you in two hits. Why? Did no one test this battle system at all? Its not even hard, really, its just frustrating because you constantly fight the jank and not the enemies.\n\nSo what Transistor is, essentially, is walk through linear world (with good art, mind you), fight, walk again, fight, walk again. The story has an extremely slow buildup and never truly gets good, and the ending that you get is just an insult after everything you went through. From Supergiant I expect quality and seeing how good Hades is and Bastion was, it just confuses me that Transistor is this janky and rough. I guess a miss is allowed, though - and luckily it isnt too long.

There is a heavy emphasis on trying different abilities and modifying them until you come up with a moveset that fits your playstyle. In addition, swapping out your moveset unlocks more lore, which I really appreciate - it's an amazing touch! However, I CANNOT STAND the gameplay penalty to running out of HP: [spoiler]one of your moves is randomly locked off until the next checkpoint; this effect can stack until you only have one usable move, further putting you at a disadvantage[/spoiler]. I know they did this to encourage experimentation, but I feel like adding more lore would've been a better alternative.\n\nIf I die in a game, just reset me to last checkpoint, please.

Supportive with Help(), Evasive with Jaunt() and Mask(), Life stealing with Tap(), or MAXIMUM DAMAGE WITH VOID() ) and combining them is even better (making functions work outside of Turn() with Jaunt(), make functions stun with Crash() , or having damage over time with Load() ).
