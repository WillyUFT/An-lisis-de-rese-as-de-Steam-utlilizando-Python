This means I haven\u2019t been able to finish it and I got super frustrated, just like with all the games of this type.\nThe graphics are stylized and very nice to look at. There is also a barely visible sort of vertical grid, which I guess is included to be reminiscent of the old console games and the screens they were played on. Other than that, the basic enemies all look similar, with a few exceptions, such as elite soldiers, bugs, and giant robots. \nThe backgrounds in some levels are impressive, I have to say, and give the impression that you are playing a level in a much bigger world than the game really has. The sound is satisfying as well. Hits and slashes sound good, and so do the death screams of defeated enemies. The music is appropriately epic, but nothing too spectacular.\nThe gameplay is, like I\u2019ve mentioned, quite fast, but the game introduces it in increments. When you begin, you can only jump and attack at close range. As the game progresses, you unlock the slide, double jump, dash, range attacks, and all the other moves which are the staple of action platformers.\nIn no part of the game do you feel bored, but there are a few major problems with the game that made me rage quit a few times. First, the game starts off too easy. It literally takes one hit to kill most enemies, which lulls you into a false state of safety. \nAs you progress, however, this starts to change quite a bit. The enemies become more resilient, armored, and shielded, their weapons become overpowered (plasma rifles, I\u2019m looking at you), their behavior becomes too annoying (those damn bugs!), and the game itself is pretty much impossible by the end, when you are in the elevator and the enemies just pile up on you. Perhaps this is just due to me being bad at these types of games, which is a possibility I\u2019m not denying.\nThe boss fights, paradoxically, are almost not hard at all. Once you get the pattern down, they just become exercises in following their movement and avoiding the attacks. The animations are fun to look at, at least, and the bosses are all quite different, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and sometimes even fun to fight. All, except for the Gravitron. That thing can go die with other annoying game bosses.\nThe story is ludicrous, but befitting a game that was created at a time when an Italian plumber jumping on mushrooms was an acceptable plot. The titular Strider is a typical manga ninja cyber assassin, who holds his sword behind his back when running. He has the task of eliminating Grandmaster Meio, the ruler of Kazakh, an evil country that is totally not Soviet Russia. You will fight, among others, a mad and eccentric scientist, four martial arts ladies with huge thighs, and a general who wears a fur hat on his bearded head, talks with a thick accent, and runs around on robot raptor legs. If that is not enough to entertain you, I don\u2019t know what might.\nOne thing that this game succeeds is actually making you feel like a ninja. You\u2019ll do a double jump and dash to grab hold of the underside of a platform with your daggers. Then you\u2019ll jump up, slice the enemy in two, and slide into a ventilation shaft. On the other side, a flying machine will try to attack you, but not before you throw shurikens at it, and use your sword to deflect the laser from the turret. The game is full of moments like these.\nAll in all, Strider is a fun, albeit increasingly hard game, that verges on impossible for me. It had some really intense and interesting moments, and it had me screaming and cursing as well. If you like these kinds of games, and you excel under pressure, go play Strider, and be a ninja cyber assassin who saves the world from an evil Grandmaster and his lackeys.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697566285, "timestamp_updated": 1697566285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532163739204406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148253812": {"recommendationid": "148253812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198938244032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1698947793}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember the first time I played this game way back in 2014, my jaw was on the floor.

What he finds, however, are plenty of soldiers to cut in half, as well as flying robots that Strider can parry and deflect their bullets into them, annahilating them instantly. Strider is kind of... ruthless like that.\n\nStrider is an amazing, PERFECT platformer. There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this game, other than how difficult they've made backtracking to find missed collectibles. Strider is very rapid, and his sword play is even quicker. After defeating certain cringe bosses, Strider uncovers his lost tools in the city of Khazakh, Eagle Option especially is very useful to get rid of mobs quickly and effortlessly. Strider can also climb unto walls and later, FLY! You've heard me, Strider can fly, so if you feel bored at first, I advise you to keep playing.\n\nStrider is [b]9.5/10[/b] platformer goodness. Its quick action bossfights are very memorable, and you feel like you are in there saving the Russians in Khazakh, that have willingly given into oppression and become slaves...

I first discovered Strider Hiryu in Marvel vs. Capcom for Playstation, and thought the character was really cool. The more I played as him, the more I felt I had to have more. From there, I got the NES and Genesis versions, and I really started to dive into the lore. After that I played an emulation of the arcade version, and then in December 2022 I bought the 2014 Strider, and I firmly believe that this is truly what Strider was always meant to be, without any constraints or limitations, just pure, heart-pounding action from start to finish, but still with an underlying story that is sparse enough so as not to interrupt the action, but present enough that you don't lose sight of the ultimate goal. \n\n     And there really is nothing quite like running at top speed on the first stage, just slashing non-stop and effortlessly blowing through any enemy foolish enough to stand in a Strider's way.\n\n     In addition, the story is just vague enough that it can bring players together in discussions about different theories and fan fiction, but still present enough that you don't lose sight of the ultimate goal. There is even a slew of collectibles to add to the gameplay experience and challenge the player, especially in the Research Facility. Not only do they offer a challenge, but a reward; the Fallen Striders give Hiryu excellent changes in color palette to suit many different tastes, and the enemy and story intel expand upon the world and story of the game for those, like me, who want to know more about the amazing world that Capcom and Double Helix have created. \n\n     Another excellent aspect of Strider is all of the callbacks and easter eggs from the old games, and beyond their mere presence, that they actually tie in to the story of the game and make sense and are explained therein, rather than being just for the sake of nostalgia like so many other games of today.\n\n  And, although this as gone on far too long already, I just end this review without talking about the gameplay. The pace and speed of the gameplay, combined with the sheer multitude and variety of enemies, the well crafted and inventive boss fights, and the mass of upgrades, abilities, and attacks available to Hiryu, this game makes for one of the best gaming experiences that I have ever had. The 2014 Strider will forever live in my heart as one of my favorite video games of all time. In fact, this game is the entire reason that I began PC gaming and am currently on Steam! So thanks Strider!\n\nWell, if you actually made it through this whole thing, thanks for reading!\nI'm gonna consider this my tribute to my favorite character of all time!\nTAKE ME TO YOUR BOSS!\n\nOh, by the way, I'm a fan of Strider!

I didn't want to take out what I said....but I wanted to update it after more play:\n\nnote 2: Another big dotted line. TL;DR If you can't be bothered to fix your game from crashing, you get an instant thumbs down:\n\nStrider is always a special series to me. I first saw it in the arcade and it looked amazing. Then I tried the NES version when that came out. This is where my love for the series began...and I really mean love. Strider on NES is one of my favorite games on that system and probably the game I have beaten the most in my life. I had everything memorized, down to where every file would drop on the screen. It still is an amazing game.\n\nStrider Returns was awful (but that really isn't part of the series anyway) and Strider 2 was good enough to get a couple playthroughs. That brings us to this one.\n\nThis Strider feels like if the arcade and NES versions were merged, with the more current technology. You can call it a Metroidvania if you want...but it still feels more stage like to me. Hiryu has more access to climb everywhere, and the levels can be pretty big. It checks all the boxes just right for what a Strider game should be: crazy cypher swinging action, interesting bosses, exploration, and climbing walls and ceilings. Everything is just right.\n\nSounds promising right? So why the thumbs down on a series I really love? Because it is missing something major.\n\nStrider has no heart.\n\nIt really feels like the developers wanted to make it Strider, so they incorporated everything that needs to be into it properly...they just didn't put that love into it to make it good. The areas look nice but turn out to be boring. The enemies are traditional good, but uninteresting. Climbing everywhere becomes a chore. The map is functional, but is bare bones and a little confusing. The power ups are so-so. There is noting I can say is missing in the design, but it just not good design. I mean, it might as well be a Spiderman game....it would check all the right boxes for that too, but nothing convinces me it was designed to be strictly Strider.\n\nIts a shame because I absolutely love the Strider series....but this? I'd rather go back and play the NES version for the 1,000th time. \n\nThis Strider..the body is here in complete form. But it feels dead inside.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere comes the edited section, and everything above couldn't be more wrong. The problem was that I didn't understand the game like I thought I did when writing this review.\n\nBecause of the adventure style, I was treating it too much like a hybrid of the arcade and NES version.  I wasn't focusing on exploring the areas like I should have. And I wasn't using my map. Not using my map was the big problem. I expected this to be a little more straight forward level-by-level. \n\nIts not. There is backtracking and searching around needed. It isn't really \"Metroidvania\", but it has aspects of those style of games. \n\nI do stand by the enemies being boring, but the combat gets pretty crazy. I also stand by the Spiderman comment, but it doesn't bother me as much as I get more into the exploring side.....not being in such a rush to get to \"the next level\" or so I thought.\n\nThis game has stepped up dramatically in my opinion once I knew what I was actually supposed to be doing.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow for the third part:\n\nI got to a section where I have to fight a boss. There is no way to save on the way, and it took me a good amount of time to get to the boss. Mid fight, dialogue came up and the game froze and then crashed. This is the 4th crash I have had, and the most annoying.\n\nI loaded it up again, and started my path to the boss. Getting halfway (and through the harder parts to get to him), it froze and crashed again.\n\nNo sympathy: if you don't fix it, you don't deserve a recommendation.

Strider games. Those slash-em-up platformers that debuted on the arcade, got ONE sequel and then dropped off the face of the planet (outside of the main guy appearing in MvC).\nI KNOW Capcom has a... [i]reputation[/i] for doing edgy gritty reboots in this era that would get nowhere and just kinda suck in general. You might think this is one of those considering it never got followed up on.\n[b]But no, it's actually pretty damn good.[/b]\n\n\nIt's a 2.5D Metroidvania. The original games were linear platformers, this one sorta expands the formula into a full-on open map that you explore as you get more abilities.\nYour moveset is also a REALLY good expansion on both the original games and the protagonist's MvC appearances; you have directional slashes, that come out INSTANTLY and can be done as fast as you can mash the button (you can attack as lightspeed like a funny ninja).\nYou also have doublejumping, a slide kick, a stomp attack, a [b]launcher attack[/b] (!!!) that lets you [I]juggle enemies[/i] (this is not at all necessary to do, it's just for flair), 4 different elemental variants of your blade with different effects each, and an aimable dash that can be done in any direction and has special effects depending on your weapon.\n\nNow, it might just be the Sonic PTSD kicking in, but I'm at a point where I'll go into 3D/2.5D games EXPECTING the controls to be floaty, stilted, jerky and delayed. It's like a staple of 3D at this point, main characters that are janky physics objects that lock up your controls for multiple frames while figuring out what to do.\n[b]But I'm happy to say this game controls DAMN well for what it is.[/b] Your attacks and inputs are recognized INSTANTLY, and your movement is as tight as it gets. You can maneuver in mid-air to your heart's content like you would in a Megaman game, and your airdash (once you unlock it) gives you some CRAZY aerial mobility on top of that. It's [i]tight[/i].\n\n\n...That said though, the combat is kind of... not balanced all that well?\nEnemies can and will shoot bursts of bullets with no telegraphing, but you take VERY low damage from most things. Like the game doesn't EXPECT you to avoid attacks, so you'll be eating stray bullets a lot.\nWeapons are also not really all that well balanced, with the fire and gravity swords really OUTCLASSING the other two by a long margin. Fire deals a ridiculous amount of damage per swing, and gravity extends your reach with boomerang projectiles (at the cost of slightly limiting your attack speed by 2 projectiles on screen at a time).\nYou compare this with two lower damage swords, one of which reflects projectiles (useful, but not needed since you take so little damage) with the other one freezing enemies (not so useful, still low damage, frozen enemies block your path).\n\nBosses are also kinda hard to make out on a first run, with weird attack patterns with little telegraphing that aren't very intuitive to figure out just LOOKING at them. You'll figure it out if you pay a bit of attention but again, it's rough on your first time.\n\nHonestly my BIGGEST gripe with the game overall is the level design.\nOr rather, not the level design ITSELF but [b]the lack of PROPER fast travel or warping[/b].\nAlmost every area has warp spots laid throughout that (once you have the right ability unlocked) take you to ANOTHER specific, fixed warp spot either in the same area or a different one.\nIt's COOL-looking, especially when you're warping between layers of a single area (it's 2.5D so you can move into the background and vice-versa) but it just makes going back for collectibles a bit more of a pain than it needs to be, ESPECIALLY with how huge the areas are.\nIt's not a problem if you like the gameplay and don't mind running back and forth, but it does make the game a bit longer than it really could've been if you go for 100%.\n\n\n\nThe graphics are [i]decent[/i] for what it is; it's not a very colorful game as the originals were, but the environments are varied enough and actually DO have different marked color schemes to make them easier to make out (the sewers having lots of greens, the temple browns, the factory blues, military areas being reddish, etc). They're old but they're more than serviceable for what they are.\nCharacters don't move their mouth when speaking though which makes cutscenes a bit funny to look at, but I can forgive that considering this game didn't really have that big of a budget to begin with.\n\n\nThe music's... [i]fine[/i], it serves its purpose during gameplay well, but there's not that many memorable memories here. I just finished [b]100%ing the game[/b] and I only remember about two or three melodies tops.\n\n\nThe story is... simple, honestly. The game jumps STRAIGHT into gameplay with not that much emphasis on cutscenes, and the story is simple enough that it doesn't need it. Stop the evil cultist dude that took over not-Russia. It's a retelling of the first game's plot which was an [i]arcade[/i] game, so there's your point of reference.\nThere's a lot of unlockable gallery extras that give you tidbits of information on each character and area though, which is actually pretty cool if you actually want to know more about these not-very-well-explained characters and locales.\n\n\n\nOverall? Yeah, I like the game, minor gameplay design gripes aside. It's REALLY damn good for what it is, for the year it came out, and for the small budget it was given.\n\n\n[b]That said, there is a rather IMPORTANT bug in this PC release that has not been addressed by the game's negligent parent Capcom.\nIf your CPU has more than 8 cores, the game will simply refuse to launch, crashing instantly upon trying to open it.\nIt can be fixed, but it requires a workaround found on the forums/guides, which could take upwards of 20-30 minutes and REALLY should not have been necessary to begin with.\nOnce it's fixed it runs really well, but be warned that depending on your rig you may need to go through the process to get it running.\n[i]Capcom please. DON'T be like this to your creations, it hasn't even been 10 years since it came out for crying out loud..[/i][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1687600713, "timestamp_updated": 1687600911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140139044": {"recommendationid": "140139044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010863259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1686975198}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Strider Game EVER!!!!

While a very short game, it's a wonderful experience to play for a day or two, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nStrider's Graphics are good. Not great, just good. There are sweeping vistas to see, combined with stylized characters and anime effects. It also plays a lot with vibrant colors, and things ARE color coded which adds to the style. It certainly can feel a bit jumbled, but it all comes together to make the game look quite nice.\n\nAudio is a bit of both. Voice Acting is not good, it's just plain old bad. Everything else is passable, if not quite good. Satisfying hits, joyous level up sounds, and good mechanical sounds from threats.\n\nThe story is just OK. It's very minimalist, with very little being explained to you and with most exposition coming from either rare cutscenes or in characters speaking to you while you're moving in the world. You're Hiryu, on a mission to kill Grand Master Meio. That's about as deep as it gets, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. \n\nThe gameplay is the big draw here though, with it being a tight, well built Metroidvania. I mentioned earlier that it's short, and it is. I am not great at Platformers or Metroidvanias, but even I was able to beat the game on Normal in under 4 hours. Now, I'd say that this is a GOOD thing. Because, everytime you gain a new ability or attack, you have a short while to experiment with it before getting the next one, without a massive amount of time spent just fighting for the sake of fighting instead of actually progressing. Movement is incredibly slick, with controls mostly working to perfection. It does have that issue where when you're holding down to try and pass through a floor, sometimes you'll slide instead of go down, but that's about the worst that comes out of the control scheme. \n\nThe map, while a bit big, never feels like you don't know where you're going. Secrets can still be explored for, but the game also gives you a directional arrow on your map menu in case you want to move on. You will want to explore too, as being able to spam your cool abilities and being able to tank a lot of hits is locked behind getting Energy and Health upgrades, which are found while exploring.\n\nBosses are fun too. Never overly challenging, but none after the mid point are a cakewalk, and none are a cakewalk period if you're playing on Hard.\n\nIt's just a tight, short and fun Metroidvania that is certainly worth a few bucks.

But the game has an unimaginative Story yet its backed by an enjoyable combat and character movement experience. I only know this guy from Arcade games as a kid.

There is no proper introduction to the world or the character Strider Hiryu, nor anything about the motivation of the character. The ending is even more underwhelming.\n\nThe collectables and the power upgrades feel very awkwardly placed. Distracting from the hurried experience of slicing through hordes of enemies. I hated how poor the travelling between maps/levels were set in place.  It was very tiring to go through the same route again and again just to see if you have missed a collectable or an upgrade for your weapon.\nThe combat is brilliant, i loved how varied yet simple the attacking options were. The character movements are also great, as everything feels fast paced and rushed. \n\nThey could have made this soo much better, had the team had a credible script. The voice acting felt so generic, the main rarely spoke and when he did he sounded like a lost goof. Strider had potential to be a great game but was limited by too many of these short comings.\n \nIf you want to experience a different style of gameplay and enjoy rushed combat.

Strider is mostly know from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 despite having 2 other games he starred in. Strider 2014 though easily sets up such a memorable version of himself that honestly whenever I think about the character, the fast paced, metroidvania version is all I think about.\n\nThe game is all about hitting hard and fast, like a ninja, and using the environment and enemies projectiles against them. A large portion of this games is simply rushing through enemy mobs as you reflect all the bullets they throw at you while performing cool tricks and triangle jump your way to the next location. With the way Strider 2014 uses movement also helps cement it as one of the cooler games to see when performed at higher play as there's just a cool amount of slips and slices that you can do while mowing down enemies. Bosses are even given great care to just how fun and challenging they can be, and while they can be brief, they are high action, and always a fun change of pace.\nAesthetically, Strider 2014 is a direct contrast of what you'd normally think of a ninja fighting an evil organization would look like. Everything about this game is super high tech, and all the environments and music help reinforce just how foreign Strider is to it, and how well he adapts to it throughout the game, often using various upgrades he finds throughout, both powering him up and helping him move even faster.\n\nMostly Strider 2014 is a hidden gem that Capcom doesn't advertise nearly as much as it should, and if you are interested in some high octane Metroidvania fun, Strider is easily a great pick.", "timestamp_created": 1682839086, "timestamp_updated": 1682839086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50423729419708252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137329034": {"recommendationid": "137329034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074325998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1682537999}, "language": "english", "review": "Girls only want striders with sweet skills, but this one group of soldiers want me to join them because I'm pretty good with a bow staff.

Here's the good news first:\n\n1. Combat is fast paced and feels almost completely within your control. Movement feels fluid and fun.\n\n2. The spammable basic slash attack very much makes you feel like an unstoppable super ninja from the very beginning. Charge strike also feels very satisfying to use.\n\n3. Charge Mode feels awesome to use. You earn it through landing enough attacks while not getting hit too much. It's a super ability that rewards player skill, setting the tone for what will enable you victory in this game.\n\n4. All aspects of combat are able to be mastered, meaning your fate is mostly controlled by your skill level.\n\nThe bad news:\n\n1. Enemy variety gets boring to look at fairly quickly. \nYou won't really be visually astonished by any of the enemies you encounter. There is basic foot soldier, soldier with shield, flying robot, big robot, and c r a b (they don't look like crabs).\n\n2. Hiryu can take a shitton of damage in a very short amount of time.\nHe has no invincibility frames at any point. Add this to the fact that Hiryu can be hitstunned means that he can take a massive amount damage in less than a second and there isn't a real way to stop this other than to move fast enough out of the way in the right direction. Hiryu also can get hitstunned while struck in mid-air, and will begin falling once he's hit. Certain attacks also make him lose his grip while climbing. All these factors combined lead to many moments in the game that feel outright cheap and undeserved. These moments can be mitigated after getting Option A, however, which provides a momentary projectile shield.\n\n3. Bosses are either too weak or too cheap.\nMany bosses can be defeated simply by spamming the melee attack and moving around a moderate amount. This only gets easier later on once you realize you can combo the eagle and panther upgrades together into your flurry of regular attacks. Bosses can be stopped and stunned if you inflict enough damage on them. This leads to the interesting effect of not knowing a boss had a certain attack until you happen to stop beating on them. The final boss is disappointingly weak to fight against, especially in his biblical angel final form.\n\n4. Hiryu's first jump has a strange quirk. \nWhen doing a single jump starting from forward moving momentum, he will jump forward normally, and you wouldn't suspect anything would be off about this jump until you try to turn backwards while in mid-air.  When switching to backwards movement in Hiryu's first jump, he will turn backwards instantly and retain the same speed as he was moving forward. This sounds minute in description, but it can throw off your rhythm in combat as he'll move in a direction at a speed you did not expect. It's a not intuitive and can be hard to get used to. It's further strange that his first jump has this property considering neither his second jump nor his plasma catapult jump have this quirk.\n\n5. Hiryu's climbing also has some odd quirks. \nTo start climbing on a surface you have to press the directional button matching the direction you have to grab it from (press up to grab ceiling, press left to grab wall on the left), but this is not always true. For example, if you are running in a straight direction to the left and reach a dropoff point, Hiryu will sometimes not drop off and start falling but instead will grab the wall that's perpendicular to the floor's dropoff. Hiryu can also freeze enemies, which effectively turns them into blocks you can use for climbing. Moving into a mid-air frozen enemy can cause you to grip onto them when you meant to attack them. This can happen a fair amount in late game, where there are many enemies in a small room that can be frozen.\n\n6. Story is bad.\nIt's a cliche hero-comes-in-to-save-the-world-from-big-evil-Hitler-guy-and-hero-wins kind of story. A weak narrative can be mitigated by having the characters or character dynamics be compelling or interesting, but not even these are here. The lore isn't very interesting to read either.\n\n7. Voice acting is bad and feels forced.\nThe dialogue for the English script is outright cringy once you hear the voice actors speak their lines. Hiryu has a bad Japanese accent, the Pooh sisters (yes, fuckin Pooh) sound really forced in their evil bitch monologues, the insane scientist goes laughably overboard in his \"hehe I'm cwazy\" speeches, General Mikiel and another side character have bad lazy Russian accents, the scientist Schlange (yes, fuckin Schlange) is the worst sounding of them all, and the final villain Grandmaster Meio is just... plain. You can tell these actors showed up for a paycheck and nothing else.\n\n8. Exploration and unlockables are underwhelming.\nThe development team didn't really try much when it came to what is often the best part about games: exploration and being rewarded for said exploration. It can be fun to get new upgrades, but the same animation is used everytime you get one and it gets old. Upgrades and extras are placed in rather easily spotted and reachable areas. For extras, they simply recycled the concept art and character models that were created for the game, attached some lazily written lore to them and called it good enough. There are the Beacon Run and Survival challenge mode maps that can be unlocked too, but those don't provide much incentive in of themselves to play.\n\n8. Achievements.\nAchievements are a little odd. The achievement for beating General Mikiel tends to not unlock after beating him the first time on Hard mode. There is also an achievement for grabbing all large health canisters, but no achievement for finding all unlockable extras. No achievements exist for meeting any conditions in the Beacon Run and Survival mode challenges. On Xbox, the game can also bug out if you don't force quit it for a few hours and it'll somehow think you're not connected to Xbox Live, and therefore won't record any new achievements you should've gotten. Uncertain if this bug can happen beyond Xbox.\n\nFun Facts:\n\n- The giant millipede bosses are actually several crabs attached together. The crabs did this willingly. \n\n\n\nThe crabs willingly attached their mouths to each others' anuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Brainwalker units are called so because they are controlled by actual brains. Human brains. Civilian brains. \n\n\n\nThey abducted civilians and put their brains into robots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- The coolest sounds in the game (I personally believe) come from the mechanized dragon boss roars and the shield soldiers' voice line, \"GO NO FURTHER!\".", "timestamp_created": 1679954428, "timestamp_updated": 1679954428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650508999824523926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135536325": {"recommendationid": "135536325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072445406", "num_games_owned": 2176, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1679910440}, "language": "english", "review": "Strider is one of the few games out there to make you actually feel like a ninja.

You can play it without hating it. But I ended up hating it. I\u2019m not sure if games like these are supposed to have a good story but this one definitely doesn\u2019t. It started off pretty standard but turned into nonsense and I started caring even less.\n\nCombat was pretty cool at first but then I realized it was just mashing the attack button as fast as I could. Occasionally holding the attack button to hit enemies with shields. Over time it became mundane and boring. After the first mini boss the game decided that making a mini boss an normal enemy was okay. So I promptly restarted the game on easy difficulty. Thank god there is an easy mode.\n\nI noticed that some checkpoints are not saved when you exit the game. Which is annoying. Jumping movement is a bit floaty and the character sometimes clings to a wall or a ledge when I just want to jump off of it. There are enemies that are annoying rather than difficult. \nEnemies respawn even if you didn\u2019t leave the area.\n\nAlso I absolutely hated it when an enemy knocked me off of the top of a building and I had to climb back up. Or when I am trying to explore and go down the wall and accidentally touch a wire that shocks me and sends me tumbling down. One of my most hated things is that during a boss fight when they talk there will be a text block at the bottom that doesn\u2019t let you see your character or the boss.\n\nVisually it\u2019s okay and the music sometimes is okay too. But definitely nothing special.\nIf you ask me why I played through the entirety of it is because I didn\u2019t want to lower my average completion percentage.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a functioning game but ultimately it comes down to the question that Steam asked me: do you recommend this game.

You won't be slipping off things and you stop on a dime\n\n-Excellent mobility. Fast movement speed, wall/ceiling clinging and climbing and later upgrades such as double jumping and multi directional dashing \n\n-Very fast 8 directional attacks\n\n-Strong powers and upgrades with different properties for progress or combating enemies. Shout outs to the ability to deflect shots back at enemies with timing. Super satisfying\n\n-Bosses are quite enjoyable and decently varied\n\n-Good music, some nice remixes from older Strider games\n\n-Strider Hiryu is cool as shit \n\n\n>>The Bad<< \n\n-Story is paper thin basic. You are super cool ninja man on a mission to assassinate super big evil Emperor Mayo. That is pretty much it. Less of an issue if you go into this with a \"Who cares I'm just here to slash and style on people\" mentality but still worth mentioning \n\n-Awkward cutscenes zooming in close to poorly textures models with zero facial animations despite them talking \n\n-No fast travel to any zone. There are fast travel points that lead to very specific points within a zone or to another specific zone but for the most part you will be traveling long distances if you are backtracking for missed upgrades due to not having an upgrade to access it early on and especially if you plan to get 100% completion. Massive slog and time waster \n\n-Some powers are a little too strong making some bosses go by like nothing \n\n-The game despite feeling great to slash through countless enemies very fast it is a little braindead and you will be mashing the attack button very very often\n\n-Two of the four Cypher upgrades are meh and you'll most likely only ever use them when you absolutely have to to progress or to break an enemy's shield that requires it to break it\n\n-The game has a very bad habit of crashing for many players (myself included) way too often, becoming borderline impossible to complete the game. I am not sure exactly how or why this happens but there is a Steam thread post by user \"X6205\" with a possible fix that worked for me. \nLink here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/235210/discussions/0/2575445991822522940/#c2974023280301011959 \n\n\n>>Conclusion<< \n\nOverall Strider 2014 is a very solid B-tier small game for those who want to feel like an overpowered ninja on speed while moving and looking stupid cool. Its a game that very much values \"Rule of Cool\" over anything else, mostly being carried by it but still remaining mechanically very solid. Worth a shot if that's what your looking for and especially if you've played and enjoyed Strider 2 back in the day.

Also, some of the environments could definitely do with a bit more variety because they are incredibly bland at times.

You cannot play this game. It will not even boot. So you have to either disable cores or use software to fool the game into thinking you only have 8 or less cores. Completely, bonkers and I've never heard of a problem like this with any other game. I have 12 cores so the game just does not boot. \n\nWhy I do recommend the game:\nThe game itself is a lot of fun, it's metroid-lite with really fast paced action and cool power ups. Don't go into this game expecting story because while there is some, it's mostly window dressing between the platforming and action. You gain abilities and gear to progress through either enemies or obstacles like Metroid/Castlevania, the ability to reflect bullets with your sword, throwing kunai, a cool ability that launches yourself forward through enemies or special doors.\n\nThe game is really cool and I've heard almost no one talk about it. Either that's due to capcom not marketing it well enough or the issues relating to CPUs- because apparently some have issues with crashing. The only reason I've been able to play this game is on Steam Deck & even with putting the game into standby mode I've had little to no issue. Runs really well even with the power setting turned down.  \n\nSo if you like Metroidvania &  have 8 cores or less, or a Steam Deck or whatever, this game is for you. \nYes, I've heard you can disable cores to play the game, but if you think having to go into your system settings and turn off CPU cores is a fix?

Whereas other games focus either on ranged combat or a slower, more deliberate melee, Strider is about becoming an unstoppable force that obliterates anything unfortunate enough to stand in your way, similarly to how the old arcade games played.\n\nThe only notable downside I can see is that, well, the graphics took a little while to acclimate to. Being a primarily 7th gen game wasn't the problem, it's that the game deliberately imposes a faux-scanline effect on the screen that just doesn't look that great.

It's far in between is what i am saying, and maps are more of a cut pieces that are joined together to make \"world map\", then these cut pieces are also in sections, so you can imagine doing backtracking can be a little tedious. But, it is NOT game breaking though, as the level designs are awesome. Like it really came from a time of those 8-16bit era where the emphasis on level design is part of the game Dev's philosophy which is also tied to enemy design and behavior.

Finding out it actually came out after the release of the PS4 and Xbox One actually makes it much worse than I thought.\n\nStrider is a remake/reboot of a very old game from the Nintendo/Genesis era, so it can be understood for being so simplistic, but it doesn't make it any better. Having had years of development to make this game into something more substantial and subsequently failing to do so doesn't feel great. There is extremely little to the game, mostly running around the screen and mashing the attack button. There are additional powers and variations on it but throughout the game, there is extremely little use for them other than the occasional enemy requiring a slight change in tactics. For the vast majority, there is next to nothing beyond this leaving the game extremely simple and dull. The boss fights are similar, not requiring much more than being able to jump up to where they've decided to draw the fight out at and mashing the attack button further.\n\nThere are several collectibles but they aren't gratifying to collect and give little in return. Map exploration is simplistic and lacks any sort of Metroidvania retreading or discovery. This game is about as empty as it gets and the only saving grace is that it can be grabbed for cheap.\n\nIf you're of the opinion that gaming peaked in the 8-bit or 16-bit era and desperately want a game that feels like a modern graphical update of that time period this game is for you.

I'm hoping it can keep me hooked until the end. This feels like a game I'm going to want to come back to enjoy all the way through again! \nIt's harder for me to articulate what is working for me in a game, so don't be put off by the short Pros section. I think this is a sign that I'm too sucked in playing the game to think about why I'm having fun.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Great combat\n[*]Compelling pace and progression\n[*]Exploring the map is rewarding with power-ups and extras in plentiful supply\n[*]Just F---ing fun!\n[/list]\n\nCons:[list]\n[*]The player character's movement can feel a bit sticky and awkward at times, especially when maneuvering tight quarters. I can get stuck to walls and ceilings easily which can get in the way when fighting. Sometimes certain moves require a bit more precision than I like, such as detaching when climbing. \n[*]Attack direction is effected by the surface that you're standing on and can make hitting certain targets difficult and frustrating, but this a rare occurrence.\n[*]The controls feel a bit awkward in situations where I'm charging and want to attack with one of my 'Options'. It's frustrating wanting to save a charge while at the same time attacking with an option, but I acknowledge it's a nit-pick.\n[*]Unskippable cut-scenes are a more obnoxious problem, especially when difficult bosses have opening speeches. It doesn't seem like much but 5 to 15 seconds really starts to wear on me after the first time. Any action game that's going to have cut-scenes ought have an option to skip them (at least after the first time!). I'd like to see more games with an auto-skip option in the menus, extra brownie points for that!\n[*]Enemies tend toward feeling tanky with too much health. That's a tricky balance, but I think it's a valid concern considering longer health bars require more mashing of the attack button which can really start to hurt after a long session. The most difficult boss I've fought so far became a frustrating not just because of the (quite enjoyable) challenge, but also because my hands were starting to hurt due to the repetitive movements. Multiplied by the number of deaths, this became a pretty unpleasant experience. \n[list][*]I think an accessibility option for auto rapid-fire, or a separate control for charged attacks, could be helpful solutions in other games.

Not a bad game, but not one I would recomend either.\nPros:\nTight controls, serviceable story, interesting take on the Strider franchise.\nCons:\nRepetitive enemies, bosses, and the map design starts showing it's flaws near the end.\n\nThe game allows you to change the properties of Strider's attacks by changing the color of his plasma scarf, which is an interesting ability. The problem however, is that it affects all of your abilities at once, so not only you can't mix and match without having to quick swap them during combat, but all of your abilities share similar attributes, making them less unique. Additionally, there's no change to your special attacks, which could've added some much needed variety.\nThis plasma system translates into enemies being largelly the same across the whole game, except some more obnoxious ones being color coded.\nOn the map, while it mostly consists of industrial style enviroments, it's decently varied, but navigation gets obnoxious in late game, as you move across areas with more frequency, they start blending together.\nCertain areas can only be reached through specific routes and a specific example of bad design is the temple, which has a ring that you can fall into accidentally into, with a launcher that sends you into the prison, and the hatch that closes right behind you, so there's no way back, and the way out of the prison has a gauntlet that forces you to go through several rooms locked until you defeat the enemies inside.\nAdditionally, in order to complete the game 100%, you need find several collectibles, which are all very interesting, except one, the health canister. This canister just recovers your health, so if you don't need it, naturally you tend to ignore it over time. However, despite not adding anything to your overall character progression, these count for game completion, so you end up being forced to backtrack to destroy items you already found before but didn't know were important, because, well, they really weren't.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind about completing the game 100%, and would like some Strider action, this game is non-offensive, but as a metroidvania, it lacks in several aspects.", "timestamp_created": 1658257989, "timestamp_updated": 1658258298, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118965460": {"recommendationid": "118965460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136097602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1658185598}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game highly recommend playing if you like metrovania and hack and slash together good balance of difficulty not to hard not to easy very fun game glad to play this remake of the strider games from the ps1 one era it's a gem", "timestamp_created": 1658075387, "timestamp_updated": 1658075387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118913673": {"recommendationid": "118913673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285035972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1657109265}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroid but not fun", "timestamp_created": 1657991164, "timestamp_updated": 1657991164, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118881216": {"recommendationid": "118881216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113384605", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1657935342}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Score: 3/10[/b]\n\nThe fundamentals in Strider are comfortable, but the execution of every single facet of the game varies from mediocre to abhorrent. I blew through the game at an intense pace to keep myself interested, and yet could not escape the boredom of a dull, terribly-voice-acted story and one-dimensional combat. The best part of the game is far and away the silly pleasures of beating the pits out of every single thing that shows up in front of you, but every moment where you start to enjoy that is interrupted by an enemy specifically designed to roadbump your fun and keep the pacing through each level tedious and formulaic. Why in the world is the second most common enemy in a game about spamming the attack button till your finger hurts a shield-user that SPECIFICALLY stops you from spamming? It is taking the fun part of the game, that is well and wholly acknowledged by health dropping from each enemy, and asking you to stop doing it every 15 paces. Asinine. Without any form of a progression system, you eventually realize that most enemies are optional, and the anti-fun shield guys no longer become an issue since you're hopping and zipping over their heads to the next boss. Which... range from okay to awful gameplay-wise, and consistently terrible in voice-acting (which is BAD bad, not fun bad). Music was almost never noticeable, though it doesn't really become a nuisance at any point. Boss themes are... I can't remember enough about them to say anything, which is a negative in my book. Ultimately, here's what you get - 10 seconds of slashy fun, then you have to charge up a swipe for a shield guy but you get bumped midway through the charge and have to restart it. Then you get bumped again, which sends you into a wall trap that pinballs you to the other side of the room. The nearest enemy then freezes you and you jump to avoid him, snapping to the ceiling, which you won't realize for a few seconds because six bombs are going off inside your character model.

Note that while my performance on my 1070 was buttery smooth, there are known issues with certain cpus and graphics cards so make sure to test upon purchase and see if you need to refund. \n\nStrider is a fantastic 2d action exploration game that gets most everything right, and what it gets wrong is easily dismissable. You play as a cyborg ninja taking on a bunch of techno russians and their cyborg mercernaries hired to take you out. Its flashy, chaotic, and smoothly balanced, with plenty of fanservice to the original Strider games of yesteryear but taking an honest approach to the established Vania format. Functionally, you slice, you dice, and you dash, and over the course of the game you find more ways to do all of the above in even more engaging ways. Like Metroid: Dread years later, it maximally uses the 2.5d space to full effect, with enemies coming in and out the arena, camera changes for dynamic effect, and constantly utilized sense of depth to each inch of the map. While some areas are hit or miss as far as visual engagement, there is a ton of variety in set pieces and scenarios you're thrust into, with some really beautiful midgame backdrops calling back to the classics being among my favorite. It is at its worst serviceable and clean, making it easy to navigate without getting lost, and the dynamic layered map certainly helps.\n\nGameplay is generally sublime--you can swing your sword as fast as you can hit the button, and all the various mechanical variety introduced later on blends pretty seemlessly into the general flow of the game. My biggest issues stem from the generally boring enemy types you face; robot soldier with gun, with rocket launcher, or with SHIELD and gun make up the majority of encounters, with the occasional miniboss sprinkled throughout. By the end of the game you will have seen every feasible variation on robot soldier, and you will come to hate the shield guys, who start requiring certain elements to break. Unlike many games with shield dudes, you cannot use your fantastic ninja skills to get behind them and slash them to death--for some reason they have more agility than you, the cyborg ninja, and will snap around to block any and all attacks unless its a charged attack or the matching element. While \"challenging\" near the end game, these guys kill the flow in how limited your options are, and stand as the only enemy that works like this. \n\nBlessedly, bosses welcome whatever strategy you feel like. There are the obvious advantages on certain ones, but you're never punished for variety, and most are memorable in their spectacle and design. WIthout spoiling, while the final boss is as cheesy as the rest of the game, beating it rewards you with probably the best credits background victory screen I've ever seen, and is so incredibly badass that it makes the entire game worth it just to see. While I played the game on normal, I found myself dying to more platforming than the bosses, and would recommend anyone wanting a challenge to play on hard. Unlike previous games, boss encounters once gleaned are often the easier experiences, made difficult only by some of the more obnoxious moves and massive health pools. The big bad in particular has an orb attack that deals massive damage and follows you around the map--if there was a way to destroy it I never could figure it out. ultimately you just have to gauge what your best DPS tactics are. I liked the eagle the most for this, but even then by the end I hated how even the common grunts could take 6 or so slashes to the face before dying and late game encounters end up just being damage trading.\n\nThe biggest sins this game commits are in its weak story--which isn't so bad in itself--and the fact that it insists to take up a full 6th of the screen when its being exposited to you. For some reason, even though all the dialogue is voiced, the game has these massive text boxes pop up and caption everything the villain of the moment is saying. There is no way to disable these from what I can tell or shrink this box, which is a problem--they are not opaque, and because Strider tends to orient camerawise lower on the screen, these incessent, often repeating quips COVER where you and enemies can be, as well as obscure pitfalls and dangers. It is particularly bad in the early game, and overall I would say that the first 20% of this game is the weakest it gets, which isn't great. While the initial introductions to bosses and such is welcome at first, this game does not know when to shut up--which means you're going to have to do guess work as to where youre going a lot. This isn't helped by the fact that you will come to realise you've effectively seen the entire bestiary in the first 5 minutes--turrets, soldiers, and big mech soldiers. Thankfully the flow of the game encourages you to ignore most mobs, but later on many get tracking shots and elemental attacks that can ruin you if you get clipped, and the general flow becomes frustrating. I've already spoken of the shield guys, but thats that. It's a shame, because the actual combat options available to you are varied and unique and calls for an equally varied enemy set to compliment, but because grunts at most take a quick change in element to slice down in a hit or two, it's barely utilized outside of bosses.\n\nThe other mixed bag is platforming. First off, like any good metroidvania, there is sequence breaking, and its not that difficult to do. The game is definitely not coded for it but it thankfully has contingencies in case it happens, so feel free to break the waypoint system and watch bosses you've already defeated say theyre about to arrive. That is fun! What isn't fun is the weird, wonky hit boxes, the HORRENDOUS knockback enemies and environment have, and the inconsistent wallgrabbing mechanic that is essential to it all. Its not really noticable early game, but by the end of the game you're going to be flipping coins wondering if you'll even grab the ledge. Luckily the game is incredibly forgiving and (usually) doesn't set you back too far if you screw up, and while I appreciate that, its a bandaid to a bigger wound. When it works its as good as any speedy game in the genre, but you certainly feel it when things go awry. Another more minor issue I have is that the game never gives you any high speed moves, and while you move fast enough from the start, I was practically begging for a faster sprint option with how tediously long and winding some areas could get. \n\nThe final annoyance I have is the weird completionist requirements needed to finish the maps. For anyone like me who want to get everything yourself, you're out of luck; while upgrades are visible on the map, there are also hidden collectible intel and concept art filling the hidden corners of the world that are not--meaning you're going to need a guide to 100% everything, and they all count towards your final score. Also, so do the large health refills for some bizarre reason.\n\nAll being said, Strider is a fantastic reboot by a now notorious studio (you would know them as the Killer Instinct reboot folks, or more recently the Amazon New World MMO), and its genuinely incredible this was the only game of its kind they made. The experience is superb and is one of the better metroidvanias out there, especially for the time. If MercurySteam could go from that awful 3ds castlevania game to the pinnacle of the Metroid series in Dread, it makes me wonder what this studio could've made if it hadn't sold its soul. Probably wishful thinking knowing how cutthroat the industry is, but I would have loved to have seen a sequel with this from what they learned. As it stands however, this is a mindblowingly good game and shouldn't be missed by newcomers and verterans alike. It goes on sale often and is worth every penny, caveats and all.

The controls are terrible as the precise jumping and clinging to walls is a key part of the game but the strider sticks to walls when you don't want it and doesn't when you desperately need him too. The only cool thing about the controls is that double jump resets after getting hit so you can get knocked of a wall and jump back up and grab it again if you're lucky. The map is terrible for navigating. The story makes no sense. So why is this a missed opportunity? Because the visuals are excellent, the characters are excellent, the environment is excellent.

Apart from some bothersome slowdowns (bothersome because my system greatly exceeds the recommended system requirements) and a bit of repetition, this is a quality game through and through. \n\nInstead of making the game in 3D and getting a mixed response from older fans, they kept the side-scrolling gameplay and made it in a metroidvania style. This is great because it is a \u201ebest of both worlds\u201d kind of approach. The 2,5D graphics look great and the gameplay will be imediately familiar for fans of the older games. \n\nSome might say that the game is a little too short at just 7 hours on the easiest difficulty, but it is worth mentioning that unlike other games, there are very few cutscenes and all are very short (under a minute). Of the 7,3h of play at the time of this review, more than 7h was practically gameplay, not me watching a cutscene. So when you think about it, this game actually has quite a good length. Plus it is considerably longer than the other games in the series, with bigger areas to explore. \n\nI consider this the best game in the series. While I did not play Strider II (Amiga), i did play Strider (Genesis), Strider 2 (PS1) and a little of Strider (NES). Apart from the fact that it's not as innovative in terms of gameplay and graphics as the first Strider, it has the better gameplay of the series, that will probably age better as well.\n\nAnother great game from Capcom.

It's a 2D metroidvania, with a focus on action and combat.  As a kid, I played both the NES Strider and the Genesis Strider.  They were two very different games.  The NES strider was a straight metroidvania with small sprites.  A very good game.  The Genesis version was a straight action platformer with huge sprites, it had amazing visuals for its time.  The 2014 version of Strider feels like it combines all of the good things from those two old games.  \n\nStrider is fast.  You move fast, you strike fast.  You run through the areas, slashing anything that gets in your way.  You have a great climbing hook that lets you latch onto any wall or ceiling.  Even when grappling around, you are still pretty fast, everything always feels great.  The action eventually moves past brainless slashing, as you get a charge attack, and different versions of your sword to use on different types of enemies, but it never becomes challenging enough to become frustrating.\n\nExploring in Strider is great.  There are secrets everywhere and using the aforementioned climbing hook is a joy.  As you get further in the game, you will acquire new skills that allow you to explore more, and backtrack and get pickups that you weren't able to earlier, like most other games in the genre.  The map is fine, and gives you the info you need.\n\nStrider looks great!  While it takes place on a 2D plane, there is enough going on in the background, both nearby and far into the city that the world feels alive.   The animation and action is very smooth and feels like it should.  During some of the cutscenes game will zoom in on characters a little closer than it should, and you can see that some of the textures aren't quite up to snuff.  \n\nI seem to have a soft spot for metroidvanias, and I have one for Strider for sure.  Not only did I play the two games I mentioned earlier, when I was young, but as a big fan of Capcoms fighting games, I have a lot of experience with the character.  That all being said, I very much enjoyed my time with Strider.  Two big thumbs up.  \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1640482970, "timestamp_updated": 1640482970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566907286643981934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106503761": {"recommendationid": "106503761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072413397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1662332323}, "language": "english", "review": "I have loved Strider since the 1980's.

Controls were tight, tons of upgrades and collectibles to find, beautiful graphics and music, it was tons of fun. But let's back it up a bit.\n\nJust like the classics, Strider Hiryu is an assassin whose mission is to stop Grandmaster Meio from world domination. He'll have to brave through the city, military bases, underground labs, and more to stop his evil plans. Many enemies and obstacles will try to stop him. Can you help him save the day?\n\nStrider plays like a platformer and Metroidvania meaning that you will be exploring maps and gaining new abilities, weaponry, and skills to gain access to new areas. The story is pretty simple like the classics so there's no deep plot, but the action keeps you hooked in. You start off with just your blade, but as the game progresses you can equip it with different elements and gain more gear. \n\nThe frame rate is pretty smooth as well as the controls. Exploring areas was a lot of fun and if you are good, you can find tons of collectibles that range from concept art, to new costumes you can equip on Strider. Boss fights were very enjoyable. Most times if I found myself stuck on one, I learned what pattern I wasn't following correctly and was able to pass them. I was never stuck in an area or boss for a long amount of time and I always found that satisfying.\n\nThe game is a moderate length as I finished it in about 10 hours, but you can beat it faster if you don't look for collectibles (I got about 70 percent or so when I finished the game). I will say that my ONE gripe with this game is the lack of fast travel. You will unlock these short travel abilities that work between certain zones. However, when you reach the point of no return, there is no way to just hit a map and fast travel to a past area to look for collectibles you are missing. Some of the maps are HUGE so to have to walk through them is a hassle. Other than that, I had a great time with the game.\n\nFinal verdict? If you like Metroidvanias then you NEED this in your library. The action and gameplay were so great, I had fun looking for secrets, and the platforming puzzles offered a fair amount of challenge especially towards the end. Tons of collectibles to find will give you hours of gameplay to enjoy so you can't go wrong with this game. So gear up, grab your blade, and go save the world!

It has a lot of problems, like the terrible primary school level writing in the dialogues (you can't skip them), it starts slow, the first areas are boring and they are hard to tell apart from one another. As a metroidvania is very lacking since the exploration doesn't matter that much and the enemy design (both on artstyle and gameplay desing) are kinda generic and uninteresting.\n\nHowever, if you manage to pass through the first areas and get some power-ups, the combat gets way better, you encounter better designed enemies and the exploration is actually enjoyable. The boss fights are nothing out of the ordinary, but they are well designed and fun to fight. \n\nWhere this game really shines is when you got some power-ups that allows you to slash your way through the rooms like a ninja, and things can become really chaotic since you need to divide your attention on the large amount of enemies and switching between you power-ups to kill enemies with specific mechanics.\n\nOverall this is a fun game, if you don't expect too much from it.

The gameplay is probably this game strongest point as your character from very start feels nimble and acrobatic, with a satisfying combat that makes you feel like you're controlling an actual ninja...and all of this can be enhance by you exploring the map for upgrades. And yes, it's a metroidvania game.\n\nThough this game is without it's flaw, the story is pretty barebone by itself and feels like it's from a Saturday morning cartoon with the characters going pretty hammy on their dialouges...except for the player character, Strider Hiryu which stay pretty stoic and silent through out the game and only speak when necessary but none of the character you'll meet will have any character development through out your roughly 6-8 hours journey\n\nThe OST for this game is pretty mid in my opinon as most of the tracks serves as a amibent for the levels and the sound of your unadulterated carnage will most likely overlap all the music in the game. I remember like 3 tracks which go pretty ham that are: Raid (Opening Stage), Kazahk Theme and The Armed Fortress\n\nI haven't encountered too many bugs myself but I have heard some people on Steam forum that the game would crash if you have certain GPUs and the game key binds cannot be change in-game and you have to change it from a .ini file which should not be a thing even for a 2014 title. But that's about it\n\nOverall, the game is great if you like metroidvania style game like Ori, Hollow Knight...OR if you just happen to know the character from a certain fighting game (Marvel vs. Capcom) and don't know where to start. This is a solid title to try out. I bought this game during the Summer Sale and can't play anything else during the weekend, it's so good \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1625555213, "timestamp_updated": 1625556470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95144729": {"recommendationid": "95144729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063532593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 986, "last_played": 1625531572}, "language": "english", "review": "It's short, but it's a fun challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1625531622, "timestamp_updated": 1625531622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491266340017318726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95137795": {"recommendationid": "95137795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131074907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1625784726}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun remake/reboot of the original Strider.\n\nIt follows the original game design philosophy, as a platformer with interesting level design, but this time the developers put a \"metroidvanesque\" touch in the mix, adding some exploration with backtracking.

Any longer than that, though, and I think the game\u2019s weak points of having samey-looking enviroments, poor enemy variety, and button-mashey combat would\u2019ve made Strider overstay its welcome.\n\nThe story and characters aren\u2019t much to write home about. It gets the job done, and features good voice acting, a badass protagonist, and it may occasionally make you want to punch a cocky villain in the face as they mercilessly tease you while you\u2019re busy wrecking their shiz. Overall, the story is there, but the game doesn\u2019t bog itself down with it, which I think is a good thing.\n\nThe environments are mostly of the \u2018rundown city\u2019, \u2018industrial area\u2019 and \u2018sewer\u2019 variety, with a good heaping of futuristic neon-lighting thrown in. They all kinda blend into each other and have very few landmarks, resulting in areas that rarely feel memorable or unique. And you won\u2019t get much satisfaction from wandering into a boss\u2019s lair and tearing him a new one, because it\u2019ll all just feel like it\u2019s taking place in room #3217 in Generic Industrial Building #87.\n\nEven with he lack of environmental variety, the environments themselves are very finely detailed, with a lot to gawk at in the background. And it helps that the game\u2019s graphics are more than serviceable enough, and  is even detailed enough to have objects reflect off of surfaces or buildings, which is a cool touch.\n\nThinking back on the sound effects, I also cannot say a whole lot aside from saying they were well done. Same with the music, which was sometimes catchy (to the point where I found myself humming one song even when I wasn\u2019t playing the game). No complaints.\n\nRegarding difficulty, this is a game you also want to play on Hard, as Hard is already rather forgiving, and Normal mode pretty much entirely lacks any challenge (especially considering how liberally checkpoints are sprinkled everywhere). Towards the mid-to-late game you may also find yourself just jumping over hoards of enemies and skipping combat entirely. However, there are a handful of encounters, mostly later in the game, that require a decent amount of skill, and bosses that will stomp you if you\u2019re not paying attention or playing sloppily. At least for me, beating some of these encounters and bosses were genuinely challenging, and were quite satisfying to complete.\n\nOverall, Strider is your standard Metroidvania fare. It\u2019s not a masterpiece by any means, but it\u2019s very polished, controls fluidly, and is fun enough for its duration.

Beyond that, you'll be climbing walls, hacking, slashing, and doing cartwheels in the air like the original games, but with a focus on exploration unlike the previous entries.

It's not a \"bad game\" but feels just passable.  Some of what holds it back:\n\n-Analog control only.\nYou can't use the D-Pad to control Strider, which seems really odd for a game like this.  It feels unnatural and imprecise, which then leaves you never feeling like you're satisfied with your movements.  The game tries to compensate for this with lots of healing items spread out across the level, but then it feels like you're going through on 'God Mode' where it doesn't really matter how much damage you take.  If you try to go through it by actually skillfully dodging things, then you're back at square one with the analog control feeling like an inadequate input to do it through, like having to steer from the passenger seat.\n\n-Impact seems absent\nMuch like Strider's movement, his hits also seem to lack impact.  The few times they do hold impact is because of slow-motion, which is not something you want to repeat often as it interrupts the flow.  But it definitely feels like something's missing.  I'm not sure if that's sound design, graphical design, or something else, but there's just a very light feel to everything, like nothing carries weight or substance.\n\n-Somewhat bland\nAt the end, everything feels somewhat bland which is odd because Strider himself is unique and some of the level design touches are unique.  But when everything was put together, it comes off as rather meh.  I feel like it suffers from a case of quantity vs quality.  I would've rather a smaller game with fewer enemies if it meant you'd have a more impactful experience, rather than one that tried to do a lot and came off as unexceptional.\n\nFWIW", "timestamp_created": 1615055442, "timestamp_updated": 1615055442, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498138636350631714", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87580028": {"recommendationid": "87580028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084983695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1614497742}, "language": "english", "review": "its good and just hard enough. if you like metriodvania like games or hack and slash, buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1614479162, "timestamp_updated": 1614479162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87551600": {"recommendationid": "87551600", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969535200", "num_games_owned": 1039, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1224, "last_played": 1613430645}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid platformer.

I'd suggest doing this as soon as you install the game.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/235210/discussions/0/2575445991822522940/", "timestamp_created": 1611487449, "timestamp_updated": 1611487449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85257477": {"recommendationid": "85257477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073112143", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1696817293}, "language": "english", "review": "Gran juego infravalorado!!", "timestamp_created": 1611482435, "timestamp_updated": 1611482435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85228708": {"recommendationid": "85228708", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997429012", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1160, "last_played": 1611407033}, "language": "english", "review": "Great remake and a awesome fast paced metroidvania.", "timestamp_created": 1611438504, "timestamp_updated": 1611438504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85070138": {"recommendationid": "85070138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087076699", "num_games_owned": 709, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1026, "last_played": 1611205961}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good", "timestamp_created": 1611205992, "timestamp_updated": 1611205992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84838259": {"recommendationid": "84838259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359002665", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1683334971}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will not boot up.

But you'll never be happy with exploring the map. \n\nI keep not being able to decide if I should go left or right because one side is a secret with goodies and the other is a cutscene door slammed in your face that you can't return from.

In a dystopian and technically advanced future, a dark Russian has usurped world power and rules from Kazakh City with an iron hand. In the role of the high-tech ninja Hiryu you have to try to find your way through the city to finally kill the \"Grand Master\". Even at the end of the 80s, no dog behind the stove was interested in this story.\n\nStrider sticks to the mechanics that made his ancestor with his gambling hall roots an insider tip and serious challenger for Sega's similar shinobi more than 25 years ago: You run and climb. At the same time, the controls sometimes seem unnecessarily jerky when there are transitions between horizontal and vertical movement. You jump, you fight and split up the robotic opponents - just like before. The action scrolls smoothly in all directions, the attacks that come with two buttons and do without a block flow from the fingers. Dynamic and fast action instead of sneaking and slow assassination are on the program. However, I would suggest choosing expert level A. Because on all others you are at most challenged with the intermediate and final bosses to some extent. The standard enemies are no more than cannon fodder at the C and B levels. It was different back then: Strider was short, but intense and not easy to master. In contrast to the comparatively linear approach of its predecessor, Double Helix builds on a second element: level exploration.\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ large, nested game world\n+ atmospheric art design\n+ demanding combat system\n+ numerous allusions to the classic\n+ good boss fights\n+ a lot to discover\n+ Achievements and trading cards\n\n[h1] Contra [/h1]\n\n- poor story\n- Control during climbing not implemented well\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nSTRIDER \u2122 / \u30b9 \u30c8 \u30e9 \u30a4 \u30c0 \u30fc \u98db \u7adc \u00ae offers you a successful new edition of the ninja action classic, which gives you hectic, dynamic battles with area research of the 2D Castlevanias.\n\n\n[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]\n\nSTRIDER\u2122 / \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u98db\u7adc\u00ae ist ein Action-Abenteuer, welches von Double Helix Games/Capcom entwickelt wurde. \n\n[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]\n\nDass die Geschichte des Ur-Strider aus der Endphase des Kalten Krieges stammt, ist \u00fcberall zu sp\u00fcren. In einer dystopischen und technisch fortgeschrittenen Zukunft hat ein finsterer Russe die Weltmacht an sich gerissen und regiert von Kasach City aus mit eiserner Hand. In der Rolle des Hightech-Ninjas Hiryu muss man versuchen, seinen Weg durch die Stadt zu finden, um schlie\u00dflich den \"Gro\u00dfmeister\" zu t\u00f6ten. Diese Geschichte hat schon Ende der 80er Jahre keinen Hund hinter dem Ofen interessiert. \n\nStrider h\u00e4lt aber an den Mechaniken fest, die seinen Urahn mit seinen Spielhallen-Wurzeln vor mehr gut 25 Jahren zu einem Geheimtipp sowie ernsten Herausforderer f\u00fcr Segas \u00e4hnlich gelagertes Shinobi gemacht haben: Man l\u00e4uft und klettert. Dabei wirkt die Steuerung bei \u00dcberg\u00e4ngen zwischen horizontaler und vertikaler Fortbewegung allerdings manchmal unn\u00f6tig hakelig. Man springt, man k\u00e4mpft und zerteilt die robotischen Gegner - genau wie fr\u00fcher. Das Geschehen scrollt fl\u00fcssig in alle Richtungen,  die mit zwei Kn\u00f6pfen auskommenden und auf einen Block verzichtenden Attacken flie\u00dfen aus den Fingern. Dynamik und schnelle Action statt Schleichen und langsames Meucheln stehen auf dem Programm. Allerdings w\u00fcrde ich vorschlagen, den Experten-Schwierigkeitsgrad A zu w\u00e4hlen. Denn auf allen anderen wird man h\u00f6chstens bei den Zwischen- und Endbossen einigerma\u00dfen gefordert. Die Standard-Gegner sind auf den C- und B-Stufen nicht mehr als Kanonenfutter. Das war damals anders: Strider war zwar kurz, aber intensiv und nicht einfach zu bew\u00e4ltigen. Im Gegensatz zum vergleichsweise linearen Ansatz des Vorg\u00e4ngers baut Double Helix aber noch auf ein zweites Element: Levelerforschung. \n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ gro\u00dfe, verschachtelte Spielwelt\n+ stimmungsvolles Artdesign\n+ forderndes Kampfsystem\n+ zahlreiche Anspielungen auf den Klassiker\n+ gute Bossk\u00e4mpfe\n+ viel zu entdecken\n+ Errungenschaften und Trading Cards\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- magere Geschichte\n- Stuerung beim klettern nicht gut umgesetzt\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nSTRIDER\u2122 / \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u98db\u7adc\u00ae bietet dir eine gelungene Neuauflage des Ninja-Action Klassikers, die dir hektisch-dynamische K\u00e4mpfe mit Gebietserforschung der 2D-Castlevanias vermitteln.", "timestamp_created": 1606292252, "timestamp_updated": 1606292252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630319297313690186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79661252": {"recommendationid": "79661252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073029301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1606053474}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a fan of Strider, know nuts about him other than he appears in MVC games.

It takes the mechanics, the story, the looks, the tone, the feel of the controls, etc., and lets the player enjoy a game which is impressively reminiscent of what came before it. i.e. You'll get nostalgia if you've enjoyed previous Strider games, but if you've never heard of Strider before, you won't feel like you've been snubbed from the treehouse. \n\nI was relieved and happy how often this version would have a new take on familiar bits from the older Strider games, and this new version outdid the older versions without ruining the nostalgic meaningfulness of the older games. i.e. I can still enjoy the earlier Strider games even though THIS one is very, very well-done.\n\nMy only big complaint is that the protagonist's speaking lines often ruin the mystery of the character's personality. Granted, the voice actor still did a great job. (I was always a fan of the professional, enigmatic, rarely-speaks Hiryu who would save the world without any bravado, yee-hahs, arrogance, or one-liners. The Strider 2014 game's dialogue unfortunately doesn't portray the protagonist in a way which allows the audience to admire the character's sense of mystery.)\n\nAll-in-all, I've enjoyed playing this game.

The only REAL reason any of us are here is because there's been such a void of Metroid and Castlevania content for the last decade (1 game in 11 years for Metroid, and that was a remake, and 12 since a REAL Castlevania, excluding Bloodstained). We're so hungry (and desperate) for anything tagged Metroidvania so we'll grab whatever we can get our mitts on. \nNone of us are here because we saw Strider in the list and went \"Oh. A new Strider. I remember playing that on the NES. I've got fond memories of that game. I'll give this one a go\". No. That game was a buggy mess and there were (technically) only 2 games for a reason. \nAt almost 2 hours in I already felt the hot ball of frustration in the pit of my stomach. \n\n- It's tagged as a Metroidvania, but it's really not. It's a 2D side-scrolling action platformer. It doesn't have any of the bare bones of a Metroidvania. MVs have a heavy emphasis on exploration, FREE exploration, with some enemies and obstacles to fill out the trip. This is just slashing following a linear path with zero alternate or branching paths. It's \"Go here. Okay, good. Now go here. And no deviating!\". You are really only allowed to freely explore towards the end once you've got all the power-ups. Until then, doors are locked to keep you on the path. Unlike Super Metroid that lets you go in multiple directions, and depending on which way you go, you'll have differing abilities and health/ammo compared to a friend who plays it too. This game, though, you and a friend will have the exact same experience. \n\nBut my biggest gripe: LET ME CUSTOMISE THINGS! Your options menu is useless! \n\n- Let me use the D-pad! \nWhy, oh WHY, do I HAVE to use the analog stick for a side-scroller!? You know, the games where you need precision when jumping around and aiming? You'll be mid-boss and are slashing in the wrong direction, or you'll slide instead of jumping, or will jump up instead of off the wall. Side-scrollers are 2D, so let me use the 2D movement buttons! The movement keys on the keyboard use the arrows. No one uses these anymore. It's WASD for movement! At least I can customise the controller buttons through Steam and emulate the D-pad acting as the left joystick. There are battles fought on floating balls that I believe is the sole reason you use the joystick to move; so it's easier to get your head around. It would have been better that holding left goes anticlockwise, while holding right makes you go clockwise. The final boss was all kinds of confusing. I have no idea how I didn't die because I was all over the place. \n\n- Let me turn off subtitles! \nWhy is it in Japanese action games when there's text on screen it fills up half the goddamn screen? Think Attack on Titan. Anytime you kill a titan, SUBJUGATED appears over the entire screen and blocks your entire view. The same is here. I'm trying to explore, and some Russian a-hole spreading his propaganda over the loudspeaker won't shut his trap. That's fine in itself, but every time he speaks, the text box covers 1/4 of my screen, covering any vents or platforms that are at eye-level, and can't see anything below. Give me an option to remove the text boxes or turn off subtitles, or at least alter the text size. I do heave ears, you know! The battle against Solo was infuriating with his text boxes (which are only full of taunts and nothing useful) covering the bottom 1/4 of my screen, and therefore covering the floor which explosions rise up from. Ugh! Who designed this! Was it even tested? Don't even get me started on the text boxes covering the battle with Meio! \n\n- What's the point of having a health bar when health packs are literally floating around at every entrance and lining every rooftop? I never felt that I was in danger. I died once, and that was against Solo for the reason stated above. \n\nPROS\n\n- I mean, it looks good. I guess. \n\n- Music is cool. I've found myself bobbing my head to some of the faster tracks. \n\nThat's about it, really. If I could use customise the controllers, and not through Steam, and turn off subtitles, I'd have had a much smoother experience. Sorry, Hiryu. As cool as I think you look, and as much as I love you in Marvel vs Capcom, you once again have an average-at-best solo title. \nThere are better, ACTUAL Metroidvania games out there. (Hollow Knight, Axiom Verge, Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, Iconoclasts, Bloodstained, Blasphemous, Salt and Sanctuary. Hell, Seasons After Fall was way less frustrating than this, and that's a Metroidvania that's aimed at a younger audience, and it doesn't even have any enemies!) \nI grabbed Strider for 5 bucks, I think. That's all I'd pay considering how often I found myself cursing at the screen, ESPECIALLY the projectile/spitting enemies. \n\nHOWEVER, after all that, once I had all the power-ups after about 8-8.5 hours and was making my way through all the levels again with free movement, that was fun, which is why ultimately I give it a thumbs up. It took 8 hours for it to be fun, but I got there. \n\nTO THE DEVELOPERS: You'll find that people who love Metroidvanias also love things like Final Fantasy. Know what these have in common? Adventure. Travelling. Exploration. It's not the combat we love. That's part of it. The main thing is the travelling. Just the player and character alone together taking in the surroundings. That's what we want. Not our hand held telling us we only have one option. If for your next Strider game you had far fewer cannon fodder enemies, more exploration/more choices available for which ways to go, the choice to decide which power-up to go for first, fewer projectile enemies all crammed together, and a few tweaks to the control scheme (especially the 360 combat), that'd be something I'd love to play and would look forward to. \nAlso, why not a story-heavy turn-based JRPG? Read the Strider manga. It's got a great setting and story for a JRPG, and the striders' abilities would work in one", "timestamp_created": 1599564729, "timestamp_updated": 1599745210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476666659116744995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75596650": {"recommendationid": "75596650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008967093", "num_games_owned": 882, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 888, "last_played": 1599445092}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the original Strider on the NES.

It has a stage layout that encourages exploration, but then makes gameplay and major upgrades entirely linear.\n\nAll of the old Strider's elements are here: The colorful, future-ninja aesthetic. The wavy red [strike]scarf[/strike]plasma exhaust. Clinging to walls, hanging from ceilings, performing flips, slides, and throwing kunai knives, it's all here. You face off against [strike]Russia[/strike] Eastern European dictatorship with an army of thousands of faceless clone/cyborg soldiers while its citizens try to stay the hell out of the way.\n\nStrider's best encounters ([spoiler]like fighting Ouroboros in the air[/spoiler]) occur in the game's opening act. From there it starts to slide downhill. You'll start to notice that there really isn't any much variety to the enemies outside of the bosses, pallete swaps, and a few weapon changes. \n\nThe most annoying enemies are the shield mooks that carry around riot shields that sometimes glow with plasma energy. To kill them, you have to blow away their shield with a charged shot. While these enemies look like you can attack them at different angles than their shields, allowing for more skillful approaches, this is not possible. Later in the game, you have to match your plasma energy to theirs to take out the shield, which becomes a really annoying game of 'Simon Says' that detracts from a good flow.\n\nThe camera sometimes zooms in more than necessary, or shifts and hides vital combat information. While this is annoying, the moments where it truly impacts gameplay are rare. The most irksome time this happened was during the fight against Zero, who has an attack that causes the floor to explode beneath you while hovering in a place at the top of the screen. Yet, when you double-jump up to attack him, the camera shifts to where the explosive floor cannot be seen, making it difficult to determine where you can safely land.\n\nThe most glaring flaw in this game is how the world opens up as you gather upgrades. While there are some sections that require upgraded movement types to access, many upgrades are locked behind glowing doors that require certain plasma unlocks to open, of which there are four. It comes off as lazy work at best.\n\nIf you are a fan of retro platformers, it's worth a play-thru. \nIf you are looking for a really good Metroidvania, look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1598617294, "timestamp_updated": 1598617294, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74990123": {"recommendationid": "74990123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020238689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1449515795}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2605\u2606\u2606", "timestamp_created": 1598512181, "timestamp_updated": 1598512181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74741116": {"recommendationid": "74741116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142401642", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1691549262}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es divertido", "timestamp_created": 1598124386, "timestamp_updated": 1598124386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74687062": {"recommendationid": "74687062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035342078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1664341845}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait until it's on sale only.", "timestamp_created": 1598044292, "timestamp_updated": 1598044292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74253092": {"recommendationid": "74253092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095217331", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 408, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1129, "last_played": 1597341105}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 (If you count for the fact that it's a 2D side scroller)\n\nWhat a game!

Overall though, this is a hack and slash through and through because of how simple the bosses are. I blitzed through this game, and got the speedrun achievement on my first and only playthrough, which I found hilarious. This combat system starts showing its weakness when later in the game things start chunking your health and stun locking you. Stun locking is NEVER FUN, especially since the movement is not built for dodging, and stunning projectiles are spammed heavily.\n\nI did really like the platforming in this game. The ability to stick to any wall was cool and they really designed the game around that ability.

It was really badass and magical, the epic of the mysterious ninja going to war against the robotic soviet army led by an evil alien sorceror. Yeah Strider is a game that relies solely on aesthetic impressions and the story doesn't make sense. Trying to develop that story would have only resulted into incoherent divagations and the developers of this game didn't fall into this trap. \nBack then, arcade machines were miles ahead of home consoles/computers for graphic, animation and sound. this game was a real trip. I had a real fetish for this game and I was eager to be back in the 3d remastered feeric.\n\nInitially the remaster looks very good, as soon as you reach the second level you reconnect with the magic of the huge overbearing city which is one of the game's main character.\nThe coldness and magnificence of the megalopolis is excellently rendered, with great attention to details, and it made me happy to be back into New Kazakh. The third level is very impressive too, with a huge dam to scale before you reach the military area.\nUnfortunately this is where the good things stop.\n\nMaking an arcade style gameplay in the 201xs wouldn't make sense on home consoles/computers, that's why they turned the game into a metroidvania. Or more precisely a semi-metroidvania.\nThis could have been clever, there is the exploration aspect of the metroidvania mixed with some long horizontal or vertical areas where you have to fight your way like in the arcade game.\nUnfortunately it doesn't work. In the first couple hours your characters doesn't have enough weapons and mobility options and the constant backtracking through short foxholes and mazes is a bit annoying.\nAs soon as you power up sufficiently , it becomes less annoying but the enemies are not very varied. Most of the enemies you'll encounter are pallette swap of 3/4 different soldiers.\n\nThere are a lot of bosses, most of them being ports of the original arcade bosses and mid-bosses, they're almost all there (except the roided super soldier of the first level for some reason) but the game has a serious lack of difficulty and most of the bosses can be defeated in less than 5 minutes. The main levels are also fairly easy and you'll only lose if you are very carefree. The game doesn't really require any skill and you can zap through it in a few hours if you don't collect all the crap.\nYeah collectibles seem to be one of the main gameplay elements here, if you don't waste your time collecting useless concept art and costumes like the devs intended, you can finish the game in less than ten hours. Even despite the adversity of the floorplans that will force you to come back 3 times through each of the levels, each time you get able to open new color-coded doors.\nThere are 3 different color-coded weapon types that you have to acquire, but you can feel this gameplay is tacked on and forced. Only the second one is useful against bosses because it does a lot more damage.\nAll in all I'd say the gameplay is very undeveloped.\n\nAs for the universe, and since the metroidvania format demands that all takes place in one huge area, we lose a lot of the diversity of the original game. Here you won't be fighting amazons and dinosaurs in a mushroom infested forest, or wolves in the desolate tundra. Everything takes place in one huge city. Unfortunately, after the dam level, everything becomes metallic militarized corridors till the end of the game. They added an underground black market with an insurgency leader that doesn't do anything interesting, but there is very little graphical difference with the other levels. They also added an \"underground temple\" which is more of the same, with weird frescos in the background (and unexplainable graphical slow-downs)\nEven the flying fortress \"Balrog\" doesn't make you feel like you're on an airship. It's just more metallic corridors.\n\nThe music is the worst part in the game, it's some insipid techno music that vaguely copies some melodic segment from the original music but the whole thing is so mediocre it's barely noticeable.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1591832824, "timestamp_updated": 1591834130, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70557455": {"recommendationid": "70557455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991825315", "num_games_owned": 2613, "num_reviews": 665, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1592858056}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very good game.

At first it seems like you're being pushed along and there's little room to backtrack, but you'll get your chance later in the game once you gain more abilities.

It's not a perfect game but holy fuck, this game is addicting and fast-paced - pretty fun actually!\n\nStrider is a 2014 title developed by Double Helix and they ahve not made many titles, one of the more recognizable ones being MX vs. ATV Reflex which isn't a bad game neither, but Capcom was on the publishing side of things this time to not muck up the game...the cutscenes don't show much detail but from a third-party company, that's good enough for 2014 standards. The game's story is a bit different from the original Strider released decades ago, but it is still very faithful.\n\nYou control Strider Hiryu, one of the few strider survivors many years ago, after he lost many of them, heading down to the city of Kazakh to put an end to Grandmaster Meio's plans and rule the world From here upon landing, it's not just a side scroller - this my friend, is a metroidvania take on it. You can still beat the game with hardly many upgrades, but you will have to rely on few of them. Once you start able to slide, dive down attacks and charge your Cypher sword, from there, it gets better. The more upgrades you get, the better you feel. Health, energy, and the likes. There is other collectables too. Explore the land!\n\nHowever this is not an easy game, it features three difficulties - Easy, the usual Normal, and the more frience Hard, if you want to challenge yourself. The game has a variety of enemies, mini-boss and bosses that will test your abilities. Will you have what it takes to put an end to Grandmaster Meio's plans? And you can bet your life on it, Solo will have none of it, neither the Tong sisters, or rather now called, The Wind. And it's not a  Strider game if you don;t have the infamous Mecha-Pon, a metal mecha Gorilla!\n\nThe soundtrack of the game has been remixed and it's by far one of the best of the saga. One thing to point out as a con, if you are playing with a new computer that has more than 12 cores in your CPU, you will be unable to play it - but I think if my theory is right, you can still play if you disable few cores on your computer, advanced stuff though.\n\nFinal verdict, Strider is one of the best Metroidvanias your money can buy - the saga while forgotten, the character isn't. Strider Hiryu will be always one of Capcom best and badass character for years to come. I fully recommend the game. Now, what are you waiting for?

A un precio bajo es buena compra.\nLos puntos negativos que le veo son: Los dise\u00f1os tanto de enemigos como el mapa es un poco mon\u00f3tono, los bosses no son nada complicados y que al principio puede hacerse algo pesado, pero mola.", "timestamp_created": 1585070233, "timestamp_updated": 1585070233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65562638": {"recommendationid": "65562638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208226573", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 864, "last_played": 1584811597}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game with alot of collectibales to get and alot of exploration.", "timestamp_created": 1584893373, "timestamp_updated": 1584893373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65542282": {"recommendationid": "65542282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981003101", "num_games_owned": 1131, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 891, "last_played": 1584965379}, "language": "english", "review": "If you ever played Strider on Mega Drive / Genesis, this keeps the roots of the original while expanding on the format.

That's this game, and it's a mixture that is both insanely satisfying as it is frustrating!  :)  Re-used sfx and remixed music done in the most cohesive way it could've been done, fast and frenetic gameplay that's both really responsive and really demanding of precision when playing at higher difficulties, and an open world that allows for both exploration and expansion of Strider's abilities...  WOW! I love this game! It's almost perfect!\n\nAlmost.\n\nIn regards to the Nintendo Hard aspect, the baddies will attack you off-screen and have all kinds of dick moves that'll either hit you like a crazy-good grenade toss worthy of a youtube clip, or they'll stunlock the crap out of you for a (near) fatal combo if you're playing at the hardest difficulty. HOWEVER, that's only in the higher difficulty settings; easier settings are way more forgiving. Some of the out-of-the-way areas have the simplest aspects, but get so annoying that you'll have one of two reactions: either it's so stupid-yet-so-hard you'll throw your controller into the wall (like the one where all you gotta do is double-jump but once you complete it getting back across will drive you insane), or you'll realize it's meant to be that way and relax into a sorta Zen state and just keep doing it until you nail it. But THAT'S THE THING! YOU'RE A NINJA DOING NINJA THINGS! It has that aspect of performing those jumps/moves that demand a razor edge precision that you NEED to pull it off perfectly or you're just not worthy of being called a Strider!\n\nBoss battles are definitely challenging the first time but because the game doesn't punish you by sending you back half the level you can quickly and easily learn from your mistakes and try again almost immediately. Yeah, the first time you get wrecked you're pretty annoyed, but you can go right back less than a minute later with your newfound knowledge and say, 'Yeah, gonna tear you up this time!', and you typically can, until you get to the higher difficulty settings, then it humbles you a couple dozen more times until you either pass or rage quit and head to Gamestop to buy another controller. That's exactly how Strider should be.\n\nBut it's not without its flaws, tho maybe it's by design.\n\nWhile the game is simple in graphical design, allowing it to run silky smooth even on the most mediocre of systems, it's also framerate locked, i.e. it's specifically designed to run at 60fps, which is both good AND bad. If you want the game to actually run SLOWER, make sure the vertical refresh is locked, then reduce your monitors refresh rate to 30hz and, BOOM, now the game runs at half speed! Want an insane speed challenge that pushes your very reflexive limits? Up the refresh rate if your monitor allows. I haven't seen this since the days when games were locked to the clock speed of a CPU in the old DOS days and pressing the 'turbo' button could slow it down in an instant, but hey, it is what it is. Either speed it up for a challenge, slow it down so you don't get wrecked, or lock it at 60fps. At least you have choice.\n\nDownside: The game only allows for a single contiguous save, meaning you can't have multiple save files. Start a new game and you start a new save, and you play that save until it either ends or you start a new one. Kinda ruins having that one perfect save with 100% completion while having the other saves to challenge yourself, but that's likely to keep within the arcade ideal of 'You put in your quarters and you get this one play-thru, so you do what you do and either win or go home!' aspect. I get it, and yet I don't like it entirely. Still, that's the only complaint I have.\n\nOh, and one other. I played the original, and it had you killing actual people in it. This one replaces nearly all of them with robots in order to stay politically correct. Doesn't take away from the fun, but it takes away some of the brutality of the original. You're supposed to be a ninja wrecking the 80's era communist empire, so the slaughter of countless nameless, faceless nobodies should be par for the course! Oh well, it doesn't take away from the fun.\n\nUnless you're they type who doesn't care for TRUE arcade-style super reflexive twitchy platformers with lots of action, then GET! THIS! GAME! It's an old school arcade remix dream come true!

I had a huge grin on my face for most of the time while playing this game. It's simply very fun to play as an over-powered ninja :D\n\nTo be clear, I am not having fun just because the story says \"Strider\" is an over-powered ninja. Pretty much any game tells you what the character is supposed to be, but what's really difficult to achieve is to convince the player through GAMEPLAY. Whoever designed the player character should be given all the credit in the world. Pretty much everything about this character screams that he's a ninja.  First of all, you can attack as fast as you can mash the attack button. I don't think I've ever seen this before in other games that I've played, but after playing this game I wish other games did this as well. It was so much fun spamming the attack button in an enemy's face. You're a ninja. You SHOULD be able to cut enemies up really fast :D. Also, the 1st attack in a chain, Strider will yell \"HA\", which feels cool. Second of all, all of Strider's moves are very stylized. The way he attacks, runs, STANDS, etc. Everything he does just oozes style and it's so fun to watch him in action.\n\nOk, so you're playing as a cool as hell ninja. While that's nice, if the gameplay is not engaging, then you're quickly going to get bored. That ALMOST happened in the 1st hour or so. That's because you're mostly just running straight, jumping every so often, and spamming the attack button whenever you're close to an enemy. However, the game steadily introduces new mechanics to keep the gameplay from getting stale.\n\n1st, the game introduces charge attacks (i.e. hold down the attack button for a stronger attack). These attacks are needed against enemies who have shields, because if you regularly attack an enemy with a shield, Strider will get stunned and you'll be open to taking damage. Simple but effective way to force the player to use a new mechanic.\n\n2nd, the game introduces kunais. These effectively grant Strider a way to attack enemies at range. Because this gives you a whole new way to take down enemies (i.e. at range), you will always have to decide whether it's best to take down certain enemies by melee or ranged (ranged is not always the best option because it takes energy that recharges slowly). Furthermore, kunais effectively are a damage boost to melee since you can spam the attack button AND spam kunais right in an enemy's face :D\n\n3rd, the game introduces \"special plasma\" attacks. These are basically special attributes you can apply to your attacks. There are 4 special attributes: reflect, fire, freeze, magnetic. The reflect plasma makes combat more tactical, because with the ability to reflect attacks, you have a new way to take down enemies (and is better than kunais since reflecting an attack doesn't cost energy). Fire plasma is very useful because it adds damage to your attacks. Freeze and magnetic plasma are\u2026\u2026. Just sorta there :P. I didn't really use them much. They look cool though.\n\nFinally, the game introduces \"Option\" attacks. Options are basically special moves, of which you have 3 of. You can use an eagle that damage enemies in an arc, a droid that gives you a shield and attacks enemies whenever you attack, and a panther that runs along the ground attacking any enemies in the way. Once you get these Options, that's when the \"over-powered\" of \"over-powered ninja\" starts kicking in. There's pretty much no cool down on these Options AND you can use them AT THE SAME TIME. So you can spam attack while throwing kunais while an eagle, droid, and panther wreck all of the enemies' shit :D :D :D. Options made the game a lot of fun. It was so satisfying to kill like 3-4 enemies with a well-timed eagle or panther attack, or killing a big enemy that took a minute to kill in the past to now be dead in like a few seconds.\n\nBecause the game keeps introducing new mechanics at a steady pace, the game never became boring. It just got more and more fun. There's not a lot of enemy variety (I think 6 enemies), but the enemies that are there are distinct from each other and require different approaches to take them down. The platforming is also fairly challenging. The progression system is simple, yet effective. You can get health ups, energy ups, kunai # increases, kunai range increases, and energy recharge ups. \n\nMy main gripe with the game is with the bosses. Because you're an over-powered ninja, nothing is really a challenge for you. While I can accept that with regular enemies, I think at least bosses should provide some challenge. But they really didn't. I died at most once at some bosses. Their attacks are fairly easy to dodge and even when they do hit, they don't do much damage. While it's fun to be an over-powered ninja, SOME adversity would be nice.\n\nThe story is another missed opportunity. Everyone apart from Strider is a fucking cartoon. And not a fun cartoon. It also doesn't help that all of their voices are annoying and what they say is cheesy as hell. There are GENIUS lines such as \"progress, technology, and SCIENCE are against you\" and  \"you cannot win. I have gun\" -_-. There's no real story here. Everyone is just a cartoon villain that Strider has to take down. No character development, reason for why anything is happening, or whatever. The only reason there's a \"story\" is so that we know what the bosses look like ahead of time :P.\n\nOverall, I had a real fun time with this game. Normally, a game this easy wouldn't entertain me this much. But this game just hit all the right buttons.

But this was alleviated fairly quickly. As I obtained upgrades and traversed the world, I enjoyed the game more and more. I will say that you have to hunt for the various collectibles and upgrades, and I had some VERY frustrating moments backtracking and getting lost. I found the map to work very well once I was in the right area, but found it to be difficult to figure out which way I needed to go to travel to an area after I had already passed it. But by the end of my Hard mode run, having obtained every collectible and upgrade, I felt plenty powerful and beating the final boss felt very rewarding! The game readily introduces new mechanics and enemy types and manages to give you a sense of freedom in what is really a linear experience. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys games that fall under the Metroidvania category or someone who likes challenging action games or platformers in general. \n\nP.S. Don't feel pressured to grab everything if you don't care about costumes, artwork, challenge modes, or even all of the upgrades! You can beat the game without them on the lower difficulties.

Do you want to see an example of how to masterfully reboot a classic arcade franchise right? If you answered yes to any of this, then Strider is just the game for you!\n\nEven if you've never played a Strider game before, don't worry, this is a reboot. it's essentially a re-imagining of the original arcade game as a metroidvania. You play as this high-tech ninja-like assassin who's mission is to fight through a Soviet-esque futuristic dystopian city and assassinate the mysterious tyrant known only as The Grandmaster. Along the way, you fight his various minions and machines that are sent your way.\n\nThe mechanics are all well designs and each of your the powers you get feel as fun to use as they are useful. Enemies are introduced in a way so that you learn the game's mechanics and learn how to take down enemies with the tools at your disposal. Don't think the path to victory will be won thru spamming your standard sword, because you will need to use your charge attack to break thru defenses, your options to hit far away enemies, your reflecting plasma to throw enemy shots back at em, and your myriad mobility techniques to dodge your foes' attacks. Overall, combat feels fluid and the controls feel evolved from past games.\n\nMy only complaint is that the music doesn't feel nearly as memorable as what was in Strider 1 and Strider 2 and the character animations in cutscenes feel stiff, but outside that, this is a beautiful metroidvania and an excellent reboot of a capcom property.

Difficulty can veer a bit too much on the easy side, but still enough of a challenge to be satisfying.\n\nContext on when I made the review: currently I'm at ~30 hours, almost finished the game on hard. I restarted from a previous playthrough where I had also almost beaten the game, then just put it down. I'm trying to 100% it & I'm slow, so bear in mind my hours spent are probably inflated.\n\nProduction quality: top notch, graphics are gorgeous, soundtrack is kicken, runs like a dream. I have noticed a few issues on my recent playthrough with clipping bugs (eg. hit an enemy wrong, got stuck in a ceiling), but we're talking something on the order of once every 5 hours or so.\n\nHow Metroidvania is it?: It keeps to the basic formula of gated doors, and platforms out of reach until you get various enhancer abilities. Game progression is highly linear, but cleverly hidden with occasional backtracking, to roughly the same degree as Super Metroid. In terms of sheer amounts of stuff to find & hunt down, it's actually pretty good, with a 100+. That includes the actual progression abilities, upgrades to health/energy, large heal pickups, and unlockable concept art, story lore, costumes, and mini-game modes. Excepting the large heal pickups, they nicely avoid the trap some other metroidvanias get into where most pickups just give you in-game money. Basically very by-the-numbers implementation of the formula, no bait-&-switch by people who think the genre name is whatever the fuck they want it to be. \n\nChallenge: I jumped right in on Hard, haven't had too much of a problem, which might indicate it is on the easy side. Game definitely does tend to spike in difficulty on certain bosses and for certain sections. Overall I would call it satisfying but not ultra-hard bragging rights worthy.\n\nLength: Core game is a bit on the short & sweet side, like the linearity comparisons to Super Metroid are apt. Of note, some of the unlockables are for either Beacon Run & Survival mini-games you play directly from the main menu, which can be seen as a supplement to the main game.\n\nNegative stuff:\nEnemy variety is the big weak point, they could have definitely improved in this area. A few core types that they then provide variations on. One note I want to make here... while the game does indeed use color coded enemies, the corresponding weapons actually have different enough characteristics that switching up does have some tactical implications. Fire cypher does the best damage, so that's my main, but I'm sacrificing the defensive benefit of the reflect cypher and the range of the magnet cypher. Magnet cypher is a long range weapon, but unlike the other 3 weapons it's hit rate is capped.The end result is you have to do some tactical thinking about what enemy to take out in what order, and switching fluidly to the right weapon for the job, which is a good thing. Basically the color coding isn't the problem here so much as it is there are not enough core enemy types with color coded variations.\n\nOther negative thing that stood out to me were the large health canister collectibles, they're just very boring and don't even really give that much benefit. Basically a one-time heal, that doesn't even really heal that much. Very disappointing, in particular when juxtaposed with the other types of collectibles.\n\nOther things of note:\nThe game has some deliberately tricky platforming sections, and this is a focus of the experience. Mileage varies of course whether you think that is a good or bad thing.\n\nI absolutely do not agree with some of the other reviews saying there was not enough variety between areas. Each area is very distinct, with a consistent theme and distinct game play challenges. Each area is set in a future-marxist-hell-city, so obviously there is some similarities in style, but the claim they lack variety is influenced more by those reviewers not liking the game in general vs. being factual. It's kind of like bitching that Metroid levels are all a bunch of cave like corridors, or Symphony of the Night levels are all in a castle TBH.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565546196, "timestamp_updated": 1565546196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54256557": {"recommendationid": "54256557", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980076617", "num_games_owned": 940, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1563806039}, "language": "english", "review": "It does not work on modern multiprocessor PC\n", "timestamp_created": 1563901733, "timestamp_updated": 1563901733, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471311450004577637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54077086": {"recommendationid": "54077086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000856057", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 587, "last_played": 1562723644}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game with good visuals and a kick-ass soundtrack.

I'm glad I finally got around to it. Strider is a great game. \n\nStrider is a game designed to emulate what made classic action/metroidvania games so good. And I think it succeeds in most aspects. The gameplay is great. Platforming and combat are fun. It feels good to play because of the tight controls and variety of mechanics that you're given. I really enjoyed the majority of the boss fights. Some were a bit too easy but a fair few of them were genuinely challenging and well designed, at least on normal difficulty.\n\nExploring in Strider is fun but I will say that a lot of the areas are fairly underwhelming and lacklustre. Enemy types are also fairly repetitive but I felt like they did enough with them to keep that interesting at least. Unfortunately the areas not being that interesting made backtracking and finding all the upgrades and secrets kind of unappealing to me. So if you're looking for a noteworthy metroidvania, Strider may not be the game for you.

I have been putting off playing it (2019 for a 2014 game) cause I heard it was a metroidvania . \nI was excited at first. One my first games as a kid, on my first console, was getting a new game. Considering how relatively unknown Strider is; but I sighed when I heard it was metroidvania in a market saturated with them. Ori, Dust, Guacamelee, Axiom verge ect. I  didn't think Strider a side scrolling action platformer would need the additions of upgrades and branching paths.\nThankfully they did make it work all while reinvigorating a lot of what made 16 bit strider (never played the ps1 sequel) awesome. I especially love how the type: a,b, and c drones were remade especially b who is only usable 3 times in the original. Boss and enemy redesigns are good world and level designs are good. Although I was a little disappointed there was no jungle area with dinosaurs or ice mountain with wolves like the original. There was also no updated fight for the one dragon boss from the original. These complaints don't hinder the game  in general I know why these elements weren't included; just a fanboy picking at the tiniest of nits. \nGameplay wise everything clicks  Double Helix games should be commended for getting Striders movement down pat. I jumped right in and it was like slipping on an old glove; Strider still handles exactly like I remember, From sword swings to jumping and climbing everything felt so familiar. Impressive considering I was playing a new game with a new controller.  If I have to be critical the only controls I would change is instead of the the left button or LB ( I used an xbox one controller) for accessing the the bot upgrade menu I would have made it the left trigger it just didn't feel right.\nI had a blast playing this. It brought back so many memories for me and as a fan I cannot recommend it enough. Its a reboot that done right keeping what made the original great while bringing a lot of new content that compliments and improves the game.

Tiempo despues, un amigo me llam\u00f3 y me dijo que la habia visto en un bar. Y all\u00e1 que nos fuimos, como siempre, en busca de un nuevo vicio. Dicha recreativa era Strider, y desde ese entonces, ha sido uno de mis arcades favoritos.\n\nUna pila de a\u00f1os despues, aparece este que nos ocupa, que conserva toda la movilidad genial que ya tenia el original, y la lleva aun m\u00e1s all\u00e1. \u00bfY que ocurre cuando uno de mis arcades favoritos se convierte en un metroid? Pues que si la cosa est\u00e1 bien hecha (como es el caso), llevas una franquicia (que estaba muerta) a un genero que me encanta. Ya lo jugu\u00e9 en Ps3 (con su correspondiente platino) y ahora lo he vuelto a tocar.\n\nPero como todo tiene sus fallitos, y aunque no s\u00f3n muchos, ahi van:\n\n-Poca variedad en los escenarios. Este es el aspecto m\u00e1s flojo sin duda (para mi, al menos). La mayoria se parecen demasiado entre s\u00ed. Si, s\u00f3n diferentes, pero al final no te queda esa sensacion de otros metroids de saber donde est\u00e1s, porque no s\u00e9 si este era el laboratorio o los cuarteles.\n\n-La navegaci\u00f3n por el mapa. Hay puntos de viaje r\u00e1pido (o algo parecido), pero est\u00e1n muy mal repartidos (o eso me ha parecido), y no sabes a donde te llevar\u00e1n. De hecho, m\u00e1s que viaje r\u00e1pido (el t\u00edpico que te deja elegir destino), es un atajo fijo a otras zonas, y como no sabes a donde van... lo mismo te das una pateada para nada.\n\nAl margen de esto... el control es excelente, el juego es r\u00e1pido, la m\u00fasica est\u00e1 directamente sacada del arcade en algunos momentos... y nos puede durar unas 8/10 horas, dependiendo de lo concienzudo que seas. Aunque si vas directo al grano se puede hacer en menos de 4.\n\nPor no alargar m\u00e1s, le casco un 8'5 y desde luego, lo recomiendo. No es el mejor del genero, ni el m\u00e1s original (ni falta le hace), pero es una muy buena opci\u00f3n, especialmente si te gusta el genero y como a m\u00ed, te encant\u00f3 el arcade.\n\nY en el pr\u00f3ximo Manqueando... \"Steamworld Dig 2\" (cava, cava, cava!!!)", "timestamp_created": 1551785267, "timestamp_updated": 1551785267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518053352832794189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49316815": {"recommendationid": "49316815", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995919019", "num_games_owned": 1503, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1551454079}, "language": "english", "review": "Recent installment in Strider series is rather a metroidvania than simple platformer.

NOPE. NOPE.\n\nPlayed on Easy, with controller. Breached through the game. You jump over regular enemies, keep spamming the attack button and the bosses... well, at least on Easy there's no strategy required. You just mash buttons. Doesn't matter, most bosses are horribly designed anyway. So, 4 (!!) hours later, I reached the final elevator.\n\nOnly to die like 10 times to BULLSHIT ice rockets. F C K this SHIT, I'm out.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nCame back a day later, salt removed from my system. Turns out I got stuck right before the final boss. Somehow managed to beat the part where I died over and over again... on my first attempt. I don't get it.\n\nOn to the final boss. Died only once to each boss form (\"this isn't even my final form\"-cliche), beat the game on Easy with a final ingame time of 3 hrs, 27 minutes and 42% completion rate. So you get what, maybe 5-6 hours of content out of this game?\n\nProof: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1651468097\n\nI have no idea how anyone can play this game for more than 10 hours.\n\n- The controls are HORRENDOUS. Your ninja dude just sticks to whatever walls he feels like. Good luck on the anti-gravity and upside-down rooms. These have no place in this game. They only fuck up the controls even more.\n\n- Instead of looking at the game, I often completely navigated via the map. Just follow the arrow, jump over everything, dash straight through everything. You can literally play huge parts of this game by mostly looking at the map in the top right corner. 10/10 game design.\n\n- The music is forgettable, the graphics are straight outta 2008.\n\n- There is no power up in the game that feels like it actually means progress. All 4 power ups are just glorified keys to open some fancy new doors you couldn't open before. I used the fire power up for most of my playthrough. Only switched to Ice or Magnet when I absolutely had to. The red plasma... well, what does it exactly do? Reflect bullets? Awesome. NEXT.\n\n- 2 of the 4 power ups are worthless. The red plasma does nothing that matters what the yellow (fire) can't do, the purple one (magnet) is completely useless in combat because it replaces your sword with some sort of projectile... that needs to come back to you before you can slash again. So you often press the attack button and nothing happens. Great. So, yeah, only ice and fire are worth a damn, and ice often just freezes enemies in place, so you have to jump over them instead of just rushing & slashing through them.\n\n- Useless secrets. Concept Art? \"Enemy intel\"? Who needs that crap? Give me stuff that MATTERS.\n\n- Uninteresting enemies. Most enemies are just color-swapped enemies you met before. Even the bosses get recycled. Why? There are 3 ninja ladies... you first fight #1, then you #1 and #2 at the same time, and then you fight #1, #2 and #3 at the same time. Yeah, really interesting. Only girl #4 was actually a threat.\n\n- The story... well... what story? There is no story. You go here, go there, meet some dudes, talk 2 sentences with each dude and that's it. The main evil guy that appears all the time... well, you kill him like 60% through the story. Wtf? But wait, there's more. There's a bigger baddie! So the real evil main guy shows himself for the first time... only right before the end. Why? And he's not even interesting. It's just some generic undead wizard guy or something. The whole story can be summed up by \"good Ninja fights evil wizard\". Sure. Never seen that before. Totally unique. Good job.\n\n- My thumb hurts from spamming the attack button.\n\nThis game is probably good if you're dedicated enough to speedrun this SHIT, but as a casual gamer... stay away. There's just nothing in this game that's new or innovative in any way. It's a generic game with a generic hero, generic enemies and generic power ups.\n\nPS: I also checked speedrun.com for this game now - they run the game on Easy because Normal & Hard for the most part only make bosses tankier. So if even those few people that have put the most hours into this game are not interested in higher difficulties, I certainly won't bother.", "timestamp_created": 1549747077, "timestamp_updated": 1549814425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.184089973568916321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48594623": {"recommendationid": "48594623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002205586", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1549632182}, "language": "english", "review": "damn it's a good fun game", "timestamp_created": 1548614775, "timestamp_updated": 1548614775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48554259": {"recommendationid": "48554259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273556446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1065, "last_played": 1547317717}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an awesome time and a lot of fun to complete.", "timestamp_created": 1548462098, "timestamp_updated": 1548462098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48513743": {"recommendationid": "48513743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963275016", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1548286218}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a horrible slow muddy trend chasing metroid wanna be pile of trash. strider is slow in his movements. the controls feel like your moving through playdoh.

Huh... Well, what should I say...\n\nFor starters, if you are familiar with the Strider series, you might want to rethink for a moment... Unless you are REALLY familiar, and by that I mean \"being aware the NES version exists\". Why this? Because this version of Strider plays closer to that of the NES, in that you explore the places and find items required to progress, the main difference being this is full-on exploration with upgrades to find on the way, as well as costumes of previous Striders, artwork and enemy information. Like in most Strider games, you can simply mash attack to deal with some enemies on the way, while others requires a different approach, including the use of Options, changing the Cypher's element, charging the attack, sliding, slamming, etc.\n\nAnother aspect is the difficulty of the game don't expect an easy trip through Normal, early enemies won't be much a threat, but if you don't know where nor how to regain health you will find yourself dying... A lot. By endgame you WILL want to be at full power. The pacing may feel a bit slow, but thankfully there's a lot to explore, coupled with minimal loading times and a large map per loading sections, so your adventure won't be hindered in manners that would be annoying.\n\nThe effects and details are of high quality for the time, with minimal negative impact (or at times NO negative impact) on overall performance.

Which is what ultimately lead me to give Strider a shot. Strider is a really good game with combat and movement mechanics that encourage a fast paced style of play but doesnt have much in the way of challenge.\n   \nFirst off I would just like to say that if you were looking primarily for a challenging Metroidvania Platformer Strider is not it. Strider is best described as a 2.5D action side-scroller with some Metroidvania elements and simple platforming. The majority of the game is spent moving forward with most of the backtracking and exploration left up to the player. New abilities that are necessary to open the path ahead are typically found along the way. If you wish unlock secret costumes, concept art, most of the health/energy upgrades which are all optional you need to back track to find areas where you previously could not get into.  The platforming is quite forgiving and its usually obvious what you have do. The game will not challenge you in this aspect. \n    \nStrider starts you off with one primary attack and a simple jump but doesnt take long before you are given other attack and movement options. Strider Hiryu's primary attack is a slash that can be executed in eight different directions and can literally be performed as quickly as the player can press the button. This means the faster the attack button is pressed the more attacks that can be performed within a certain amount of time leading to enemies dying faster. However not all enemies can be felled with the basic slash which is where the special abilites and elemental weapon upgrades come in. These are gained simply by progressing through the game. Some of the speacial abilities include a bird of prey and panther which can be summoned and unleashed upon your enemies at any point (after they have been unlocked) so long as you have the required energy. Energy recharges on its own and is displayed as a red bar under your health bar. Elemental upgrades are applied to both your sword and kunai. There are four total Elements that can be equipped including the default one you start out with. My favorite was the fire upgrade as it not only sets enemies aflame but also does the most damage.\n   \nThe combat in Strider is quite simple but its effectiveness as well enjoyability are dependant on how quick the player is not only able to execute his abilities but also knowing which abilities should be used in what order. Playing as Strider can really make you feel like you are an unstoppable speed demon of death. Running into room and killing a group of foot soliders before they are even able to react because you are swinging your blade at blinding speeds. Without missing a beat you switch to your ice blade freezing the flying enemies above with each strike. These frozen enemies can now be used as platforms so you can jump on them and deflect those pesky lazer turrets projectiles right back at them with your blade and killing all the airborne baddies before you even hit the floor. Everything I described can be done fluidly without interruption at a fast pace. The controls are very tight and responsive. The visual feedback is quite satisfying with sparks flying whenever strider deflects projectiles or attacks an enemy. Enemies also explode upon death typically after being halved by your blade.\n   \nThe game is easy on normal which is an issue because the combat really starts to shine when it demands the most out of you. The bosses are fun to fight but some are so easy that it felt like I beat them in under a minute. The most difficult part of the final boss was just dodging a particularly damaging projectile attack (not difficult) besides that I just spammed attack when possible and he died in 3 tries. The only reason I even died twice was because I wasnt taking him seriously to begin with. I have not played the game on hard but I have heard that hard mode is significantly more difficult than normal. The bosses are supposed to be a real bitch on hard.\n   \nStrider's main selling point is its fun fast paced fluid combat and the biggest downside is the difficulty. The game is worth the $15 asking price and is a must buy at the sale price of $4.50. The game will take you about 4-5hrs if you rush through the game, 7-8hrs if you complete most of the game (about 65%-75%), and about 9-10hrs if you do a completionist run. It took me 7hrs to complete 70% of it.\n\n    On a scale between 1-10 with 5 being average this is a 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1545965053, "timestamp_updated": 1545985298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47877330": {"recommendationid": "47877330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044173253", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1545944745}, "language": "english", "review": "hype as fuck, super fun to control and it doesnt overstay, give it a cool thumbs up\none thing though its one of those games where your character is so insanely jacked that you feel a bit carried by hiryu himself lmao. you the player dont need to push yourself to the limits cause hiryu has you covered. still though the shit you can do with this character  zip zoopin around beatin everyone to shit its fun\ncheck it out on sale you'll enjoy it", "timestamp_created": 1545945655, "timestamp_updated": 1545945655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47806578": {"recommendationid": "47806578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200902218", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1549216504}, "language": "english", "review": "i hate physics now", "timestamp_created": 1545746685, "timestamp_updated": 1545746685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47772427": {"recommendationid": "47772427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044495071", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1539557633}, "language": "english", "review": "A wodnerful and fun little romp thorugh old school strider with a new face lift on it.", "timestamp_created": 1545642981, "timestamp_updated": 1545642981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47662308": {"recommendationid": "47662308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134884772", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1667860842}, "language": "english", "review": "Remember when ninjas were magical?\nThis game brings a lot of that back.

Good for you, mate.\nAlso, since this game is a solid action-packed MetroidVania in which you jump around a lot, you climb walls and you are a futuristic sword-wielding shinobi wearing a scarf, you're in luck. \n\n- Graphics: pretty cool even for today's standards.\n- Music: I particularly loved it since it's a modernized version of old Strider soundtracks (duh, right? Well, I'm just saying it's not all new melodies. So nostalgia could be triggered if you're a fan... although if you are, you're not reading this because you bought the game years ago, when it came out), and it was very exciting for me to listen to the melodies I remember from my days playing Strider on the NES (yes, I was a Nintendo kid).\n- Gameplay: is not as fun as it was on Strider 2 on PSX, but it is VERY close. Hiryu is fast, precise and responsive. It is just a pleasure to jump around while delivering death and destruction to those who dare stand in the way of your blade, even if every now and then you stick to a ceiling or wall you didn't intend to.\n\nExploration is kinda limited by the minimap always telling you where to go and stuff (maybe there is a way to turn that off) but always encouraged (and rewarding) if you're one of those humans who get obsessed over getting every single collectible.\n\nThe difficulty is fair as long as you know what you're doing. Not everything is solved just by slicing your way through (damned shields!), so as long as you pay attention to the enemies and such you're not gonna have any problems.\n\nThe game is not long. You could probably clear it in less than 6 hours while getting everything and without being in a rush... I haven't done that, so I cannot tell for sure, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nWhat else?... bosses? they are fun. Story?... it's ok, I guess... don't expect big thrills in that department. \nMmmh... I dunno... I like this game. I played it four years ago and cleared it.

Meh.\n\nBUT, I gave it it chance, and I'm glad I did, because as progress was made: the environments became more expansive, inviting exploration; a host of powers and upgrades become available, making combat more varied; and the enemies and platforming amped up in difficulty, which made the whole thing far more interesting.

The fact is it is extremely rewarding not only to continuously unlock new abilities but to be able to utilize those abilities to explore previously inaccessible areas.  What makes Strider stand out from many of the other games in the genre is how fast-paced and fluid your movements are.  Where many of the protagonists in these games use guns Hiryu relies on his sword to cut down his enemies; this forces the player to get up close therefore putting themselves in danger.  Although, there are a couple of quirks to address there is a lot of promising features in this title as well.\n\nThere is not much of a story in Strider, therefore your main goal is to use both you acrobatic and combat skills to get from point A to point B.  You merely start with the ability to jump up into air and swing your sword like a mad man.  You can also hold the attack button to charge a more powerful blow.  As you progress you'll unlock kunai to throw, giving you a much appreciated range attack.  You'll continue unlocking skills to improve your maneuverability such as slides and dashes.  Also you'll get different upgrades for your sword allowing it to utilize elemental effects such as fire and freezing.  Finally, you have robots called options which let you use a powerful ability at the cost of a meter which will slowly keep recharging.\n\nAlthough, the platforming and exploration make up most of the experience the game does try to keep things interesting.  For one thing there are sections that offer increasing difficult combat scenarios with no breaks in-between.  The boss fights are the real highlight of Strider.  Each boss offers clever patterns you must learn and when you chip away a set amount of their health they will start to mix things up.  This really keeps you on your toes because as soon as you feel comfortable with one pattern you'll get a new one you'll have to learn quickly.  The Pooh sisters were a very interesting example since as you fight each new sister she will bring in the other sisters you previously defeated for back-up.  This results in forcing you to dodge and fight multiple bosses at the same time.\n\nStrider features a surprising large world to progress through.  The world map is broken down into a handful of sections.  In each section your mini-map will fill in as you explore.  You'll also find a handful of rooms that will let you restore you're health as well as save your progress.  As you unlock new powers you'll be able to bring your map back up to see which doors you've passed can now be accessed.  You'll always have an objective marker to help keep you oriented at least till the endgame when you start backtracking for upgrades and secrets.  There are health, energy, and ability enchaining techniques to be found all over the world.  Secrets include concept art, story details, and challenge courses.\n\nWithout a doubt Strider is an enjoyable, fast-paced, metroidvania.  The combat and movement is frantic but as you progress you will start to master it.  Exploration is a huge part of these kinds of games and I wish they would have made it a little more accessible.  There really isn't any nice system to warp from one zone to another which would have been very useful when tracking down upgrades near the end game.  Although you can see the percentage of collectibles you have found in each zone but for some reason you aren't actually able to access each zone's mini-map unless you are in it.  These roadblocks seem completely unnecessary and they are pretty much the only thing holding this game back from being another classic.

Enemies, predictable. \n\nThe level designs are pretty well done for a 2.5D title. The verticality lends itself to the gameplay style, allowing Strider to make quick jumps and strikes to take down enemies. Controlling the character is a breeze.

Going back with your new items usually gets you some lesser power ups or collectables.\n\nGame has a severe lack of personality. The hero is just a killing machine, trained to kill a dictator. The enemy bosses have no background, they are just ordered to kill you and thats it. No drama.\n\nDifficulty is irregular. Levels are just filled with enemies that shoot at you and you don't get any special reward for killing them, appart from health. So, yes, you can skip a lot of enemies if the level allows it and then you won't lose and recover your health. Difficulty comes in overpopulating the level with shots, but is hard for you to die. The lack of imagination and recurrent abuse of lesser enemies makes the levels from boring to indiferent.\n\nBosses are a little better. Some are interesting (such as bounty hunter or the tank guy), they have their patterns and you can learn them, predict their moves and shots and use it to your advantage. But some other ones are extremely easy (such as the centipede) or brutally difficult (metal gorilla, triple sisters). It's strange how the difficulty peaks and there is not always a clear way to fight them, with the fight resulting in you smashing button X. On the other hand, the final boss was the most interesting, with it's two phases.\n\nBut the game feels underwhelming.

The early hour is a bit dull - while it plays like a decent old school action game, there's nothing that sets it apart besides the stylish character and super fast attacks. It wasn't until the boss fight with the flying mercenary that combat became a little more fun and you finally unlock the ability to reflect basic bullets.[/h1]\n\nIn Metroid games, the excuse that the protaganist doesn't have all of her abilities from the start of the game is that Samus doesn't have the authorization to use all her weapons. A paper thin excuse, but an excuse nonetheless. This game has no excuse other than \"because its a game and we need an excuse for progression and game longevity\". [b]Why does a Ninja have to unlock his Kunai from an underground black market dealer after beating a boss? Why does Strider have to unlock a slide kick ability? Why is he not able to do his ground slam ability when he gets his kick ability?[/b] Getting some of the basic moves in this game would be like not being able to get a side arm, main gun and grenades in a first person shooter until you kill some bosses with your knife. I feel like it really drags the game down and had I gone with my first impression, I would have quit this game before the fun happened. (I almost did).\n\nRegardless, the game picks up with more challenging play afterwards. I feel the movement/jumping is a bit \"too slidey/slippery\" so I died jumping around traps when I felt like I shoudn't have (though there are techniques to get a better handle of Hiryu's speedy movemnt). It seems the game is designed for you tank some damage when running head first into enemy loaded hallways, as it doesn't seem quite possible to dodge or reflect all the bullets that will come your way. The world is generally filled with healing pods though, and enemies drop small bits of of health and energy, so a decently skilled player shouldn't die too much if at all. (Even pitfalls and traps don't insta-kill you and instead quickly respawns you with a small health loss).\n\nPresentation wise, the game has a nice clean look and the sword effect looks really nice in high speed. Up close character textures are a bit bad when the camera closes up on Strider (when he gets a new ability for example) There's an extremely annoying propoganda message from the boss that repeats ad infinitum until you reach a certain point - not do you only have to constatly hear the same lines over and over, but the lines are captioned in a bar that takes about the bottom 1/8th of the screen, which covers up the player characters and elements of the world including enemies, items and passages. Music is fine, but forgettable. There's apparently an ability to customize Strider's appearance, but four hours in and I haven't unlocked any other costumes. I assume you unlock them after completing the game and I severely doubt I'll comeback to the game as I'm clearing my backlog, making this useless to me. And the non-player characters are very typical, flat personalities with nothing to really love about them.\n\n[h1] Strider takes about an hour and a half before it gets fun in my opinion, so be ready for that. I don't feel like you're missing anything by not playing this, though, if you never have played the classic Strider games, then you probably would like to at least know how it feels to slash a sword half a dozen times in a second.

I had the Playstation one at some point but don't think I ever actually played it.\n\nSooooooo... this one reminds me of a cross between the Arcade and NES versions. Graphics, enemies and fast combat like the arcade, and the little bit of metroidvania that is \"similar\" to the NES version. Plays and feels much more like an arcade game, though.\n\nFirstly, as someone else said in a review, the combat gets boring really fast. You get other plasmas (weapon types) and some throwing knives and stuff, but in the end it all comes down to mashing buttons. The reason for this is that most of the enemies are bullet sponges. Worse than in any actual arcade game I played as a kid. I mean fuuuuuck... c'mon. You also have a charge attact that you HAVE TO use against some shielded enemies, especially towards the beginning of the game. The problem is the charge takes like two or so seconds, and waiting can open you to a lot of cheap hits.\n\nThe platforming is overall good and imaginative, but some parts will reeeeeeeeeeeeeeally piss you off. If you are like me and scream and cuss when you're frustrated at a game, you might want to keep the door closed if you live with someone.\n\nThis game is really too long in my opinion. For the type of game it is, a metroidvania shoehorned into an arcade game, it needs to be three or four hours, tops. Because it's more an arcade game, so the length should correspond moreso to that genre than the other.\n\nHonestly, if there's one thing I could change about this game, it would be the bullet sponge enemies. If there wasn't so much of that, this game would be infinitely more fun. I mean, I'd rather see more enemies than fewer that are artificially padded out.\n\nI've had a few glitches in this game, causing me to have to restart. They mostly revolved are waves of enemies that attack you not completely spawning. For instance, I was in the tower at the end of the game, and you're basically doing an enemy gauntlet riding up an elevator. First two times it works fine... I ride up, I die, it starts over. The third time, however, as I'm going up, I kill a few waves of enemies then... nothing. The elevator keeps \"moving\" but nothing else spawns so that it can proceed. So I'm just stuck in the animation of an elevator going up. \"Ok\" I say, going to end game and reload the save like the few times before. But this time it starts me AT THE DOOR TO THE FUCKING TOWER AGAIN!!! I got pissed and shut the damn thing off. \n\nFuck this glitchy game. I mean, you're already making me kill tons of bullet sponges, and now you want to give me a royal \"FUCK YOU\" yet again when I'm almost done?!? \n\nYeah, I'll beat the game. But it sure won't be tonight. Damn thing.......... *grumble grumble*\n\nYou can usually pick this up for dirt cheap now. You can try it at a heavy discount, but honestly this only brings back any nostalgia by way of the visual aesthetics and the music. The game is sub-par, as much as I hate to admit it.

The game has been published on PC, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.\n\nThe plot tells the tale of Strider Hiryu, an assassin sent to Kazakh City with a mission to kill the despotic dictator Meio. Our experienced ninja proceeds through hordes of robotic guards and bounty hunters, helps the local resistance and eliminate the most important officers in Kazakh forces. Nothing really original and the characters are not interesting, just another excuse to slash some guys. Took me 4 hours 37 minutes to clear.\nGameplay includes mechanics inspired by Original Strider and Strider 2, when Hiryu's design has been based on his look from Marvel vs Capcom 3:Fate of Two Worlds. On start of his quest our protagonist has only 2 base attacks, however pushing the game progression gives us upgrades, new skills and weapons just as in other Metroidvania games. The cast of enemies keep increasing, some of them may be hard on first try but later they become easier as you acquire new gear and learn how to use it. Your best friend will be the Cypher, which after unlocking allows Strider to perform charge attacks and later even perform a double jump and dash, there are also 3 other variants that increase the damage, freeze the enemies or give you magnetic blades, but they are acquired later. Bosses are not really special, they can surely be challenging sometimes but not very intense, some of them even dissapoint. The map keeps hidden collectibles such as big medkits, unlockable challenges, intel and upgrades that increase our stats, also there are some secret weapons droped by fallen Striders.\nThe map contains many hidden content but also many doors leading to different locations, after getting the right gear you can always backtrack to get all the stuff you have missed. There is no denying that Kazakh is not any worse than Dracula Castle from Castlevania games in case of design, locations are preety various in case of views, the climate is definetely well preserved.\nSoundtrack have really surprised me to be honest, it is not loud but if you listen carefully you will recognise many remixes of classic Strider tracks, including the very best Kazakh Theme plus some other good sounds really fitting the action. To be honest I haven't expected such a quality in this case.\nTechnically the graphics are preety typical for 2014, nothing astonishing but does not hurt your eyes either, but there is one annoying glitch, in one place Strider has been stuck inside the textures forcing me to restart from last checkpoint. Nothing really problematic so you will not have any trouble I think.\n\nThe game is great, I can assure you, but not as good as classic ones. The plot is very predictible and does not give any feelings, just an excuse.Gameplay lacks some challenge but works fine, soundtrack fits great but music might have been louder, bosses kinda dissapoint but they are good enough and there are almost no issues with it. I think that the game deserves a strong 7,9/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1526978084, "timestamp_updated": 1526978084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685087800025939941", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42162707": {"recommendationid": "42162707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304159861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 243, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1656971873}, "language": "english", "review": "bad game", "timestamp_created": 1526921004, "timestamp_updated": 1526921004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.281613826751708984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42120790": {"recommendationid": "42120790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026335621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1659978649}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is all right, but pretty repetitive and gets boring quite fast.

The music is very fun and action-like and keeps you engaged in the game.

That being the reboot of Strider Hiryu's titular platformer. There are a lot of things I could say about this game that make it so good but its not without its flaws.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nCompared to its predecessors, Strider's controls and gameplay are very polished and fast-paced. Works well and is very reflex heavy. I found the difficulty had a perfect curve, nothing was too hard until the last couple of hours. I had the most trouble on the mechanical gorilla but didn't do the last level which was apparently cheap af. I don't bother with final levels in difficult games like this anyway.\n\nThe bosses are probably the most fun I've had for a while. They're a perfect challenge for me, not too hard but maybe a little frustrating later on. There were a couple I found a little on the cheap side most definitely but regardless, they are all great boss fights for sure.\n\nOverall, don't come in expecting a cakewalk but among the perfectly fast paced design of the controls and the goddamned amazing bosses makes the gameplay really a cut above the rest! Maybe with a few minor to major frustrations, especially in the latter parts of the game.\n\n9/10\n\n[b]Presentation[/b]\n\nI'll try to look objectively as hard as it is. Being a sucker for futuristic cities and anime-style character designs. Honestly, as much as I love the character designs and the way they designed the cities the artwork isn't Strider's strongest point.\n\nI find the lack of facial expressions a little laughable and the Wind sisters didn't appeal to me as much as I hoped they would. Their models were a little ugly. That's my biggest gripe with the visuals, everything else is good... but not [i]great[/i]. The backgrounds and level designs are quite good. I loved the consistent motifs for sure. The temple especially is very nice looking.

That was adding to the experience. Or would, if there was much of an experience here to begin with.\n\nSee, most of the time in Strider is spent on combat and exploration. Now, that would be nice if these elements were good but they... really aren't. Rewards for exploration are very dull, sometimes an upgrade, mostly 'intel', which basically means pieces of lore scattered about. Now, the ridiculous part is that it seems like those collectibles are the only way to understand what this game tries to be about, aside from a ninja going after some generic totalitarian state. For the first hour, the characters don't say a thing, it takes close to 1.5h to even be informed about your main character's name. Miniature pieces of exposition are dropped through dialogue, but a lot of it is just generic, annoying and repetitive \"evil totalitarian speaker messages\".\nAnyway, what else about exploration? Nothing. You can see everything on the map, it is most of the time clear that you will need some kinda upgrade to snoop around further, and that is mostly it. Not much of a sense of wonder and discovery, even less of a desire to get more, since rewards are so mediocre.\n\nThe combat isn't better, possibly worse. Now, early disclaimer, I played the game on Normal, since that should be the difficulty by which one can judge a game properly. And on Normal, Strider is... ridiculously easy when it doesn't cheap-shot you. Your character's ability to dodge fire well is close to zero, you will just eat bullets all the time, but that doesn't even matter! Killing enemies gives health, health is scattered in abnormal amounts throughout the game as well. It is like the game knows you have to be healed to an obscene degree because you can't do anything about the fact that the bullets will fly, you will get hit and the enemies know where you are before you can see them!\nAnd that last part showcases a bigger problem, which is the camera and visual cues. First of all, the camera is so close that many times you will walk into an obstacle because you didn't see it before moving. This is merely frustrating because those just play death animation and penalise you with minimal health loss. What is worse are enemies shooting you, optionally shooting you from another building and similarly optionally shooting you from behind the foreground. And in the latter two cases, you will likely run face-first into these enemies and get smacked in the face by them.\nAll of these issues are further dragged down the mud by the fact that Strider has two attacks, neither of which are satisfying to use nor carry any impact, and the bosses. Though calling these clowns 'bosses' is an overstatement, usually, they are just a partial inconvenience and a time-waster, unable to kill you unless this is the first time you encounter a given type of their attack or if their blabber covers the [i]visual cues of their own attack[/i]. They are real and annoyingly easy pushovers. Ironically, that means they fit perfectly into absolutely meaningless combat of the game.\n\nThere is something to be said about slick controls and a great feeling of freedom through very versatile movement system; you can climb anything, jump over enemies while slashing at them and so on, but the feel of being a ninja vanishes when all you do is eat bullets and get hit by stupid things.\n\n[b]In conclusion, it is not like Strider is a bad game, but it is so blatantly mediocre and lacking any substance to anything within the game, that you are better off not wasting your time on it.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1517006063, "timestamp_updated": 1517006063, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39581159": {"recommendationid": "39581159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077159790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 742, "last_played": 1517086260}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great game very fast paced and fun metroidvania", "timestamp_created": 1516801153, "timestamp_updated": 1516801153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39581096": {"recommendationid": "39581096", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988160556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1516800870}, "language": "english", "review": "Not that good", "timestamp_created": 1516800949, "timestamp_updated": 1516800949, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.379682242870330811", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39543109": {"recommendationid": "39543109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295579340", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 3067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1511380609}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanto, una buena trama", "timestamp_created": 1516653794, "timestamp_updated": 1516653794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39517480": {"recommendationid": "39517480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051449893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1516663964}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the name of this game should be \"Superninja against robotsoviets\"", "timestamp_created": 1516559257, "timestamp_updated": 1516559322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491990864276885986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39395955": {"recommendationid": "39395955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030204754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1516411663}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're like me and you've tried the demo for PS3 (also on PS4 and Xbox 360 I believe), you probably thought, \"meh, seems alright\".

Revolution will be crushed.\"[/h1]\n[i]- General Mikiel, delivering a motivational speech.[/i]\n\nSome ninjas prefer the path of stealth, fading into the shadows like Kevin Spacey's career. Other ninjas prefer the path of violence, their destruction of their noodles striking fear into the waiter's eyes.\n\nYou are Strider Hiryu. Your path is to pelt pigeons at people's faces.\n\nStrider is the fifth entry in the Strider franchise, that began with Strider and whose latest entry is Strider. Now I know that can get confusing, so for clarity's sake I'm going to call this one Strider. \n\nIt's a Metroidvania, which boils down to \"there's a couple of colour coded doors, come back when you're rocking their fashion sense\". Touted as a retelling of the classic Strider story (the other Strider) I'm still not entirely sure what the story is. The wikia says that Earth got sucker punched by a dictator and Hiryu here is the youngest agent sent to go sort it out, who drew the short straw as it was the only one left.\n\nMost I can say about the story is that Hiryu speaks with a comically thick Japanese accent, which is novel to hear. \n\n[h1]\"What do you know of Striders, prisoner?\"[/h1]\n[i]- The Strider, talking about Striders[/i]\n\nFor the gameplay, it's well defined; about half of it can be defined as good. For the good half, Hiryu can icepick his way along any surface; overhangs and small hills are no match for his mighty tools. For the rest of your amazing platforming moves, you get a double-jump and a dash. Don't let your jaw hit the floor too hard. It's solid and the platforming challenges are the highlight of the game. After you're done, there's these \"Beacon Run\" time trials that I absolutely suggest going for.\n\nOnce you've passed the highlight, you come to the combat. Which is not the highlight. See, Hiryu swings his immasculated toothpick as fast as you can hit the button, which has the effect of it feeling like an itty bitty tooth-cleaning device. Weak, ineffectual, unsatisfying, and roughly half the game.\n\nCourse, said toothpick is spiced up a little by the elements - Cold, Reflect, Gravity and Explosions, the classical Greek ones you're used to - and the introduction of \"options\" that involve throwing pigeons at people's faces for significant damage or cats for paltry damage, but it never ascends beyond combat that's just a chore. \n\nA launcher and a slide are there if you really feel the need to make your chip damage slightly less useful.\n\n[h1]\"Strider, you have been marked a danger to the state. Surrender, or face the consequences.\"[/h1]\n[i]- Solo, not the drink.[/i]\n\nThat's on Hard, mind. On Normal - I didn't even touch Easy - enemies dies almost instantly, going too far in the other direction to braindeadville. I mentally clocked out either way.\n\nNow, apart from that core combat, the world is nicely contextualized with platforms that double as rooftops, balconies, prison meeting areas, your mother's secret fetish dungeon, et cetera. Combined with a nicely paced OST that's fairly experimental, and it's a 2.5D game that looks great - like finding a unicorn in hen's teeth.\n\nJust a shame it's boring to play. \n\nGoing back over fully completing Strider, it's just not a game I'd recommend. For every decent aspect, and there are a few, I just keep circling back to how empty and listless the combat fundamentally is. \n\nI'd advise you go check out some other Metroidvanias.

It's overall a fun game but I feel like it could have used some more polish in terms of presentatioin.\n\nHere are some of my frustrations while playing the game.\n\n---No Intro---\nSome people would see this as a plus because they'd wanna' drop into the game and just start playing. I count this as a negative as I want some context before I play. A minute worth of intro would have been nice.\n\n\n---Soundtrack is lacking---\n\nI'm not asking for an epic score but it would be nice to have some Capcom-like soundbites from the 90's.I mentioned before that I'm a huge Megaman X fan and this is one thing that would have made Strider's fun experience into a memorable one.  \n\n---Some Glitches---\nSometimes the door animations won't play as they're already open when i enter the room. This would be fine if I could walk through it but no. The game still reads it as a closed door thus rendering it inaccessible. This has happened only 3 times in my 9 hour run of the game.\n\nIt often suffers from slow down and I've read that it's happened to everyone so I have no idea if it's cuz of bad optimization or my laptop is just crap. haha \n\nSteam version may not be the version to pick up.\n\n---Enemy variation---\nThis is can be taken as either positive or negative. Most of the enemies are soldiers with guns and robots. Sometimes they use different guns. I say that this can be taken as positive as it does feel like you're fighting against a military force instead of a wacky funhouse. \n\nNow, I'm moving onto the positives.\n\n+++Fluid Play Style+++\nAny of Strider's abilities will work on almost every enemy. At first, your options are limited, but in time you'll find abilities that you can stick with throughout the entire game. You can play aggressive like I did and use the fire upgrade the most or you can use the ice upgrade to incapacitate enemies. Etc.\n\n+++Awesome Visuals+++\nCharacter models might look like late PS2 era but the environments look beautiful.  \n\n+++Huge Map+++\nThe 2D map here is done almost perfectly. It annoys me because it's so close... Megaman ZX and ZXA could take notes from this 'cuz, man, I can actually understand the map here. It's still not as good as Castlevania's maps though because fast travel is not done well in this game. Good luck getting all the collectible stuff here and backtracking.\n\n+++Hiryu is fucking cool+++\nIt's hilarious how this guy doesn't give a shit outside of being a ninja. You'll know what I'm talking about when you finish the game. Once the credit's roll after the final fight, watching strider get out of danger is amazing to me.\n\nOverall, good game. It's got a weak start but once you get the ball rolling, it feels pretty damn good to climb around the environments and cut your way though swaths of soldiers.", "timestamp_created": 1512095877, "timestamp_updated": 1512095877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37963787": {"recommendationid": "37963787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106867420", "num_games_owned": 1065, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 824, "last_played": 1512080156}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pura nostalgia con gr\u00e1ficos actuales.

After rushing home, popping it into my console and turning on the power, it was then I was almost immediately treated to one hell of a show. There I was, gliding into an enemy base, sirens blazing, only then to start flipping majestically through the air while making short work of the enemies that were foolish enough to cross my path. This was my first encounter with the Strider series, and safe to say it was a pretty lasting one.  \n\nFast forward to this latest addition to the series, then, and it\u2019s a delight to see that everything that made Strider cool back when I was a kid has made the jump to today.  That feeling of being a legendary ninja is re-ignited at the very beginning of the game, as you fly in yet again with the instantly recognisable theme song blaring away in the background, and easily manages to sustain itself from there.  \n\nYou see, this is action thrown at you at an almost frantic pace. There\u2019s a seemingly endless swarm of enemies always attacking you, and it\u2019s up to you to flip and dash around them... Or, better still, simply go to town and cut them all to ribbons, with the thrill of murdering everything in a room without even stopping for breath being an oh-so-satisfying one. Start sinking your teeth deeper into the Metroid-vania style gameplay, and it only gets better. You\u2019ll unlock items that can deflect bullets back at your foes, set them on fire, or (if all else fails) simply obliterates them via a spirit eagle that you can summon to do your dirty work. Whatever your choice, such systematic destruction never gets old. \n\nIt\u2019s not just endless foot soldiers that end up falling to your blade, however.  Things truly come to a head when it comes to fighting the game\u2019s numerous bosses, which challenge you to take your skills and apply them to battles that are (for the most part) challenging yet fair. Learning the attack patterns of each boss, deftly dodging them and then unloading your own assault to come out on top is a process that is very pleasantly rewarding... Yet no matter the combat situation, there\u2019s many a moment that just feels cool, and you\u2019ll want to keep going just to try and generate that next cool moment for yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s annoying, then, that some of the game\u2019s design seems to primarily exist to slap you cruelly back down to Earth. For instance, far too many enemies have attacks that can stun you momentarily or knock you down for a second or two.  Not only does this break the flow of the action far too often, but you\u2019re so vulnerable once you\u2019re in a stunned state that it\u2019s not uncommon to end up trapped in a cycle where you\u2019re knocked down again the second you stand back up. The same holds even more true with the traps mounted on the many walls you have to climb, with a single brush against a spinning saw blade or similar obstacle sending you tumbling off the wall like an ungraceful idiot. You will encounter many a moment where you\u2019ve nearly reached the peak of a grand ascent, only for a tiny miscalculation to send you crashing into an obstacle and plummeting down to right where you started. It\u2019s something that will hinder your progress so much, you\u2019ll start to wonder why the enemy hasn\u2019t just plastered such obstacles on every flat surface possible.\n\nThere\u2019s also some weird level design in play that doesn\u2019t really fit the aesthetic of you being an unstoppable ninja. The most glaring of these comes about halfway through the game, where three large water valves block the path you wish to proceed down. Two open up easily enough, but opening the third sees you travelling halfway across the world to obtain an item that only then removes this barrier. It\u2019s a minor criticism, I concede - the game has to hinder your progress via some method - but the contrast between being a screaming whirlwind of death one second and then some sort of weird errand boy the next is still a tiny bit jarring. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the map you\u2019re travelling around also feels a tiny bit uninspired, with only two or three little areas sticking in my memory when I try and cast my mind back to where the adventure took me. The rest of the world remains distinctly forgettable, a bland mix of grey buildings and unremarkable landscapes that do little to spark the imagination. If you\u2019re hoping there\u2019s an exciting storyline in place that can perhaps compensate for this, then you\u2019re sadly mistaken \u2013 while the characters themselves look cool, the smattering of cut scenes they play a role in never really explain anything in regards to what\u2019s going on. Put simply \u2013 you\u2019re a good guy, you\u2019re trying to kill the bad guy, and things don\u2019t really go anywhere beyond that. If you\u2019re looking for a compelling tale to captivate you, you\u2019ve come to the wrong place. \n\nStill, even though I\u2019ve spent as long critiquing the game's faults as I have done pointing out its strengths, none of them even come close to destroying the sense of joyous carnage the game manages to capture. You might be frustrated in one moment, but give it a few more moments and you\u2019ll most likely be back on the adrenaline rush where it feels like nothing can stand in your path. We\u2019ve come on great strides (Ha ha) since my first encounter with the series, then, but this version of Strider is still one that is well worth checking out.\n", "timestamp_created": 1508850059, "timestamp_updated": 1508850059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583352148532867432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35931216": {"recommendationid": "35931216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185656142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 931, "last_played": 1523988099}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was fun to play !

This game is surprising that way and, while you can only play as Hiryu, so much gets unearthed as you play - unlocking color schemes and finding extra challenges along the way, should you deviate from the missions even a little bit or making a betweener before battling a Boss or five. I have to say, though: exploiting the new moves you acquire to achieve certain \"goodies\" can be cryptic if you don't know how they initially behave - keep that one in mind. \n\nHOWEVER, when you do acquire the powerups you need, they won't be too hard to use to progress throughout the game, so don't sweat it! :) [b]8/10[/b]\n\n---+---\n\n[b]Final Score: 9/10[/b]\n\n---+---\n\n[b]Opinion:[/b] If you are even remotely aware of the original Strider Hiryu games of decades past, or are up for something new pretty and fresh, atmosphere and gameplay-wise, do yourselves a favor and purchase this one - please don't pass it up!

In general, the graphics are beautiful and polished with an atmosphere fitting its respective area. Only a few scenes that shine a spotlight on the characters reveal static, comic-like faces.

Not all areas of this map are available at the start, often requiring the player to obtain an item (such as a weapon or key) or a new character ability to remove some obstacle blocking the path forward.

Fast and fun 2D action platform game although many of it\u2019s features are copied from other games or recycled from the other Strider games. Recommended on sale. Takes around 6 to 8 hours to finish.\n\n[h1] Review [/h1]\nThis is a reimagining for the strider series where you play as a deadly sword wielding ninja. It does a good job at capturing the feel of the classic arcade game. It has responsive controls, maintains the unique wall climbing and offers a good mix of platforming and combat. While the arcade game had linear stages this uses the ever popular Metroid formula, with different themed areas, where progress is gated with weapon coded doors. However the game doesn\u2019t focus on exploration. Your objective is signposted and you can follow a linear path with a minimum of backtracking if you do not want to collect hidden upgrades and secrets.\n\nThe presentation is faithful to the original with many remixed music tracks, sound effects and familiar enemy designs. Part of the greatness of the original was the art and world design and the nostalgia is a double edged sword here. This game simply doesn\u2019t offer the same kind of surprises and global adventure. The areas of the game that aren\u2019t direct copies of the original are rather drab with a few good set pieces such as boss battles thrown in. The city you explore is made of military and industrial districts which aren\u2019t that thrilling.\n\nThe visuals can be very cluttered at times, especially later in the game, with lots of effects and bullets on screen. There are also too many upgrades for the run time. There are 4 types of sword, 3 active abilities, air dash and kunai. For a fast paced action platform game it can feel a little contrived to only switch weapon to activate switches or destroy shields.\nThe story lasts around 6 hours (more if you want to hunt down secrets) as well as offering unlockable challenge levels. Overall it\u2019s solid, there are better 2D action or platform games out there, I would recommend it when it\u2019s on sale.\n", "timestamp_created": 1502882692, "timestamp_updated": 1502882692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34267796": {"recommendationid": "34267796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995601606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 681, "last_played": 1502849127}, "language": "english", "review": "Mediocre at best.", "timestamp_created": 1502849162, "timestamp_updated": 1502849162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.279640942811965942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34265403": {"recommendationid": "34265403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052874618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1465248060}, "language": "english", "review": "Gay future sasuke dies a lot cause im bad at games\n\ns'alright", "timestamp_created": 1502836930, "timestamp_updated": 1502836930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397621452808380127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34254377": {"recommendationid": "34254377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091805269", "num_games_owned": 1574, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1502797345}, "language": "english", "review": "i missed an ability which is essential for the last area, from which you cant backtrack and now i cant finish the game.-_- But other than that it seems to be a good game, buy at your own risk.", "timestamp_created": 1502797551, "timestamp_updated": 1502797551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34182112": {"recommendationid": "34182112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039366835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1511074203}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fucking AWFUL.

[/h1]\n\nStrider was quite the popular arcade game from 1989 (with a sequel in 1999) that had you in the role of the titular ninja Strider. You moved fast, could double jump and cling to nearly every surface available. The game was punishingly difficult but rewarded memorization and fast reflexes. \n\nThis Strider isn't a remake or remaster of those games, but a sort of reboot. Since our PC and consoles no longer have a quarter slot, the game is designed to stretch out your twitch skills more than your wallet. Still taking the role of Strider (well, [i]a[/i] Strider now named Hiryu), now you'll start pathetically weak and require various upgrades to progress.\n\n[h1] How's the story? [/h1]\n\nSet in a future time, in a pseudo-soviet communist dictatorship, you're trying to topple the shadowy leader behind the government: Grandmaster Meio. To do so, you'll need to infiltrate their headquarters. But with their advanced technology, well equipped troopers and numerous powerful allies, you need to find help in the form of allies and power-ups. Other than that, the story is pretty straightforward.\n\nHowever, given how uncomplicated the story is, the game drags it on and on. The pacing of the game feels like it should have been a much much shorter game. When I felt I was at a boss that had to be near the end, I looked it up and that boss was the 1/3rd mark. Not that lots of content is bad, but the story telling doesn't match the pace of the game.\n\n[h1] What about the techy stuff? [/h1]\n\nBefore discussing the tech behind the game, we have to set our expectations. The game was 15 dollars on launch. The graphics are well done, but do not expect an AAA experience. Models are well done across the board but the textures are a little on the blurry side during cut scenes.\n\nThe music in the game is totally awesome and makes me wish they sold it separately. The audio is clean and informative, with hits being clearly registered. Enemy sound is less telling, but you're so much faster than your foes it isn't really a component of gameplay.\n\nSadly, the music is almost inaudible during the game. I only noticed how awesome it was once I paused the game.\n\n[h1] What will I be doing?  [/h1]\n\nEach boss you come across generally protects a small golden console that gives you a new power. Plasma blades that cut through shields, dashing mechanics or flaming spirit dragons. Foes will start relatively easy to defeat, but over time each mini-boss you defeat becomes a normal troop that you'll fight. This will put your upgrades to good use, as without them those fights are what qualifies them as mini-bosses.\n\nSo you'll start being able to jump, slide and attack. Over time your attacks will get better, cutting through shields or gaining new abilities like using shuriken. Your jump becomes a double jump and the spirit animals that help you in combat will give you new ways to go through old maps. It's not quite a metroidvania but it has many elements that remind me of that genre.\n\nSomething I really enjoyed was the bosses. They all feel very very unfair at first, requiring multiple deaths to learn their patterns but each time you die, you end up a little further than before. That sense of 100% skill based progression was very very satisfying.\n\nOne sore point for me was the foes getting better as you do. They'll replace weaker foes with more difficult ones you come across and while that keeps the game challenging, I never felt a sense of progression against the common enemies, only bosses.\n\n[h1] Should you buy it? [/h1]\n\nAt 15 dollars, for around 10-20 hours of gameplay, yes. Economically, the game is worth it. However if you're not a fan of difficult games then you might want to avoid it. The game isn't famously difficult but it doesn't hold your hand. If you die, it's because you messed up and you'll be starting from the last checkpoint you visited. Those are far apart, so you could be backtracking far and often. If that all sounds like an incentive to get better at the game and not die, then it's probably right up your alley.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Gameplay that feels skill based and rewarding.\n[*] Soundtrack that rocks, when you can hear it.\n[*] Boss battles that are really give the feeling that you're progressing.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Poorly paced story that feels stretched to match the game length.\n[*] Audio is asymmetric (your stuff is great, enemy sound is forgettable) and the soundtrack is [i]quiet[/i].\n[*] Foes scale, robbing you of a feeling of progression against non-bosses.\n[/list]\n\nI'm not a fan of numbered ratings for games, so I'll leave you with this you will probably enjoy this game \n[list]\n[*] If you want to like Metroidvania games but feel the back and forth is tedius.\n[*] If you want a cheap game that is thick with content.\n[*] If you want a challenge, but the Souls series is scary.\n[*] If you like feeling like a fast paced future-ninja.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1501682358, "timestamp_updated": 1501682382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686902821063995361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33968483": {"recommendationid": "33968483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061567694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 565, "last_played": 1501671069}, "language": "english", "review": "I was reluctant at first, especially at the dragon boss, but this game is awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1501671159, "timestamp_updated": 1501671159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33942042": {"recommendationid": "33942042", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969481463", "num_games_owned": 2018, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1501562280}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game.

Also certain place requires certain powers to enter it, so you'll need to reenter the place later.\n> Unlockable system. This thing, surely needed in every modern games. Modern games are lack of unlockable system because most of them are treated as a paid DLC. \n> Level boss are really good, reminds me most of the classics game that you can hit boss while they're in rest state. \n> Very lightweight. Most modern game will have about more than 8GB+ HDD Space. This game, only took 5GB for 5h gameplay (if you play story mode only).\n> Good graphics, runs perfect 60FPS on GTX 1050 TI \n\nCons:\n> Controls are as retarded as Assassin's Creed. Sometimes you can stuck on a platform and refuse to jump. And sometimes, it can jump unexpectedly.\n> Some enemies are really making frustration. You'll require few secs to charge to attack shielded enemy, but shielded enemy attacks you at the same time you finish recharge.

Finally, I say Strider for the NES, because that version of Strider WAS actually a metroidvania.  If you're looking for a more arcadey version of Strider, there are plenty of other titles, but this one is full on metroidvania.

The best boss in the game  hands down is the first one you encounter. The rest of the bosses were kind of bland [spoiler] (other than the giant robot that could climb walls) [/spoiler] . I think over half of the bosses were just repeats of fights I have all ready won if I remember right. \n-----------------------------------\nPros:\n+Looks nice\n\n+good music\n\n+ controls well (few exceptions)\n-----------------------------------\nCons:\n-Backtracking. The game did not have to much backtracking until the end of the game. In Fact, one of the power ups \n[spoiler] (the cheetah one ) [/spoiler] was hardly used other than to backtrack quicker to another power up [spoiler] (ice sword) [/spoiler] needed to move on to the next area. They probably could have cut out that small bit.\n\n-Heath power ups: they hand them out way to fast after the first boss fight. I think I found 5 of them before I got to the 2nd boss. Which also made me believe the game was super short seeing as I found half of them right off the bat. [spoiler] I finished the game in under 5h on hard mode with about 50% of collectables collected. [/spoiler]\n\n-Boring boss fights. Just win them all using your bird special once you learn the easy patterns. (you will probably die more to the normal baddies than these bosses)\n\n-Final boss. \n[spoiler]  Don't even use a keyboard with this fight. Even with me not being able to control my character proper, the fight was still easy even on hard mode. Just stand in a certain spot and keep hitting him with your special attacks and jump off to the side to avoid any danger using the pads. [/spoiler]\n\n---Gravity rooms. Worst thing in this game (if you are using a keyboard.) Just trying to navigate in rooms that screw around with the gravity is the worst, especially when you have to platform while fighting.\n\n-Story is lacking in depth.\n\n-Can't edit the key bindings.\n\n- Being stun locked frozen by baddies.

First off, the game is awkwardly paced and short.  I beat it in four hours and change, and four hours is the speedrun time- I certainly spent a fair amount of time dicking around as well.  There's a couple sections where you need to open specific doors or activate objects and the game takes you on a tangential objective.  One such situation actually has you go on no fewer than four tangential objectives at the same time, a cascading necessary sidequest involving multiple boss fights.  If anything feels like being given the runaround, it's this part of the game, but there's also some other points that feel like backtracking.  The difficulty is also a bit all over the place; if two enemies surround strider the game you can do almost nothing, but otherwise you're all but invulnerable.  Some of the special abilities are easy to forget about and a bit awkward, and the elemental switching is almost always a very black-and-white choice (since only one weapon type breaks the majority of shields and does like double damage).\n\nThere's also some things that are more middling.  Metroidvania format has its ups and downs.  There's a lot of secrets to collect, but almost none of them are even that helpful, and although it's kind of cool that the special kunai and dash elemental abilities are hidden, keeping them hidden means they can't be all that fantastic and sure enough they're pretty middling.  Another hit-and-miss thing is the art design.  It's as flashy as it should be, but the models sometimes make it difficult to determine what's a plaform or what's going on at all at times.  Finally, the music didn't really do anything for me, and the story/dialogue is straight out of console generation 4.\n\nThe good bits of Strider are the speed, breadth of movement and attack directions, the controls are awesome besides the fairly uneeded specials, there's exactly the right number of enemy types and bosses for the game's length and they're matched well to your abilities, bigass levels that are enjoyable to explore and some ridiculous setpieces to blow up.  If you want to play a fast platformer where you cut half the level and slide through robots by the dozen to get to crazy bossfights- I mean, it does it.  It does it really well.  I didn't find a single bug or stutter, nothing.  Fifteen bux is an okay price even with the length but it's gonna go on sale, and if this interests you at all you should get it then.", "timestamp_created": 1496892534, "timestamp_updated": 1496892534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68590390682220459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32197920": {"recommendationid": "32197920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127229390", "num_games_owned": 738, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1522317797}, "language": "english", "review": "surprisingly good considering i got it in a humble bundle and i had absolutley no idea what the game was\n\ngameplay is really fun, but there's some imbalance between the difficulty of bosses and the outside world: outside is extraordinarily easy, but the bosses are quite difficult", "timestamp_created": 1496665442, "timestamp_updated": 1496665442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32159438": {"recommendationid": "32159438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046445186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1469831182}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego se crashea muy frecuentemente.", "timestamp_created": 1496517142, "timestamp_updated": 1496517142, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.395555555820465088", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32128002": {"recommendationid": "32128002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314193820", "num_games_owned": 2084, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1469016293}, "language": "english", "review": "For some reason, it reminds me of Ninja Ryukenden.\n\nIn any case, it's an awesome platformer with old school roots.", "timestamp_created": 1496406690, "timestamp_updated": 1496406690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439932286739349365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32126820": {"recommendationid": "32126820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010433971", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1278, "last_played": 1496402193}, "language": "english", "review": "Make sure you're up for this sort of gameplay (go youtube) its more a game pad game than keyboard.

Takes around 7 hours to 100%. Navigation outside of main objectives isn't very fun and there aren't any real points of interest besides color-coded locked doors which usually hide a power-up or concept art unlock.\n\nGame itself is more combat oriented and that's where is shines. All animations are fast and don't cancel anything (e.g. you can jump, throw kunai and power up your slash at the same time), plus you get 4 different attack types that change how your combat moves behave, neither mode is a direct upgrade but instead they compliment each other (e.g. use reflective mode to reflect bullets while you run torwards the enemy, switch to magnetic mode and dash to stun them, and then switch to flame mode to finish the stunned enemy off). Most locked doors are opened by a dash so you don't have to pause while moving from area to area either. There are no pauses during movement or combat, it feels very streamlined and fast-paced.\n\nVisuals are nice and clean, have a nice style (e.g. some effects like dust or explosions look more hand-drawn than realistic), but nothing to write home about. Enemies telegraph their shots and projectiles are very easy to see. Bosses make great use of projectiles, something you would see in old arcade games. Bosses in this game are in general very fun and challenging, and urge you to move a lot, unlike some other modern metroidvania games (*cough*Shadow Complex*cough*).\n\nOne thing that puzzles me is complete lack of facial animations during cutscenes. It's not noticable on Hiryu and some other characters that wear masks, but it looks very cheap on characters that don't.\n\nSome issues with the game: Game is locked at 60 fps. You can't remap keys in-game, but you can do so by editing config files. Non-XInput controllers are supported only through third-party means (x360ce). Controls during segments that have non-standard gravity are just plain bad both on keyboard and controller, but these segments are rare and it doesn't ruin them completely.", "timestamp_created": 1492709686, "timestamp_updated": 1492709686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31228113": {"recommendationid": "31228113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025272394", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1492558962}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Acci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida y muy fluida, as\u00ed se resume Strider.\n\nUn juego que no os llevar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de un par de d\u00edas completar, pero que entretiene gracias a un sistema de combate decente.\n\nAun as\u00ed tiene varios \"peros\".

You'll start off weak and grow more powerful with every upgrade including more health, more energy, long range attacks, etc.  Enemies and bosses have tactics and weaknesses that you learn and exploit.  There's not really much of a story to the game, you're there to assassinate the baddie, that's pretty much it.  Characters aren't really explored and are cliche for the most part.  Expect the dialogue to be not so good.  Game is pretty much constant action/exploration which makes it enjoyable.\n\nThe game does have several issues.  The biggest is probably the wall grapple controls.  You can attach to almost every wall/ceiling in the game and move around.  Getting off of these can be problematic at times.  You'll press the jump button to detach and instead he'll keep on hanging there.  The game automatically moves you up platforms if you get to the edge of them instead of waiting for a prompt from you to do so.  This can get annoying at times if you're trying to get close to the edge of a platform without wanting to go up on it.\n\nThe second problem is that the difficulty is inconsistent.  I played on hard and while I found the very beginning to be sufficiently difficult, it got easier from there, especially once you get the first 2-3 health upgrades pretty quickly.  Some areas are overabundant in health pickups & killing enemies gives you a little health back as well.  Save points recover all missing health.  There's occasionally an area or two where the difficulty spikes for a little, but not too often.  Once you learn the basics of enemies, they'll usually give you little problems.   Later on, you can usually just run by enemies and mostly ignore them.  Bosses also suffer from the same problem.  There're 2-3 that are pretty tough and will probably kill you a time or two until you learn from your mistakes and win, but others are incomprehensibly easy.  The Pooh Sisters will barely put up a struggle and will probably only take down a fraction of your health before you slaughter them.  I beat both the final boss and his alternate form without dying once, and I arrived at the final boss with only about 40% of my total health.\n\nThe game can get a touch repetitive as you'll be fighting most of the same enemies throughout with occasional palette swaps which grant them different health/damage/special abilities/weaknesses/etc.  Would've been nice to have more enemy variety, though enemies do use different weaponry (Rifles, Snipers, Shotguns, Rockets, Machine guns, etc) which do make fights feel different.\n\nYou don't unlock the quick travel points until about 60-70% of the way through the game and the most that any one area will have is 1.  Some areas don't have any.  This can make backtracking for upgrades/pickups a little annoying later on when you've got all the special abilities.  Especially since some areas are relatively sizable and could take 5+ minutes to run through.  Most 'essential' stuff is usually somewhere close by where you find a new special ability.  It's usually only the unlockable art/intel/character info that are far off somewhere, so it'll only be really annoying for people trying to 100% the game.\n\nGraphics are fine, music is hit and miss but is decent enough for the most part.  Didn't run into any bugs/crashes at any point.  Most of the games problems are minor points, though I would have really liked the game to be much more challenging, especially the bosses.

Strider's signature katana arc is in full evidence here, allowing you to let loose a pleasing flurry of attacks or charge up for a longer-range strike. Movement includes an array of somersault jumps and combine with a wall-climbing mechanic that is never too clingy (as such mechanics can sometimes be). Basically, every room of enemies can be a fun, adrenaline-filled dance - and this is just with the basic toolset the game starts with.\n\nThere's some interesting depth here - you not only get ranged kunai attacks, a short teleporter hop and three extra modes for your sword, but each of these get different effects in combination, giving you plenty of high-energy options to take down even bigger foes with finesse. There's also a chain-based higher damage mode you can get to if you score a high succession of hits - I never popped the achievement for doing this 25 times, but I managed to quickly take down the one boss I had any real trouble by trigging a succession of these, and like everything else in this game's combat, it has the capacity to make you feel like the ultra-badass you probably aren't.\n\nElsewhere, the game can be unexceptional, though not in any significantly detrimental way. This Strider goes full Metroidvania, and while the aforementioned puzzles are great to track down, it lacks the clever item placement of something like Super Metroid (and for better or worse, there's nothing like that game's shine sparking to test your skills/patience). The environments are thoughtfully if visually unspectacular in their construction - though gameplay is on a 2D plane they've done a great job of layering things in the background and foreground, but it can all look a little samey and the series' distinctive cyber-soviet environments seem a little low-key this time round.\n\nEnemy design is a similar story - in terms of function they've nailed it (on sight you have a good idea how an encounter is going to go down, and attacks are appropriately telegraphed so you can get on with the business of dodging and obliterating) but the designs don't really stick in your memory. Bosses are a little better on this front, though they're ultimately lifted from earlier games (and they have some over-used chatter before you encounter them).\n\nStill, unless you've recently burned yourself out on Metroidvania-esque titles, there's more than enough style and substance in this game. I've owed this one a review for three years now - taken me around this time to actually have a machine that can run it (oddly) - Chris covered for me on thereticule (http://thereticule.com/strider-the-verdict/), but I couldn't resist singing it's praises myself, especially as three years on, it seems to have largely been forgotten.

Bosses are frantic, enemies are dynamic, and the abilities you acquire are fun and empowering, kunais, dashes, new blade types, etc. My only real complaints here are that at the occasional gravity warping sections within the game, you never feel quite as in control as you should, and that switiching blade types on the fly can feel stressful. Oh, and turning around is kind of weird? But anyway. Graphically, it's exactly what it should be, throwbacks to the old games show up in proper spaces, but also aren't carbon copies. The soundtrack is actually really sick, unfortunately it is turned down too low to appreciate, like a lot of soundtracks nowadays. I recommend cranking it up a little! But otherwise, the combat is nice, the presentation works. Playtime is around five hours, and that's just about the right length. It all checks out.\n\nBut then we get to the fact that, again, this game is a Metroidvania. That means backtracking to get collectibles with new found power ups. But the issue with Strider's layout is that backtracking is genuinely annoying to go through. There are only a few warp points in the game, and they are far out of the way from the \"Plaza\" (the place you consistently return to over the game). The collectibles, too, are almost never worth going to get, with the exception of a few upgrades to your health and mechanical upgrades. Furthermore, rather than in a, well, GOOD Metroidvania, you aren't led silently to where you need to go to next by map design and the designer's invisible hand. You're given a waypoint on the map to head to. What was the point of making this a Metroidvania, then? If the areas were stacked in order, the game would have felt relatively the same, though a bit funky to backtrack through small parts of areas. I often feel compelled to collect everything I can in games like this, but in Strider, I just didn't bother. They're not hard to get, usually, theyre just not worth it. I didn't want to waste my time.\n\nThat being said, Strider is still a fun game. The action is frenetic and fun, but I'm honestly hesitant to recommend it. I actually felt like it wasted my time often when playing it. This is one of those many times I wish I could give a middling review score rather than the binary of \"Yes\" or \"No\". It's a good action game, but whenever it tries to be like a Metroid game, it just becomes boring.

It doesn't need it though, being as expansive and fast-paced a platformer as it is. There are plenty of metroidvanias out there but I can't think of many that let you play as a spastic cyber-ninja, and that's just as fun as it sounds. Despite a few design hangups it stays fun the whole way through, too, so it's an easy recommendation for an action-heavy take on the genre.\n\nStrider dumps you into the cyberboots of Strider Hiryu, out on a mission to kill the mysterious despot who rules the world from high-tech Kazakh City. This isn't really explained in the game intro which drops you into the snowy outskirts of the city, leaving you to pick up the pieces of the story through the game's terribly talkative bosses. I can't say I minded too much because right from that intro I was somersault-slashing robot soldiers into cyberfillets and speeding across rooftops, and at that point I wasn't questioning it.\n\nThis game wastes no time in getting you to the action, so I'll waste no time lauding them for it: This is one of the most viscerally fun metroidvanias out there to tear around in. Combat in Strider is always fast-paced, kinetic, and full of possibilities. Your spry protagonist will quickly unlock a full suite of combat moves including charged slashes, sliding kicks, diving strikes, and air dashes. Even his basic attack is a lightning-fast swing you can rapid-fire like the Crissaegrim from Symphony of the Night, in any direction no less. On top of that are the plasma types, allowing Strider's sword to reflect bullets or freeze enemies, throwing knives which can share those plasmas, and three combat options like a holographic panther and orbiting drones.\n\nAll of those tools will be necessary for cutting down the hundreds of cybernetic foes standing in your way. Enemy troops carry all kinds of firearms and almost every group has a shield soldier to dispatch with a charged slash or a specific plasma. Then there are flying drones, turrets, and larger mechanical menaces that make for longer encounters. You'll need to be agile to take on beefier foes but flipping willy-nilly all over a giant robot as you hack it up never gets old here. Once you master the movement you can control the flow of battles, slipping between shots and removing threats as you see fit.\n\nYour swift, fluid movement will help you traverse the vast metropolis of Kazakh City as well. The map is divided into thematic districts, from rain-soaked cityscapes to cramped industrial complexes to vast underground caverns. Strider starts the game with the ability to cling to and climb along any surface, walls and ceilings included, which greatly multiplies the spaces that can conceal secrets. And indeed, there is stuff to find stuffed into every corner of the sprawling world. This is actually one place where the game's design works against it, because the levels are a little too vast to comfortably retread to find new secrets. There's no fast travel system either, so hiking back to the starting areas can be a laborious undertaking.\n\nThe level design is definitely the weakest part of Strider, which is a pretty big deal for a metroidvania. And it's doubly painful because the levels LOOK great, with tons of little details in the fully-3D landscapes. But all that detail can make it tricky to pick out the walls and platforms in the foreground, especially when things get cramped. They get cramped pretty often as well, with many levels going overboard on long, featureless halls to sprint down. Strider's normal running speed makes this less of an issue, until you need to backtrack somewhere. But that's the other part that got to me, the backtracking. It's to be expected in any metroidvania especially after you score a new power, but here it feels particularly forced. You'll be sent to a new level to do something and all of a sudden you'll get a notice that you need a new option or plasma to proceed. It could be as simple as one locked door between you and your goal, but the game will happily send you through three enormous side levels to get a new power to open that damn door. Or it might arbitrarily send you back to the middle of an early level, or into a back entrance of an old map, or so on. It's not the worst thing in the world since you get more to explore, it just tends to be terribly arbitrary.\n\nI feel pretty confident that the action will help push you through the worst offences of the level design, though. The fights never get boring and the bosses all have fun gimmicks and lots of dynamic attacks. Strider isn't a terribly difficult game on normal, either, so it should be clear sailing right up to the final area. The journey will take you a good 5 or 6 hours and there are additional difficulties and challenge modes to top it off. The sound design is great, with plenty of rich metallic tones and a pumping soundtrack to keep you pushing on. The graphics are nice and clean but leave the characters looking stiff and plasticky in the cutscenes, but at this point I'm just nitpicking. There are certainly nits to pick but honestly if you like metroidvanias and ninjas, just get it and immerse yourself in hours of quality skulking and slashing.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The design and methods our crafty Ninja Hero Hiryu goes about climbing, flipping, slicing, dicing, teleporting, and projecting himself through the multiple levels of this game is a blast, the action, the pace, the difficulty at not getting hit, loading up your cypher sword and going all out on some unfortunate Meio kronies is a thrilling ride...for awhile.\n\nOne of the achievements and probably the most worrisome is the complete in 4 hours achievement - this is totally possible on any setting as the games areas to travel and places to go are limited, with the help of a few maps from online you can plot a course that will take you directly or almost near direct paths with almost all power ups to beat the game in 4 hours. I completed it in 3:05 and think I missed 1 power up.\n\nStrider had very few cons, I think 3 overall:\nThe first and biggest one is that Double Helix the designer of the game is no longer in business. Strider has such a comfortable blend of action, evasion, and puzzles while it glides along quickly enough that you can beat it in under 4 hours once youve honed your skill. \nThe Second con would be that is it such a short game, there are some extra modes like survival where you try to survive wave after wave of enemies or the time trials where you run around the maps hitting beacons in a certain time frame to collect A - F rank, but they got old quick. \nThe Third is the Direct X, if you dont have DX11 it cant run on your machine, some people have posted about this, and there is supposedly patches (unofficial patches)- youve been warned.\n\nIf your a platform player this is a must, wait for a sale and enjoy.

As you can see from my playtime, I've never played the game much, and when I considered why that was, I didn't find much overlap between my view of the game's shortcomings, and the negative reviews.\n\nThe main complaint I see in negative reviews is that this game is too easy and the non-boss enemies are way too easy (some say the bosses are too easy as well, personally I don't mind a game where I can kill the boss after figuring out his tricks over 3-6 attempts). I think this complaint mostly stems from imo misunderstanding what this game is and isn't supposed to be.\n\nAs I see it, this game is not supposed to be \"I Wanna Be The Guy\" with a Strider skin, and the open world enemies aren't supposed to privide much, if any, challenge (though to be fair, the Heavy Trooper Mechs come in different variations that can be fun/interesting to handle). They're there to provide scenery and something to slash with your increasingly powerful skills as you fly by, and that's it.\n\nThe main thing that put me off playing the game for longer was the open-world approach they have taken with map-design. If I need to spend time looking at the map, frankly, I'd prefer a minimap. It just kind of makes me wonder \"who asked for this\", but I guess it was probably cheaper to do it this way and stuff some collectibles in there. I for one find the idea of exploring to find my way and traveling between zones via phoenix in this kind of game off-putting. Ori and the Blind Forest did a similar thing and I didn't like it there either, just give me a linear level path imo.\n\nThat said, if you want to play a metroidvania style game that makes you feel fast, agile and powerful, which isn't very hard but a quick blast of fun, I can definitely recommend the game (as long as the map thing doesn't turn you off).

Most people will probably love this game but I'm very picky about controls.  I prefer direct responsive controls, not scripted animations. This game isn't as bad as fly-by-wire games such as the Arkham series, but it was still annoying.  \n\nIf I'm running left and I press right, I prefer the character to start running right, not to do a nifty slide animation that causes you to lose control of your character for a half second.  I also hate wall clinging, especially when it is very difficult to get your character off the wall.  The only wall clinging I'm ok with is when you have to hold a key to cling to the wall and you let go of the wall when you release the key.  This is one of those games were the walls seem to be made of fly paper. Getting off of them requires pressing jump and the thumbstick away from the wall at the same time.  And by \"away\" I mean exactly 180 degrees on the thumbstick.  190 degree or 170 degress causes you to flip upward on the wall rather than letting go of it.  Similarly, when you jump and try to press up to attack an enemy above you, if your thumbstick goes SLIGHTLY left or SLIGHTLY right your character flys left or right very quickly instead of aiming up. An example of scripted movement is that when you get close enough to a waste high platform in front of you, your character automatically hops up onto it and takes a few animated steps forward, often running into a damaging obstacle.  This kind of scripted behavior makes for a very cool looking demo video but a very frustrating game.  Like many games, the most challenging boss was the controller boss. \n\nIf you are not as anal as I am about controls, you will probably like this game. I love how it rewards exploration with lots of little hidden secrets.

I expected some sort of platformy hack and slash, I ended up with a fairly engaging ninja-themed metroidvania game.\n\nAs with most metroidvania games, you start out with fairly minimal abilities. Minimal to the point where I was not very impressed at first since I was just spamming the slash attack. Once you get a few power ups though, your combat options open up immensely and it becomes way more engaging. This isn't to say that it's perfect, I found the combat actually got annoying at several points in the game as some enemies were bullet (slash?) sponges no matter which powers you used, to the point where I found myself skipping over a lot of enemies. I also found some enemy types incredibly annoying to fight against due to the fact that they can stunlock you to death in large packs. Sure you could dodge the bullets, but if you mess up even once, a sufficiently large pack will refreeze/stun you as soon as you break out. Aside from those fights though, I found the boss fights to be very fun with varied mechanics.\n\nMovement in this game was great, especially as you unlock powers to increase your movement options and unlock new areas. I always felt like I was in control when moving, which is great for combat. My only complaint is that some maps are fairly large and I found myself wishing for a quick way to traverse large flat areas, such as with some sort of charge/sprint power seen in some other games in the genre.

I initially felt this way due to simply being able to go through the metroidvania-like map by dashing forward and pressing one button to go through enemies. While it was like this for the first 90 minutes or so, it became much more challenging. The enemies changed from being one dimensional and the bosses were actually challenging. They weren't impossible to beat, but it did require that you face them 2-3 times and learn their attack patterns. \n\nThis game has much more to offer than what I experienced/was willing to do, but that's generally the type of gamer I am. I prefer to play for the story instead of trying to unlock every single little thing.

The focus is not on the exploration at all, but rather on avoiding enemies and environmental dangers, be it by deflecting bullets, or wall-climbing, or blinking: \"fast\" is the keyword here.\n\nThe combat is extremely straightforward, relying mostly on oldschool button mashing with no combos. A rather big flaw can be found in the game's pacing, lacking any new combat option or major upgrade for the first couple hours, which might be a boring start for most players. \nMid-game onwards, though, the combat becomes more engaging, balancing button mashing with more precise striking in order to reflect bullets, ranged options and cool \"special\" abilities, without ever slowing down the action. \nThe level design actually encourages making full use of the strider's arsenal, mixing plasma swords (reflecting, explosive, freezing, magnetic) and turning an otherwise too-straightforward, one-button combat into a fun, fast hack'n'slash. Despite lacking tight, tactical approaches, or complex enemy movesets, the combat still feels engaging and satisfying.\n\nWith fun and speed at its core, the game doesn't slow down on any meaningful story or characters' background, instead throwing at the player a number of bosses with little context but very solid ideas, at least visually. This is probably where the futuristic, cyber-warfare setting shines the most.\n\nAdditional game modes (time trials, enemy/boss rush) can be unlocked by finding collectibles, for those who find the game too short (it actually is). This, coupled with the lack of any real customization and very linear progression, speaks clearly about how Strider retains its arcade soul, compelling the player to play just for the fun of slashing away at cyber-troops with style.\n\n\nDespite a few shortcomings, Strider manages to turn a very oldschool concept into a fun, fast paced game, even by today standards, aided by some neat polish and good visuals. It doesn't want to be a metroidvania, it doesn't add customization or rpg elements, it just sticks with the classic hack'n'slash and makes it fun and good to look at. \nThe one highlight of Strider is that it perfectly nails the feeling of being a badass ninja with stylish powers fighting an army of cyber-soldiers.

I haven't played a whole lot of previous Strider games, but in this one I felt right at home. Graphics were stunning, ambient sounds and music that played occasionally were giving me right feel at the right time - there was some perfect sound both for action and for atmosphere. Controls were solid, if a little too complicated, but once I got used to them, everything became just right. Kazakh City was decently big and really fun to explore with rich variety of zones, though, some areas like Underground were a bitch to get to. I was aiming to collect every collectible besides large green containers (they're nothing but a health refill item anyway) and this led to some frustration, because some of the little Strider icons, which give you costumes, were really challenging to collect. Other than those, I loved collecting all the items, but I missed a few optional icons with concept art, which isn't a big deal.\nThe core gameplay of Strider was fun and addictive, I spent hours just running around, killing bad guys in style and jumping on the rooftops like madman. Bosses were memorable and very challenging, except for Gravitrons (I was seriously just sitting in one spot and throwing exploding kunai at them until they broke).

I recommend playing with a controller. Fortunately for me I didn't run any into bugs, glitches or crashes while playing.\n\nYou don't have to be familiar with the other titles in the Strider series to get into this one. This is a perfectly fine standalone title and the first one to have a seamless metroidvania-style of progression in it. It has 3 difficulty settings (I beat it on normal) and some difficult steam achievements. You play as the Strider, Hiryu, who has been sent on a mission to hunt down and assassinate Grandmaster Meio. It's not quite that simple though as many obstacles and diversions are put in your way. Meio lies inside of a tower, sealed by 3 Gravitron power cores you will need to destroy. As you go you'll find different powerups that will teach you new moves, increase your health and energy, unlock shortcuts and this game's version of elemental attacks to your main weapon, the Plasma Cypher. It's worth noting the elemental upgrades are a key mechanic to the game as they will allow you to defeat specifc enemies and open specific doors you'd otherwise have to ignore. \n\nIt's really fun to play and see just how versatile Hiryu is. He can slide, jump, double jump, air dash, ground pound, climb up walls and across ceilings and reflect enemy bullets back at them. There's a lot more too as you get more Cypher (weapon) upgrades. The enemy variety is decent. Most times it's different difficulty variations and palette swaps of the same foot soldiers but it is done in a way that keeps it fresh as you go through this 6+ hour adrenaline fueled ride.\n\nThe boss fights are where this game really shines. The mid to end game boss fights are challenging and will no doubt test your reflexes to their limits. Without going into spoilers, I will say there is enough unique variety of boss encounters to always keep you on your toes. Another high point is the world the game takes place in, each area is interconnected with areas you can backtrack to and unlock other secrets or create shortcuts as you progress and learn new abilities. You don't necessarily have to walk back on foot the whole way though, you get the ability to summon an eagle and a panther that will take you to other areas if you find the right tile to use them on. The map system is excellent, areas that are currently inaccessible will be marked as such so you can find it later when you have the right ability to get through it.\n\nThe soundtrack is okay. Not bad but I wasn't impressed with it either. The voice acting isn't the worst but it is pretty bad. The sound effects themselves though were both crisp and fitting of the theme & technology found in the game. The biggest flaw I found, which may be considered a nitpick by some, is that when Hiryu climbs a wall and gets close to a ledge, he'll automatically pull himself up. Now that might sound like a good thing but there are some precision platforming puzzles where this is an absolute rage inducing annoyance and I've unintentionally pulled myself up right into an electrical grid or a laser beam more times than I'd like to count. Or when I'm trying to jump down onto a wall right below the ledge only to pull myself back up. The way Hiryu handles can feel a bit floaty too when you're trying to do some precision double jumping and air dashing for some of the harder end game areas. Aiming his cypher with the analog stick also doesn't feel 100% accurate.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I recommend this game. I had a blast and enjoyed the challenge it offered.

Y no puedes cambiar de dificultad a mitad del juego. Si la cambias vuelves a empezar y pierdes la partida anterior.\n\nComo dec\u00eda antes t\u00e9cnicamente est\u00e1 bien: los gr\u00e1ficos son correctos, el movimiento del protagonista es flu\u00eddo, las acciones que lo caracterizaban (colgarse de las paredes, saltar y repartir espadazos como si no hubiera ma\u00f1ana) tambi\u00e9n se 'sienten' bien.

Now become alive, and is striking harder!\n\nSTRIDER is a great side-scroller, not fantastic, but well made. I have to be honest : the very first minutes were kinda boring. Simple smashing button and jumping frenetic to evade attacks from enemies, cuz you dont have a parry(block button), but...\"hey!...this is what these games are made of... so keep playing!\"\n\nAfter the intro, and 1st stage, i realize that some potential was painted into horizon, with unlocks, upgrades, and new challenges. And i wasn't wrong. The customization is minimal, but the progression is massive. You can have at least 20 upgrades, from classical -double jump- to aerial strikes, slides, charges and why not?\n \"ultra-MO-power-THA-des-FA-tru-KA-ction kills\" XD\n\nBasic enemies are easy, and a bit repetitive. Same soldiers over here and there; with some improvements over the journey. The Bosses are a little harder but not frustrating. Overall you can defeat 'em all in two tries after analize its weak points.\n\nHealth Regeneration is not allowed, but you can gain some from destroying enemies and crashing \"boxes\".\n\nCheckpoints are way too far from your objective, but is the only way to advance from point to point.\n\nAbout the graphics, i must add that they are nice, some old vibe (robot anime series) here.\n\nThe sound is quite simple but satisfying, not intrusive.\n\nMenus are classic, you can feel as you were playing some Super NES game, which made \"nostalgia\" grows. \n\nYou can beat the game in 10 hours. (my real gametime isnt showed, cuz i lost internet connectivity all weekend, so i had to play offline)\n\nAll in all, is a good game. I recommend to fans of the genre and alike.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes. This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

By every measurable criteria, the modern Strider far surpasses its predecessor.  I was not a fan of the original and though it looked great, the action was clunky and overly challenging in spots, which were hallmarks of the time.\n\nThe modern Strider, released in 2014 by Double Helix Games is a graphical delight and a blast to play.\n\nThe combat is fast paced and represents gaming at its best.  Lower tier enemies are quickly dispatched and it is quite enjoyable to utilize your speed, mobility and ninja moves to savagely respond to a group of rifle toting cyborgs putting you under fire.  Bossess and larger enemies take some pattern recognition, which is reminiscent of the finest old-school gaming.\n\nStrider simply has the best platforming mechanics in gaming as well.  Double jumping, wall climbing and ceiling climbing have never been done better than this.  Jumps are fast, controllable and tight and climbing a wall is not a chore to accomplish.\n\nThe game has leaderboards and is littered with hidden collectibles and unlockable options adding quite a bit of content and replayability.\n\nThis remake was refreshing to see and Double Helix did a fantastic job here.  Though the game has top-notch graphics, they did not try to force 3D and perspective change to modernize the game as the Castlevania series regrettably did.  This is how you remake a game, by taking what was good about the original, do it better, focus on fun gameplay, improve and modernize the graphics and add in a ton of extra content.", "timestamp_created": 1468085980, "timestamp_updated": 1468085980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567343294620513916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24190077": {"recommendationid": "24190077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037111426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1536918563}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my take me back to the cheaper and simpler times of Video Gaming.

Not a big deal, just found weird.\n\nI really liked the first 1-2 hours of the game, it slowly gives you the abilities on the game making it feel like a tutorial after the first boss. As you continue on the game, you are presented with up to 4 different plasmoids and with their different uses with the kunai having a secondary effect as well. The pacing was just great.\n\nThe difficulty scaling on enemies is perfect and all the bosses are unique though some can be cheesed especially the second evolution of the final boss. It was the most underwhelming boss fight even though it was also the final one.\n\nThe controls are somewhat finicky on keyboard when aiming for the kunai as well when sticking on walls, but that might be just me sometimes since I always want to charge your attack (holding the atk button). Despite of that, the fighting controls feels very responsive and you get this nice feeling when you are juggling you plasmoids on bosses.\n\nThe game has been bundled twice now but if you missed those and are planning to get it, I'd buy this at least 50% since it is quite short but nevertheless you'll have great fun with it.\n\nOverall Rating: 81%", "timestamp_created": 1467669688, "timestamp_updated": 1467669688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580547153949737549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24063274": {"recommendationid": "24063274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015076058", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1184, "last_played": 1467584619}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is legit.

Calling it a ninja platformer implies that there is at least one stealth aspect in the game, but au contraire. Strider is  probably the only Hack'n'Slash platformer I've ever heard of. You have this extremely satisfying saber that you can swing as fast as you can click the button, and you eventually get new abilities that let you dodge around enemies like a goddamn baby-face-blaster scout (before the nerf.) You start out the game struggling to kill a couple grunts, but by the end of the game, both from upgrading and getting better, you are cutting through waves of enemies. Strider does this great thing, where it introduces new enemies as bosses, and they kick the crap out of you. Once you die enough times and you kill the boss, you then progress forward only to find that many of the newly found enemies sprawling before you are that very same boss. But because you spent so much time learning their weaknesses, you can now kick the crap out of them no problem.\nThere are, however, some certain broken enemies. The acid-spitting shielded bugs in the sewers will wombo combo you into the next century, and the gorilla boss will stun-lock you for 5 hours. Strider also tries to implement these 3 different combat \"options.\" They are stupid and I don't like them. The cutscene models are the same models as the actual game models, so they look like crap, and the voice acting is terrible.\nThere is one more mechanic that is both a blessing and a curse. As you progress through the game, you gain different kinds of sabers, reflect, fire, ice, and homing. The reflect one is great, you can reflect bullets and kill waves of enemies without laying hands on them. The fire one is also great because it lights enemies on fire, and a charge strike can makes enemies explode. The ice saber makes people frozen, there's not much else to say about it. Then there's the homing shot  saber. Ever wanted to cut your attack rate by 3/4 and gain a slightly ranged attack that homes in on a random victim? Well there you go. Now all that is well and fine, I just don't like the ice and homing ones, but the game introduces enemies that have shields that can only be destroyed by a specific type of saber. So you have to dodge enemy fire while meticulously trying to get the game to register your command to change sabers, then break the shield in one hit, then switch back to the old saber to continue on your way. It's not good game design.\n\n7/10 So much replayability, the soundtrack was good, and the 3d backgrounds were great.

I didn't play the original, but this is one of the best sidescrollers I've ever played. It's right up there with the Disney's Aladdin DOS game and Broforce.\n\nWhat I like the most about it is the movement. Complex, yet fast, lots of options. It makes running through those long levels so much less boring. Remember how in other games you have to always take a long run back towards the objective after you've explored the level? Yeah, this game makes that fun.\n\nWeapons (elements) might be few, but each are very different and further contribute to the variety and complexity of enemies and ways to take them out! Then there's also the special attacks. I sometimes forget to use them, but the highest difficulty will actually punish you for forgetting to use them. This game wants you to smash as many buttons as you can, until the screen is full of all kinds of effects. Quite literally - you can attack as fast as you can smash the button!\n\nYou might be thinking, that if all you have to do is smash buttons, then the game is rather easy and very primitive. Yeah, for the first half an hour. Then it gets hard. + that's what makes this game special. In comparison, in Disney's Aladdin you sometimes had to stop and firgure out the best way to take out enemies and approach them as such. In this game you go full nuts and dash through the level like a cyberninja - for the first half of the game. Then it adds armored enemies with laser weapons, where that becomes more difficult to do, but still makes it the preferred playstyle!

Capcom has done an amazing job bringing back one of their beloved franchises in Strider (2014). The game is beautiful, fast, frantic and simply alot of fun to play. No other game makes you feel like such a badass ninja such as this one.\n\nStory: The story is nothing to write home about. It is pretty stock standard, the Strider organization sends their best assassin, Hiryu, to kill the dictator Grandmaster Meio who currently rules with an iron fist in Kazakh City. The plot is pretty paper thin and is only there to progress the gameplay.\n\nGraphics: On high graphics settings, Strider is a joy to look at. The character textures are super crisp, colours are vibrant and pop off the screen and the landscapes are incredibly pretty. Capcom has done well to modernize the game yet keep the charm of the original arcade classic released in 1989.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is fantastic to listen to. The composers of the game have done well to remix old tunes such that they sound fresh yet familiar and harken back to the glory days of the arcades in the 80s to 90s. The sound of Hiryu's blade cutting through enemies is very satisfying and the laser blasts have a nice retro sound to them. Each of the villains are voiced admirably, being cheesy yet fun to listen to.\n\nGameplay: Strider's gameplay is just too much fun. The game moves at a much faster pace than the original arcade game and I think is better for it. You can rapidly tap the X button on the Xbox 360 to slice and dice your way through enemies and use the trigger buttons in combination with the A button, to quickly dash through the air and jump through obstacles. Each of the gameplay elements is refined to a tee and is a pleasure to play.\n\nOverall, Strider is a fantastic reboot of a much loved arcade franchise. It is the perfect example of how to create a modern take on a series and yet still remain faithful to the original's spirit.\n\nThere should be alot more remakes like this one.\n\n9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1466142899, "timestamp_updated": 1466142899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564356803894042969", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23601894": {"recommendationid": "23601894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060277415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 632, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1466096579}, "language": "english", "review": "STRIDER\u2122 is a game that I recommend because:\n- is a method to banish boredom\n- it has a good price\n- it has full controller support\n- it is classic\n- it has action\n- it has trading cards\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1466106574, "timestamp_updated": 1466106574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.303289711475372314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23573990": {"recommendationid": "23573990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162990699", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 917, "last_played": 1469946504}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm having a blast with it.\nSatisfying combat system.\nGreat platforming.\nand resposnsive controls", "timestamp_created": 1466015211, "timestamp_updated": 1466015211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23563583": {"recommendationid": "23563583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093966296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1565588109}, "language": "english", "review": "Strider requires a good PC to run it and it's worth it for Classic Strider fans.

I am thus stuck at 92.8% complete (I swear I thought I'd gone and gotten all the unlocks, but I missed one.  LET ME GO BACK WITHOUT STARTING OVER!)\nSwitching plasma mid-fight does not feel very fluid.  On some fights I'd have to go blue, yellow, purple, and I lost a lot of health doing that.  maybe having one of the two kunai buttons as a \"next plasma\" might have been better...  maybe it's just that I am really terrible at remembering which direction is which plasma, or something...  or I'm bad at using my left thumb on the controller?  Not sure.\n\n\nUnplayed portions:\nI'm still missing quite a few achievements, I'll possibly come back to get those later.\nI haven't played any of the challenge modes.

Your character, Strider, is an assassin in a technologically advanced future dystopian world. There's an evil dictator in Kazhak and you have to assassinate him.\n\nBasically you run around the levels, slashing up bad guys with your high tech sword. Strider stats off as a fairly advanced side-scrolling melee action hero. He can run, jump, slide, climb walls (even hang ceilings), and slash enemies with this sword, you even get to charge up your super attack meter. You have a life meter so you can get hit a few times before dying. You also have a mana meter that autochages but you start without any mana or skill to use it.\n\nKilling enemies will grant you a little bit of life and mana and help charge your super attack meter. Getting hit takes away life and some of your charge meter. When your meter is fully charged, for  a short period of time, your attacks are more powerful and have extended range.\n\nAs you explore the levels and progress through the story you earn power ups for Strider and his sword. He can learn new actions: double jump, dash, downward flying stab, throw daggers, deflect enemy shots, charge the sword, and summon mosnters to attack or for \"fast travel.\" Summoning monsters to attack and throwing kunai use up mana.\n\nYou also earns elemental upgrades for the sword: fire, ice, and magnetic charge. These elemental upgrades can also be applied to his charged sword attacks, throwing daggers (kunai), and dash attacks. You can choose which element to have active.\n\nThere are also optional upgrades to find throughout the map. Extend life bar, extend mana bar, increase mana re-charge, and number of kunai thrown per use. These require a bit of backtracking. They are not necessary but very helpful to have.\n\nI played this on easy difficulty and found it to be an enjoyable experience.\n\nI highly recommend using a controller.

There's no weird sh*t or gimmicks to pull your attention away.\n\nIt's also not a heavy lift - controls are precise and simple.  This is a game with a lot of hidden stuff, but it also WANTS you to find that hidden stuff.  There's some backtracking involved to get to hidden items (like when you gain a new ability, and so can reach/break a previously unreachable/unbreakable doorway), but it never comes off as tedious.\n\nWell worth the cost, even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1465280572, "timestamp_updated": 1465280572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23428909": {"recommendationid": "23428909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005545917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1663362656}, "language": "english", "review": "Instant nostalgia!", "timestamp_created": 1465270238, "timestamp_updated": 1465270238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23428646": {"recommendationid": "23428646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119607988", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1515123719}, "language": "english", "review": "FUCKING HARD AS FUCK AW GOD STOP KILLING ME FLYING ROBOTS AHHH FUCK.Long story short good game", "timestamp_created": 1465268416, "timestamp_updated": 1465268416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23419823": {"recommendationid": "23419823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116763746", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1465595427}, "language": "english", "review": "Why don't you have this game?", "timestamp_created": 1465227316, "timestamp_updated": 1465227316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23415407": {"recommendationid": "23415407", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970951404", "num_games_owned": 2232, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1447423785}, "language": "english", "review": "needs more tities.", "timestamp_created": 1465205574, "timestamp_updated": 1465205574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436123371124267578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23415375": {"recommendationid": "23415375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263566417", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1464958944}, "language": "english", "review": "Great visual and gameplay.

He doesn\u2019t get bogged down in the details, preferring instead to slice first and ask questions later. His latest hack-and-slash action game is the same way. Without preamble or pretext, you\u2019re dropped straight into the action, cleaving through one hapless guard after another. Strider\u2019s capacity for carnage is boundless, and the acrobatic precision with which he dispatches his foes makes him a delight to control. Right away, you have everything at your disposal to feel like a one man army, and as your arsenal grows, so too will your enjoyment of this well-crafted game.\n\nSimply being Strider feels great. The way he moves from running to sliding to climbing a wall to bisecting a robot is so seamless that you feel like a tempest on the battlefield. From the arc of his jump to the range of his slide, all of Strider\u2019s movements are perfectly measured to give you complete command of the action. In the beginning you can do little more than jump and slash, but by exploring the world and defeating powerful bosses, Strider unlocks new techniques for his arsenal. Reflecting bullets, throwing knives, and summoning a eagle made of pure energy are just some of the powers you earn, and those powers expand your fighting repertoire in new and interesting ways. Instead of mindlessly cutting down the competition, you could send your eagle to intercept airborne foes while you take out those on the ground. Alternatively, you could employ a long-range strategy using the throwing knives and reflection cypher to dispatch foes from afar.\n\nWhichever you choose, juggling these powers together is a real delight, and cartwheeling through the air while dispensing death at 360 degrees is extremely empowering. There are plenty of locked doors to be found early in your quest with no means of entry--this is the game\u2019s way of teasing you with the promise of new powers--and they grant you no choice but to pass them by. As you unlock new powers, referred to as cyphers, you are able to return to these spots and open the doors associated with your new cypher. This can help you advance along the main storyline or reward you with hidden unlockables such as concept art and new costumes.\nAs you acquire new cyphers, Strider's scarf color will change to indicate which cypher you currently have active.\n\nWhile Strider\u2019s world is filled with surprises, the backdrop itself is disappointingly drab. The game looks slick and clean, with a subtle scanline effect that harkens back to the ninja\u2019s arcade roots. However, the moment you touch down you\u2019re greeted with a futuristic, industrial aesthetic that rarely relents as you progress. Gloomy pipes and heavy machinery follow you wherever you go, splashed with all the browns, greys, and whites you can handle. Admittedly, this style has the benefit of making Strider--in all his crimson-scarfed glory--pop against the background, but even so, more variety in the different arenas would have been welcome.\n\nCertain enemies also sport a splash of color to indicate a weakness to a particular cypher. Against such a foe, Strider must switch to the appropriate cypher and use it to disable the enemy\u2019s defenses--most often a color-coded shield--before dispatching him. These enemies help keep fights feeling dynamic as they force you to mix up your tactics and utilize Strider to his fullest. One cypher, the cold cypher, does rise above the rest with its incredibly powerful ability to quickly freeze enemies. Frozen enemies can take no action, and are locked in place for several seconds. Other cyphers add to the enjoyable chaos of Strider's combat, but the cold cypher does the opposite. It simplifies encounters and feels more like a crutch than a compliment to your other abilities.\n\nUnlike most rank-and-file grunts, Strider's bosses maneuver around the arena making them very different--and enjoyable--encounters.\n\nOnce you finish Strider\u2019s main adventure, you can try your hand at the game\u2019s challenge modes. These challenges come in two varieties: survival and beacon run. Survival challenges are all about testing your combat prowess. You\u2019re granted a pre-selected loadout of cyphers and turned loose against wave after wave of enemies. Beacon runs, on the other hand, are all about speed and agility. Your goal is to pass through each of the beacons on your way to the goal, all the while navigating a trap-and-enemy-infested environment. This mode is especially welcome since Strider is so fun to control and the main game rarely tests your platforming capabilities. When a challenge is completed, you are graded on your performance and can compare your stats against others on challenge-specific leaderboards.\n\nFrom the moment you embark on your journey right up until the final deathblow, Strider is a blast to play. Controlling this agile ninja feels empowering right out of the gate, and each new upgrade brings with it an enjoyable new way to engage your foes. While his world is a little drab there\u2019s still plenty to explore even after the job is done. Strider is fun, pure and simple, and serves as a fitting revival of a classic video game hero.\n\nStrider / PlayStation 4 & Xbox One / PC\n\nThe Good\n    Strider himself is wonderfully fun to control \n    Steady stream of new powers and enemies keeps combat fresh \n    Beacon run challenges let you flex your platforming muscles\n\nThe Bad\n    Strider\u2019s world is rather dull and repetitive \n    The cold cypher is too powerful\n\n8\n    Great\n   \n", "timestamp_created": 1465170484, "timestamp_updated": 1465170484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630635559558868408", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23408436": {"recommendationid": "23408436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123079251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1420249571}, "language": "english", "review": "The fact that I didn't make a review for this game sooner is a shame.

My only real gripe is that the boss battles manage the rare feat of being too easy, but also feeling very cheap - you will take damage from some apparently unavoidable attacks, but they do so little damage there's no real incentive to try to learn to avoid them. I also wish the objectives were presented a little more creatively than having your AI computer thing just tell you where to go. Finally, it's lacking some of the zaniness of the original Strider - sure its got a mecha-gorilla callback, but where's the stuff like the Politburo transforming into an armored dragon?

Later you get Kunai's (Throwable Daggers), Double-Jump Boots, different Plasma Upgrades (Normal/Reflective, Fire, Ice and Magnet) for your Sword (The Upgrade Names heavily implies on the same Upgrades from Metroid Prime for those who know it ;) ), Robo-Equipment (Panther, Eagle and Flying Saucer), etc.\n\nThe Stages are mostly 2 Layer based which means, that you can later switch from one side of the stage to the other.\nThey are based in the Kasach Region where you will explore the City, Military HQ, Research Lab, Underground Facilities, etc.\n\nLike in the Original, you will fight against Bosses at specific Times where at the End you get rewarded with an Upgrade most of the Time which enables you to explore new Areas or track back for earlier Stages to get Upgrades which was before impossible to get without the right Equipment.\n\nThe Graphics are good and the Effects aren't overly used on the Display to avoid losing Orientation in Combat. Also good BGM during Exploration and Combat.\n\nHere are some of my + / o / - Points:\n\nPositive:\n-Good fastpaced Remake in the Style of the Original Strider\n-Character can climb on almost any Surfaces which makes for a good fastpaced Running in the Stages (especially later with Character based Upgrades)\n-Many Upgrades and Extra Collectibles (Skins, Concept Arts and Enemy Infos)\n-Challenging Boss Fights\n-Some Boss Fights returns also from the Original aside of Grandmaster Meio (Mecha-Pon, Solo, Ouroboros and the Chinese Sisters)\n-Mostly Easy Achievements for those who likes to collect them\n-All of the 4 Sword Upgrades are important and balanced for different Enemies/Obstacles\n-Kunai's can also be upgraded (More Range, More Kunai's in one Throw)\n-Kunai's and Plasma Catapult can be upgraded like the Sword with the 4 Elements and have different Effects while changing the Plasma Type (Example: With Fire Plasma you can throw Explosive Kunai's which explodes after sticking to an Object, etc.)\n-3 different Robo Equipments which can aid you in Combat\n\nNeutral:\n-BGM gets later a bit repetetive while the earlier BGM's where more remarkable in my Opinion\n-Heavy Attack not so much usable (I rarely used it, since Light Attacks are faster and can deal more Damage over Time)\n-The Kunai Weapon is gained as Upgrade much later in the Game, while i personally preferred it that they should be made earlier available, since they are very useful as Anti-Air Weapons\n\nNegative:\n-Not much of a Story (Kill Grandmaster Meio) or especially a short Explanation at the Beginning. You get thrown right on the 1st Stage withough knowing what's going on if you didn't read some Infos beforehand.\n-Short Duration of the Game with ca. 5-7 hours depending on your Skill (It took me 5 and half an Hour for completing the Game while collecting all of the Upgrades, but not all of the Collectibles)\n-Not much Variety of Enemies (Mostly you will fight against Light/Heavy Soldiers and Drones with different Weapons)\n-Stages are also lacking of Variety (Mostly Military Complexes and Facilities) while Original had also Jungle/Tundra based Levels\n-The Lack of a General Map to orientate makes it later difficult to navigate for collecting Upgrades/Collectibles\n\nFazit:\nThe Game is fast and the Movement is amazing. Good and fair Boss Fights.\nFor Fans who like Metroidvania like Games, i can recommend it. \n\nDue to the short Duration of the Game it is up to you if you want to wait for a Sale or get it now.\nI also really recommend playing it with a Gamepad since using a Keyboard gets to be troublesome in some Stages.", "timestamp_created": 1464470009, "timestamp_updated": 1464470421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549189209938049316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23258783": {"recommendationid": "23258783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013779354", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 724, "last_played": 1464462927}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game.

It also allows you to check maps of the areas you already explored. \n\n[i]I had troubles checking other areas using the map. It seems the coordinates of the map stick to you so other areas map's are not centered and you will need to zoom out and then try to find it, there are also cases when you can't see the whole map if you are not completely zoomed out. Since the scrolling limit is reached before you get to the edges.[/i] \n\nThen you have an equipment tab which only purpose is to tell you the skills and power ups you unlocked so far.\n[i]It kind of spoils the game since it tells you how many health, energy and kunai power ups are in the whole game and also the quantity of \"locked\" slots hints to the quantity swords and dashes you will get on the long run.[/i]\n\nAnd finally a suit tab, as you explore you will find different ninja suits which can used as soon as you get them. These suits have a small lore and are purely cosmetic (they're just palette swaps).\n\n[b]Movement:[/b] \nIt's quite fluid. The controls are very responsive and easy to use. Hiryu moves really fast and can jump into walls and ceilings, moving between them is relatively easy and this allows to explore the map to find hidden bonuses and power ups.\n\n[b]Attack:[/b] \nHiryu can run/jump/climb and attack with his sword at the same time giving him a lot of fluidity while attacking. You can also change the angles of your slashes. Depending on the situation, charge your attack and deal a high damage slash or deal quick slashes at the speed of your button mashing skills. \n\n[spoiler]You also unlock different elements for your sword, and kunais which allow you to reflect projectiles, burn, blow up, freeze and stun enemies and different kind of skills, adding lots of variety to your attacks.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]World:[/b] \nEach area is interesting in its own way, the first areas are quite basic, letting you learn the ropes and the limits of your starting abilities and each area increases the platforming difficulty taking into account the mobility skills you have acquired, forcing you to use them to its maximum potential. ex: [spoiler] as you acquire double jump, the next area will ask you to jump an electric barriers which would have been impossible if you lacked that skill.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]This also happens when you unlock air dash.[/spoiler]\n\nAs you go further into the game, you unlock different types of \"swords\" and skills which, in a really metroid-esque style, allow you to gain access to previously inaccessible parts of the map or warp between areas. The map is indeed big so these fast travel devices really help at moving around the areas (which you will do a lot if you want to find all the hidden power up and extras which are almost always behind a door that can be unlocked with one of your newly acquired skill). \n\n[i]One thing I noticed is that these \"warp\" devices, while they always take you to the same place, it is never previously told to you to where you're being sent. So if you don't memorize where each one will take you, you could end up wasting some time. [/i] \n\nThe enemy variety is quite lacking tho, it relies on upgraded version of the same enemies to up the difficulty as you keep advancing.\n\n[h1]Difficulty:[/h1]\nYou have infinite lives, there are a few checkpoints in each area, if you die. You get a fision mailed screen and then spawn in one of them so you can try again.\n\nThe enemy variety is like this: mech-soldier, turret, big dudes and stationary cannons. \n[list]\n    [*]Mech-soldiers: They're pretty much the same. Their variety relies on what weapons they use (rifle,shotgun,machine guns, small rocket launchers or shields), most need from 1charged slash and/or 3 slashes to die since they grow a bit more durable as you progress.\n    [*]Flying turrets: They're pretty much the same as mech-soldiers, except airborne.\n    [*]Big dudes: Durable and slow, they telephone their attacks and can be easily kill-able by just jumping from their left to their right (they prioritize turning and they do it really slow).\n    [*]Stationary Cannons: Placed on walls or ceilings, they shoot at you rapidly, recharge and shoot at you again. \n[/list]\n\nOutside of bosses, the game is relatively easy even on hard difficulty. The charged attack has a wide range, deals high damage which allows you to take care of many enemies in a row and just needs approx. 2sec. to charge. Your normal attacks interrupts most enemies so as long as you keep hitting them they wont retaliate. As you get more power ups and new skills, you keep getting stronger to the point where most enemies won't really pose a threat to you. \n\nPlatforming is also quite forgiving. Stepping on the acid/lava deals low damage as long as you jump out of it asap (which is pretty easy since the pools are shallow, they reach Hiryu's thighs at most) and anything that should one-shot you just does some chip damage and then returns you to the closest safe place you landed before so you can try again. So save for some exceptions, it's almost impossible to die from failed platforming,\n\nThe bosses difficulty is harder compared to the normal enemies. They follow attack patterns as you lower their hp and enter \"phases\". this can be learned mid-fight, so as long as you learn it, the easiest ones should be doable on the first try.\n\nYou're most feared enemies will be the popup messages by npcs which take space near the bottom of the screen, hiding enemies, traps and projectiles which you could have seen otherwise.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\nThere really isn't any memorable soundtrack here, nor there are area specific music, so you will end up hearing around 5 different musics as you play.\n\n[h1]Extras[/h1]\nThere are a few extras that are unlocked by discovering them in hidden parts of the world areas. \n[list]\n  [*]Artwork: Developers drawings and drafts\n  [*]Enemy data: Description of enemies and lore followed by their respectives 3D model.\n  [*]Challenges: Gauntlets and Speed runs. Clearing them would provide of an extra hour of gameplay but this doesn't really unlock anything additional.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nStrider is a decent game, It takes around 10hrs to clear the game if you backtrack to get all the power ups and most extras(I got around 78% of the extras when I cleared the game) I did backtrack on my own to get them earlier as soon as I unlocked a new skill, thinking I would never go back if I hadn't... The game had me go back anyways. So knowing this, one a new run it would take me 1 hour less or so to clear the game.\n\nThe controls are nice and each new skills adds a lot to your mobility and damage but they don't really offer enough to provide the possibility of multiple playstyles until very late game. the platforming is quite challenging but also very forgiving in deadly areas via re-spawn. The difficulty is intermediate even in its highest difficulty with not much enemy variety. \n\nI would recommend it as long as you buy it on a 50%+sale.", "timestamp_created": 1463168087, "timestamp_updated": 1463268620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768475115299224854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22954469": {"recommendationid": "22954469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066694653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 252, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1463146219}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended, runs well & smooth, simple gameplay, fast pace, Keyboard controlls not ideal but still a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1463146255, "timestamp_updated": 1463146255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465473145246505737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22952309": {"recommendationid": "22952309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088775500", "num_games_owned": 2981, "num_reviews": 279, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1460822336}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nAnother one of those old retro game remakes, except this one stays true to the feeling and improves upon it, nice gameplay, reason to backtrack, nice graphics, cool boss battles, this game has it all, if you like retro games or 2D games I would recommend you to try this game out, its quite a gem 4/5!!!

I didn't know what to expect, having never played a Strider game before, and I was pleasantly greeted by a fast-paced classic side-scroller. Gameplay is very hack and slash oriented, your primary weapon is a sword that can be swung incredibly fast in multiple directions, even while airborne. This gives you a wide range of flexibility when attacking enemies, which is nice. Along the way you pick up upgrades and special moves/weapons that offer some variety to your attacks. These upgrades also represent the metroidvania elements of the game, as they can be used to further explore areas of the free roaming maps that were previously inaccessible.\n\nOn the technical side the game runs smooth and fast, as expected from a game of this genre. It offers a pretty good selection of graphics tweaking options, though I assume most PCs these days will have little trouble handling the game. While it\u2019s not a visual spectacle by any means, it manages to look pretty nice, showcasing the unique art style in great detail.\n\nOverall, Strider is pretty fun through and through if you're looking for a game of this type. There are a few downsides; combat can get somewhat repetitive before you gain all of your abilities and a few of the bosses are pretty disappointing in terms of challenge, however, they are not too detrimental to the overall experience. You can run through the game pretty quickly (there's an achievement for beating it in under 4 hours), however fully exploring each area will undoubtedly add some extra playtime.

Very fast, high paced, no compromise, 360 degree platforming action. An effective cross-breed between free-running and a metroidvania style map makes this a modern day halmark for the genre and the series.\n\nSo the original strider was a platformer with some sick hack 'n' slash elements. It had cool moves and a whickedly long sword that was fast to boot. You'd make your way from one end of the level to the next while slashing everything to bits; including the Soviet parliament. Good times.\n\nThe new version is not a remake; more like an emulation and update. With the finesse of today's hardware Strider has been made more agile, and faster. Everything about him is smooth and flexible. You can attacks in eight directions, while in motion, on any surface. Ok, not while hanging from a ceiling, but it is still more than you're getting from Simon Belmont. The flexibility of Strider's movement options is so amazing you'd wish you could play other games with them. \n\nAlong with the fluid movement options you also acquire a number of powers. Like shield drones, energy panthers and power hawks, along with elemental powers and kunai. All these tools are needed to fend off the never ending tide of conscripted enemies and bosses. You can clear a room on the fly, but sometimes you need to stop and think and moderate your approach before being gunned down by a crossfire of machinegun bullets. It is awesome and fun to deal with obstacles in such a fast and agile way. It helps keep the pace up and the fun coming.\n\nYou make your way through an open world, with indicators telling you where to go. Certain abilities unlock new areas, just like in the classic Metroid games (I'm calling them classic now; I have little faith in Nintendo at this time). This sends you round the world with the option to go back for more powerups or to plow on ahead, straight for the boss' head. Three ways the game offers you a level of freedom. In movement, in combat, and in exploration. \n\nThe game takes a step back from it's Soviet roots and propells you into a Soviet controlled neo-industrialist nation that is being opressed by a powerhungry madman. Standard fare. Not much time is spent on story or expostion.

At the time of its release, this type of game wasn\u2019t quite as abundant as it is now, but the standard formula was set in stone: explore the world (smacking baddies as you go), find new items, and use these to explore further. [i]Strider[/i] is comfort gaming in that it does nothing to shake up the formula, but is pleasant to look at and play, and is over before it outstays its welcome.\n\nI used a gamepad to play, and it worked well. Hiryu, with his flowing scarf and permanent crouching dash, is a real treat to control. He\u2019s always fast and agile, and fans of the series will be pleased to hear that his cartwheeling jump is present and has been perfectly realised. The movement and animation is smooth, but I found that Hiryu would cling a bit too readily to walls and ceiling, and his movement when in this clinging state is significantly slowed. It\u2019s hardly a deal breaker but I did feel it wasn\u2019t as slickly executed as the other running and jumping. It would be remiss of me not to mention that you can\u2019t bind movement to the d-pad, which will probably be a deal breaker for some players.\n\nUnlike some games of it\u2019s type, there isn\u2019t much menu hopping in [i]Strider[/i], so you\u2019re free to roam and fight. A creature of habit, Hiryu uses only one weapon, a kind of laser sword, and he\u2019s so comfortable with it it's like an extension of his body. Hammering the light attack will produce a series of very quick attacks, and holding it will charge up for a big horizontal swing. This can stagger the game's weaker enemies, and - BONUS! - it makes a wicked slicey sound. You can do launcher attack as well, but I rarely used it as you can\u2019t launch larger enemies for air-juggling, and the weaker ones go down quickly enough with basic swings. This isn\u2019t a game where you\u2019ll have to memorise combo attacks, which makes it more accessible but also means the combat has little depth. The iconic appearance of the sword and the sound it makes means it feels great to use, and at the start of the game I was cackling with glee as I tore through entire regiments of robot enemies, but as the large mech enemies began to appear at the end of the game, and even footsoldiers started to carry shields, I longed for a bit more variety in my means of attack. At that point your tactics basically come down hit the bad guy in his unguarded back, which works in almost every instance.\n\nSome variety comes in the form of unlockable kunai which can be thrown to pepper weak flying enemies or hit far switches, but they don\u2019t have any of the punch of the sword and can\u2019t be thrown often enough to be much use in a heated fight. In addition to these, you\u2019ll find different modes which affect the sword and kunai, for example an icy blue one which can freeze enemies solid, useful for both traversal (frozen enemies are platforms) and combat. You can switch to any state with a single button push, so can vary things up as much as you like without getting bogged down in menus. Lastly, Hiryu can collect three \u201cOptions\u201d, powerful tools which can seriously damage bosses, but which are limited in use by an energy meter. I, ahem, always forgot to use them, but they\u2019re there and they work fine.\n\nMy biggest complaint about [i]Strider[/i] is that it\u2019s short and fairly samey throughout, definitely a more linear kind of metroidvania. You explore one large city, Kazakh, themed around a soviet dictatorship. Although you\u2019ll travel through a prison, an army base, and an underground lab (oh, and a sewer for some dumb reason) each area looks pretty similar to the last. I didn\u2019t get lost much in [i]Strider[/i], but that\u2019s not because I\u2019ve got a great sense of direction or was able to navigate by landmarks, but simply because most areas aren\u2019t very big and don\u2019t allow for much in the way of diversion. If you go down the wrong track, more often than not you\u2019ll find a \u201csecret\u201d pickup, usually a piece of concept art, and then you\u2019ll have to double back and go the other way. The map is actually pretty good, but you won\u2019t often use it.\n\nThe story, such as it is, isn\u2019t worth mentioning. These guys are baddies, and Hiryu has to stop them, simple as that. There\u2019s a smattering of cool bosses in here, but also some weak and forgettable ones. None of them really tested me as a player, and honestly I breezed through the game on the standard difficulty. But, I\u2019m not complaining: I tend not to finish a lot of games these days, so it was nice to play one which gave me just what I was expecting, and didn\u2019t throw up any big roadblocks.\n\nWith good controls and animation, okay combat, and so-so level design, [i]Strider[/i] doesn\u2019t quite do enough to really stand out from the pack, but if you\u2019re looking for a quick, bombastic adventure, you\u2019d be remiss not to at least give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1458822005, "timestamp_updated": 1458905474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542151153087615967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22018851": {"recommendationid": "22018851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050641921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1107, "last_played": 1497499420}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic action-platformer with some metroidvania-style gameplay elements.

A solid and attractive platformer built around a rather nonsensical plot, the game runs the player through a variety of environments as they slowly unlock new abilities for the main character, allowing them to access more and more of the world in a fairly linear fashion.\n\nThis game takes the design of Metroidvania games and does it much better. Backtracking? There isn\u2019t much of it here; the game is designed to take the player on a linear route through the world, and while it feels nice and convoluted, the overall amount of backtracking is very minimal. This is an excellent piece of game design that many other Metroidvanias could learn from; the only real backtracking required is a few areas which have to be unlocked by later abilities.\n\nThe core gameplay itself is pretty enjoyable. The platforming feels good, you can climb along the walls and ceilings, there aren\u2019t too many bottomless pits, the enemies are reasonably varied, there are tons and tons of bosses (about one every half hour or so), with new enemies introduced like clockwork in the meanwhile. The game is always kept feeling fresh, and at the end, you get to put all your skills to work taking down the big bad.\n\nThe game has decent voice acting, but the plot itself is pretty much nonsense; it isn\u2019t really clear what is going on beyond \u201cThere is a bad guy who is in charge and you need to kill him.\u201d Who sent Strider? Who are all these people? Why is the big bad doing what he is doing? Who knows? Who cares? It doesn\u2019t matter!\n\nYour goal is to cut your way through his minions, and the game employs you admirably in this.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty great game. The graphics ae solid, the game is the right length for what it is and doesn\u2019t feel stretched at about 9 hours to 100% it, the protagonist has a reasonably diverse set of skills which can be employed in a few different ways to make your way through the levels and beat down the bad guys \u2013 if I had a complaint, it would be that the standard game difficulty might have been a touch on the easy side at times, but overall, it wasn\u2019t really an issue. Checkpoints were pretty generous and never really felt like they set you back too far even if you did fail.\n\nWas it perfect? No. But I had fun playing it, and the game had excellent pacing which kept me interested and kept me wanting to play after I got rolling through to the very end, even though it gave me many, many possible break points to choose from.\n\nAll in all, this is a great reboot, and the game was really quite fun and was worth the 9 hours I invested.

The game uses modern particle graphics and is overall a fun (but challenging) way to spend about 9 hours. \n\nYou play Strider Hiryuu, a kind of futuristic ninja fighting against the forces of Grandmaster Meio, who rules the city with an iron fist (+ magic powers). Your fellow striders have fallen in battle, and you can find their remains occasionally as you wander the areas of the game. Finding a fallen strider gives you a new skin (just a different color suit). Grandmaster Meio isn\u2019t your only problem though, he has an army of henchmen, cyber troops, and bosses for you to battle before you even see him. \n\nAs mentioned before, the game is a two dimensional side scroller and you will spend most of your time double jumping, climbing walls, and boosting around with your plasma catapult (a kind of air dash). Since there is no money or exp to pick up, you can actually run or jump past most of the enemies in the game. That\u2019s why the game has an achievement for completion in under 4 hours. I took 10 hours my first run through since I tried to grab all the upgrades around the game world. Strider has a world map similar to Super Metroid, where you can see most of the upgrades on the map as soon as you get close enough, and you\u2019ll constantly be encountering doors that you can\u2019t open until later in the game with the appropriate weapon. Almost all of the fighting is done with your trusty sword \u201ccypher\u201d that can be upgraded with special effects like fire, ice, and bullet reflection later in the game. You also have special attacks like throwing kunai, and \u201csummoning\u201d support, but your sword will deal with 95% of your enemies.\n\nPros:\n+The game is challenging (especially some bosses) but there\u2019s no penalty for dying so you can try out a bunch of different ways to tackle enemies. Be aware though, that some bosses have an unskippable dialogue scenes so if you keep dying and restarting boss fights you\u2019ll get annoyed with their long-windedness.\n+You can cling to almost any surface and with double jump + plasma catapult there\u2019s all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore in the city. A lot of upgrades can be found this way.\n\nCons:\n-Not much of a story, but the game is pretty casual (not the difficulty) so it\u2019s not that big a deal. You\u2019re probably playing for the ninja action anyway.\n-Some of the gameplay elements aren\u2019t explained very well.  I didn\u2019t understand until about halfway through the game how the energy system worked or what the \u201ccombo meter\u201d did. Neither of these things are critical to winning (at first), but a short tutorial would have been helpful.\n\nOverall, Strider is fun and just challenging enough that you\u2019ll find yourself respawning a few times at the bosses.  If the regular enemies become too repetitive, you can just run and jump past them. You should probably play this game with a controller though I used keyboard (no mouse input). The reason I used the keyboard is that you mash on the attack button a lot, which I don\u2019t like to do on my controller. \n", "timestamp_created": 1456164598, "timestamp_updated": 1456164598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509954392910003662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21364864": {"recommendationid": "21364864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180549358", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1500651349}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and intresting platform game with a lot puzzles and action :)", "timestamp_created": 1456063863, "timestamp_updated": 1456063863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21324389": {"recommendationid": "21324389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114686272", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1456692658}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Historia: 10/10\nControles: 8/10 (Un tanto complicados, pero nada del otro mundo)\nBanda Sonora: 10/10\nGr\u00e1ficos: 10/10\nAI: 10/10\nReplay Value: 10/10\nMultiplayer: N/A\n\nGran juego! lo recomiendo, excelentes gr\u00e1ficos y buena historia", "timestamp_created": 1455912308, "timestamp_updated": 1530097659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496240615844726563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21314087": {"recommendationid": "21314087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109669131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1016, "last_played": 1455874377}, "language": "english", "review": "Best platformer I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1455874457, "timestamp_updated": 1455874457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21312403": {"recommendationid": "21312403", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975161360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1455862891}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun all in all, though not perfect.

No, I wouldn't. Why? Because, unlike what most people claim, the game just isn't fun. Maybe I'm crazy, but I feel like the complete lack of context and the INCREDIBLY weak excuse for a \"story\" in the game deals a rather harsh blow to it. Adding to that, the fact that the metroidvania tag applied is VASTLY misleading, I just couldn't find anything fun about it.\n\nNow, just to be clear, the game isn't bad (extremely annoying flashing lights during \"boss intros\" notwithstanding), but I honestly couldn't find any enjoyment in playing it. I suppose if I have to praise it for something, it would be that it wastes no time in letting you get to the action and start kicking \u00e4ss, but the fact of the matter is that it feels like that's ALL you do. Yeah, combat is pretty centrical for ALL metroidvania games, but there's SUPPOSED to be exploration as well!\n\nStrider has essentially no exploration whatsoever. This, in case you're not aware, is a direct violation of the entire metroidvania formula. It'd be like a Super Mario game WITHOUT MARIO.\n\nAll in all, between the completely hollow \"story\" and the utter lack of exploration, I can't recommend this game. It's not bad, it's just boring.

Coming into this, I didn't quite expect what I got. Strider is an amazingly fun action platformer, that you can either play in short bursts, or one long playthrough. The game boasts a progression system similar to that of Mega Man, and is an adreniline driven hack and slash. You play as Hiryu, a part of a ninja clan known as the Striders, sent deep into the heart of a technologically advanced version of Cold War Russia, where the citizens are ruled under the steel fists of Maio (Prenounced May-O). Your Mission? Get in, assassinate Maio, get out, get payed. It's not as simple as this, as Maio and his countless armies forsee your attack, and are constantly on guard. Will you defeat Maio, and free his people? That's up to you. There are only 4 problems I have with this game, and they are quite small. \n1: Cutscenes are unskippable, and some bosses have cutscenes before you fight them, so you have to watch them multiple times if you die. \n2: Some cutscenes suffer from framerate issues, and can go on, even after the characters have finished speaking. \n3: Occasionally Stiff or wooden voice actors, some of which just sound plain silly. \n4: Occasionally, Strider will get stuck on a wall for a few seconds, or the controls will go stiff for a few seconds. Besides these small problems the game is a blast, and I recommend you give it a try. My absolute favorite thing about this game is that Strider will swing his sword just as fast as you press the attack key, so if you mash it, bloods gonna fly.

The gameplay manages to combine the old with the new with Strider being extremely mobile and slashing his blade with unprecedented speed. The addition of metroidvania style gameplay seems like a natural fit for the franchise and the sprawling pseudo Russian capital city provides some breath taking and artistically intriguing locales to venture into. \n\nAs a long time fan of the franchise I'm absolutely thrilled to have it back in such a blaze of glory.

If you want to know much about this game, here are the points I have written in details, and I have avoided spoilers.:\n\n1/ Story: The game story is nice, albeit a little bit too simple, but sufficient enough.\n\n2/ Platforming: The puzzles, obstacles in the game are well-designed. You will need to acquire the skills in the game to get past a lot of obstacles. The Devs really have thoroughly put their thoughts and mind into designing these obstacles. \n\n3/ Exploration: As you play in a huge city, Strider is full of places to visit if you decide not to stick to the guide and instruction from the game. Try wandering around the city on your own, you will discover a huge lot of fun things to do.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that this is merely a little open-world type of game. There won't be side-quests. And sometimes if you happen to be in somewhere you haven't been before, or re-visited randomly, there may be boss battles, so prepare yourself well. But don't worry, the game won't put you into a random boss battle if it doesn't know you have the skills required to enter that battle.\n\nBut after you get some skills, you could go around and try visiting the old places to get more power-ups. If you are afraid that you might get lost, use the Maps.\n\n4/ Maps: However, sometimes, you will need to do some zoom-in and out for the Maps. I did had a problem with the Map when trying to switch from one area to another, since the Map of another area might disappear from the screen, and you could not see anything. In this case, I would recommend trying move the arrow keys around, try zoom-in and zoom-out, you will get over this problem easily.\n\n5/ Power-ups, upgrades: Strider offers a good variety of power-ups you will need to win the combat. From Ice, Flame, to Magnetic, Kunai, Option A-B-C (you will figure it out what they are) or skills such as Projectile Reflecting with your sword... and much more, it's definitely great to play such as a game with so many things you can use to deal with the enemies. These upgrades will also help you in exploring the city. And using them to get to strange places you have never been to before.\n\n6/ Combat + Boss: Definitely the best points to talk about. If there's anything I would recommend, it would be going for the Hard mode when you start playing the game.\n\nTrust me, it's gonna be one huge fun to do. That's what I did when I first played this game. Going for the Hard mode in Strider not only makes you realize how much important it is to explore the city to get more power-ups, costumes (did I mention there are 11 awesome costumes in this game?), concept art.. but also to make you prepare yourself harshly for go into the battle with the Bosses.\n\nFor 1 or 2 first bosses of the game, you will feel like the game is pretty harsh on your Health, since the Bosses at Hard mode are no joke, they mean serious business if you don't master your dodging and sword slicing skill well enough. But after getting your hands on some Energy and Health upgrades, you will realize the Boss battles are much gonna be easier. They will only have one or two fatal strikes at you. So try Hard mode, it's totally encouraging. Even the damage of normal minions, enemies are gonna be a lot strong, so try to get a lot of upgrades. By the time you reach the Final Boss, believe me, the Final Boss would not be hard to finish.\n\nAs for the Combat: I would state it in two words \"Button Mashing\". I can spoil you on this one, but it means, in the boss battle, if you want to win (Well, I'm still talking about Hard mode) without letting yourself getting killed fast by the Bosses' damage, you would do well to hit those guys as fast as you could. Since the number of consecutive hits on them do matters in this game, hit them fast will help you increase your own damage. Therefore, you will have pressed a button, like , 200-300 times after this game, and that's ok :D\n\n\nWell, that's about everything I can tell you. I totally would play this game all over again. Because Strider is a great game. And it's gonna be totally worthy of your own money.\n\nScore: 9.5/10. -0.5 because of the Maps >.>", "timestamp_created": 1453578953, "timestamp_updated": 1453579149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20690539": {"recommendationid": "20690539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019838342", "num_games_owned": 1036, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1453170858}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels silly for the player to be shot by someone off the screen because the view is so zoomed in (with no control over zoom by player input).

For the uninitiated, this means it's a platformer with vast explorable levels and tons of little nooks and crannies to find unlockables and hidden items. It's also got an emphasis on combat and by the end of the game you'll find you have a lot of tools at your disposal to be able to take care of the various enemies that get thrown your way. That said, I'm going to break this review down into the various components that are considered essential in the execution of a good metroidvania and see how [b]Strider[/b] measures up.\n\n[h1]Controls: 9/10[/h1]\nStrider is an excellent protagonist. He's extremely capable and exists as an extention of your fingertips. From the moment you start the game, you'll notice how fluidly and accurate the control scheme is and this allows you to truly take ownership of the game. For the most part, if you get hit, it's because you failed to react in time and not because the controls failed you. \n\nStrider sticks to any wall or ceiling and is able to climb every surface from the start. Sword attacks are directional and instantaneous so you're easily able to parkour your way through the levels, slicing and dicing as you go. This feeling is unique to the game, and I think what makes it a lot of fun.\n\n[h1]Combat: 6/10[/h1]\nCombat is somewhat lacking. The majority of your experience will have you mashing the attack button repeatedly to take down enemies, and the only true variation on your regular attack is the charged form. Shielded enemies provide incentive to use your charged slash, but end up feeling like more of a nuisance that breaks up the button-mashing than a variable challenge. Additionally, you have special abilities you unlock as the game goes on, all of which better enable you to steamroll your way through the game. But you will likely rely on your sword slash for the majority of the game as it retains its strength throughout.\n\nNot only is the typical combat somewhat repetitive, but there is absolutely no incentive to kill anything. I realized this about a half-hour into my playthrough and just started skipping all nonessential enemies. There is no kill score to rack up, no experience points or customizable character additions to get. You kill red shirts for being annoying and that's about it. So yes, it's still fun, but I think it's a huge missed opportunity not to reward a player for killscore. Add to that that it largely lacks challenge, and you find it fall short here.\n\n[h1]Level Design: 5/10[/h1]\nI have mixed feelings on this. At some points the level design is brilliant and rewarding, and at others it's equally dull and infuriating. Games in this style commonly emplace artificial barriers to progress. Think of The Legend of Zelda, where you need to get that next gadget (such as the boomerang) before you're able to reach certain areas of the game. The way strider uses this mechanic, however, can be infuriating. You'll find yourself skipping so much content because it's behind a door that you can't unlock yet or you haven't gotten the kunai. It's not fun. By the time I was able to access everything, I no longer cared to backtrack through the entire game to find the stuff. Compare this to a game like Shadow Complex, where part of the game actually has you backtracking through previous areas for actual progression after you've unlocked all the gadgets and you'll see that Strider falls short here.\n\nWhere the game shines, however, is the platforming. This is something that I can confidently say the game did well. The game gives you a lot of tools to navigate its levels and you'll find yourself using all of them simultaneously before you even realize it. This ninja-feel is something the game achieves well, and is extremely rewarding.\n\n[h1]Boss Fights: 7/10[/h1]\nOne of the things I'd read about going into the game is that the boss fights were repetitive and recycled. I actually couldn't disagree more. Even though you see some bosses more than once, they are not at all the same fights in most of those cases. Now, one of my qualms is that they are sometimes unfair in that some attacks are impossible to react to on your first attempt. Unfortunately this is typically the only challenge to overcome as they generally are very easy to best. Overall, boss fights are fun if not a little frustrating at times.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict: 7/10[/h1]\n\nI have mixed feelings for the game overall. Up front, I'll say that I played it on Normal difficulty and don't intend to play it again. It lacked challenge for the most part, and I saw a lot of missed opportunity in a somewhat decent game. My biggest problem with it is the abysmal level design. Still, it was a fun game to play once and I think a lot of players will have found enough reason to go back for all the extras once they've unlocked all the gadgets. I do recommend waiting until the game is on sale, but it's definitely worth your time to play once you own it.", "timestamp_created": 1451069643, "timestamp_updated": 1451069643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19937511": {"recommendationid": "19937511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074891661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1449263504}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Strider es un juego muy entretenido y bastante fren\u00e9tico, donde se premia con velocidad (no literal) el ser habilidoso y tener buenos reflejos.

It follows the formula pretty straight: platforming, distinct zones, collectables, and mobility and weapon upgrades that unlock new areas.\n\nStrider's main strength is the feeling of speed and power that was clearly a core design consideration. This is a game about movement, first and foremost, much like the original Capcom arcade title. There's no XP or leveling system, making much of the combat completely optional if you'd rather just blow right past everything instead. But the fact that you can blow [i]through[/i] enemies instead is part of the appeal, part of the sense of power that the player experiences.\n\nThis would be irrelevant if the controls weren't good; luckily, Strider controls beautifully. Environments are easy to understand, boss fights are (mostly) about player performance and not trying to figure out what to do, and everything just feels very tuned and well-tested.\n\nThere\u2019s no story to speak of. There\u2019s a collection of enemies who are clearly made in the 90\u2019s arcade game mold -- they exist to taunt the player, attack, and eventually explode.The voice acting is largely awful but one gets the idea that this was deliberate.\n\nThe problem, really, is that Strider 2014 is short and shallow. It\u2019s the sort of title that was designed for a $10 - $20 price point, to be downloaded over online services. Once you\u2019ve found all the collectables and upgrades, there is nothing else to [i]do[/i] in the world except go fight the final boss. There are challenge levels but they feel tacked-on and don't have any rewards for completion. It\u2019s not like some Metroidvania titles where there\u2019s radically different sorts of play styles depending on enemy drops and equipment choices, where each trip through the game can be very different.

However, they do the same attack patterns even if they are out of order, so that helps a lot I guess\n\n[b][u]- Backtracking for upgrades and collectibles is time consuming due to lack of good overworld design/fast travel points[/u][/b]\n~ it's not too bad as there are fast travel points but it could be way better in terms of placement and where they take you\n\n[b][u]- Unbalanced sound design[/u][/b]\nThe music isn't bad and actually fits the game pretty well, but it's nothing you'll be humming to any time soon. It is the lack of sound balance when fast traveling and attacking that puts this as a con.

This is speaking as someone who only has ever played the NES version, which despite being okay, wasn't the greatest game to hit the market. However, this one far exceeded any expectations I had.\nYou are Strider Hiryu, your job is to kill Grandmaster Meio, but obviously no game could be as simple as THAT...and for good reason because Hiryu is a total badass and it's a pleasure to play longer just so you can kick serious heiney. It's a very action oriented game since you run, jump, and just generally hack anything that moves to death with Hiryu's Cypher, which apparently is some kind of tonfa-sword combo that can be powered with various plasma types. The game can probably best be described as a Metroidvania for those of you who know what that is. Hiryu must overcome various obstacles by searching out new weapons, abilities, and such to make it all around Meio's city.\nAnd that's where the game has me for sure. If you're the kind of person who loves adventuring all about, having to know what's around every corner, and getting a little excited when you find a new power-up that will let you be even MORE of a badass ninja than you already are, then yes, definitely a game to consider getting. I'm currently not finished with the game, but I've logged a number of hours already and the game say's I'm only about 60% of the way through.\nIf there is one complaint to be had, I'll say that for normal difficulty, it seems particularly easy. Though I've done quite well at finding all the HP Upgrades, Hiryu doesn't take all too much damage unless you're standing around LETTING him get shot. If anything, the worst I've faced is when Hiryu falls into a trap and disappears and respawns on solid safe ground, which is more of an irritant than a real danger. Perhaps a harder difficulty on a later playthrough will give a bit more challenge, or possibly the game itself will bare its fangs when I get closer to the end.\nOverall, I'd say it's a solid game and I'm quite often finding it difficult to hit the Exit option when I really need to stop playing :D", "timestamp_created": 1449250390, "timestamp_updated": 1449250390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19403503": {"recommendationid": "19403503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075614420", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1514240235}, "language": "spanish", "review": "^^", "timestamp_created": 1448938832, "timestamp_updated": 1448938832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19403483": {"recommendationid": "19403483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173850066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1449511121}, "language": "english", "review": "i enjoyed it", "timestamp_created": 1448938760, "timestamp_updated": 1448938760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501765966415405273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19365313": {"recommendationid": "19365313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041153970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1445201289}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a huge fan of the Little Ninja Bros series since I was a youngling.

Now fast forward again to the release of the NES game (What is this...it's nothing like the Arcade?!), then suddenly (Wait a minute, this is pretty cool...), and finally (This is one of the greatest NES games ever!!!)\n\nSeveral years later I became the unfortunate owner of the Turd known as \"Strider 2\" by US GOLD for the Amiga. I couldn't resist when I saw the box at the store (Strider 2, are you kidding me!). The excitement only lasted a few short seconds...(Looks kind of like Strider, Sounds kind of like Strider...wait...did I just morph into a robot with tank treads for feet?!?! What the hell is this garbage!). It was so bad I had repressed the memory, only to have it crawl from the stinky depths while writing this review. US GOLD were The Masters of Dissapointment...Sh@tting all over some of my favorite franchises.\n\nStrider 2 on PS1 (alright, now we're back in business!) was pretty solid, and although didn't quite have that magic that I had found in the original Arcade or NES game, it was another good Strider game (nothing wrong with that!).\n\nOver the last 14 years, Hiryu would occasionally appear in Capcom games as an extra or playable charachter and this gave me some hope that they hadn't forgotten about one of my favorites.There was also Moon Diver on XBLA that was very \"Stider-esque\" and I believe was made by some former capcom employees, and that was decent...\n\nThen came the announcement of this game...Initially I was excited, but apprehensive (what if it's not good...) so for some reason I held off. After hearing a friend mention how much he liked the new game, I decided it was time to give it a shot. \n\nIn short, I love this game! It's like a delicious combo platter of the Original 2 (arcade & NES) Strider games, with chunky bits of strider 2 mixed in, all served up on a tasty Metroidvania platter. The graphics are great, the Sound is great, the controls are great (xb360 controller), there's lots to see and do, plenty of abilities and secrets to find, and there are some epic boss battles.

The game will always let you know exactly where to go, and while you do revisit \"areas\", you tend to only ever go to new parts of the same areas. The map's not too massive but it's big enough, the areas are diverse enough too.\n\nThe controls are really pretty good, attacking and movement are both lightning-fast, and most of the powerups make Strider more fun to control. The dash is great, the double jump is fine enough, and chaining the two can lead to some fun platforming usage, though rarely is this required. The kunai and its powerups are also a fun projectile weapon and rather powerful to boot. The four different plasma types are mostly positive; the reflect plasma makes for some interesting puzzles, the exploding plasma has the highest attack and the exploding kunai are great, the ice plasma is actually a bit annoying but is used fairly interestingly in a few puzzles, and the fourth one is just completely useless and, worst of all, slow. There's also two summons; the bird is fairly useful and strong but the panther is just... bleh. Also a shield thing I never used.\n\nStory-wise... I didn't understand the story at all until like 60% of the way through, and it's mostly inconsequential. Music's decent, not very memorable. Graphically it looks pretty good for a 2.5D game, lots of lush backgrounds and the visuals rarely get confusing. \n\nAs far as exploration, there's a little bit, but most of the puzzles are simple and very few of the secrets and collectibles are too hidden at all. A lot of them require backtracking, too, a door you can't open or a puzzle you need the dash to solve or whatever not, but there's not really much mandatory backtracking or aimless wandering involved.\n\nBoss fights range from \"that happened\" to \"one really annoying attack but otherwise simple\"; mostly, not really providing any sense of challenge. Honestly the only challenges this game presented were instances with a lot of stunlocking, which is... not a good thing, at all. I'm replaying on hard and while enemies seem to do a little more damage, the amount of health upgrades you can eventually get effectively nulls this effect.\n\nBut it's a fun enough game to play.

Also, a short-ish manga series that got obscured by it's video game counterpart. Starring Strider Hiryu - one of the best-known Capcom characters despite having only 4 games of it's own in more than 25 years time. One of those was an unofficial sequel, and one is the one I'm reviewing here.\n\nThis is a story about cybernetically enhanced ninjas iniltrating a futuristic Kazhak Soviet Socialist Republic (apparently the end of the cold war and the fall of the USSR never happened in this setting) filled with bizarre opponents to beat.\nWhy did it manage to stick around for so long ? \nSimple: Because running, sliding and cartwheel jumping at breakneck speed, while chopping up enemies with a plasma blade it is as awesome as it's weird. (Unless you're playing the unofficial sequel, in which case it's fun but nothing that special)\n\nBut how does a quarter-munching arcade game translate to a console-oriented downloadable title ?\nPretty well actually, unless you're looking for something that throws a handful of linear levels with disconnected visuals at you.\n\nInstead, you get a Metroid style map, and you'll be travelling to and fro to complete your arsenal, opening up new paths based on that, and finally tracking down and beating the final boss. There's also exploration on the side to find powerups and bonus collectibles. (Collectibles also include levels for the challenge mode, but as far as I've kept track those are the ones that are placed in plain sight along the main route - you need to make an effort to miss those).\nIn keeping with it's arcade heritage, the focus is more on the platforming action than adventuring around though, and it more than delivers on that front.\n\nThe map is mostly well designed and the movement and fighting is all as fast and as furious as it ever was, including some subtle tricks to be had - certain enemies are much easier to defeat when you figure out which weapon to use against them.\nThrow in a good number of boss fights with a few nice twists, and overall you get a good action platformer.\nOh, and it looks and sounds appropriately cartoony.\n\nIt's not without it's flaws:\n- The plot is rather thin, and is barely enough to help build the sense of progression, let alone getting you really involved in the setting.\n- The cutscenes lose points thanks to people's faces not being animated. It stands out really bad, especially since the rest of the animation is well done and fluid.\n- Outside of the boss fights, the variety in enemy types is a bit low.\n- And the game is on the easy side if you know what you're doing.\n\nBut none of those are dealbreakers, and the end result is a game that's easy to recommend to fans of 2D action games.", "timestamp_created": 1446154875, "timestamp_updated": 1446154875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18740141": {"recommendationid": "18740141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966605201", "num_games_owned": 1169, "num_reviews": 222, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1493278891}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

You get a double jump and an additional boost attack getting in the end a sort of triple jump.

Whether it's \"good\" or not is more up to your personal tastes and tolerances. The game is a Metroidvania style action platformer with all the standards of backtracking once you find new power-ups and such. This is where the game excels, the areas are mostly well designed and you rarely scratch your head as to what you need to progress or get a power-up you see currently out of reach. The combat is very simple and actiony, with one primary attack augmented by your current Plasma power setting, a secondary attack which is rarely useful outside of it's special button combo uses (use as down-special in the air), three unlockable energy consuming specials which are of varying degrees of use as they are highly specialized, and later a dash attack which you will then spam like a crazy person.\n\nSo where is the rub? The voice work is atrocious, the story is completely insipid and you will never care about it. The game isn't exceedingly long which can be viewed as good since when you reach final area it locks you out of hunting specials and when you beat the game you cannot go looking again for completion. But the two biggest complaints, and why I almost don't recommend this game are such: the controls for the gravity sections (including final boss) are godawful to the point of frustration, and there are no invincibility frames. Your controls on the gravity balls section \"try\" to compensate for constantly changing orientation but instead fuck everything up and make it work. And the lack of invincibility frames in a game like this with so many projectiles and high damage attacks means you can, AND WILL, get stunlocked to death sometimes and certain attacks will do far more damage than you'd expect (or were probably intended. Ice Breath being the biggest contender).\n\nNow, with that big wall of whining aside for the second paragraph, if you can tolerate a little jankiness and won't get too flustered during the gravity sections, on the whole the game is still undeniably fun. Just rampaging around like an unstoppable killing machine and slicing through enemies like butter is always enjoyable.

The result is hectic, satisfying combat, smooth controls, and a big map full of hidden goodies. Nailing those essential elemets would have sufficed, but gorgeous visuals and a fleshed-out story (complete with voice acting for all the dialogue) really ice the cake. Still, it's not so perfect a game that you can expect it to go down as a modern classic in its genre. It's hampered just slightly by the addition of too many combat mechanics that do little more than overcomplicate what should have been more straightforward hacking and slashing. And while there's a large world to explore, this game has the most convoluted map I've seen in a very long time, which makes exploration and secret hunting a massive headache.

Besides that the game is clean and crisp. It's a joy to play and although at first it may seem too easy (there are difficulty options), that's just a nice way to lull you into the fact that this game requires a lot of strategy. While you start with these clunky combos and button-mashing slaying of any of the Kazakh guards you see, their tactics and yours have to evolve to suit the multi-levelled terrain, the new equipment and abilities both you and the enemies get, and your general skill. The better you get, the more the game begins to feel like a brutal ballet where Strider vaults over enemies and cuts everything in his path with effortless grace. The story is far better than that of its originals since now there's not only voice acting but it's actually got a cohesive and tangible plot this time that isn't arbitrarily sending you across the world in a weirdly specific set of locations with little backstory.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game.

In my view it looked so generic on those trailers, so I thought \"great, another generic looking 2.5D game to cash in on an old franchise\". I must now eat my words. Thoughts. Whatever.\n\nI only played two strider games, this and the one on Mega Drive. I never knew there were more until I recently googled it. So my review will occasionally compare this with the 'original' (well, it was a port of the original anyway so every time I say \"original\" I mean the Mega Drive port) and occasionally talk about the game as its own thing.\n\nI loved the original game. Never finished it, as it was usually the case back then. But what really stuck with me was how different everything in the game felt from every other game. The east european backgrounds, the level where you could only see silhouettes behind lightning strikes, the crazy gravity sections. The game never ceased to throw new things at me as I made my way through the levels. Today is common place for a game to have movie-like soundtrack, with those orchestral arrangements that follow no specific tempo (in movies they follow the whatever-is-happening-on-screen-tempo) but, to my memory, Strider seems to be one of the first games that did it, and I loved it.\n\nWhy am I saying all this? because I think that feeling of playing a game filled with things I have never seen before was one of the defining features of the original and is the only thing missing from this reincarnation. Strider (now we are talking about the current game) doesn't take risks. It looks great but does nothing I haven't seen before. The few things that stand out it brings from the original, like the gravity mechanics, but not everything came and nothing ground-breaking was introduced. Granted, most of those features on the original are now commonplace and new Strider is in a tough position of showing newer things. But my point is that it doesn't take any risks in any aspect.\n\nHowever, while Strider sits in its own comfortable zone, it does everything extremely well. The game plays much like the original, your attack is as fast as you can mash the button without so much as slowing you down and you can climb walls and ceiling. Only a million times better than the original and with much more depth. There are so many maneuvers, different attacks, different enemies, that make battles extremely deep and incredibly satisfying. At first you just run through the enemies mashing the button, but as the game progresses you will find this strategy lacking. Shielded enemies will start appearing, flying enemies, enemies with different attack modules and so on. So each combination requires different strategies and fast thinking. By the end of the game I was jumping, dashing, changing weapon type in mid-air, activating powers, all within a second. The combat is, without question, the star of the game.\n\nThe linear progression of levels was abandoned in favor of a metroidvania structure. And it definitely works. Metroidvania, open world, or any other kind of structure that has you backtracking all the time, works very well with action gameplay. It's also a well made map to explore and improve your character stats by finding upgrades. I think it was a nice addition, but the fact the combat is so good is determinant.\n\nOne last thing. I thought the difficulty curve was ideal. I mention that because I read people complaining it's too easy. I did beat the last boss on my first try but that doesn't mean it was easy, I did it while standing up and shouting continuously at the screen until the ugly thing was dead.

Every time you die to a boss you get to watch the same cutscene(s) again before getting another shot, including the one where you're told its name and title. You can skip some of the cutscenes with ESC but not the introduction ones. Writing is bland. \n\nFootsoldiers are palette swaps of eachother and sometimes carry shields or guns that inflict different status effects. With the exception of shield enemies none of them pose any challenge. Shield enemies require a charged attack which also doesn't pose any problems as long as you don't face a guantlet of them. \n\nHeavy enemies are also palette swaps of eachother and more powerful versions just mean they get an additional attack. They're damage sponges too, not much skill required just lots of jumping. \n\nPlayers have a meter which fills by damaging enemies and avoiding getting hit. Next to impossible to fill during normal gameplay until you get the deflection power up, bullet hell guantlets force you to use it if you want to fill the meter. Unfortunately enemies in later areas have increased health and the deflection power up doesn't do nearly as much damage as the flaming one. The flaming one of course doesn't deflect bullets so the Charge meter doesn't see much use. \n\nReally aggravating to get hit by electricity, you can often get stunlocked.

A game by my favorite studio and gotten good critic and user reviews. But this game is the definition of mediocrity and blandness. Most of the game is spent running around the same looking futuristic drab landscape, where every level feels the same. You fight the same 3-4 guys the entire game (they try fooling you by changing color of the soldier\u2019s uniform to make you think it is a different enemy\u2026..I wasn\u2019t fooled), minus the occasional mini-boss. There are many boss fights, which is a nice change of pace, unfortunately the game uses the unfortunate trope of repeating multiple bosses. The levels are big open levels, although they are mostly empty and boring, and involve much backtracking. Most of what you will find by searching around is boring concept art nobody every cares about. \nThe other thing you will find is upgrades. In order to gain any health or energy upgrades you need to scour every single level all over the place. You start with the smallest health bar I have ever seen in a game. Don\u2019t play the game on hard because guys shoot multiple shots are once that are impossible to dodge, as you are the least elusive acrobatic ninja ever. All you can do is do a slow jump in the air where you spread out, or just run at people. There is a slide but it is slow, you do a spin first to do it, and you can still get easily hit while doing it. In hard guys do tons of damage, the health pickups give you almost no amount, and bosses take tons of retries. The terrible checkpoints mean you will have to start in areas before the boss and you will have to watch the crappy cutscene again. There is literally no story, and the small amount of dialogue/cutscenes involve terrible voice acting and models that (no joke) don\u2019t open or move their lips when they talk. \nThen there\u2019s the combat. It is the most boring ever. You literally just spam x (basic attack) as fast as you can while running at guys. The same is for the bosses. You have a charge-up attack that takes too long, and an upward slash that is completely useless. You never learn combos or anything special. By the time you learn a teleportation, or using other elements in your attack, its 2/3 done with the game already. The first 2/3 is just doing the same slash move over and over with every guy as fast as you can while you run straight at them. It became so boring and monotonous that I just tried jumping past guys to get to the next area. You can also be continuously juggled and killed with certain enemy combinations, as happened to me a few times. \nThe platforming can be fun and inventive sometimes. You can climb and stick to walls, which is not common in many platforms. Unfortunately, more than not, it frustrates. It is very finicky and hard to control. There is a way to move fast up a wall, but not horizontally move across the wall, meaning it\u2019s super slow. For some reason on platforms you can\u2019t swing around from above to under it. If you try to jump from hanging below something you must drop first, then try to jump. Many times I would try to jump off the side of a wall and it wouldn\u2019t let me detach. Other times I would try to jump over something and it would make me grab onto the side of it. \nThe worst problem I faced, above all else, was the checkpoints. On multiple occasions I would exit to a new level, and see a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d icon in the top right. I would then quit the game, and upon coming back see that the game didn\u2019t save my progress and I was back at a previous level. In one occurrence I had to redo an entire boss fight, and go to the next level again, because the same hadn\u2019t saved my progress. What game in 2015 doesn\u2019t save progress AFTER A BOSS FIGHT AND THEN A LEVEL SWITCH?\u201d!!?! This meant that I would never want to exit the game, because I never knew what it would save and what I would have to repeat. I couldn\u2019t even count on beating a boss or starting a new level to mean it had saved, as those normal staples were apparently not part of the game\u2019s save function. \nThe game does have decent length, and I still BARELY recommend it because there are a few times where the game shines and the platforming is and inventive, or a boss fight is enjoyable, or some of the new powers you get later on, including throwing stars, teleportation, etc, are fun. I just don\u2019t get why they have you get them so late in the game. The backtracking definitely frustrates as well. \n\nThere are MANY other better options in the action/platformer genre, and use this only as a last resort if you've run out of other good ones to play.

Hiryu was a badass, and (spoiler alert) defeated Ryu. So when I saw this game that I hadn't heard about before on sale and recognized it's main character, I decided to try it out, and boy, does this game have a lot to offer besides just a ball-busting protagonist! The story is set in the dystopian future of 2048 in the Russian city of Kazakh which is ruled by the oppresive Meio, a godly being who plans to wipe out humanity so that he can re-build the world in his own vision. You play as the previously mentioned Strider Hiryu, an extremly skilled ninja who must defeat Meio and restore peace to Kazakh and prevent apocalypse. The game is a Metroidvania-style hack-and-slash action-adventure platformer (wow that's a long genre name), where you use your plasma cypher to slay enemies, and as you progress in the game, you collect upgrades to your weapons, your health and energy and even new weapons and techniques. As one would expect from a Metroidvania game, these abilities and weapons are equally as useful in defeating enemies AND overcoming obstacles. The gameplay is flawless, which is mandatory for a game with such gameplay principles, and it is unbeliavebly satisfying and fun. The graphics look really nice during gameplay. When the charactermodels are zoomed in on during cutscenes, they don't look as good, but it is of little concern. All design choices are very good and everything really possesses the grim science-fiction feel the developers went for. The music, while not very memorable, is atmospheric and fitting, and it warmed my heart to hear some wobbles among the ambient noises and musical tones. Voice-acting, story, characters etc. is good, but again, not very memorable. Even on medium difficulty, the game presented quite a challenge, but it is forgiving, which I think is important in a game like this. All in all, if you like platform games, hack-and-slash games, or Metroidvania style games and play for the gameplay more than anything else, I recommend Strider with all my heart. And I also recommend playing with a controller.

Another nuisance is when the bosses are talking to you (for the Story) and you're fighting the dialog is in the way of the gameplay.  You'll simply take damage due to the fact you can't see it coming.  There's not a lot of enemies either.  Yes, there are tons of bosses, but the random enemy gets recycled throughout the game and the only differences are colors.  \n\nThe game is very good though and very much worth it for anyone that likes a good Metroidvania.

The curve of mobility upgrades could have been a bit more developed, and the combat seems to take up more of the focus. That's not really bad, but I feel like I was expecting something different. Also, back on the subject of saves, they're way too far apart here. Iteration time is NOT a hard concept. Even better, put in quicksaves, which no one ever has ever objected to.\n\nFor what it is, the game is very good. The animations are nice, I love the art style, and the combat is entertaining, and can bear being repeated several billion times as you try to defeat the boss fight right after the current room because there's no save between room and boss (seriously, this is elementary stuff). I was just expecting something different. On the bright side, however, this has made me even more excited for such games as Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.

It's even worse around gravity globes you can run on, which are their own irritating issue that just becomes more annoying.\n\nNo invincibility frames - A few normal enemies and a few boss attacks have their entire gimmick around this and squeezing as much damage as possible in one volley or chain stuns.  Easily a quarter or more of a fully upgraded health from one of those, or just getting pinballed between 2-4 enemies for a few seconds while you wait for the chance to have control again.\n\nOther smaller issues involve the final tower level being a boring difficulty spike and that wall climbing has you suddenly mantle up and over from a bit too generous of a distance.  Also there's an entire level where you run against the wind meaning you walk slow and jump short distances; meh.\n\n\nThe Good:\nMovement is amazing.  Running, dashing, jumping, and sliding around while slashing everything in sight is solid and the best part of the game.  Worth a playthrough alone just to hop around and hit stuff really.\n\n\nThe Metroidvaia aspect feels tacked on with four flavors (ice, fire, reflect, magnetic/ranged) to the dash, slash, and kunais, but overall is fun while you do a little backtracking here and there and have a dramatic pose animation that plays each time you pick up an upgrade.  Also ignore the story.  Not because the story is really bad, but because it's just in the way of the fun and makes deaths to bosses involve watching another boring taunt speech.\n\nFor all of the negatives, I do still recommend this game oddly.

What's interesting is the fact that you need to adapt to different enemies on the fly, use dashing, kunais and your special ability to get rid of enemies or just do super cool stuff in general and most of that in one fight, kind of my style especially that you can attack as fast as you can push dat button (which can result, more often than not, in boss fights not even lasting 10 seconds)\n\nThat's pretty much everything i have to say here as it's a solid game and i liked it very much, definitely worth the bucks (of course it feels kinda short if you rush through in under 4 hours for the achievement but still) and i recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1436782255, "timestamp_updated": 1436782255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16984002": {"recommendationid": "16984002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005516133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3530, "last_played": 1660233047}, "language": "english", "review": "So fun!

Llegu\u00e9 a pensar en un momento que se trataba del t\u00edpico juego \u201cB\u201d barato y mal hecho para aprovechar el nombre de la franquica dada la recepci\u00f3n que tuvo, pero me alegra que no fuera el caso.\n\nStrider no es perfecto ni tampoco intenta serlo, no busca ser el t\u00edpico juego para babear en los trailers de youtube ni vivir de memes por sus grandes cinem\u00e1ticas o filosof\u00edas baratas, no busca nada de eso, pero ninguno de sus problemas da\u00f1a la experiencia del juego solo merman la calidad final de lo que pudo haber sido si le hubiesen puesto algo m\u00e1s de amor y cari\u00f1o al juego.\n\nHay dos grandes problemas en este juego: el primero es su mapa cuya organizaci\u00f3n es bastante confusa, llegando a molestar una vez que empiezas a retroceder para abrir nuevas zonas (backtraking), cuesta mucho distinguir hacia donde ir para llegar a determinado lugar porque simplemente el mapa es raro e innecesariamente enredado (y digo innecesariamente porque los escenarios son bastante b\u00e1sicos para recorrer pero todo cambia al mirar el mapa).\n\nY el segundo gran problema es que reciclan muchos enemigos. Double Helix se preocupa mucho no volver repetitivo y tedioso al juego y lo consiguen, pero no totalmente. Lo que el dise\u00f1o del juego consigue los enemigos reciclados no. Muchos soldados iguales (con distinto grado de dificultad pero iguales a fin de cuentas), muchos minibosses iguales que salen en diferentes lados y algunos jefes se repiten de modo muy absurdo. Por ejemplo: hay unas chicas ninjas que toca enfrentarlas una a una, y luego a las dos juntas, luego sale la tercera y luego las tres juntas\u2026 Aunque tambi\u00e9n hay que destacar otras excelentes peleas con jefes \u00fanicos. Insisto, el juego no es para nada repetitivo pero molesta un poco ver el excelente ritmo y velocidad que lleva el juego para encontrarse cada cierto rato con casi los mismos conocidos.\n\nPoco m\u00e1s que eso lo puedo criticar al juego, ese hecho de que Strider pudo haber sido una maravilla, con mejores efectos, m\u00e1s variedad de enemigos y algo m\u00e1s de presupuesto. Pudo haber sido un Bayonneta en 2D pero se queda en un Ninja Gaiden + Super Metroid sin llegar al nivel de excelencia de ninguno de estos dos casos. El juego es r\u00e1pido desde el primer segundo en que empiezas a moverte y no dejas la acci\u00f3n hasta que termina, como fan\u00e1tico de Marvel Vs Capcom me encanta el hecho de que el personaje se sienta casi igual que en el juego de lucha.\n\nLo recomiendo 100% y no tengo idea del porqu\u00e9 tiene tan poca \u201cpublicidad\u201d este juego, seguro sali\u00f3 en un tiempo donde las \"experiencias cinematogr\u00e1ficas\" y los scripts guiados eran lo que se consideraba \u201cgameplay\u201d y no la libertad total que brinda este juego.", "timestamp_created": 1436314961,

It's just something I've experienced so much, from puzzle games to fighting games to action games... Eventually, it starts to get stale. That's what I find so incredibly refreshing about this game. My impression shifted from 'this is way too simple' to 'this is crazy awesome' really, really fast.\n\nIn terms of story and setting, I knew hardly anything about Strider, but this game throws you right into the fray in a heartbeat. There was so much to appreciate about this game at first. The art direction is gorgeous, for one, and the gameplay is bizarrely smooth. Each button tap of your weapon is a sword attack. Every single one. If you spam the 'X' button, you attack that many times --it's really one to one. Jumping felt a little wonky at first, but I quickly adapted to it, and once I did, I was warped into a crazy fluid combat experience.\n\nAdmittedly, I was worried that 'jumping and sword slashing' would be all to the combat, but the game quickly provided me with a series of upgrades and attacks that really refreshed my palette. By mid-game, the combat was borderline addicting, and I could hardly put my controller down. Jumping back and forth, dodging attacks, reflecting bullets, switching elemental strengths and plunging in for a strike --it was all incredibly satisfying. \n\nTo its detriment, though, this game is -really- difficult, particularly in some segments. I mean, I usually play games on hard rather than normal, because I think developers sometimes dumb games down for the masses, but even normal was a big challenge (Particularly a certain elevator that had me rage quit a few times.) Also, checkpoints. Don't think that just because you respawned before a boss fight means that if you turn off your game, your progress is saved. A couple of times, I had to restart half a level because I quit the game before another checkpoint without even realizing.\n\nThat aside, though?

However, the game lacks in many aspects and I will try to cover these in this review of the game. \n\n[h1]Shallow Fighting System[/h1]\nThe whole game system encourages the player to rush through the enemies and end them as fast as possible which is expected of a ninja and should be good if implemented right, but the problem here is that enemies come in large quantities and spam you with bullets that stumbles the player. You may be able to play the game slowly and kill enemies without losing health but it will take forever, plus regular enemies are tough to beat and I don't mean tough to fight, the game makes them harder to crack when hit. Throughout the game, the only effective moves you'll be using is your normal sword strike or the charge strike. \n\n[h1]Repetitive[/h1]\nThe game is extremely repetitive, it reuses a lot of enemies and (you guessed it) it also uses the same bosses all to extend the length of the game. I have been playing this game for five hours and I'm still fighting the same soldiers that I met at the first level. I'm not even sure, they might have changed the color of their eyes but I'm pretty sure that they are the same except, now they are more in quantity and with various weapons to use. Adding cruelty to injury, sometimes they even use a shield to prevent you from passing which is really annoying to deal with. They also spawn back when you reenter the room.\n\n[h1]The Problem With Level Design[/h1]\nThe level design, the levels are well done and the platforming is fun. The placement of enemies is also clever and hard to pass without thinking of how to approach them. There are doors which require special keys to open and pass through and there are also secrets with rewards. \n\nBut the problem is the foreground and the background are sometimes confusing. Especially when you play this game for the first time, you'll have trouble finding doors and vents without looking at your minimap. I find myself, most of the time, constantly looking at the minimap to make sure I didn't miss anything. Also, there is lack of variety in designing the levels. In a normal platformer, you expect a climate change, a day time a night time. These things are important to me and I think they keep things fresh for the player. The game changes environments but not much, it is all about fighting in a modern city, a factory or underground which all look like the same place to me.\n\n[h1]Many Worthless Rewards[/h1]\nThe reward System, every now and then, the game rewards the player with new powers to use. My problem with this is that most of these rewards are mere keys to new areas. Most of them are useless in a fight and you'll be more inclined to use your sword in fights instead of wasting your energy on those moves. An example of a useless reward is the [i]kuni[/i], a ninja projectile used to throw at enemies and instantly kill them (supposedly). But instead, if you use it on enemies in this game it's like throwing stones at an armored soldier. Plus, it only can be thrown halfway through the screen and then disappears. The only useful thing about this item is that some locks are only activated by using it.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAt the end, Strider is a fun game and a good platformer. It offers great boss fights and will keep you active throughout the game. The game however is repetitive and sometimes doesn't reward the player properly. You might be playing this game for a while but be prepared to spam the same button over and over to defeat all your enemies. If I have to give it a score I would give it 5/10.

It doesn't say to where a certain passage leads to. So you end up going in circles or being slingshot into another section by accident. Having to make your way back to where you were. You're left having to look up for a map online. Which kinda defeats the purpose of playing a Metroidvania game.\n\nThe voice acting is kinda bad. I sometimes prefer to play Japanese games with Japanese audio and I would've liked if this game had this option. But the acting is not bad enough to ruin the experience.\n\nThe enemies kinda get repetitive. Except for a few, you see the same generic enemy throughout the game.

They paid respect to the gameplay qualities that made the original fun, while carefully modernizing it with new elements which really elevate experience.\n\nThe gameplay starts off *very* simple, letting you learn the basics, and then slowly adds new moves, attacks and special powers as the game progresses. The difference between the complexity of the combat in the beginning and in the end is REALLY dramatic. That's a double edged sword, because on one hand it helps keep things fresh and  interesting, but I can see how it could make someone toss the game aside after 20 minutes because he/she felt the gameplay lacked depth.\n\nThe control scheme is really excellent using an xbox 360 controller, but in the midst of heavy action I sometimes experienced some problems getting the dpad to select the desired plasma type. Probably just my overworked, uncoordinated old fingers, but it did annoy somewhat.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much perfect. They nailed the whole sci-fi ninja theme, and the 2.5d rendering dynamically zooms in/out depending on the area you're in, so that it feels confined and in-your-face when fighting in narrow corridors, and vast and open when you're outside in big areas.\n\nThe sound effects are also excellent, but I found the voice acting (there isn't much) and music just a tad above mediocre.\n\nThe game lasted me around 10 hours on \"normal\". 90% of it was an absolute joy, but the last 10% was sadly tainted with frustration due to a combination of high difficulty, my low skill level and some stupid game design decisions:\n\n- Checkpoints aren't save games! You have to reach a \"save pod\" to save your progress to disk. It blows my mind that someone felt the need to punish the user for having to turn off the computer!\n\n- Some checkpoints are placed too far before boss fights (of which most are great btw), making you replay a dull, unchallenging part of the map over and over. \n\n- No \"retry from checkpoint\" option.\n\n- Unskippable cutscenes before boss fights (well, you CAN after watching the first 15 seconds or so, but when boiling with rage after dying 15 times this feels like half an hour).\n\nAt it's best, Strider 2014 brought me stellar gameplay moments, and while I do reckon this is in my top 3 action platformer games, there's no denying that the above complaints poisoned my overall enthusiasm somewhat.\n\n82%", "timestamp_created": 1434566518, "timestamp_updated": 1434734198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561964452266693115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16451677": {"recommendationid": "16451677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077134316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1590789748}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IYMHiyKsmg\n\nDamn good fun.", "timestamp_created": 1434481446, "timestamp_updated": 1434481446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16375312": {"recommendationid": "16375312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034207934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1497657435}, "language": "english", "review": "Story and Characters: 9/10\nI mean killing the Winds sisters? Instant win. Hired to kill the Grandmaster Meio? Even better. A classic retelling of the core Strider story complete with the classic assassination feeling along with the judgement of self-righteousness. The villains do not disappear after beating them once and pose a threat every step of the way, even during easy mode.\n\nArt and Sound: 9/10 \nThe 2D animation does not try to focus on nostalgia which I really prefer rather than relying on old nostalgic feelings for a game. This makes me feel like a new reboot that actually works which is incredibly rare (I'm looking at you Nintendo). It is aesthetically pleasing. The classic Hiryu \"HAHHH\" attack sound is missing which I will take a point off just for that (pls add it in the future!)\n\nGameplay: 8/10 \nSome of the directional attacking is a bit clunky. Although overall the games easy to learn keys are nice on the hands. The directional jumps can also interfere with some tricky terrain passes where you have to calculate the amount of time and reflex you have to make a jump etc. So far I enjoy the upgrades to your Cypher which really makes this higher than it should be (you are welcome Capcom)\n\nReplayability: 7/10\nCan get a bit repetitive but worth exploring the other difficulty options while having fully upgraded your Cypher. Although for $15 dollars this is definitely replayable to a point where you will see immersing yourself into it for hours on end.\n\nFinal Thoughts Overall: 8/10\nStrider Hiryu is a classic game rebooted not to fit into the \"nostalgia\" resurgence of this past decade but tells a core retelling of his story, one that vividly explains the struggle of the Strider character.

While buying I was worried that this game may not deliver its promises. Luckily for me, most of those dark predictions were proven untrue. \n\nThe biggest problem of this game is that it could use a tad bigger budget. Some areas like voice acting, textures and level variety could use some more polish and work. This is most noticeable while navigating the main menu which in contrast to action packed game, is pretty dull. Not very Capcom-like. There are just some aspects of this game that contrast to the great ideas and design decisions in gameplay department. I also lamented the lack of interesting story that could frame the adventure in broader context. In this situation only the gameplay pushes us to finish the game. This complements mechanics, but plot-less game still feels a bit empty. \n\nThat said, Strider delivers... This is a button-mash-through-your-enemies gameplay at its finest. Press attack button as fast as you can and see how those Techno Commies are sliced into pieces. Yes, I said Techno Commies. There are also some robotic dragons, panthers, eagles, mad scientists, weird martial-arts sisters and bounty hunters as bosses and all other cool characteristic Capcom-esque stuff. Action is explosive and it rarely slows down. I like it. Otherwise, this is a solid made metroidvania game which spoils you with upgrades every time you explore a bit. Feels rewarding. \n\nIn conclusion, while production values and the plot disappoint in places, the gameplay drives this game nicely to its home destination.

I agree it's drab but no because of art direction. Strider really needed better world building behind it to be masterpiece.  \n\nCons\n-Weak story/world building\n\n\nStrider was great fun. The pace of the game makes you feel like an expert warrior. The action is just at the right speed where I have enough time to react while not being a cake walk either.  Another aspect I loved about Strider was the way skills progressed in the game. Each tool had its distinct strength and wasn't overshadowed by new additions to Strider's arsenal. \n\nThe enemy variety just was right in that non-boss combat did not feel monotonous meaning each enemy required its unique approach for the most part. The boss battles were really the highlight of this game for me. Some boss patterns were easy and others were hard but none of the fights felt gimmicky. I couldn't just stay in one spot and win the battle. Dodging and moving in to attack were the general patterns but each boss fight requires its own approach in executing those actions. \n\nThe only aspect that I felt Strider lacked was story. I never gained strong sense of connection with Strider. Nobody in the story cared for Strider leaving me with nothing to identify with. I felt like a random guy who did all these awesome things in a world where the Why was never explained. Maybe these feeling are a result of me having never played a Strider game before? I mean it's alright if you don't give the main character a lot of depth because it's a game but if you take that course your world needs to have the depth to support the story your trying to tell.  \n\nThe story was decent though and game play was more than enough to make up for the story's failings.

Suffice to say the final boss fight is kind of the least satisfying of all bosses in the game. A bit of a let down. Also pretty short: About 7 hours. Granted I did not 100% the game, but I also see no reason to...got most of the upgrades, rest is art unlocks and stuff. And I had to repeat a lot of stuff due to crashes. Anyway, would be an ok to good game if it didn't crash randomly.\n\nAlright, had to change the review again.\n\nGood stuff:\n\nCool graphics, amazing boss fights and pretty decent combat once you get more stuff. Also Metroidvania stuff.\n\nNow to the bad stuff. The game crashes. Constantly. For no apparent reason. Just because it wants to fuck your progress. See, the game features checkpoints AND save points. Unfortunately if your game crashes (or you leave the game for whatever reason) ANY checkpoints you reached since the last SAVE POINT are GOOOOOONE!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is an insta \"thumbs down\", since many people seem to have this problem. Just random crashes. And it's not just in Windows 10 apparently.\n\nI was REALLY looking forward to actually finishing the game, but this makes it impossible, since someone REALLY smart decided the last level shall not have any save points and that section is extremely lengthy. I got to the elevator part and assume after that comes the boss fight, but I can't be bothered to just try and hope the game won't crash. Sometimes it runs for an hour, sometimes it crashes 5 times in just as many minutes. Unpredictable.  \n  \nAlso, the enemies are extremely cheesy later on, because they can almost stun lock you infinitely. You have no iframes in this game, which means, once you're shot down, bombed, shocked, hit with a melee attack or FROZEN ffs, you just lose more and more health without being able to fight back. Of course you should not get into such a situation in the first place, but since you're always outnumbered, it just happens. But being repeatedly frozen and shot is just not a fun experience. I was able to deal with all that until the last section of the game where they just throw 2 massive robots at you that shoot homing missiles that also freeze you...I mean, seriously? And as if that wouldn't be enough let's throw constantly respawning flying bots that send homing bombs your way. So between getting frozen, knocked away and knocked down, you can just hope that you didn't take much damage from the enemies before and hopefully just survive that.

That's a pretty loaded sentence and if you thought \"wow, that sounds awesome!\" then this is the game for you. The graphics are very gorgeous and gameplay is generally fast and furious if your computer can handle it; I had to turn down the resolution quite a bit and there was still lots of slowdown, though it was certainly cinematic at times with Strider dodging bullets in slow-mo like an uber boss.\n\nStructurally the game differs from past Striders (except for the NES game) by taking on a Metroidvania format - you run around sections of a big map collecting abilities and fighting bosses in order to unlock access to new areas. Nothing wrong with that, I love Metroidvanias - but Strider 2014 does feel padded at times even though it's not a really long game. Certain sections drag and the map feels overly big and occasionally confusing thanks to different \"planes\" that don't really make much sense. I never felt the need to run around and explore every nook and cranny or snag every ability, which is really a first for me in a Metroidvania game. \n\nAside from some dullness that will likely keep me from replaying this anytime soon, Strider 2014 is worth it if the idea of communist-fighting ninjas appeals to you or if you're a fan of the older games. At its best, it's full of nostalgia with old bosses like the Pooh Sisters and the robot gorilla all present and accounted for.

As someone who beat the genesis strider 1 and strider returns, NES Strider, Playstation Strider 2 (Japanese version), and who has been slaying people on MVC1, 2, and 3 ultimate, this is a wonderful game.  It's like the creators looked at the game Moon Diver which was supposed to be the successor to the Strider franchise, and learned from all the mistakes that were made in that title.  Even without ANY powerups, from the get go, Strider feels just as sleek and fine tuned in his handling and controls as he did on any of his previous incarnations including MVC.  Add in all the cool power ups, the button combinations that are needed to traverse levels, and the multitude of secrets waiting for the gamer with an eye for exploration, and you have a wonderful romp in a revamped Strider universe that  pays many nods to the previous games.\n\nThere are only a few things for which I fault this game.  Firstly, the music is awesome, especially the nod to the NES Egypt Rail Carrier track.  The track is slower and there are trains in the background capturing some of the feel of the original NES content. However, it drops the ball in that there is no level that takes place on a high speed train.  This was an effect that was supremely brought to life on the NES.  With the current technology, it would have been awesome to see how an idea such as this could have been illustrated and also the game mechanics that would have been involved.  Secondly, we are given different color palattes for Strider as mementos from fallen Striders.  This is a cop-out as it would have been much better to actually RESCUE said Striders and have them join Strider's team either as a type of limited subweapon or as an AI controlled ally or as a completely different character that can be swapped out at any save station.  \nWith that said, if there were other playable characters, the idea of Co-op would easily be implementable.  And, considering that Co-op was already a part of Moon Diver, there is really no excuse for there to be a lack of couch Co-op for Strider.\n\nStill, that only amounts to a 0.5 point deduction on an awesome game.", "timestamp_created": 1428452549, "timestamp_updated": 1428452549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15239844": {"recommendationid": "15239844", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996870709", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 214, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1538939289}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll take \"lousy cashins of classic arcade games put out by dying companies in a desperate attempt to become profitable again\" for $1000, Alex... what is Strider!", "timestamp_created": 1428347235, "timestamp_updated": 1428385425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367567479610443115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15192332": {"recommendationid": "15192332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070973716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1066, "last_played": 1528082638}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my top 5 favorite games.

Strider plays like a smoother, quicker modern version of how Zero played in Mega Man X4 and X5. The best thing about this game is that very feel; your character can slash enemies 1:1 with how fast you can mash the attack button and it's very satisfying to plow through enemies at a full sprint.\n\nThe game is somewhat of a free form metroidvania, but only somewhat. Your objectives are given to you marked on a map and you only need to backtrack through one area in order to fight a particular boss. You can find secrets and upgrades by exploring more once you've powered up, but all of the crucial stuff you'll find just by letting the game hold your hand. The fact that the city is technically open to exploration is nice though, and it doesn't slow the pace of the game if you don't let it. Surely going back to grab stuff often serves as a nice break between difficult boss fights.\n\nSo the gameplay is really solid all around and that's what's important- however you may find that things are lacking in art direction and story. There are a handful of environments to traverse as the city is separated into districts, but each one is blander than the last. Visually, the game doesn't have much personality especially when you consider that the character's mouths don't move during voice acted cutscenes. I'm not a visual designer, but what I think what this game needed was a darker, more dystopian tone rather than the spitshined anime one we got.\n\nThe story can't be called a disaster because it isn't really there, but what is there feels dissapointing in light of the fact that they actually bothered to animate a few cutscenes and record dialogue. Especially after defeating the final boss, you might find that the complete lack of meaningful exposition or resolution brings down the experience.\n\nOverall, an 8/10 with one point deducted for the each of the two paragraphs above. The gamplay style is timeless and I disagree with the majority of people who found this game frustrating.

There's gonna have to be a lot more order if they intend the OS & Machines will have any hope in the market compared to consoles.  Things like this make it hard for me to continue recommending friends to pc gaming.  I will eventually play this game when I want to go thru the inconvenience of (apparently non-official or sanctioned from Steam or Capcom) guides.  At a glance of the guide,  it seems I've had more ease setting up emulators than the steps the guide seems to indicate.  The game apparently doesn't recognize (at least for me) 2 separate usb controllers (Sabrent 12 btn usb pad & playstation pad w/adaptor) that work with Street Fighter IV just fine.  The title screen alone looks cheaply done & not impressive as seeing the first Strider game many years ago.  I hope the game is more entertaining than this initial impression I have.\n\nupdate 1/30/15: the game crashes randomly upon booting many times for no apparent reason;   looked online for fix & basically found nothing solid.  used xbox360ce to emulate 360 / xinput pads since this is the only type of pad the developers apparently bothered to allow.  this app alone causes the game to crash as well and the app hasn't been updated in a while afaict.  I only really get the app to work by luck it seems due to it being a factor of the game crashes.  i refuse to drink the \"buy a 360 pad\" kool-aid for any game esp if my pads work 100% for every other game if i can avoid it.  The game is good but not w/o its complaints.  First, it's buggy--random sound effects occur when they are not supposed to (ie level change sound while just running around); i had to reset the game many times while exploring & climbing b/c he'd get stuck in walls but wasn't that big of a deal to me; maps would show an item as not collected (therefore preventing full 100% achievements for a section from being obtained) even though it was obvious it had been; set to play on hardest setting (b/c found the game too easy on lesser difficulties) but didn't get hardest setting achievement--not a big deal but just a little annoying.  The game also doesn't provide quite the impact of the original (the ape boss was too easy & not very large or imposing--he was kinda easy in the original too but more imposing.  There wasn't much variety in the landscapes (was hoping for a dinosaur stage & weird end boss it had from original; no amazon/jungle stage.  There is no save file, if u want to start from beginning, all your previous progress is lost and once u beat the game, you can't use anything u acquired--this is just lazy on their part.  The only thing that remains is the challenge levels which is better than nothing but still not a sign of thoroughness.  Seems like the game was cut in development probably b/c DH knew they were gonna be purchased by Amazon so they just put some polish on console versions first, then whatever time was left--if any--for the pc version.  The game just feels like they rushed it & didn't give it its due.  A concept like Strider is very cool & should be given the full treatment.  Would love to see future versions include blocking or a combo system like ninja gaiden's but uniquelly Strider.  Perhaps the 3d treatement mixed w/some 2d stages if done cohesively.  Also starting the game off w/o the cypher for a level or two if storyline is more epic / movie caliber.  I prefer the original robotic panther but the eagle in this version may be better.  Also preferred the orbs which were more dynamic in movement in the original.  Would've liked to see more & bigger closeups of Strider & his enemies but understand the panoramic & scale of the environments may have been lessened to a degree.

The game really nails down the feeling of being an unstopable assassin by having you be significantly faster than your enemies and destroying waves of well placed enemies. If you rack up enough hits on your opponents you can then unleash Hiryu's full power in short 5sec rage allowing you to make short work of who ever dares cross your blade. Like any game though, there are a few shortcomings. For example there is next to no story explaining the game. The game literally starts off with Hiryu diving into action, and doesn't even take the time to explain to you the controls. The only story that is present is through a handful of cutscenes (that have the characters speak without changing facial expressions or moving their mouths) that allow you to piece together a rudimental plot. Infact the game doesn't even tell you the main character's name unless you read the end credits. Overall the game is good clean fun with a fair challenge.

It's basically how International Relations would go if the participants were  futuristic ninja assassins, robots, and god-like evil entities. The game turned out to be a success, paving the way for a couple of sequels, fighting game cameos, and so on. \n\nHowever, along the way something was lost. Kouichi Yotsui aka \"Isuke\" was the visionary behind the original Strider. After leaving Capcom he designed a similar arcade game by the name of Osman / Cannon Dancer, and most recently Moon Dancer (XBLA/PSN). He left behind a blueprint for all subsequent Strider games, and Capcom hasn't done much to deviate from it.\n\nStrider (Arcade/Genesis/various ports) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups\n\nStrider 2 (Arcade/PSX) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups.\n\nStrider 2014 (Current-gen platforms) stars Strider Hiryu. He battles the evil grandmaster Meio, faces off against a trio of female assassins, slays the bounty hunter Solo, and cuts through a cyborg/mutant/??? army. He climbs walls & ceilings, and finds power-ups.\n\nNote that I'm being exceedingly unfair in these descriptions. There are numerous differences between the three games, ranging from mechanics to level-designs to bosses. The story never changes though, and each itineration feels safer than the last. \n\nUnlike the previous games, Strider 2014 is an action-adventure game. Progress is tied to exploration, and Strider comes across abilities that help him reach new areas. Also unlike the previous games, Strider's cypher (sword-thingie) has multiple modes. For example, he can deflect bullets, or cause explosions, and even freeze enemies. Most of the time players will stick to the one mode that fits their play-style, only switching to others when it's absolutely necessary (color-coded shield enemies....ugh).\n\nThe most common enemy in this game is the overly-standard grunt with a gun. It seems that Strider brought a cypher to a gun-fight, but his maneuverability allows him to close gaps in a hurry. Battles tend to be exceedingly one-sided, with Strider easily cutting through everyone. Larger foes make rare appearances, and you can't have an action-adventure-platformer without flying enemies. Still, this game doesn't have any style. The military's lack of imagination is painfully apparent, when every room is filled with GWGs, big mechs, turrets, FEs, and zombies. Early on there's a fight with an elite who uses a double-bladed staff, he doesn't show up again until the end of the game. Nobody ever gets the bright idea to try anything original. Strider is killing everyone and finding kickass abilities, and the military can't come up with anything more than more guys with guns? More guns with guys? Guns guns and guns that gun? Give me a break. At least the bosses try to be different, and for the most part they're pretty good. \n\nWhen not slicing through foes more generic than the last, Strider is exploring each area for upgrades, costumes, and art unlocks. Acquiring some of these treasures requires the usage of different abilities, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before. At least getting around is fluid, and the mid-air dash is very handy. The environments never seem to graduate from cold & sterile though. I guess this is to be expected in Neo-Russia, and I can't imagine that Strider would suddenly run through an Amazon forest, but it leads to every area being too similar to one another. \n\nThe mechanics of this game are solid enough, but nothing stands out. There was a level of finesse to the first game, and you really had to be on-point with your movements and jumps. Here, it doesn't seem all that necessary. In a way it's nice, because the original Strider has a punishing level of difficulty. However, I tend to get lulled into a state of complacency. The damage I take is largely irrelevant due to large number of health-replenishing capsules, and whatever traps I run into take a mere sliver of life. Granted, I played on the normal difficulty, and I died a few times, but the idea of replaying on the hard difficulty, just doesn't sound appealing. \n\nEnemies in this game also tend to be sword-sponges. By that I mean they take a lot of hits until their vitals give way and they're split into pieces. There is a charged attack for dealing with everyone quickly, but the kunai tend to be more effective after a few upgrades. Also, while the first game had \"blink and you'll miss it\" amounts of violence when Strider killed someone, it still looked really cool. Here? It just isn't the same. Since practically no blood is spilled, the combat isn't as satisfying. It's fun weaving in-between the bullets, but the pay-off isn't there. \n\nAll that said, Strider 2014 isn't a bad game. My review might make it sound that way, but I believe it functions properly enough. The controls are suitable, the bosses are solid, i's are dotted and t's are crossed where it matters. It is a perfectly safe product for consumption. I just don't think it's exciting. The original Strider was rare, almost alien in quality, and every moment feels weird and interesting. Strider 2 is more standardized, but still works as an enjoyable arcade game. Strider 2014 checks all of the boxes for what can be considered an ok or even a good game, but it's so safe and bland I'll probably forget I even played through it a month from now. Moon Dancer? It's a piece of crap, but at least it played around with new ideas. \n\nIn short, this is a decent game but I don't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1419795460, "timestamp_updated": 1421481529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531563222408294678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13670950": {"recommendationid": "13670950", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970539211", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 742, "last_played": 1394579430}, "language": "english", "review": "what new strider game", "timestamp_created": 1419795103, "timestamp_updated": 1419795103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471947193145751953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13632152": {"recommendationid": "13632152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032486799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1504365603}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay I saw this game and expected some high-quality remake like Bionic Commando Rearmed and Duck Tales Remastered.

For a long time that's what I assumed Strider would be like.\n\nOH WOW WAS I WRONG.\n\nIt's so much better than that.

This is, hands down, one of my favorite games of the month, the year, and hell, it beat Dark Souls as my most enjoyed game I bought from Steam. I'm just gonna copypaste my opinion I told to a friend the moment I beat it:\n\nI had a ton of fun with Strider. It's almost one of my most favorite games of all time, but I don't know what makes it not quite up there with favorites like Metroid Prime and Super Mario World. It's got some of the tightest design I've seen in years and the action is fast paced and fun. Looking around all over the map provided hours of entertainment in itself, and the story leading you a linear trek before that was hilariously bad. The game almost praises me as well, with some enemies sounding like they said 'Mayo is god'. There's a lot of freedom even when the game is at its most linear, you can climb anything if you put your mind to it, Metroid-style enemy freezing allows you to use them as platforms and the warp dash maneuver is one of the coolest powerups I've ever seen. I guess my only complaint is the weapon switching can fuck you over if you're using a 360 controller and it's abysmal D-pad and you can't turn the hint system off. I've been plenty challenged and I've only beat it in Easy Mode. There's still a lot to learn too, as I've seen a speedrun of it that took advantage of clipping glitches and half way through there were so many glitches stacked up I couldn't comprehend what was going on. Sadly, I don't see any chance of Strider returning anytime soon, as the marketing for the game is basically non-existant, and even then, Metroidvanias of this quality are very rare and precious. It's still my GOTY.\n\nSo yeah, buy this fucking game if you love 2D action titles of any kind. It doesn't fuck around with needless story and exposition, you don't need to care about anything except that you're a ninja who kills cyborg Russians.

It is remarkably mediocre.\n\nLong Review:\n\nStrider is boringly forgettable as a platformer, as a Metroidvania, and as an action combat game. There is really nothing compelling about it, and its strongest point is that the experience is nice and short (~5 hours on normal difficulty). My major complaints,\n\n- The map: This is the worst map I've seen in a Metroidvania, and I've played a lot of them. It has two major problems that are compounded by the lack of useful fast-travel mechanics. The map is basically linear, sprawling from right to left, and the environments are barely distinguishable (basically, sheet metal factory is all you'll see throughout). Because of this, there are few shortcuts to unlock and I never had a moment that made me say \"wait what, this connects to THIS!\" I never really had any idea where I was unless I was constantly checking the world map. You do unlock a couple of powers that let you jump between points, but these warp points are so disjointed (with little indication of where you'll actually end up) that they don't provide a satisfying or quick way to get from one point to another, even at end-game. It just kills any desire to explore or backtrack. It also seems like the designers realized this, because they actually mark all of the important power-ups on your map (only cosmetic and alternate game mode unlocks are truly hidden).\n\n- Enemies: this goes hand-in-hand with the uniform environments, but the enemy variety is just not there. There are basically 5-6 enemies that are palette-swapped throughout the game (human soldier, flying drone, ape robot, spider robot, turret, acid-spitting bugs). Even though the game does give you a nice set of powers to mess around with, the combat feels very one-note because you just seem to be fighting the same battles over and over again. This does not go for the boss fights though, which are pretty fun.", "timestamp_created": 1418234740, "timestamp_updated": 1418234740, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485077977180480957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13272585": {"recommendationid": "13272585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069533181", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1495725354}, "language": "english", "review": "Strider is one of those games that looks and sounds awesome on paper, and comes out better when it's released.

He is incredibly acrobatic. It felt weird to me that there was no mouse needed to play Strider, just a keyboard. The keyboard is tolerable, although I was wondering if a gamepad is more appropriate for the PC version of this game considering all the different moves you will learn as you progress through the game making Strider a more powerful protagonist.\n\nThe story is very simple as it takes place in Kazakh in the Soviet era. Once you understand the setting you will slice various enemies while you rely on your map to reach your next objective. The gameplay is very fast paced and this is a good attribute for this game. The action is also impressive and gets more impressive as you progress. You will learn new moves such as the double jump. The double jump will be crucial to jumping over obstacles such as electrical fields and moving buzz saws. Other moves include the kunai, which is a plasma weapon used to shoot enemies and becomes crucial during boss fights.\n\nThere is plenty climbing up walls and ceilings and Strider has sickle that can be called a climbsickle. This is a very useful tool for navigating the different levels in an action platformer that is basically about moving horizontally and up and down. There are many collectibles in this game, some for upgrading Strider, others for cosmetic effect. The collectibles Strider can be in well hidden areas, so Strider must use his double jumps and catapults to good use in order to find these collectibles. The most important collectibles are health and energy upgrades that increase Strider\u2019s max health and energy.\n\nThe enemies consist of troopers of different variations, some very basic, others carry shields that require more advanced moves to eliminate them. The enemies do become repetitive since they look the same and can respawn as you backtrack to some levels. The boss fights can be downright annoying, especially if you don\u2019t learn each boss\u2019 patterns. Every boss has a pattern of fighting, so you will have to go through several tries of button mashing to finally defeat a boss.  One boss fight includes 3 sexy females after fighting two of them in previous encounters.  Another includes a boss who uses water to attack you and you must learn how the pattern of water based attacks is used. Defense is very important in each boss fight. Too much offense and too little defense will get you killed without a doubt. The defense requires a number of keys to be pressed in order to avoid a boss\u2019 attacks. These boss fights made me think that a gamepad might be better suited to fighting these bosses than the keyboard.\n\nThe graphics are never bland and are always bright. Every level of Kazakh City is vibrant. Levels include an abandoned train station, a research facility, a military prison, and other diverse locales. Strider can eventually travel using an eagle perch, which looks beautiful when using it as a travel point. There\u2019s also a panther statue that can be used to travel from one destination to another.\nOverall, I think Strider is a decent game that is a reminder of the arcade era of the 1980s. It can be frustrating to mash buttons in order to defeat tough bosses. I felt a sense of accomplishment when defeating these bosses, but I didn\u2019t feel like I would like to fight them again for fun or replayability. The replay value I find in this game is the collectibles that are scattered throughout each level. It can be enjoyable if you\u2019re looking for 1980s arcade fun and fast paced action platforming, but you should be aware of the frustration of pressing different buttons so quickly, so many times with the keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1417367865, "timestamp_updated": 1436032961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501536190509796143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13151716": {"recommendationid": "13151716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110211759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1554154206}, "language": "english", "review": "Strider does not run on cards with DirectX10 even if you Have DX11 installed\nMoney wasted.\n\nGood game :(", "timestamp_created": 1417304317, "timestamp_updated": 1417304317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13142938": {"recommendationid": "13142938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163419263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1418488322}, "language": "english", "review": "Man Awsome game, I remmember the first title on Sega Genisis.

Poor marketing if you ask me. They leave out the magic of the Charge Strike Meter, which fills up every time you hit an enemy without getting hit yourself. Charge Mode is best described as \"Fry with 100 cups of coffee\" mode and for my money, blows away its Sleeping Dogs equivalent in the dust. It transforms the gameplay [u]entirely[/u], turning your Strider from a vulnerable hoppy-avoidy ninja who has to manage his button presses into the ultimate human chainsaw able to finish off monstrous killer robots before they can fire off their next shot. You lose all of that power the moment you get hit, so there's actual tension in those hellish games of chicken.\n\nIt might seem wrong to enjoy a Strider game on the strength of playing a death-crazed berzerker rather than a nimble evasive ninja, but it's fun in its own right and that's what counts; right? Dare I call it an intelligent button-masher? Because you work to enter Charge Mode, you work to stay in Charge Mode and you work to take advantage of the 5 seconds of Charge Mode, I say yes. That's right: [b]Strider[/b] is worth your money for the 5 seconds of Charge Mode it provides. The exploration aspect? You live in a bleak cacotopia where every enemy is a one dimensional evil baddy. Finding stuff is a chore, not a reward. The attacks most associated with Strider, to wit the Slide and the Down Strike, feel tacked on by the necessity of this being a Strider franchise. In practice, these attacks are mostly used for area unlocking rather than combat. I might've bought this game on the strength of its franchise but now I've discovered a much greater, far more exciting game that would exist outside of it...\n\nOther weapon mechanics are a mixed bag.Your Kunai and Options are powered by an energy bar which refills over time, encouraging you to use your specials at any time without taking undue importance from your Cypher attacks. Your Cypher Upgrades on the other hand seem oddly mismanaged. Your first upgrade is the Reflect Cypher and it's the coolest by far, turning you into some sort of Jedi and allowing you to reflect bolts with your sword [i]if you time it just right,[/i] opening up synergy with the Charge Mode mechanic for its slowdown effect. Too bad enemies stop using reflectable bolts midway through the game. The second upgrade is the Burst Cypher and completely trivializes all other upgrades by simply making your enemy explode. It is, in fact, the best upgrade. Third upgrade is the Ultra-Cold Cypher, for turning enemies into ice platforms and better explore the game whle the fourth upgrade fires ranged boomerangs from your sword, somewhat defeating the whole \"you have a sword, your enemies have guns\" motif inherent to ninja-related games. It's the last upgrade though, and as such feels enough like an end-game mechanic that you forgive it for being dead simple.\n\nAlthough not as exciting as the combat, the platforming can be enjoyable on its own thanks to the Plasma Catapult, your 8-way short-ranged teleport dash device. The challenge comes from planning your trajectory, working the flexible nature of your jumps along with the linear nature of the Plasma Catapult to form elaborate mid-air travel paths. The Plasma Catapult also gains from the Cypher Upgrades to form some cool but essentially useless gimmicks. For example, the Magnetic Plasma Catapult turns the targets you pass through into living magnets for enemy fire! Too bad it's tied to the ranged Magnetic Upgrade, making it more convenient to just shoot them from a distance. In fact, every combat gimmick tied to the Plasma Catapult is nullified by the fact that the Plasma Catapult [i]phases through your enemies[/i], bypassing the very notion of combat!\n\nOn the topic of Challenge Mode, one important notice for the developers: you need a way to show the player his top score and rank in a stage BEFORE they clicks the mission, so the player knows which stage they aced and which stage still needs work. Otherwise, since Story Mode is rather short and offers rather little replay options, alternative modes of play become greatly appreciated. Thankfully, Challenge Mode missions are built around the best aspects of the game: races across the city, and combat!\n\nI gripe, but I had fun. The developers, [b]Double Helix Games[/b], have thrown a great deal of ideas at the wall and many of them stuck. You want a sequel and you want an editor, someone who will focus the game on the more thoughtful mechanics and axe all the overpowered shit. No seriously, the first Option you unlock, the bird, turns each and every boss fight into easy mode.

I have not played the original Strider, so keep that in mind when reading this review. Also this is my first impressions after playing it for about a little over an hour.\n\nControls could have been better, but they are tight for the most part. Strider's animations are very good and overall graphics (especially shader effects) are pretty sweet. Sound effects and music are lacking though. There are times where you are very aware that a sound effect is missing or that the music is trying to pump you up but falls flat. Title screens and transitions seem to lack polish as well.\n\nNot enough variety in enemies. It also does this thing where bosses (middle bosses?) become normal enemies (further reducing the enemy variety). Normal enemies are mostly one-shot, which I really like in this kind of game. And the harder enemies require a little more, but not enough to slow down the pace.\n\nIt tries to be a metrovania game, but I don't feel it. There is not that much back tracking and the fast pace makes it even less obvious that there's backtracking. Upgrades come at relatively good timings and keeps the gameplay fresh. Love the fact that it's an arcade style side-scroller, which means no levels, experience, talent trees, etc, etc.\n\nOverall I would say that this game seems to lack polish. It's not a bad game by any means, but probably will not be playing it again. Simple, fast-paced sidescroller with limited exploration. For it's original price ($15 at the time) I would say it's barely worth it.

The game takes the formula from the old Strider games and only expands the map size a bit. There\u2019s hardly any dialogue or cutscenes at all. It\u2019s no-nonsense ninja sidescroller action. I can\u2019t remember the last time I played something that felt this stripped down and focused. Even the logos when you start the game go past faster than other games. This is the game for everyone who\u2019s ever complained about modern game trends, and that they \u201cjust want to play the game\u201d. It does this without wallowing in nostalgia. This isn\u2019t a retro sidescroller, this is better than them.\n\nI had a good feeling about Strider after I saw a clip of it, but even so I was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. It does basic things right, such as putting the coolest stuff at the end, and the second coolest stuff right before that, and so on. The controls are as responsive as the Itagaki Ninja Gaiden games, and details like the sound design augment how good it feels just to move around and do things.

Joe: Rise of Cobra to Battleship: The First Person Shooter would make not only the new Killer Instinct but also a reimagining of Strider, then I would have assumed we were talking about some forgotten twin sharing the same Double Helix. Credit should also be given to Capcom\u2019s Osaka Studio who provided oversight during the creation of Strider\u2019s surprising return.\n\nThis is one of those rare instances where a development studio burdened with making licensed products for so long is given the opportunity to create something more original, and whether it was mainly due to the direction of the project heads or the pent-up creativity after so much shlock, the result is an adequately designed Metroidvania of the classic NES/arcade cyber-ninja that unlike its contemporaries makes the player feel powerful from the start rather than making the player feel inept.\n\n[h1]Taking Strides Forward By Staying the Course[/h1]\n\nOut of all the Capcom franchises in its backlog of history, Strider is probably the least interesting in terms of its gameplay as well as overall design. Originally on arcade machines, the game was a side-scroller that while enjoyable for its aesthetics, for its simplified yet refined combat, and for its difficulty curve to mask its purpose to eat your quarters, the game itself is archaic to modern standards. Even the console or various computer ports deviated from the original by making a generic side-scroller with some light adventure mechanics by finding clues to progress the story. Aside from a manga made to flesh out the lore of Strider, the IP remained dead until 2013.\n\nSo how does DH\u2019s take on Strider deviate or even return-to-form at all? Other than the aesthetics and brand name, there is nothing in common with the previous games. Strider (2014) has taken the barebone design of the original and made a simplified Metroidvania game with eight-directional controls that will remind one of the quality from the Castlevania trilogy to Castlevania 4 given a 2.5D style as well as an inspired Metal Gear Rising: Revengance health system. The added controls as well as visual polish creates such a satisfying result to play that there is almost a sense of liberation in terms of how you control the character flawlessly around enemies and master the destruction you can create like the cyber-assassin Hiryu was always meant to be.\n\nWhile it does stay true to the ideas of Metroidvanias, Strider (2014) mainly sticks to the basics of progression with secrets to discover to improve your character in somewhat open-ended linear maps with multiple weapon to unlock new paths or means of countering enemies. There are no sequence-breaking routes or anything distinct about Strider in terms of its combat or its platforming mechanics. The only notable thing about its gameplay is a feeling of improvement, something inherent in the genre, that begins at a high point of fluid mobility and high combat prowess that only makes the character feel more powerful the farther the game continues to add more to Hiryu\u2019s arsenal.\n\nAll of these aspects do not make the game bad nor does its lacking originality undermine it as many modern Metroidvanias like Guacamelee rely on its combat mechanics; they may stay true to its non-linear exploration like Axiom Verge; they utilize the spectacle of Metroidvanias to make a game as enjoyable for newcomers as well as die-hards looking for a new itch like Ori & the Blind Forest. Strider (2014) is content to stay the course by revamping the original design while managing to keep the same cathartic entertainment of the originals from their simplicity. \n\n[h1]One Stride Forward, Two Steps Back[/h1]\n\nHaving praised the game as it is, there are some oversights that are warranted from the limitations of its design by creating a Metroidvania devoid of any real depth. As previously mentioned, the lack of sequence-breaking undermines players\u2019 ability to explore these maps for alternative paths, which helps establish a more non-linear experience through either exploits and tests of player skill. This is something that establishes the real hallmark of the genre, and one that is often ignored by modern developers for better or worse. Strider (2014) doesn\u2019t even attempt to allow players to pass up any ability, relying on self-imposed challenges not to use abilities that will make fights easier towards the end. However, the far more egregious issue with the game is the lack of depth to incentivize more replayability with the game beyond the difficulty settings. \n\nPerhaps the one idea the game teases the player with the prospect but never seizes the opportunity to add more to the experience is having multiple Striders, which establishes many fallen Striders with their own backstories that only reward you with color palette swaps. Similar to how Shovel Knight offers the Plague Knight and Specter Knight modes for longevity, these multiple striders could have reworked the existing level design as well as offer new ways to play the game. While it\u2019s never completely fair for arm-chair critics to think of ways to make a game better outside its development process, the lack of any DLC to capitalize on this idea is a shame when developers from Ori & the Blind Forest made a new version to improve its non-linear design post-launch. Had the developers chosen to implement these types of modes instead of the color schemes, the game would have more longevity behind its name as well as more opportunities for creative approaches to the level-design and combat mechanics. \n\n[h1]Here-You, Sure-It-Can Stride-Her![/h1]\n\nStrider (2014), as a standalone title, is a classic throwback for a new age with as much ambition for its future as well as its appeal of its legacy for such a lesser known IP. You simply cannot go wrong with this game as it\u2019s a diamond in the rough with as much polish behind it for the modern age. \n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic that Capcom would please fans for an IP with so few titles like DuckTales: Remastered and this game for Strider\u2019s 25th anniversary while still leaving Mega Man fans blue-balled for so long until they finally created the MM Legacy Collections as well as ruining Bionic Commando\u2014I will never forget that series. However, games like Strider (2014) makes me hopeful for the future of Capcom as they continue to create games that harken back to the originals such as the case with Resident Evil 7, even though their ambitions for success to redeem their franchises\u2019 names will not always be as profitable as they hoped. \n", "timestamp_created": 1405958513, "timestamp_updated": 1502059068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522422432899475098", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11346432": {"recommendationid": "11346432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025843884", "num_games_owned": 859, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1404666539}, "language": "english", "review": "This is how you do reboots. \n\nStrider Hiryu returns, along with his arsenal of animal friends (now plasma entities as opposed to robots) and his trusty sword. \nEverything from previous Strider games can be found here, though this game feels alot more fleshed out in comparison to the arcade titles.  \n\nHiryu's moveset's been given an upgrade, with some of his Marvel vs Capcom moves making an appearance. His heavy launcher from UMVC3 is here, for instance.  Enemies can be juggled, certain projectiles can be parried and alot of the \"outside the box\" stuff from modern action games are also implemented. I really appreciated being able to pull off some combos utilizing the launcher attack and the directional light attacks in the air. Along with special moves such as a ground slam ability you obtain, there's some depth to the combat system. \n\nStrider's an assassin, he's not a tank. As the player, you'll be dodging attacks and avoiding bullets as opposed to blocking them. Hiryu's really mobile, so it's no problem. The lack of a block button might be off putting to those more comfortable with modern games, but I really liked figuring out patterns and dodging gunfire.\n\nBoss battles are frequent and all of them feel satisfying to defeat. \n\nThe only real issue I found with this game is that the PC port does not seem to be optimized pretty well.

Amazingly, Double Helix's recent version of Strider does the exact same thing for the Cyber-Ninja that seemingly had a larger following in the fighting game scene than in his own titles.\n\nNow, Strider's not BCR exactly. Some choices seem a smidge ill-fitting at first. Like the Metroidvania \"single grand level\" concept seems odd when you have such a mobile character who traditionally has gone through disparate locales in his games like a horny teenager goes through tissues, but they pack it with so many devious traps to flip around and baddies to chop up in such a large set of locations you'll never notice once you get going. Besides, it allows for a \"just right\" amount of item collection and several super-hidden spots concealing bonus costumes and concept art to give players their OCD collector fix. \n\nIn general, that's probably the best descriptor of the game design as a whole: just right. And it leads a constant cavalcade of classic Capcom chaos! So much so that there's little to actually say about most of the moment ot moment gameplay that wouldn't just spoil the experience if you're interested after seeing the trailers. Like the Matrix, you really can't be told how awesome it is to be Strider Hiryu, you have to experience it for yourself. \n\nI for one, highly recommend plunking down the simoleans to give Strider a go. You'll be slicing and dicing through hordes of Russian Cyber-men within seconds, and flipping and ninja-vanishing around deadly traps while reflecting bullets into robots and summoning your holo-panther buddy to tear new holes into old foes for the next 4-9 hours depending on your difficulty and how much you want to collect.\n\n  \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1405896816, "timestamp_updated": 1405896816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11334898": {"recommendationid": "11334898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039355496", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1405580280}, "language": "english", "review": "I think I've moved past the strider, ninja gaiden, shinobi type games but if I had this back in the day it'd be on the top of my list.

And then, aside from a shitty knockoff and a single mediocre sequel in 2000, everyone forgot about it. Until Hiryu, the protagonist, was included in UMvC3. Riding on the resurgence of popularity, this game (2014 Strider) is released. Disclaimer: I have never played any previous Strider games, but this one is very fun. The combat is not very complex but it is enjoyable all the same. It definitely feels satisfying to cut through the hordes of enemies you come across, and the ability to control your slash direction gives you options to engage them. 2014 Strider is a BEAUTIFUL game, and the colors and flashiness add to the exciting experience. Many of the animations are homages to the original game. The exploration is also well done. Due to the fact that Hiryu can climb on 99% of the surfaces in the game, secrets can often be found in unexpected places. The levels are built, however, so that searching for said secrets never feels too tedious. Similar to games like Metroid, the entire game takes place in a single world  and so backtracking is essential to unlock everything. \n\nOverall 9/10, even though I've never played the original it's very obvious the developer is fond of the metroidvania games of the 80s and this reboot is very well executed.", "timestamp_created": 1405477118, "timestamp_updated": 1405477118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11265548": {"recommendationid": "11265548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084628436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2773, "last_played": 1672032845}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent many a day hunched in front of my TV playing the Genesis port of this game's predecessor.  6 grueling levels, hack-and-slash, beautiful graphics.\n\nThis game pretty faithfully reproduces the experience.
