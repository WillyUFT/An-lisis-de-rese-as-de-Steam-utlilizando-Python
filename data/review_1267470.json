I've never played Into the Breach, but I do like Slay the Spire, Monster Train and other turn-based strategy games so I thought I'd give this a shot.\n\nI will say, this game has an extremely steep learning curve. The mechanics themselves are pretty simple, however you will probably die a ton to boss fights in particular, mainly because summon effects are not properly explained. The scorpion boss in act 2 and the lion boss in act 1 are the most egregious examples of this. It would be nice to have a tooltip somewhere that showed what units were spawned when a unit dies.\n\nThe other thing I didn't quite like was the leveling up grind, in the beginning you don't have access to all of the tablets and gear and you unlock orbs that you can use to purchase new gear, tablets, and stats. Now, I know it's a delicate balance between keeping things simple for new players and unlocking all possible combos, however I think a lot of what you unlock (like the stat boosts to heroes) could be removed for a better upgrade experience.\n\nOnce you understand what each boss does and what power level you need your team to be at for each fight, the game is really fun. I don't know if this was intended, but most of the time you end up getting most of your good gear and tablets on a single hero and making that one hero as busted as possible due to the way that abilities like attack range, damage radius, and multi-attack abilities stack. It's almost always better to give 1 hero +2 damage radius than it is to give 2 separate heroes +1 damage radius.

If you love playing rogue-likes and tactic games, this is a very solid title for you.\nThe price is fair for the amount of content in the game, honestly, really, fair.\nThe game is really fair in all honesty. If you use the warrior and the archer tactically, you can practically breeze through the game easily with the help of obstacles. The tablets are random but tactics are eternal.\n\nLong version:\nThe warriors of the Nile is a very solid title. The content are pretty much a lot if you don't mind the repetitive boss and sometimes, straight up unbalance cheat-y bosses (though with proper tablets you will be better anyway). The game itself proposes to be a tactical rogue-like. In term of tactics, you can move your 3 base units into tiles to survive and strike down your foes. The game plays out like Final fantasy tactics series but in rogue-like genre instead. Since it has been launched only for a while, there will be bugs, yes bugs.....\nThe first unit will be the warrior, the brave carrier and the most op unit you will have. He supposedly to be the tank of the team according to the ''soaking as much dmg in your armor'' tutorial but turned out he's just the op berserker dps the team needs. The warrior is straight out broken.... just stack tablets on him and ez win.\nThe second unit is the sexy archer. He's supposedly to be a mobile damage dealer moving in and out of combat and use his versatility to finish off foes. In reality, later in game he will have no choice but to be either a useless unit or straight out stationary double shoot or four shot or whatever artillery with 8 range.\nThe last unit you will get is the useless mage girl. She won't scale very good with tablets as much as the warrior and the archer do. While the warrior can be very powerful frontliner and archer, backline, the mage is supposedly to be both with her small passive armor and ranged attack. She has to stay stationary in order to attack unless you got that one tablet....\n\nThe game resolved around getting tablets and carving to power up your units. In early game, until you managed to get all of the level is pretty much a tutorial, since the upgrade are pretty much a huge factor in winning the game. As you lose you gain more exp and unlock more things.\n\nThere are three ways in scaling your unit during your run.\nFirst is the tablets. You will get to choose one tablets among the three units you have every time you win.\nThe second is the carving. They can be unlocked and provide random bonuses as you pay coins to get the carvings.\nThe last one is the gear. OP items means OP unit except its a legendary staff. Mage is never a good choice...\n\nAll in all its a good game and worth the price.\n\n*To the devs.\nAre morphs supposed to straight up upgrading your units or add versatility? Because it is just straight up upgrading the units (except mage, no matter what morph the mage use it will still be a bad unit)\nAnd can we do something about the archer and the mage? Especially the mage, she's in a very bad spot now. No matter how many slabs I stick up onto her, she's just not practically carrying the run. For archer, its kinda mid way between the power creep of warrior and the low scale of mage.\nThe warrior is practically too good for his role.", "timestamp_created": 1597605424, "timestamp_updated": 1597605424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74416930": {"recommendationid": "74416930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171372809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1606048474}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has cool tactic gameplay like F.F. tactics (even though is more simple) and the thrill of the rogue-like genre.\nThe characters are interesting to use and the randomize upgrade make you adapt and take advantage of the gameplay that is original and deep.\nPlus, the game is well made and it has some perma-upgrade endgame content that made it definitely worth the price.\n\nIf you liked S.F.D. this game is definitely for you.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1597601964, "timestamp_updated": 1597601964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74400482": {"recommendationid": "74400482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106207150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1604414494}, "language": "english", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u53ea\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u7a0d\u5fae\u6709\u70b9\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u51fa\u5f88\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u52a0\u6cb9\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1597579994, "timestamp_updated": 1597579994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455464601516723633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74395620": {"recommendationid": "74395620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053709248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 647, "last_played": 1598606211}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall great game for its price.\n\nIt surely lacks content compared to other similar games (monster train).

You have a fixed set of three characters (one fighter, one archer, and one mage) and battle through three worlds of nine levels, each capped by a tough boss fight. The gameplay is fast-paced and simple without being simplistic. Each character can move and then attack (except the mage, who can only do one of those per turn). After winning each level, you can choose one permanent power-up tablet out of a random three presented. Perhaps most importantly, your health does not regenerate between levels, and you must take care to play carefully so as to lose as little health as possible. (You can optionally forego a power-up in favor of partially healing one character, and if a character dies you must forego two power-ups: one to resurrect and another to heal, assuming he survives the next level. Generally, missing out on good power-ups will put you behind the scaling curve and cause you to lose the game.) You also gain random gear that you can equip for more upgrades, and gold for each enemy you kill, which you can use to purchase upgrades during a run.\n\nAfter finishing the game, win or lose, you get currency that can be used to unlock new tablets and gear and otherwise permanently improve your chances. If you win, you unlock hard mode 1, and after winning hard mode 1, you unlock hard mode 2, etc. up to hard mode 10. Each level of hard mode makes the game progressively more difficult, but winning each hard mode unlocks a powerful new tablet. There are also three variations of each character. The second variation is unlocked by winning, and the third by winning hard mode 5. The variations provide slightly different play styles and are generally more powerful, allowing you to take on the harder levels.\n\nThe game is advertised as a rogue-like, but I doubt the creators have ever played the original Rogue or anything like it. It is not a rogue-like. A rogue-lite, maybe. Anyway, the main problems with the game are that whether you win or lose is primarily due to luck and unlocks, and only slightly due to tactics. It's important to play well to take as little damage as possible, but if you don't have good power-ups you will lose. Whether you get good power-ups is based on whether you've unlocked them yet and are lucky enough to draw them from the deck. Thus, you are basically destined to lose again and again while you gain enough XP to unlock enough upgrades that you start to have a good chance of drawing good tablets and gear. In a good roguelike, losing is supposed to be almost always your fault, because you made a mistake. In this game, losing is almost always because you didn't get lucky with the tablet or gear selection, and I suppose that's my biggest criticism. It's also very repetitive, but the fast-paced gameplay makes it feel not so grindy.\n\nThe graphics, music, and sound effects are simple but well-done. There are some UI problems with untranslated text, English text that doesn't fit in the space available, and text that's poorly translated, but it's not a big problem.\n\nOverall, the game is good and worth the price. It's essentially a deck-builder where you're destined to lose until you unlock enough good cards, but when you get lucky and draw a good hand that lets you build an awesome team that can nuke the whole map in two turns it's pretty fun.

It's a rouge-like tactics game, which sounds very cool in theory, I just wish the idea was given more time because the mechanics often feel like they are trying to force a square peg into a round hole and the power level balancing is all over the place. To the extent that 1 of your 3 characters is so underpowered as to make them completely useless unless you randomly luck into a specific ability or gear upgrade. \n\nThe random nature of the ability upgrades is also very frustrating. The better rouge-likes use the random nature of the abilities/loot to force you to try out new strategies and adapt your play style, in this game the wild differences in powerlevel of the upgrades means that you can end up with builds a few stages in that are literally too weak to be worth continuing to play. Think FTL but x1000. this is made SO MUCH WORSE by the fact that the upgrades are assigned rarity so that the abilities you need to acquire in order to have a chance in fighting the boss levels are significantly rarer than the unhelpful abilities. Getting a super rare ability tablet doesn't seem fun and cool because you get to try out something you have never seen before, it just makes one of your characters seem like they will be viable in the upcoming boss fight.\n\nThis would all be fine, many popular rogue-likes have those issues to lesser extents, except that instead of an action game where skill is one of the deciding factors of success or failure... this is a pure numbers game and if you don't get the right drops your numbers CANNOT be high enough to progress. This isn't a spelunky, or rogue legacy, or crypt of the necrodancer where your progression to a new area feels like a personal accomplishment. This is Final Fantasy Tactics, minus the ability to plan your character growth.

This is not a bad feature for a hardcore game for the hardcore gamers, but considering that this is basically a mobile style turn-based tactical strategy game costing $13 (minus the pay-to-win gimmicks), the game is a bit simplistic and repetitive to force players to do Iron Man mode as the only mode.\n\nRNG is the real determining factor in this game as well. You are guaranteed to fail on a run depending on what \"upgrade tablets\" appear for you to choose from, as well as certain units. The was 1 run I made where I got about 1/3 of my characters' upgrades to be Epic & Legendary ones, and another where I got to level 15 with only commons ones to choose from for each of the 3 characters for example.\n\nThere are also many upgrades which directly relate to weapons - such as 1 that increases a characters movement and attack stats for having a bow equipped; however, I have done play-throughs where a bow never drops nor appears in the item shop (item shop offers 3 random items at a time and it is only randomly appears).\n\nHaving said that, it is a somewhat unique experience for a simple/cheap TBS game, and the way upgrades work are fun. I would only recommend this for people looking for a fresh game to play to pass the time and has the disposable income to spare. Otherwise, you may as well save the $13 and spend it on DLC for your favourite strategy game or towards something else soon to be released like King's Bounty 2 - something that will give you more than 50 hours of happiness (assuming it isn't buggy on release).\n\nEdit/ Addition below:\n\nI waited for a few updates to see if the game-play/ mechanics would improve, but so far it is more of the same. Certain character classes are completely useless unless you get very specific tablets/ items for them; in which case, you will end up making the other classes useless due to opportunity cost.\n\nI also played to fully upgrade my base, since you get permanent benefits, including: Epic & Legendary items and tablets, as well as base stat boosts for each of the classes. Literally, adding more \"cards to a finite deck\", yet you still get the same occurrence of  common & uncommon items, rather than more high tier items appearing in the mix.\n\nAlso, many of the high tier items aren't actually OP, as they may boost 1 stat and reduce another; or they may rely on another rare item/ tablet to actually work. For example, there is a tablet granting the Archer +4 dmg per bow equipped (archer can equip 2 bows max). I played several campaigns all the way through and received no bows whatsoever - not as a random drop or a purchase option in the shop.\n\nPlayers should fail based on poor tactics/ lack of skill, with RNG playing a small roll, not solely due to RNG.", "timestamp_created": 1597194017, "timestamp_updated": 1606854635, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498385697603225708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74156209": {"recommendationid": "74156209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093471594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 650, "last_played": 1640510410}, "language": "english", "review": "$5 for 10 hours of gameplay (not really finish the game though, just to the point I realized it became really easy and a bit cheesy as well) is not bad.

But...\n\n- : ... the game balance is completely off. You can't finish a run if the RNG decides you can't, and I mean it. Let's take Isaac for example : if you have really bad items/stats, you can still win, by playing really well. Here, if you are unlucky, there's absolutely no way to win. You can try to optimize your movement, your armor and your damage output ... it's a turn-based RPG, and most of the time you just do not have enough stats/effects to win a run.\nI guess there's unlockable items that will make things easier later (I've unlocked maybe 40% of the upgrades at the time of this review), but that kind of design is just really bad, in my opinion. I feel like you can't finish the game unless you unlock some specific things, which means the game [b]might[b] become playable after grinding for unlockables, before that you will almost always die against the first boss (there's 3 for a finished run, if I'm not mistaken, with 9 stages per area, boss included).\n\nAnother detail that shows the lack of balance : you'll often meet a trader (a shop) early in your run. The only problem is ... you will not have enough gold to buy anything. If you are lucky, you might have enough to buy the less pricey items of the shop (there's 3 items available for purchage per shop), but the two other items are just out of reach.\n\nI really want to like the game, and I will probably farm the upgrades, and change this review if the game ends up being nice once I actually have the tools needed to enjoy it. A lot of roguelites want you to farm the first few hours before actually having runs that are winnable, and this is one of them.\n\nFor people who might argue that it's always the case in roguelikes/roguelites... look at Binding of Isaac, Neon Abyss, Enter the Gungeon ...

Some tablets and extremely powerful, and others feels like a complete waste.\n- If you don't get good drops, you might as well abandon the run.\n\nBeating the game grants you:\n- \"Hard\" mode, which lets you toggle random enemy buffs, such as more enemy hp.

This is a strategic roguelike SRPG developed by Stove Studio and published by Gamera Game. Set in ancient Egypt, the player leads the god-blessed warriors and aims to reclaim their sun for the great kingdom of Egypt by defeating the evil serpent god. There are quite a few roguelike strategy games on Steam, but Warriors of the Nile has quite the own mechanics that combines roguelike and tactical SRPG elements. Let's take a look at it with Nyanco-chan! (\u0e05'\u03c9'\u0e05)\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game style is based on cartoon graphics, the UI is close to a mobile game, and the maps and characters are inspired by Egyptian elements. Most of the enemies and bosses you face come from ancient Egyptian mythology. Gameplay focuses on cards, roguelike and turn-based tactical SRPG elements. At the end of each round, the player can reinforce the party members by choosing one of three cards. Furthermore, you can use gold coins as rewards to buy equipment or build altar. This system have a huge impact on gameplay, so it should be managed carefully for the victory. At the end of each chapter, fierce boss battles await the player's challenge. When a player wins a boss battle, all party members recover their health and move on to the next chapter. \n\nThe current build has 3 chapters and 30 levels. At the end of that run, players are given experience and leveled up based on their achievements. The rewards you get here are used to build ancient egyptian buildings where you can unlock more cards and equipments for your characters. The gameplay is interesting overall, but rather repetitive and heavily dependent on luck. Only three characters can participate in the game, and if one is intensively nurtured, the role of the remaining characters will be significantly reduced. In other words, the balance is slightly broken. Nonetheless, the game is worth trying, and its collection elements and fast-paced turn-based action tactics are highly appreciated.\n\n[h1][b][3] Pros (+) & Cons (-) [/b][/h1]\n[table]\n[td][list]\n[*][+] Random Levels\n[*][+] Interesting Mechanics\n[*][+] Cute Cartoon Graphics\n[*][+] Turn-Based Tactical Battle\n[/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n[*][-] Repetitive\n[*][-] Some Bugs\n[*][-] Broken Balance\n[*][-] Localizing Issue\n[/list][/td]\n[/table]\n\n[h1][b][4] Verdict (Score): Game 8/10, Translation 7.5/10[/b][/h1]\nWarriors of the Nile / \u5c3c\u7f57\u6cb3\u52c7\u58eb. This is a war chess game with roguelike elements. The gameplay mechanics are interesting, but somewhat repetitive, and the process is short. However, the fast-paced and turn-based tactical SRPG element makes the player more immersed in the game. If future updates improve the gameplay balance and focus more on the player's strategic play rather than luck, the game will definitely get better. If you like turn-based strategy SPRG roguelite games, this is the game for you. Recommended!\n\n[h1][b]Side Note[/b][/h1]\n[code]Looking for nice anime games? Let's take a look with Nyanco-chan!

In this case, there are two important factors:\n[olist]\n[*] This was made by two people in China.\n\n[*] The base price is $13 USD.\n[/olist]\nMy point in mentioning this is to give the proper lens to my review, as I will \u201ccut it a lot of slack\u201d because of the above two points. I\u2019ll have different kinds of expectations on a $13 dollar game compared to a $30 game.\n\nWhat is Warriors of the Nile?\n\nIt\u2019s a turn-based tactical roguelite game. The basic format of the game is that it consists of 3 zones with 9 encounters each. The first 8 of those encounters are normal challenges, while the 9th is a boss encounter. The battlefield consists of a 9x9 square grid with various obstacles scattered throughout. On your team you have 3 heroes: a warrior, a hunter, and a mage. The enemies will be a variety of units which mirror those 3 categories. As you win each encounter, you\u2019ll be taken to an upgrades area where you can improve your heroes. The various ways you improve during a run include:\n[olist]\n[*] \u201cTablets\u201d, which are basically passive powers for your heroes which can enhance them in a variety of cool ways. The game will always give you 3 to pick a single 1 from (1 tablet for each hero), so you get to choose \u201cdo I want to upgrade my warrior or hunter or mage this time?\u201d.\n\n[*] Each hero also has a base of 2 equipment slots, 1 for a weapon, 1 for an accessory. The weapons are hero specific, but the accessories are flexible for who you put them onto. These items can give various improvements, such as health / armor / special-trigger abilities, etc.\n\nNote that Tablets and Equipment have a rarity system of Green / Blue / Purple / Yellow, so, RNG is of course involved in \u201chow good of stuff you get\u201d.\n\n[*] \u201cCarvings\u201d, which are more global bonuses in nature during your run. In this interface, it shows you a small pyramid  with three tiers and a varying number of slots per tier: 3 on the bottom tier, 2 on the middle tier, and 1 on the top. These bonuses cost gold to obtain (gold you obtain from doing encounters) and can be all sorts of things, ranging from power-ups for the rest of the run to more-temporary bonuses. Note that you must have a tier filled up with Carvings before being able to construct the next tier\u2019s Carvings. When deciding to make Carvings, you have to be careful, as every now and then an item merchant will come by during your run and offer to sell you equipment. Depending on how you like to play, you may focus more on Carvings for your gold instead of equipment because you can get equipment drops from the encounters.\n[/olist]\nWhile going through a run, your heroes\u2019 health will persist and only get auto-healed / auto-resurrected after each boss encounter. This therefore puts a heavy emphasis on fighting against attrition and playing carefully to avoid dying due to smaller bits of chip damage. Thankfully, the armor in this game is on a per-turn-basis, so if you use your various equipment and tablet passives well, coupled with smart tactical placement etc, you can avoid taking any actual hitpoint damage on most encounters. To further manage health, when your heroes are wounded, sometimes the game will give you a one-time-heal tablet as a possible reward, or if you have any dead heroes, a one-time resurrection tablet. Obviously taking these quite-temporary bonuses are not ideal, but sometimes they can be necessary to \u201ckeep a run going\u201d instead of just \u201cyou\u2019re out of luck -- you lose\u201d.\n\nIn terms of the enemies, most of them are \u201cgeneric\u201d in nature, as in just having various stats for attack / health / armor / range / movement, and whether they\u2019re a \u201cwarrior / hunter / mage\u201d. The reason their class is important is because warriors and hunters can move and attack on the same turn, but mages cannot (these rules are the same for the player with their 3 heroes). As you progress in the game, however, fancier enemies can start showing up with different powers, things like: gaining attack every turn / healing allies / giving armor to allies / rooting your units / other nasty things, especially on boss encounters.\n\nFor the battles themselves, how many turns you take is generally irrelevant. This is important because it allows you to play defensively most of the time -- focus on winning without taking hitpoint damage. However, a little bit into the game, you\u2019ll unlock the ability for a few kinds of treasure monsters to start spawning in encounters. These treasure monsters will drop gear or gold depending on their type and are labeled as \u201cwill run away at the end of turn 4\u201d. It\u2019s the usual conundrum -- do I want to rush to get those bonuses, or do I play more defensively? Depending on the encounter and your team\u2019s setup, sometimes it works, sometimes you\u2019ll take too much damage chasing after bonuses -- it\u2019s all a choice. I\u2019ve also seen bomb types of \u201cwill trigger after X turns\u201d, so, they have both positive and negative \u201churry up\u201d enemies which can spawn on some encounters.\n\nWhat about meta-progress, what does this roguelite have to offer?\n\nWarriors of the Nile isn\u2019t as robust of a meta-system compared to something like Heroes of Hammerwatch, but still has a few nice things to boost your power. When completing a run (successful or not) you\u2019ll get some experience to level up your account which grants blue orbs that serve as currency to construct buildings. These buildings give bonuses in three ways:\n[olist]\n[*] Direct upgrades to health / armor / attack to your heroes.\n\n[*] Unlock more Tablets which you can find on your runs.\n\n[*] Unlock more Carvings which are possible to show up on runs.\n[/olist]\nSimilar to the trend which Slay the Spire popularized, this game has a \u201cHard Mode\u201d which is unlocked after beating the game the first time. From what I\u2019ve unlocked, I\u2019ve seen a list with 10 levels of Hard, the first of which says \u201cEnemies on normal stages have 10% increased health\u201d, and I presume it only gets more intense from there. The reward from doing these increased difficulties is unlocking a legendary-quality tablet for one of the heroes. \n\nWhile Warriors of the Nile may only have 3 heroes, each hero has 3 variants to utilize (and a 4th listed as \u201cPlease Stay Tuned\u201d, so it sounds like they intend to implement more). At first, you only have access to the base version of the heroes, but can unlock the other variants by achieving certain things in-game (such as [spoiler] the 3rd variant for all three heroes says \u201cClear Hard Mode Lv. 5 to unlock\u201d.[/spoiler]) These variants slightly alter the heroes\u2019 base stats / bonuses / appearance and are pretty neat in my opinion.\n\nMy Estimation of the Game\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this game accomplishes what it sets out to do -- it\u2019s a fun / smaller / cheaper roguelite tactical game which is pretty enjoyable to play in smaller spurts. Eventually, you will of course unlock everything, start climbing the Hard Levels, and try different combos of hero variants / tablets / carvings / equipment / see the bosses / etc; so it\u2019s not a game that you\u2019re going to be playing \u201cover and over\u201d (unless it really speaks to you or something). For $13 USD though? This 2-person project does a good job. \n\nSmall localization notes: Remember that the developers are Chinese, so the English translation isn\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d. That being said, the amount of issues I\u2019ve seen on that are quite small and aren\u2019t \u201cobtrusive or gamebreaking\u201d. Sometimes a word in some interfaces will be in Chinese, but it\u2019s a really obvious thing like \u201cthis thing is already constructed\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t have enough currency to get this\u201d.

A run can take 10 - 60 minutes. It depends on how well you do and how much you unlocked. \n\nYou start out with 3 Units. Every one of them is different and you learn how they work in the short but well made tutorial. You can't get more or different Units, but you earn gear and abilities throughout your run. Also, you get gold with which you can buy gear for example. After the first run you gain exp and level up. With each level you get something like a blue orb. It works like a skill tree in an RPG. You unlock better stats for your Units or new equipment or traits, which will then be able to spawn as a reward in your run. \n\nIn total, there are three stages. Each stage contains of 8 battles and one boss battle. The boss battles are pretty hard. I beat the game after 6.5 hours and with half of the skill tree unlocked (level 13 or 14 i think). I was also pretty lucky to get pretty good traits. After you beat the final boss, the run ends. You can do new runs with an harder difficulty (for example, the first Hard difficulty gives all enemies an 10% HP bonus) to level up and unlock new things such as different variants from your starting Units. \n\nEvery run is pretty different. There are so many different traits, abilities and equippement that you can beat enemies in various ways. For example you can get an ability that gives you 2 turns at the start of the battle or traits, which will let your unit attack ALL enemies within the attack range, which will let you attack 2 times if you don't move and so on. \n\nIt's a nice little indie game and for around 10\u20ac/USD there is more than enough content. If you like turn-based games and roguelite you should definitely buy this. I encountered no bugs and the english is very good. I am honestly surprised at how good this is and how addictive from the beginning.

It's such an addictive game. Masked by the adorable appearances is the high difficulty, so be aware that you will need to plan ahead in order to succeed.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou control a team of 3 fighters, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. You have to deal with a fairly intelligent AI opponent fighting through the levels. There are 3 levels in total, each with 9 individual stages. The further you progress the harder the battles become. Everything is turn-based and will start needing some real tactical thinking before too long.\n\nAfter clearing a stage, you have to choose from 3 tablets, each with some additional benefits for your team. You will also be awarded gold after winning a stage, and you can use that to buy gear or make upgrades to your pyramid. If you level up, you will get blue gems to build your city--these upgrades are permanent. As expected from these styles of games, if your entire team falls, it's game over.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nI love the bright and colourful graphics, everything appears adorable.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe game can be fully played with a mouse.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Video[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BVq1PALomY\n\n[h1]Pricing[/h1]\nI think the game is fairly priced. It gives you enough gameplay to justify its price.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n[i]Warriors of the Nile[/i] is a very addictive game that's also fairly difficult. You will need to plenty of planning ahead, otherwise it's very easy to lose. After trying for about 5 hours, I managed to get through the first boss. It's a game made by an indie team of 2 developers, and it's refreshing to see the opponent AI making the player work for his/her victories.\n\nFor me, this is an easy recommendation: 8/10.\n\n[quote]I received the product for free.

Like the animations are smooth and fast. The sound effects satisfying.\n And the game moves fast BETWEEN your actions. If you like turn-based games, you probably know the bane of executing and order and then sit and wait for 30 seconds as your characters or the enemy, strolls around on the battle field like a lazy Sunday drive and then finally decides to hit you after much hesitation. That\u2019s the programmers choice!\n Not in this game. To be honest it\u2019s going to be hard going back to other turn-based games when you been blessed with swift combat.\n\nHow it works:\nYour party of 3 tackle 3 different stages with 9 battles each. Between every round you get to choose from one permanent upgrade. You also gain gold from killing enemies (after first death) that allows you to buy runes and items from the shop.\nIt\u2019s the combination between the weapon effects and the permanent upgrades/runes that gives every run an unique feel. Wanna have the same attack range with your warrior as your archer? Sure pray to the RNG gods. Wanna make your archer a close range bow assassin? Yup can happen.
