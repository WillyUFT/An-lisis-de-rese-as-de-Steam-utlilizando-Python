It seems like games made by Tamsoft don't really prioritize interesting story aspects. The story of this game starts with Famitsu and Dengekiko who want to make exclusive interviews with CPUs and their candidates. From here I still understand the story scheme. But what does creating a magazine news article have to do with killing monsters? okay in several aspects of the story, such as wanting to make news about how the CPU is united with its candidate by killing monsters together. But what was even stranger was when the final boss appeared, out of nowhere this creature suddenly wanted to destroy the game industry. It seems like Tamsoft has to change a lot of the story of the game it makes, to make it more logical and easier to understand.\n\n\n[h1] Graphic [/h1] (8/10)\nEven though the story is strange, the game's graphics are undeniably beautiful. I don't get bored seeing Neptune and his friends, even with custom costumes it becomes more interesting to look at and collect. Here, Tamsoft has been good at designing everything from the main character, side characters to the boss. no doubt netuneverse is the best.\n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] (8/10)\nThe gameplay of this game...reminds me of a game. action game full of many skills. action game using block and evade strategies. However, the most typical aspect of the gameplay that I feel is very similar to that game is the scene where clothes are torn when they receive damage. Yes, you are right, what I meant was the Senran Kagura series game. It turns out that the developer of this game is the same as the developer of the Senran Kagura series, Tamsoft. No wonder it feels familiar to see the gameplay.\n\n\n[h1] Sound [/h1] (8/10)\nThis time Tamsoft was very good at processing the sound effects of this game. I give it a thumbs up because on average the soundtrack they make is really unique and gives a new flavor to every Neptunia game. Because Idea Factory likes to use the same sound in every Neptunia game series, sometimes we get a little bored, and Tamsoft handles that problem very well. good job Tamsoft.\n\n[h1] DLC [/h1] (7/10)\nBecause this is a spin off game, there isn't much DLC in this game, so I can't really comment much.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1697792007, "timestamp_updated": 1697879564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148411924": {"recommendationid": "148411924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162994148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1697587636}, "language": "english", "review": "fun, camera on PC can be a bit wonky though since you can only move it with your mouse, but you need two hands on the keyboard to move and attack", "timestamp_created": 1697586414, "timestamp_updated": 1697586414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147548287": {"recommendationid": "147548287", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131922590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 445, "last_played": 1696431304}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome, fun game.

CMIIW.\nI saw the game price is really cheap, & the most important thing, it has only 2 DLCs.\n(I did research on other Neptunia games & their DLCs, and this one is not too much DLC).\nIt's gonna be short experience I think, & worth the money.\n\nPros :\n~~~~~~~\n+ Good soundtracks, very MOOD BOOSTER.\n  Good thing is all unlocked in the beggining, you can listen them all anytime you want, play your favourite tracks, no need to spend your \"in-game money\" to buy them!\n  (Doesn't like another \"Anime-Based game\" does).\n  Unfortunately, you can't sort them out, making playlist of your favorite tracks only, but that's okay, nothing's perfect.\n\n+ Good voice acts, whoever the voice actressess are, they really did a good job.\n  I loved it, especially when they says, \"Now Loading...\"\n  The default (audio) language is in English, so if you're into \"Japanese anime stuff', I suggest you change the language to Japanese, much better!\n\n+ Low specs gaming for 2016's game!\n  I'm casual gamer, with my own Potato PC.\n  Playing this game, I'm so grateful, I'm feel so refreshed.\n  Not 2K-4K game, not 32GB RAM-game, not so-many-cpu-cores-game, no need updated CPU, no need updated graphic cards, no need to throw your old PC out to the window.\n\n+ It's really fun game, addictive, it's very easy to farm EXP, grinding EXP is not to difficult.\n  It takes some efforts, of course. But it's really worth it.\n  You replay some mission, and the enemy's level is below you, it's still worth good exp.\n\n+ Small game size, with only 2 DLCs, about 3GB, I guess.\n  It's gonna be short experience, didn't take much time to beat it.\n  But it can be long, hundred hours perhaps, if you're completionist, and want to get all the achievements.\n\n\nCons :\n~~~~~~~\n- Only the story have full subtitles/cc, the other sections are not (when you play the game, in battlefield/arena whatever, mostly characters are talking 'something')\n  I'm not Japanese nor English, I can't focus on hearings sometimes, but can focus on my eyes reading text on the display.\n\n- Prologue/Intro, whatever it is, is taking too long! (If you play new game)\n  Took around 25-45 minutes I guess? It depends if we skipping (spamming mouse click or A on controller) the dialogue or not, and depends on how good are you on your controller.\n  (How fast are you beat first 2 missions in the beggining).\n  The Story Intro can't be skipped, neither the dialogue scene, can't pause the game while in 'visual story mode'/dialogue. \n  We can only spamming mouse button or mashing A button on controller to make it fast.\n  This game has only manual save feature, so no auto-save, no checkpoint.\n  If you choose new game, in the middle you exit the game, your progress won't be saved!\n  The prologue needs to be cleared first! Which contains some dialogue readings & first 2 mission.\n  And then, voila! some opening intro scene with song (which is always there everytime you open the game), and the quest menu!\n  In quest/dungeon menu, you can save your progress, listening tracks, set up character, etc.\n  IT IS NOT A BAD THING, really, but the duration needs to be shorter than before, just 1 mission at first, perhaps? \n  Need to quickly save my progress, and usually enjoyed the rest of the game at last, after I'm done with other things. (Kinda my habit)\n  So first time i run the game it's just a gameplay testing around 7 minutes, setting up configs, options, if there's any techical issue or something.\n\n- Like I said before, the save feature is really crucial.\n  You need to save your progress regularly, because some achievements are misable! (if you're achievement hunter, you would understand)\n  It's a GOOD THING there's no auto-save/checkpoint. \n  Just in case, make some different save in another slot save, each chapter.\n  SOME ACHIEVEMENTS ARE REALLY PAIN IN THE A$$, that's my point!\n\n- I know this is not 'Hentai Game', but 'Ecchi' in this game is not... quite spectacular. Y'know what I mean?\n  I played Senran Kagura before, it's quite good. The \"Costume break\" thing, the \"touched the girls\" thing, etc.\n  If you buy DLC, and activated it in DLC options \"Swimsuit\", and your character wear this swimsuit, there won't be \"Costume Break event\", what the heck?\n  COstume break event is happened when your default character's suit torn apart, well it's not \"fully torn apart\", no differences, I still can't see... they... nevermind.\n  Maybe because main theme of this game is \"Anime girl\" \"Anime cute\" \"Cute monster not so scary at all\"? \n  Perhaps some of the characters are not 18 yet?\n\n- Buff items (replenish health kit) only spawn if we killed the enemies.\n  And mostly enemies will drop items if they killed by our special attack, not regular attack.\n  So, no crate contains item to break, no vase to break.\n  For hardcore gamers, it's really challenging, but I'm only casual, remember?\n  Good thing there are \"accessory buff\" that we can wear, right before we doing mission, preparation is everything.\n\n- Support Mouse & controller, and we can use them in the same time, but not support keyboard?\n  If your controller has Turbo function, use it.\n  You will know why.\n\n- So, in Story Mode > New Game, There are 2 options : CPUs story, Candidates Story.\n  I'm playing both of them, in different save slot, and can't really tell the differences, nothing significant quite yet. \n  (except the order of appearance of the mission).\n  There are 10 girls in this game, each grouped by 3 categories : CPU, Candidate, Reporter. (I think)\n  so what is the difference anyway? the ending?\n  then why we need 2 story mode, I think just 1 is enough, because the plot of the story is just the same anyway.\n", "timestamp_created": 1683319602, "timestamp_updated": 1683319602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136943505": {"recommendationid": "136943505", "author": {"steamid": "76561199197431236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3448, "last_played": 1681893267}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just a great Game! after 57h playtime I'm finally made it to 100%, and it is my first game on 100% :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1681884195, "timestamp_updated": 1681884195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135449175": {"recommendationid": "135449175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145505653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1696, "last_played": 1695974121}, "language": "english", "review": "This game introduce me to the Nep series and hack & slash genre, still fun to play from time to time even after 8years.", "timestamp_created": 1679806599, "timestamp_updated": 1679806599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135169226": {"recommendationid": "135169226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073443936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1676322779}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is trashy i love it", "timestamp_created": 1679503891, "timestamp_updated": 1679503891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135041730": {"recommendationid": "135041730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124470300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1497, "last_played": 1679324782}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes with conditions. \n\n- Don't expect much entertainment compare to mainline games. The whole game seems like it would take place within 2 OVA of a TV series. I won't say if I would rather watched that because It only took 8 hours to clear which set you at 85% story completion. The other 15% are *bonus* that took place after clearing the main story, and also the 15% not really worth exploring unless you're not comfortable looking at 85% clear rate.\n\n- It's Voiced acted as per usual and I do enjoyed the Voice acting.\n\n- Feels like it could take place between mainline games despite being a spin-off.\n\n- The Game play is alright. It feels like a 2000 game but I've no further arguments regarding it.\n\nNow for some other conditions you have to endure before the game would work with you.\n\n- As per usual This is a port like Dark Souls or maybe generally Fromsoft games The Keys are controller buttons like X,Y,A,B. You have to when you 1st boot up the game, figure out which button does what on a KEYBOARD. Go into the configuration and RE-MAP everything into what you prefer.\n\n- If you wish to 100% the story mission, you are gonna have to Cheat(part of the game optional toggle)  because the last 2 mission are IMPOSSIBLE to beat. The one with Neptune with Dengekiko and Uni with Blanc. The room is litter with BOSSES with annoying long range attack. \n\n- Heard of All X are equals? Well no that doesn't apply here as some do really better then others. Black Heart Y attack does a lot of damage it's a no brainer to spam it.

It's your basic hack n' slash, those kind where you're in one area and just kill a whole lot of monsters.\n\nIt would have been nice if there were more skills to use, and combos. There is very little diversity, but there are a lot of different characters, each with unique attacks, so that helps break up the monotony a bit. If you don't like repetitive games, then I would stay away from this. I personally don't mind them, and I didn't get bored until the end of the game.\n\nThe campaign has a stupid story, with the usual entirely too much talking that is prevalent in Neptunia games. Once you beat the story, you unlock some end game stuff to do, which is pretty boring, and without the story to motivate you, they are a bit of a chore.\n\nQuests lack variety, most of them having you kill hundreds upon hundreds of enemies until a boss shows up. Kill them, and it's on to the next level.\n\nThe difficulty is fairly balanced. Some quests the enemies kill you in one hit, some you kill them in one hit, but I certainly wouldn't label this game \"hard\" by any means. As long as you are within 5-10 levels of the recommended level for each quest, you should be good. It's also pretty easy to level up, usually growing 3-4 each quest.\n\nA new feature in this game is the girls clothes ripping, which is obviously fan service, but I liked it because it truly added a nice touch to the action. Fighting hordes of monsters felt more gripping and satisfying when your clothes get shredded, and at the end, when you character does her little victory pose, seeing her in shredded clothes just screams \"yeah, I just went through Hell, and came out on top!\"\n\nOverall, it's not a great game, but it's not bad either. Well worth the very cheap price when it goes on sale in any case.\n\nBut again, if you don't like those arena hack'n'slash type games with repetitive gameplay, this isn't for you...at all.", "timestamp_created": 1650593451, "timestamp_updated": 1650593451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113508412": {"recommendationid": "113508412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198946724767", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1674636563}, "language": "english", "review": "vert vert vert vert vert vert vert vert vert green heart green heart green heart green heart green heart green heart green heart green heart green heart", "timestamp_created": 1649392534, "timestamp_updated": 1649392534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600254476070404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112556283": {"recommendationid": "112556283", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997908509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 3879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1652549221}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring but good thumb workout.

Since there were lots of ups and downs throughout it. But then I'm reminded, that there are other games that are just not enjoyable in every aspect. Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is not one of those games by any means.

Meaning you don't have to play those if you want to enjoy the story in this one.\n\n[h1] Negatives [/h1]\n- Grind is not for everyone.\n- Some players may not enjoy the fact that certain cut-scenes are long.\n- Last level of Neptral Tower is almost impossible without activating the unlockable in-game cheats.\n- Mystery quests require you to enter the quest, quit it and then re-enter it to find out what you have to do to clear those quests.

So, it\u2019s definitely the shortest neptunia game yet. We been steadily getting about 1-2 neptunia games per year and it seems idea factory is working with multiple partners to create neptunia game in just about every genre. \n\nThis one is button mashing hack and slash with CPU team and Candidate team + 2 new character. There are no IF\uff0cCompa or Tome Girl as playable character and there are no Plutia and Pershy. \n\nMusic, Interface, Voice, Jokes are still neptunia like so it\u2019s all pretty good. Difficulty wise is actually really easy and there are built in cheat to help you once you finish the game. (you don\u2019t need it or at least I don\u2019t need it). \n\nThere are only one boss and the entire game is a very repetitive button mashing grind. The DLC gave a few extra quests and it\u2019s really not that significant only add a bit of a challenge it\u2019s both really cheap so if you got extra money, might as well buy and support the developer so we can get more nep nep.\n\nOnly going to give it 7/10 for this one.

May not entirely be the game's fault, as many tout this as an inferior Senran Kagura game, and even Senran Kagura has a few neat concepts, but the gameplay itself, I'm not really fond of. Regardless, this game was a pain. Motivation to finish it dropped even further when I got this strange bug where the audio is permanently dead. Verifying game files didn't work, and I for one was too uninterested in uninstalling and reinstalling a game I'd uninstall anyway when I was done, so put up with it.\n\nLame gameplay, no challenging achievements, just boring(Some missions suck too, like the one where you have to kill 1500 monsters or something. They spawn so damn slowly too). The beginning seemed funny enough with the story intro, but the story really got nowhere at all, and the humour that I sorta enjoy in most Nep games, I didn't in this one. \nEven for a fellow Neptunia fan, this one's a hard pass.

Runs on the same engine as [url=store.steampowered.com/app/411830]Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus[/url]. Very shallow but enjoyable if you're a fan of both Neptunia and Senran Kagura games (the two series have a lot of overlap in their fanbases).\n\nCompared to Senran Kagura games:\n- No blocking/parrying, no target lock, no sprinting, no frantic mode.\n- No aerial raves, but some combos let you juggle enemies for a bit.\n- No exploration, enemies just endlessly spawn around you until you kill a certain amount/the boss.\n- All enemies are asset flips from mainline Neptunia games, and their movesets don't make sense in a beat 'em up game.\n\nOn Neptunia's side of things:\n- 10 playable characters, 4 CPU's, 4 CPU candidates, Dengekiko and Famitsu.\n- Live2D scenes, all of them fully voiced in both English and Japanese.\n- Inventory with weapons, rings and a few outfits to choose from (mostly just palette swaps + swimsuits).\n\nOtherwise, the game is quite similar to Senran Kagura games. HDD transformations act like ninja transformations, skills act like ninpos etc. There's a clothes breaking mechanic, although you can't be stripped completely. You take two characters on a mission and swap between them whenever. The game dumps a LOT of missions on you once you finish the prologue and the bulk of the game is just an endless grind through all these samey missions with very little story in between them, you get a cutscene maybe like once every 10 missions (the cutscenes are good though, the writing is very funny and punchy). While Senran Kagura is not a super technical game, this is even more cut down and barebones, you can essentially stand in place and spam one button as the enemies just spawn around you, and you will win if you have the stats. The whole game boils down to doing the numerous missions in the suggested level up order and making sure all your characters have good stats and gear. Can still be a pretty fun time waster mind you, but this kind of gameplay loop makes more sense on a handheld (this is a Vita game after all).\n\nThe game has a couple of minor issues when running on Windows 10 and but they're [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2251074340]easy to fix[/url]. There's also a sequel called [url=store.steampowered.com/app/496810]MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies[/url], and it's a bit more polished, with better mechanics and more characters (but no clothes breaking).

This is a game that got Very Positive solely because of the franchise it is so sloppily stapled to. If any other developer were to make something of this calibre, it would get laughed out the door. A tried and true example of \"Why spend money to make a good game, when our horny fans will buy it anyway?\"\n\nThe enemies lack any sort of intelligence, with their sole purpose seemingly to just merge their body with yours in the vain hopes of dealing damage. You'd have to play like a complete idiot and force yourself down to Level 1 with an accessory to give them a fighting chance. I get that this is a Warriors type game, but even other Warriors games don't have infantry that are this incompetent at doing their one, sole job. The enemies in this game are so magnetised to the player character, that sometimes, they forget how to go around obstacles, it's like their pathfinding system was designed by someone who only knew how to draw a straight line.\n\nAnd when the game does provide difficulty, it's so cheap. Get the enemies to 200 levels higher than the level cap? Check. Bloat enemy health to the point where it takes forever to kill them? Check. Have them deal lots of damage in one hit that you can't see coming because of the amount of enemies thrown at you at once? Check. These problems are prevalent and compunded in the stupid 1 dollar DLC they had the audacity to include. Even on sale, the DLC isn't worth it, and that's something I never thought I'd say about a DLC that costs the same as a can of soda. I beat the DLC quests, by the way, but do I feel fulfilled? Do I feel the same thing I feel when overcoming insurmountable odds in other, much better designed games? No.\n\nThey make this whole show of the clothes break mechanic, and how it's supposed to make you stronger whilst making you more vulnerable to damage, but it's really just a thinly veiled attempt to give this game depth, as if they suddenly started caring about the game.\n\nThe levels are ripped straight out of the PS3 and Re;Birth games with no real effort to tailor them to an action-oriented game, aside from putting some stupid barrier that prevents you from getting out of the immediate area you spawn in. They quite literally lock you into a box to fight some boring enemies, and then once the game decides you've killed enough, they mercifully let you into another box where you do the same thing again. And sometimes, they don't even do that. Sometimes you just stay in that one specific part of the larger dungeon and have you do the entire mission there. You can tell they really just wanted to phone it in - an astounding lack of passion and effort that is honestly almost on par with the annual EA sports games.\n\nI won't even talk about the story because it's about as forgettable a piece of blank paper I put back into a drawer some time ago, and even then I can still remember the vaguely phallic shaped creases on that paper. At the very least, the entire game is voice acted in English, and the writing for the banter between characters is alright. But that's it, really, the only good things about this game don't even pertain to what's arguably the most important aspect of a video game - the gameplay.\n\n\n\nAll in all, there's almost nothing positive to say about this game. It sells on its name alone. It is reviewed well solely because of its name. If anyone else made something like this, it would get ripped apart. It's a shame, really. Because now Compile Heart and Idea Factory don't have any reason to try anymore. They can just keep releasing mediocre games and they'll still profit. In fact, the very next action game in the Neptunia series is an example of that very fact. MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies is pretty much the same level of boring as this game is, and that game sold and reviewed well too.\n\nDon't even buy this game on a sale. Just get some poor schmuck to buy it for you.

The game plays like a dynasty warriors game where you fight hordes of enemies till you reach some sort of completion requirement. Before I get too ahead of this review let me state that I will be reviewing the game in a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n     The story is very short. Now that can be a problem when it comes to an RPG game but since it is so short the story can be less deep and can be fun from time to time. The characters are nice to hear their dialogue. Some side missions do provide some background plot to the main story but these are more character driven so they dont hold much weight. So if you in for the gameplay and dont want a heavy story to weight down the experience then this is a positive for you....else you will be a bit disappointed.\n\nCon:\n        The clothes ripping mechanic is interesting. So if your clothes rip it boosts your exe bar. I also felt that you attack is stronger much like you would see in senran kagura games. Now it isnt a huge selling point for this game and this mechanic is used as a gemick and hold no other significance than fan service.\n\n       The maps are dull. I get it is a ps vita title but this game seriously reeks of indie slack. Now there are good indie games so this comment is not meant to belittle the devs that put in a bunch of effort to make a solid game regardless of limitations. This game has a limit of what feels like 5 maps. You will be going to these 5 maps through the whole game. It just makes for a visually dull experience when you go to the next mission and see you need to go to the block world or the slime park.\n\n        There is a small limit of enemy variety. Sure there is maybe 15 or 20 enemies around but for a game that you will be visiting the same locations again it would be nice to spice up the enemy variety some. You will see the same enemy periodically through the game which to some is not too bad since they have medals to collect. Enemies drop medals which is used to unlock new equipment or stat boosts. Having more enemies would mean they will need to decrease the amount of medals required to get all the tier rewards which would be good. Also would provide a little more visual interest in a dull world design.\n\n       Missions are very cookie cutter. So the completion request for many missions are to kill a specific enemy or kill a specific total amount of enemies. Now sometimes that number of enemies you need to kill to trigger the specific quest enemy to spawn can be a lot and that ties in to both having repetitive enemies flooding the game and dull arenas. It just leads to playing and beating the game to be a test of stamina and sanity.\n\n       This game has major slowdown. Now I dont believe it is mainly hardware issue but I think it is something to do with the engine used in creating this game or just being a shotty port. When their is many enemies in the map the game chugs frame rates some like being in the matrix or if enemies are attacking it causes the frames to dip. It is just not a fun time to be had to enjoying the game a bit to see the game run at power point frames when you see like 40 enemies on screen at a time which is how the game is initially designed.\n\n        Lilly ranks are a joke. One cool thing is that leveling up lilly ranks do not do much besides some minor buffs like fast sp gain, respawn, ect. There is a lack of unique nature like how the mainline neptunia games had where lilly ranks granted unique bonuses to the character they are attached to. Now it doesnt need to be levels of deep where it unlocks special moves but the bonuses should be different than the same exact bonus regardless of who you boost lilly ranks with. Not to mention I had to make a hotkey program to help boost all my lilly ranks by letting the game play itself. If grinding a core mechanic is dull than it is a faulty mechanic.\n\nConclusion:\n         Neptunia u is not a great game. It was pretty difficult to come up with a single positive thing to say about this game. The game felt dull and the grind for both exp and lilly, especially lilly was a huge chore to do. The slow down just made the game a horrible experience. I guess I should say I hope blanc + neptune vs zombies is good since it is similar since that game looks to be like a dynasty warriors like game. Not much is left to be said than I can not recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1588902020, "timestamp_updated": 1588902060, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49500235915184021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68585776": {"recommendationid": "68585776", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029021125", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1601179865}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast-paced hack and slash game, I liked it--especially 'cause it has costume break feature XD", "timestamp_created": 1588641357, "timestamp_updated": 1588641357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68475969": {"recommendationid": "68475969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113608336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1667337128}, "language": "english", "review": "Its very shallow your first 10 min is 100% whats in this game with nothing else just buy Dynasty warriors and waste the money on this theres not anything or redeeming this game other than if you like moe character's and even then theres better offerings than this all over steam ....and honestly the better offerings on the psp and ps1", "timestamp_created": 1588487071, "timestamp_updated": 1588487071, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68458391": {"recommendationid": "68458391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138435186", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1595044285}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun", "timestamp_created": 1588459240, "timestamp_updated": 1588459240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68370733": {"recommendationid": "68370733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335198670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1692952401}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks nice!", "timestamp_created": 1588345769, "timestamp_updated": 1588345769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68295629": {"recommendationid": "68295629", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004488179", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1602510077}, "language": "english", "review": "\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\n", "timestamp_created": 1588247527, "timestamp_updated": 1588247527, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456140369176864624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68127912": {"recommendationid": "68127912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250111498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1588174970}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game for Nep Nep fanboy!", "timestamp_created": 1588004970, "timestamp_updated": 1588004970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523258864879608154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68124388": {"recommendationid": "68124388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340812878", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 592, "last_played": 1652733542}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was very insane.

I decided to simply skip ahead to the later titles, since I have them all, where the gameplay had changed.\n\nNeptunia U Action Unleashed is extremely faithful to the feel of the rest of the series despite being in an entire different genre. The main and most notable new addition however is the most gratuitous examples of fanservice in the series yet. As I've mentioned before, despite its appearances the Neptunia series is actually very light on fanservice. The most you will get is characters wearing less but not doing anything sexual whatsoever which I can't see as anything beyond tricking boys into playing dressup. The characters also behave in an androgynous way where if you changed the character model to a male character model the dialog wouldn't even need to be changed, except when the conversations are explicit in talking about their boob sizes (not as frequent as the number of conversations about this subject in the anime which from what i've seen is exclusively made up of jokes about Blanc's flat chest). Action U however changes this with the new Clothes Explosion Mechanic (I made this name up myself) where the character clothes explode indicating they have filled an off screen bar which allows the Neps to power up into their HDD modes. This way there is less visual clutter in the user interface. There is no way you could possibly not notice the absence of clothing.\n\nThe more I play of this series which is a comedy the more I wonder if the jokes are really as simple as they appear or if they are so obtuse I don't even recognize them as jokes. For example it occurred to me the arrangement of characters during dialog scenes could be important and I've been trying to decode the Lily System ever since. During dialog scenes some characters are in the foreground and some are in the background and this is reflected in the dialog as in the characters in the foreground change a bit depending on who is standing behind them. Like I'm not even sure how funny this is yet, is it only a little bit funny or is it hilarious?\n\nAs for the gameplay well. The amount of screentime in other Neptunia games between the dialog and the actual game is about even, if you really want to get everything in the game you'll spend a lot more time grinding areas for item drops but if you only want to finish the game you will spend about the same amount of time on dialog as on playing the game. In Action U bizarrely enough I've spent a LOT more time reading dialog compared to playing the game. The levels are short and simple even compared to the rest of the series. The difficulty is very easy if you are playing the standard way but can be unfairly difficult if you play higher level quests first. Only unfairly difficult not impossible.\n\nThere are a lot of quirks to the different characters like for example Uni is very difficult to play as because most of her combos end in launching a single enemy into the air which is completely useless for crowd control and makes the pacing grind to a hault as each level takes approximately 100000x longer if you are launching every single enemy. I'm sure there's some upside to this character?\n\nRight anyways. Exploding clothes Ice Climbers fan service.

Even though I love the Neptunia franchise I really dislike this game (to clarify things I finished the game and even did some of the post game stuff).\nWith the new fighting system there could have been a lot new fun things that they could have experience with but sadly the game didn't do much with it. But whatever let's just go over the good and bad points.\n\n[b]Let's start with the positives first:[/b]\n- New fighting mechanics (even though it was strange at first it fits the game)\n- The slice of life scenes were nice to see especially without too much drama\n- Nostalgic tracks / maps from the earlier rebirth episodes\n\n[b]But here comes the important negative parts: [/b]\n- The quests were repetative (yes I know this is a Neptunia game) but still quests like \"Defeat 2500 enemies\" is pushing a bit. And even in normal quests you have to defeat 500 enemies before the boss shows up.\n- The translation makes some of the girls unbearably annoying (even a simple greeting got translated to 3-4 sentences of gibberish)\n- The dialogues between the characters in the lily menu has no subtitles (so good luck without understanding Japanese)\n- The game tells you to switch skills in the menu. You are going to get more than 3 skills after you beat the game. So in fact you don't have to do that at all if you are not into post game stuff.\n- The last boss of the game was just there to be there. There was no story about her and she had no motive at all. In fact you only met her twice.\n\nSo even though I really like the Neptunia series I can't recommand the game if you are not into hack and slash and do not care about story too much. Oh and you should also have perseverance to beat through thousands of monsters in the quests.

I liked the game a lot and had a lot of fun. It has it's ups and downs and I'll quickly go over them.\n  + New Characters (very kawaii)\nThe plot is basically the CPUs go around killing monsters while two Gamindustri Journalists (cute girls) were watching and then writing articles about them. These girls made a really good addition to the main cast. Dengekiko is actually the best girl of Neptunia U and I don't wanna hear anything else. I just like Misaka and I also like references.\n  + CPUs Unleashed\nYou can play as any of the CPUs or Sisters and they all have their own skills, animations and weapons which is really cool. In addition to that, there's like a gajillion accessories you can unlock and pick your equipment to suit your play style.\n  + Questing\nThere are a lot of quests in the game and most of them are interesting. In addition to typical quests, there's different challenges, so it has more variety than just \"kill them or whatever\". Also, by completing quests you can watch special sister bonding time events and that's a wholesome thing.\n\n  - The \"most boring antagonist\" award won't go to Arfy?\nI like all the Neptunia antagonists but IF really missed this time.\n[spoiler]I hate the villains that are evil just for the sake of being evil. Like they just try to feck up your day for no other reason but to be a menace to society. That's the antagonist of Action Unleashed for you. Well, maybe I just don't get them.

Clearly you brought, or are considering, this game because you need/needed more nep-nep in your life. This time around we are treated to an hack'n'slash action game instead of the normal JRPG turn based combat, which is a nice change of pace for anyone who is a veteran of the series and own all the other titles. \n\n-The combat is simple to pickup, you will be slaying mobs in the thousands in no time. I do recommend a controller for the best experience.... \n-The story is... Well... There really isn't one, but there are still plenty of cutscenes with the humour and dialogue we have come to know and love at this point. For those who don't know... It's just incredibly cheesy... \n-The gameplay is satisfying, not much else to say there really. If you enjoy the hack'n'slash style, you will enjoy this. It does get harder later on too, so there is a bit of challenge to be had, but your mileage may vary...\n-All the characters play slightly different from one another, which is nice variety, but I will say some are far better than others... I mean from my experience so far Ram and Nepgear seem incredibly powerful, while others like Blanc feel weak...\n-The dress break is a surprise addition, one that even the characters in the game are shocked to find the devs added (literally). So yeah if you want to see your favourite character in panties, let them get hit a bunch and enjoy.\n \nOverall it's pretty solid. There are some issues here and there, but it's nothing that ruins the game at all. Get it now or wait for a sale!

Instead of a JRPG this time around it's a Hack and Slash with visual novel elements.It was a nice change of pace this time around and gives you a bit of a break from the normal take turn battle system. It is fairly easy to jump into The controls are easy enough to use thou i do recommend using a controller. The combat is easy to handle thou it does get a bit harder on some of the higher level quest. The story this time around ehh well....there not to much of a story here sadly.This is more of a scenario that takes place due to becoming the most powerful in all of Game Industry. Simply put what could have happened as a continuing of Hyperdimension Neptunia Re Birth 1 true ending.\n\nOver all the game is well done it still has the humor from the the other games in the series. Thou i do have to say that getting your lilly ranks all up to 10 for all the girls is just torture. You will easily spend 5-6 hours doing just that alone. Also if you have not played any of the Neptuina games and are not sure witch one to start with then it is highly recommend you start with Hyperdimension Neptunia Re Birth 1.

I've made it to chapter 3 so far, but... my thoughts on the game remain the same, with a few slight changes. First off, there's the quests. Personally, I have found these to be quite fun, and interesting, and there are some quests with some... interesting objectives. Secondly: I've gotten used to the banter between characters, along with the idea of combos in hack-n-slash titles. When I first started playing this, I was just mashing buttons. Eventually I looked at the combo list and found that I had to actually pay attention to which buttons I'm pressing... (then again, that much is a given, but I'm relatively new to hack-n-slash titles... not entirely, but somewhat, so I was kind of just learning the ropes, much like any other genre or title I have played maybe a couple of times before). Because I consider these to be slight changes in opinion, my review score isn't changing. \n\n[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]\nI still consider myself terrible at writing reviews. I may have improved slightly from when I first started reviewing titles on Steam, however this doesn't mean I'm completely blind to the fact that there's still room for improvement. That being said, take this info with a grain of salt. There's a fine difference between reading a review, watching someone play a game, and actually trying it out for yourself. On that note: if you find that the game isn't quite to your liking: Valve has a system in place for refunds for that very reason.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nWith more fourth wall breaking than ever before, comes another Neptunia title from Idea Factory. Note that this is solely based on my opinions of the game, from the amount of time I've spent playing the game so far, and thus does not reflect my final opinion of the game as a whole. So, without further adieu, let's get this show on the road!\n\nGoing with a different format for my reviews this time, I'll start off with the gameplay:\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of entries in the Dynasty Warriors franchise (though, to be fair, I haven't played a SINGLE Dynasty Warriors title, I'm not entirely new to the Hack-N'-Slash genre, as I have played Hyrule Warriors at one point.) Despite the venture into a different genre in comparison to the other Neptunia titles, such as the 3 remakes, and Megadimension Neptunia VII, it doesn't lose its charm; its appeal. The lines get a bit repetitive after a while, but... honestly, I'm COMPLETELY fine with that.  Speaking of, this brings me to the next topic.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nSo... this may come off as a bit of an unpopular opinion, but personally, I don't really care about graphics too much. Say what you will, I'm perfectly fine with games running at lower resolutions than most triple A games, and 30 FPS. When I see people saying stuff like \"30 FPS is unplayable\", I just roll my eyes and move on. As long as a game doesn't run like a flipping slideshow, I'm completely fine with that. As per my motto: \"If a game isn't fun, what's the point of having amazing visuals?!\". My personal opinions aside, there are some fixable issues such as blurred images from upscaling the resolution (which, again, I didn't really mind because the game was at least fun enough (to me anyways) for me to endure it). \n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nAs per usual with Neptunia games, the music goes for a more... sort of remixed retro style approach from what I've heard so far, with a bit of a modern twist. The music matches the environments rather well, might I add. Will have to play some more to hear what the rest of the soundtrack has to offer.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThis is where we get into the slightly spoilerific territory... or not, cause I literally only made it through 1 chapter so far. The game starts off with Dengekiko asking to write a article about the CPUs: Neptune, Vert, Blanc, and Noire, and Famitsu writing an article on the CPU Candidates: Nepgear, Uni, Rom, and Ram. The dialogue actually fits this narrative rather well, though there are some.... quotable moments here and there, as per the usual (from what I've noticed out of the 4 nep games I've played thus far.\n\n[h1]Closing remarks[/h1]\nWhile I enjoyed playing the game, I've only played it for a short amount of time. That being said, I'm bound to update this review once I playthrough a bit more of the game. I understand it can be considered a lazy practice as I've used this for my playthroughs of Outlast and MGS V: Ground Zeroes (though I really should get around to finishing those games one of these days). On that note: I give this game a (partial) review score of: 9/10.\n\n[h1]Scorecard[/h1]\n[list][*]Gameplay: 10\n[*]Visuals: 8\n[*]Music: 10\n[*]Story: 8\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1529768791, "timestamp_updated": 1532704720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42954442": {"recommendationid": "42954442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153302118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1526787417}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 nothing more", "timestamp_created": 1529730574, "timestamp_updated": 1529730574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42885155": {"recommendationid": "42885155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012650407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 216, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1527523464}, "language": "english", "review": "Thought this was a Wii U game...buyer beware", "timestamp_created": 1529528968, "timestamp_updated": 1529528968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.305176347494125366", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42838458": {"recommendationid": "42838458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026511921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1529405843}, "language": "english", "review": "Controls are worse than other Neptunia series by default.

The concept of making the game funny and comedy-driven story is just great, and to be fair, this is the first time i laughed hard just by looking at the conversation for no reason. I know Neptune is just a stupid girl talking for no plot, but this is another point of this game. The overall story is [u]Meh[/u], meaning that don't ever expect great storyline as the Re;1 or VII has, the setting still the same though, you play as one of the character, but this time they remove some side-character and adding non-playable character from the older game instead. Only that its now hack 'n slash so it would be a bit different point of view to see how the character itself fight or just making a move in the battlefield.\n\n[b] Game Mechanics [/b]\n\nWith a brand new hack 'n slash game mode, this is just getting interesting. The rest of the mechanic game system remain uncanged, like the equipments or the accessories itself, but the only different is that you can only change them while in the main menu instead of instantly change your items while in battlefield, due to the hack 'n slash mode of course. Nevertheless, the rest is just same, you got a similiar main menu, similiar maps system, customizable characters, new [i]Costume Break[/i] mechanics, quest is a little bit different but still has the same mechanics, [u]and you can now change the music from the main sequence, fancy right ?[/u]. Besides of it all, i do love the combat system where you can hack 'n slash merely all of the enemy horde in front of you, many characters can just spam the attack all the way on and many of them are just focused on single heavy shot of damage. Just be careful not to shreds off your costume while rushing them all.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nI love the entire gameplay, no comments on this one. If you okay with the original title you'll love this one, altough if you don't fit with the nudity content i can't really say this game was okay.\n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nUnlike older series, Neptunia U doesnt really get me deeper into its music library since its just a library of many previous game, altough its still good to listen to, nothing fresh out of it. The Opening Song is still [strike]Trash[/strike] for me but hell yeah this is the first time i love the Ending Song they put into it, its just fit the ED so much that i wanted to replay them so many times after i heard them in the first place.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\n\nThe graphic is the fatal issue when i discovered them. The resolutions are just so unspecific. There are many fixes that you can do but i still dont know how it work. First, the original resolution is crappy and doesnt fit anyhow. Second, fullscreen means that the game will go to the maximum resolution of your screen, despite that the in-game settings states is just 720p or lower it will just maximize itself. And just my personal advice, try to upscale the game by using Custom resolution on your desktop, i've tried on lower resolution monitor (768p) and the graphics is just like a pixelated games due to a really weird port method they invented from PSVITA to this PC version. Trying to upsacle the game to 2K on my older monitor seems fix the issues altough you cant see those enemy healthbar clearly anymore.\n\n[b] Characters and Voice Actors [/b]\n\nOverall, im really enjoying the game with no voice-cut like the original series has where it shows just the character and dialogue with no voice in it, but this one got nothing to deal with them. Mainly because the story is too short, all dialogue can contains voice (even with the ending dialogue where non playable characters just slide in and made some announcement), fully appreciate them and i like to see more on newer series, it can bring up the games more lively and basically, better. Character is still progressing and you can actually see that this is a representation of Re;1 and Re;2 character development with the same main character playing around with their sisters.\n\n[b] Overall/Extraordinary Contents [/b]\n\nFinally, time to talk about the [spoiler]Senran Kagura[/spoiler] game mechanics. I dont really know why they put this idea into the original Hyperdimension series but heck yeah many people love it so,,, i guess its not really bad idea. From my point of view, the adult content is okay. Nothing more than ripped off clothes and nude girl here and there, its kinda lame to see how the mechanics goes on and on like hell but still, they care about fanservice here. Luckily you can, like YOU can use unbreakable outfit so there's no more nudity here and there [spoiler]you can earn them through the storyline[/spoiler]. Overall, this spin-off game is fully enjoyable, meaning that [i]adult content aside[/i] this worth the bucks very well, the game itself is fun to play, and if you're looking for hack 'n slash game with small adult content you can just buy this game anyway, but make sure to buy it when its on sale xD\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Aspect[/th]\n        [th]Point[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]4.5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Music[/td]\n        [td]6.5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]8.5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overall[/td]\n        [td]7.8[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Enjoyable[/td]\n        [td]Yes[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n", "timestamp_created": 1527126390, "timestamp_updated": 1527126390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567727565765380859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42195608": {"recommendationid": "42195608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421296485", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1547296089}, "language": "english", "review": "my dreams of beating the shit out of NPCs while wearing a swimsuit and being cute has come true, P.S there is a character with big tiddies", "timestamp_created": 1527089577, "timestamp_updated": 1527089577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42161323": {"recommendationid": "42161323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311849420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 321, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1692245775}, "language": "english", "review": "this in-game tutorial is terrible, it's not fun while the game biggest challenge is on it's poorly PC port control, I spend almost 20 mins on keyborad remapping, which burn off most of the fun part.\n\n\nthe character are well design, but it's build up by the main text game, the battle part is horrible, with the enemy massive and no way to adjust the difficult, enemy could gang up and kill you five hits combo, increditable frustrate to play, the mission of variety is sad, also them place most of dialog outsdie the combo, which made combat itself even boring.\n\nthe combo system is disappoint, with the light attack plus only one heavy attack, this whole chian attack is flat, other stuff of like the transforms and small skill out of place in whole game, to be hoest I rather cut of those function to exchange a much variety main combo chain system, poorly execute battle hack and slash game, enemy is so tiny and weird look, they reuse many of old game model  the repetitive content is purely out of your mind.\n\nhave encounter several hard crush in below two hours of game play, game itself is really unstable.\n\nI even made a tutorial how to remap this game=\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1391402878", "timestamp_created": 1526915930, "timestamp_updated": 1632066834, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508099794387817383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42160496": {"recommendationid": "42160496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165778106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 859, "last_played": 1528026975}, "language": "english", "review": "Hail Nep Nep !\n\nSuper Nep Nep !!\n\nThis is a Dynasty Warrior like game with Nep Nep and the gangs.

How does it stack against other specimens of the genre, such as Devil May Cry or Darksiders? Poorly. There are few moves available and there is - overall - very little depth to the gameplay. There is some token story but it seems even less important than what I remember from Re;Birth1. Difficulty is not adjustable, and the game is really, [i]really[/i] easy. And then there are DLC weapons to use... There are no random achievements, but one of them takes several (5-ish) hours of dedicated grinding! The NG+ content is plain bad, other than the built-in cheats... but that's not exactly content. I tried the English dub for a moment and it is drop dead terrible (and I'm guessing other games from the series are like that as well). Luckily you can switch to Japanese audio. You miss out on some interactions (the Lily dialogs between characters) but that's still a lesser evil.\n\nIt might sound like there are only negatives so far, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Somehow I did. It's probably the easygoing setting and characters. But I think that - to be able to appreciate those - you need to have some prior knowledge. Go start with Re;Birth 1 if you know nothing about Neptunia. For fans of the series this game will likely be \"good enough\", even if it looks like a poorly thought out experiment at times.

I\u00b4ll tell you why.\n\n1.) Gameplay\nGameplay is easy to describe. You have three options to attack. Normal attack, hard attack and your special moves. At some point you can Transform into your HDD form, which makes you stronger. You just have to beat the enemys and / or finish the clear condition. You can\u00b4t do anything wrong. No fancy combos (it has combos but I dont want to call them that).\n\n2.) Story\nThe story is somewhat ok. The usual \"Something bad is in town and we have to kill it\". I skipped alot of dialogue becuase it was sometimes real annoying. Decide that for yourself how you want to rate it but I assume that you dont play Hack n Slash because of the big storys.\n\n3.) Graphics\nIt is what you expect from an anime-style game: simple, not much details. I don\u00b4t wanna say it\u00b4s bad but yee... Let\u00b4s keep it at that.\n\n4.) Sound\nMusik is great. I really enjoy the music. And the game has alot of music from other Neptunia games.\nSoundeffects is a diffrent story. I\u00b4d say they\u00b4re real annoying after a while, mostly because it just repeats over and over again. Nep Jr. and Uni are the worst when it comes to effect sounds.\nVoice acting is like in other Neptunia games really good (my opinion). I also don\u00b4t think that you have to use japanese voice for the full experience, english is real nice too.\n\n5.) Controls\nControls are real nice overall. Only two things i didn\u00b4t really like:\nCamera is absolut terrible. I just hate it.\nNo native PS4-Controller support. Had to use third-party software to emulate an Xbox controler (DS4 Windows)\n\n6.) Conclusion\nI\u00b4d say 7/10 if you like the Hack n Slash genre, 4/10 if you\u00b4re new to the Neptunia Series.\nGot it for ~3\u20ac in the sale. For this price it\u00b4s just fine.

If you don't know what that means in terms of setting and characters you should probably look at the main JRPG series first. This is a spinoff which isn't considered canon -- but it could very well be since it's not reshaping Gamindustri in any way.\n\nAlso, this is a Neptunia game, using IF's patented(?) technique of asset-reuse. It has considerably less story than the main games (if you can even call it a story -- I haven't finished the game yet). \n\nOn the positive side, the lack of story means fewer visual-novel style dialogues and much less childish brabbling. Compared to Re:Birth3, the visual novel parts are generally better -- all of them are voice acted, there can be more than 2 portraits on screen, and they move around a bit to indicate who's talking.\n\nOn the negative side, the lack of story also means considerably less Neptunia humor. The 4th wall is only getting a light beating, and there isn't much in terms of gaming or console references.\n\nGameplay is nothing special. This is an action game, so it's basically button mashing your light and heavy attacks along with combos thereof, moving around, possibly firing an SP skill every once in a while. You fill an EXE gauge by killing stuff which lets you go into HDD eventually which depletes the gauge over time, or when you fire your EXE skill -- which, contrary to the SP skills, very much feel like \"press button to win\", especially when you do it for the final boss.\n\nYou take 2 characters into battle that you can switch around; other characters do NOT gain experience so you need to use all your characters to level them. There is a Lily system, which provides some passive bonuses. The passive character heals over time, and gains points for EXE  faster.\n\nCharacters feel reasonably different, even Rom and Ram (although I do have to admit that I need to fire a heavy attack at the beginning to figure out which of the two I'm playing :-)). You can even \"feel\" Blancs hammer being heavy compared to the lighter attacks from other characters.\n\nMissions aka quests are basically always of the \"kill trashmobs first, then kill boss(es)\" type. Locales are familiar, except that they are much more restrictive as the fights are arena-style.\n\nPlayable characters are the 4 main CPUs, the candidates, and 2 characters that I think have been created for this game (Dengekiko and Famitsu). As for the main story, no other characters appear, although there are a few \"guest\" appearances post game.\n\nTalking about postgame, there will be a couple additional quests, and two additional game modes. The Gauntlet is just rubbish, while Neptral Tower is a grindfest of levels to beat.\n\nThe upgrade path is tied to medals obtained from monster killing, so depending on how you look at it you don't get much choice, or you can use it to specifically repeat specific missions to gain more medals of a specific type.\n\nSound is Neptunia. The voice acting is as always, I've heard familiar music tracks, and some that I didn't recgonize (but I haven't played all the main games yet, and I don't necessarily remember all the tracks). I don't know whether there are original tracks,\n\nThe game certainly isn't difficult. I found combos to be generally complicated to pull off since it's hard to tell when to press the next button unless there's a signal move like \"Hit X until the char dashes, then press Y\". But that didn't hurt me at all, and for many characters I'd just spam attacks without paying too much attention to combos at all.\n\nTo sum it up, even though the game has been created by a different company, and has different gameplay, Idea Factory has ensured that it IS a Neptunia game through and through.\n\nAlthough the game is solid enough, I can imagine that there are better games with this kind of gameplay, so the usual caveat applies: if you like to nep-nep your monsters instead of just bashing them, go for it. Maybe wait for a sale, though.\nIf you can't stand the main Neptunia series, then this game probably won't change your mind.", "timestamp_created": 1514943463, "timestamp_updated": 1515197582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38975494": {"recommendationid": "38975494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103490086", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1186, "last_played": 1463414166}, "language": "english", "review": "A delightful alternative to the classic Neptunia games: the plot is pretty shallow, however the real-time combat system is fun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1514903988, "timestamp_updated": 1514903988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38967247": {"recommendationid": "38967247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432039102", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1519821479}, "language": "english", "review": "Yey Famitsu-chan", "timestamp_created": 1514886083, "timestamp_updated": 1514886083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515362799167633057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38962164": {"recommendationid": "38962164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351695484", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1543219324}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Gameplay.\nAs usual, Galge style combined with Action-RPG.\nRecommend for ya that love RPG with Moe Characters.", "timestamp_created": 1514870659, "timestamp_updated": 1514870659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38957931": {"recommendationid": "38957931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055836491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1514863479}, "language": "english", "review": "DON'T BUY THIS GAME.\nIt is a completely unplayable PC port.\nThe default keybindings are unusably odd but good luck changing them, since the keybind settings only lists what the controls would be on a gamepad and not their actual function meaning you'd need to write down or memorize all the imputs on a controller just to change them.\nEven if you own a controller, don't buy this game.\nThis isn't the first PC game I've played which required a gamepad, it is however the first one to both require a controller and have a bug that many people experience that means it will simply NOT REGISTER THAT YOU ARE USING A GAMEPAD.\nFirst thing I did after was plug in my Xbox 360 controller, to find that I still could not select the gamepad option in the menu.\nI searched the problem and what did I find?

First off, it's a Hack and slash spinoff variant of the Turn Based JRPG main series, Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. That being said, it's more for people who have played the main series, or for anyone who just really loves anime/manga. As the title may suggest, a deep story is most definitely not going to be found here, or anywhere within this franchise. Bear in mind, however, that does not mean the game is bad. On the contrary, actually, that's part of what gives this series, and this game, its charm. Just the random silliness and easy-going atmosphere of the game is enough to suck you in for hours, laughing along with whatever nonsensical shenanigans are going on.\n\nAlthough very simple in principle, the game proves quite challenging if you just grinded one or two characters out and neglected all the others, as there are certain quests that require certain characters, giving the game a more full feeling than if you could just use the same two characters and beat the game in an hour or two.\n\nThe music is characteristic of the series, and the graphics are pretty good as well, even featuring a little improvement. The combat system is centered on combinations, but the different tiers of attacks are pretty parallel to those of the main series, which is comforting if you are new to Hack and Slash games.\n\nAll in all, it's pretty good. I'd personally pay full price for it, but that's just because I've been a fan of the series for years. That being said, if this is the first game in the franchise you're buying, either start with the main series, or pick this one up on sale.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1514339498, "timestamp_updated": 1514339498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677636325359344482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38718235": {"recommendationid": "38718235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005439390", "num_games_owned": 942, "num_reviews": 1233, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1514337256}, "language": "english", "review": "Not sure I can recommend this until they fix all the problems with it:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656429090", "timestamp_created": 1514335444, "timestamp_updated": 1514335444, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505438566207885742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38705030": {"recommendationid": "38705030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344716310", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1514362107}, "language": "english", "review": "h", "timestamp_created": 1514309645, "timestamp_updated": 1514309645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38663593": {"recommendationid": "38663593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106715286", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1515090179}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 nep nep", "timestamp_created": 1514218626, "timestamp_updated": 1514218626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38660484": {"recommendationid": "38660484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008303595", "num_games_owned": 875, "num_reviews": 553, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1521544485}, "language": "english", "review": "A comedic script will keep you entertained as you hack and slash through dozens of stages.

Through the course of the game, you'll probably have completed roughly 300 missions-- maybe less.  That many missions will have likely unlocked all accessories/gear that the game offers and maxed out every character's level.  The \"Lily Lord\" achievement requires the beating of an additional ~900 missions or more (45 pairings each requiring around 20 missions to max out).  It's just a bit too much of a grind considering there's nothing else to grind for-- item drops, levels, etc.  \n\nPros/Cons:\n+ Most text is voiced and the voice acting is great.  \n+ The artstyle is adorable.  \n+ Combat feels pretty fluid and satisfying.\n+ The amount of fanservice is adjustable.  \n+ There are some fun unlockable abilities/items.\n+ Each character feels fairly distinct in terms of combat.\n\n- Every mission is way too alike.  Each quest, with very few exceptions, is essentially 'kill 100+ enemies' or 'kill 100+ enemies then a boss'.  There's no story behind each mission or any unique rewards for completing certain ones.  \n- Most missions can be completed by mashing the x button.  There's nothing challenging the player enough to deviate from that strategy.  \n- It's common for both characters to be defeated at once since the partner spawns in at the same location the first character just died with no invincibility frames.  \n- Though I did get 31 hours out of the game, most of that time was spent achievement grinding.  I'd say, rather generously, that the game's content took me around 10 hours to see.  I don't believe that warrants the $30 pricetag.  \n- Though some missions had maps with paths to navigate, the large majority were just simple arenas.  \n- Most bosses felt like oversized enemies and could be killed just as simply.  \n- It crashed a few times for me.  \n- There's no autosave.  \n\nOverall:\nHyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed gave me a good first impression.  I was charmed by the sequences of visual novel storytelling, and the combat was fluid and fun.  Sadly, though, the game just fell flat.  It felt as if I was just slaughtering foot soldiers in Dynasty Warriors again and again without any major changes or overarching purpose.  At first, I liked that mindlessness, but, for the price, I wanted more.  I wanted more customization, more story, more challenge, more reasons to keep on grinding.  I was not given these things.  With so many great features like the art and voice acting, Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed had so much potential.

Which is why, it's understandable that there will be many flaws. But is it worth the price? Well, let me tell you my problem with this game: it's very repetitive and boring.\n\nAfter you try to use all the characters in this game, then you basically already experience everything that this game has to offer. Every level feel the same, enemies including the mid boss offer little to no challange, and the combo is very simple, you could just spam X and win. The objectives is always the same, \"kill a certain amount of enemies\" or \"kill a mid boss, but to summon the mid boss, you must kill a certain amount of enemies first\". And when I say a \"certain amount of enemies\", I'm talking about 100 to 500 enemies. Which mean you must spam the X or Y button to kill that many cannon fodder enemies until you beat the level.\n\nThe main story itself is very short and not very interesting. I think I beat the main story at my 9 hours playtime. Just don't expect the story to be like anything you experience in Re;Birth trilogy or Megadimension.\n\nThe game highlighted feature is the cloth tearing feature, which basically make your characters cloth rip after a certain amount of hit. Cool feature, sure, but let's be honest, this feature exist only for fanservice and add little to nothing for the gameplay itself\n\nIt's the first hack 'n' slash game in Neptunia franchise, so it's not a surprise to see so many flaws.

And I like hack and slash games. Games like Akibastrip or Senran Kagura usually end up being my favorite types of games to spend a summer on. So I did enjoy this. \n\nBut that being said, the characters aren't really too in-depth even on character models. There's not much to \"collect\" either. Kill hordes of enemies, they drop coins, and those coins offer upgrades, but that's really about it. As far as I can tell, there's not even a shop, and according to the progression screen, I played this game for 2 hours and I'm 15% done. \n\nAlso they talk. Forever. I don't even know what the plot's about at this point because it grew so boring and cumbersome that I started skipping dialogues. Remember: games like Senran and Akibastrip are my favorite. I don't skip dialogues often. But this one, once they start its like they never want to stop. If I had even speedred all the dialogue instead of skipping I'd probably be another hour or two longer in this game just from that.\n\nLong story short, this is a simple time killer. Which is exactly what I wanted and also exactly what I expected. So I enjoyed it. But it's a surface game. There's not a lot of depth or progression as far as anything is concerned. I waited till the Steam summer sale to buy it for like $5 so it was definitely worth the money I spent on it, but I wouldn't recommend paying over 15 for it, let alone the full $30 price tag.\n\n\n\nTl;dr?\nPros: Weeby, hyperdimension neptunia characters, simple, hack and slash. Simple, casual fun with silly strip mechanics of AKibastrip or Senran Kagura games. You don't have to have played previous Hyperdimension games to keep up, but if you do it helps. Funny dialogue and humor, often breaks the 4th wall at times, lots of cultural references to other games and anime.\n\nCons: Lack of any depth given to characters, combat or plot, LOTS of talking that you're eventually going to just start skipping because it goes on forever. \n\nRecommendation: Buy on sale if you like very simple hack and slash weeb games like Akibastrip or Senran Kagura, but I don't recommend any one buy it at full price. And I was REALLY hoping I wouldn't feel that way because these types of games are my favorite kinds but I honestly couldn't see myself feeling justified spending over $15 on this (and I have Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash preordered for my ps4 currently).", "timestamp_created": 1498300540, "timestamp_updated": 1498300540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617174506187438965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32710692": {"recommendationid": "32710692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065338550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1498625749}, "language": "english", "review": "Action packed and silliness you expect from the Neptunia franchise.

Its like the devs spent the whole budget on artwork cause the gameplay is terrible. It's all about button mashing and fighting in the same boring arenas against the same mindless enemies that don't even have AI. Ontop of that if you stand still too long you die, and dodging is so janky and barely ever works so that's out of the question. It plays like some crappy low budget early access unity game. Literally the only good thing about the game is the artwork. Even the voice acting and overall audio is terrible, I don't need to hear a character say 'now loading' every time a loading screen comes up and I don't need to hear a character say the same thing over and over again when they do an attack, it's ridiculously annoying, luckily you can turn off the in-game character audio but it still repeats the same annoying lines all around the menus so no avoiding that.

For me, it just wasn't for me.\n\nFirst thing I noticed when I first picked it up was the ENG audio. Luckily there is a JAP audio selection in the options menu as well as subtitles. The downside with this is that not everything is subbed. There were several sections in the game where you just had characters speak without subtitles. To me that's a bit annoying, but not a major complaint since their voices are all pretty great.\n\nThe battle system feels very repetitive and quite boring actually. You can pretty much grab a character, find one combo that doesn't have a huge idle time afterwards and just repeat. Of course this doesn't work for every stage, but I found this doable through most of it. The character interactions between the characters are great until about hour 8 where you're getting repeats every 20secs or so since it will take almost no time at all to get decent at this game. The real challenges don't come in until after the main story. That's when things get more intense, but even then there is just so little there. \n\nThe story itself isn't very memorable, but it is actually one of the things I like most about the game. It's cute, it's actually written very well, and the small talk between the major events at time are great. There are several refrences to games that came out around U's first release date and boy are they great little refrences. I honestly think this game would have done better as novel compared to a Hack n Slash genre based game.\n\nI could go on to pick small things here and there, but here is my overall opinion.\n\nIt's a great game for Neptunia fans, but not a great game for Hack n Slash fanatics. I would not recommend this unless they were a Neptune fan. \n\nI got this game when it was on sale for about $5 and I would say I would max at $10 for this. So unless you [u]really[/u] want it, don't pay it's current price.

Stuff ranging from stat buffs that apply across all characters to new weapons and costumes. The combat is a (dumb) blast - its really just mashing out simple combos and dashing around groups of enemies, occasionally broken up by unleashing special moves and swapping characters, until you can transform and then really wreak some havoc on large groups of enemies and bosses - but it is very enjoyable. Sometimes you need more 'Fighting Force' than 'Bayonetta', you know? \n\nThe girls' playstyles are diverse enough and have just enough to learn that you'll have fun experimenting and getting better with each style the more you play. Plus there's enough enemy variety, and there are enough ways to power up, as the game goes on to keep it from getting too repetitive throughout the entire playtime, I think (though the level designs are very simplistic). Its just really well done - the animations are great, knockbacks and hitstuns feel perfect, and there's loads of great Visual FX to provide rewarding feedback to everything you do. All the while, you're fighting to tunes that sound straight out of a Playstation-era Mega Man X title (there's a lot of great stuff here; catchy melodies, good arrangements, high energy stuff. Classic Japanese video game music with a \"cyber\" veneer).\n \nIf you're worried about it getting pervy - especially since this game, that heavily advertises its \"costume breaking\", features lots of characters who are, after all, little girls - fear not! You can adjust... well, everything that may grate. You want to give them unbreakable outfits? Go for it. Wanna mute the voices**? On a character-by-character basis, even. Conversation/dialogue scenes lasting too long? Skip'em. There's a solid amount of \"quality-of-life\" refinements here, which is great. This is definitely a good \"podcast game\" - just something to mindlessly play while doing something else, so adjusting your experience a bit is welcome. Just make sure to head into the Options and the SETUP menu (on the World Map screen) to dig into all this stuff as soon as possible. Otherwise you'll miss out on some stuff that would really up your enjoyment of the title early on, including leveling up your characters via the Medal system.\n\n( ** - to be clear, the voice acting is great. The script is generally pretty cute and funny, while the English cast are matched well to their characters and crushes every line. The problem is just that the voices get so repetitive in stages that you're going to want to mute them before the first one is over. Literally, they have to announce every special move they do, as well as throw out the same 3 or 4 quips every few seconds. The dialogue scenes are good, but the in-game just gets too obnoxious.  )\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a fun, flashy time beating the crap out of loads of enemies - one that's still satisfying-to-play and simple-to-grasp (but not AS simplistic as something like arena brawlers Croixleur Sigma or Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae) - this absolutely gets the job done. Its the modern equivalent of a Streets of Rage-type experience, with vibrant candy colors and magical anime girls: sometimes that's all you need ;)", "timestamp_created": 1492765248,

the other you get by killing certain enemy over and over again it hoes to 50 medals to 999 for the better gear. getting these medals that gives you helpful items which starts to get annyoing to have

Reaching max level doesn't need grinding as long as you tackle the post game content, however, reaching max Lily level does require grinding. My play time as of writing this review is 34h, 2/3rd of that being the Lily grind for each character up to level 9. It sucks out the fun since you can't even pretend that you're doing a \"new\" quest and are just grinding the same stages over and over.\n\nOther than that, the game runs alright, no bugs no glitches no slowdowns, steady 60fps at 1080p with the upscaled Vita graphics that aren't even rendered in 1080p. But it's NepNep, it ain't NepNep if it doesn't look budget. I could swear that all dungeons and models were ripped straight out of the Rebirth series with minor alteration.\n\nSo I guess it's a decent purchase during a sale, but wouldn't recommend it outside of sales because it's really budget and doesn't have a lot of good content.

The whole series is a glorious satire of the competition between Microsoft, Sony, Sega, and Nintendo.

However, what sets this game apart from the rest, is that it's not a turn based game. Instead it's a hack and slash game similar to Senran Kagura (and even features the costume break mechanic of the latter, only not to such an extreme).\n\nPlot wise, the game takes place during a lull in the fighting of the \"Console War\" (yeah...dead serious...this is just the beginning), which regularlly rocks the world of Gameindustri (I warned you). Basically it's not some big fate of the universe story. Rather these two journalists named Dengekiko and Famitsu (Blaitant satires of the Dengeki and Famitsu gaming magazines) are trying to write articles on the four consoles and arrange a series of quests to test the main cast and get a good idea of their performance.\n\nThe game itself is quite fun and enjoyable.

In my opinion, I like how it's more of a hack and slash free roaming styled RPG. Graphics have improved a lot since Re;birth 1 and dialogue has also shown some improvements. Clever character health and CPU mechanics, as you can continue to switch characters at any time you want. Lily ranks have improved and you don't have to buy outfits anymore, the game gives you them to have fun customising the different characters.\n\nCons: However, this game has a massive grinding component to it, and a bit of flaws with its recommended levels during quests. Sometimes, you could be 5+ levels higher than the recommended levels in quests, but enemies will still be able to take you down EASILY (especially if they are able to paralyse you) As you progress through the story, you get new weapons and skills, however, very few of them. \n\nOverall, this game has improved and shown lots of redeeming qualities, especially against Re;birth 1. So, if you're into hack'n'slashes, fanservice (and lots of it), or RPGs, I recommend this, and give this a thumbs up. :)", "timestamp_created": 1470113085, "timestamp_updated": 1470113085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573380351066589355", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24619910": {"recommendationid": "24619910", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960344344", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 234, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1469903450}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a bit afraid of the combat and the quest system, but I am really digging both now.

The game also does away with all the rpg aspects of the previous games sans item equiping-though without item crafting- and basic leveling. Story is also very thread bare, being the shortest of the Hyperdimension games on PC and just sort of putting an enemy there and saying \"oh no, shes invincible, better keep doing the same type of missions over and over again until we have this power to kill her.\" Also, in the fashion of this series, you have seen most of the enemies and all of these levels before.\n\nBut I still recomend it, because if you have played any of the previous games in the series, you know what you are in for if you watch a gameplay trailer. It has the characters you love from this series. It has the self referential and self aware comedy of the series. It has the same enemies and levels from the series.

In this regard, there is only one real winner.  Neptune, in her Purple Heart form, is BY FAR the most competent fighter, enough so that running anyone else is basically pointless, unless you are forced to.  Add to the the fact that the leveling system seems to be based on how well you perform with big combos, Neptune can reach max level very early in the game, when most characters are barely into their teens.\n\nThis game just isn't as entertaining, and I can't recommend it even if it goes on deep sale.

Durr, no***\n\nNow that the biased idiots who love upvoting shitty positive one-liner reviews have accomplished their goal, they can go **** themselves.\n\nThe story to Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Boredom Unleashed is that Dengekiko and Famitsu plan to write articles based on the Goddesses doing monotonous quests with both the CPU's and Candidates deciding to split into two groups to see who can one-up each other for the best featured article. Yup that's it.\n\nThere are 10 characters to choose from; Neptune, Noire, Blanc, Vert, Nepgear, Uni, Rom, Ram, Dengekiko and Famitsu who all surprisingly play differently from one another (besides Rom & Ram). Each character has the usual weak and strong attack expected in every hack n' slash with 3 special skills (out of a choice of 4) to use at their disposal. Later on in the story you'll unlock EXE and Lily specials which break the game even further.\n\nQuests consist of the same garbage like \"Defeat x amount of enemies\", \"Defeat x mid-bosses\", \"Collect x items\". There's at least one irregular quest in every location that will bring something new to the table. Defeating the braindead AI mobs will grant medals which can be used for permanent stat boots and unlocking weapons/accessories for each respective character. \n\nA \"new\" feature introduced in the game is clothing destruction which grants a 50% EXE Drive Gauge Boost. Then of course there's the usual HDD transformations with Uni, Rom and Ram's making an easy game even easier since the three characters mentioned only require the mashing of a single button for victory.\n\nGamindustri Gauntlet is a half-baked Vs mode that's easily forgotten tournament. One completion will unlock the last trump card this snore-fest of a game has to offer while 17 additional completions will grant one access to the most OP accessories.\n\nLast at the top of the **** mountain is Neptral Tower. 50 floors x 5 = 250 floors of grueling pain. Each floor just consists of pounding the same asset recycled enemies from story mode except this time you're stuck with a single team the entire way through. The 50th floor is just the same lackluster final boss battle except this time Compile Heart came up with the genius idea of giving it even more HP, exciting right?\n\nBut wait there's MORE. Oh no, if you thought all that was enough to make you delete the game from your Steam library just wait endure the most painful task of them all, LILY GRINDING. While entirely optional, it IS required for 100% achievement completion and arguably the best feature this game has to offer... Lily rank conversations.\n\nThere you have it. Senran Neptunia: Action Unleashed is worth no one's time unless you're into clothing destruction, waifus, or panty flashing picnics. The barbones combo system is shallow and the customization is a complete joke compared to MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune vs Zombies.

It plays like silk, at a smooth 60 fps, but..that doesn't help ist much when it has less complexity than even dynasty warriors.

It's simply mashing buttons while wishing you could do something else at the same time to speed the process along. \n\nThe clothes tearing feature is..pretty much useless, though I'd suggest getting a nude patch like I did for the jiggle physics the game has to offer. \n\nThe dialogue is generally pretty charming, if you can stand to read through all of it. Like any JRPG, it's a mountain of text upon another mountain of text. The voice acting is decent, be it English, or japanese. \n\nYou can run through the entire game in 8, boring, very wasteful hours, and the game definately isn't worth the full asking price.\n\n..So why does this game still get a positive review from me? Hell if I know. I'm still caught in the charm like anyone else who loves the series. Sure, it was mindless, tedious work. Sure, it wasn't really all that fun..but I'll be damned if I said I wanted to stop, because for some god-only-knows reason, I didn't.

Los controles reaccionan de forma muy suave y es muy f\u00e1cil de jugar, aunque [b]se echa en falta algo de profundidad en el tema de los combos[/b] (ya que son algo simplones).\n\nAdem\u00e1s de los combos, cada personaje podr\u00e1 usar [b]hasta 3 habilidades especiales[/b] (las cuales gastan gastan \"cargas SP\", que pueden recuperarse infligiendo/recibiendo da\u00f1o).

It's right down the alley for old fans of the series and new people who saw it pop up in their recommended list.\n\n[b] Gameplay\t[/b]\nUnlike the previous turn-based combat of the rest of the franchise to this date, Neptunia U takes the hack n' slash route of RPGs. Combat in Neptunia U is extremely satisfying for a few hours, but then kind of loses its novelty after that period of time. Eventually you find a broken combo on a broken CPU, say Blanc, and spam her X+X+X+X+Y+Y combo which absolutely destroys and nothing really happens, not to mention the CPUs and Candidates are nowhere close to being equal in strength, and here's a breakdown of their power.\n\n1. Neptune: She's the original MC of the series. Her X combo whilst in HDD does this insane AOE spin attack that destroys, whilst her non HDD form is simply forward directional attacks. Nothing special.\n2. Noire: One of my favorite characters, she is surprisingly less powerful than I expected. Whilst she can go toe to toe against most enemies, her Y, which is her few AOE wave clear attacks takes a while to set up, making her damage output less that some other characters'.\n3. Blanc: Some people hate on Blanc for having slow attacks, but on the contrary, her mobility combo in HDD of X+X+X+X+Y+Y makes her near untouchable and can deal 4000+ damage a hit at level 35. Blanc, at that point, is absolutely broken.\n4. Vert: One of the most OP characters, her Y combos in the middle of her X combos allows her to dash from place to place, making Vert unhittable.\n5. Nepgear: Her skill set is quite the same as Neptune's in HDD, but in her regular form, her X combo can extend a Y at the end which functions as a dash, much like Vert.\n6. Uni, AKA Skillshot God: Why is Uni called this? Well, all her attacks are very directional. Her Ys are, most of her Xs are, and in HDD, every single attack points at the first direction the first attack goes, especially in her X combo, allowing you to move and kite every single enemy, point the gun at them, and spam. Her Y is also broken AF but takes an insane amount of time to charge up, rendering it useless when she's crowded.\n7. Rom and Ram, AKA Spam Gods: I'm lumping them together due to their similar movesets. Most of their Xs in HDDs are directional, and the Ys are basically spam damage-all-enemies-in-a-huge-cone type attacks.\n8. Dengekiko and Famitsu: Wow, are these 2 journalists underpowered. I mean, I swear nobody uses them unless they have to. Their basics are weak, they have no mobility or surround AOE except for Dengekiko's Ys in combo with Xs or out. \n\nAnd of course, every Neptunia game has some broken item. In Neptunia 1, it was probably the Stamina Band that gave you 5000 extra health, in Neptunia 2 it was the FREE Gehaburn for Nepgear that let you one-shot every monster for at least 30 levels. In this game, it's that Scrambler Drive that allows you to, get this, instantly HDD at the beginning of every game. Couple that with the HDD gained from Costume Break, It essentially allows for each character you bring in to use their BROKEN AF EXE Drive twice. Wow.\n\n[b] Story\t[/b]\nFor all of you long-time fans out there, you all know that Neptunia is a story-centered game. This game is chock full of the standard Neptunia humor. For all of you noobs out there, that includes the boob jokes, [i]RIP Blanc Forever ;([/i], classic 4th wall breaks, which Idea Factory did a great job with, and the general personality of your favorite characters. However, the story is stretched a bit thin. The \"Quests\" in the game are the same thing, with \"Irregular Quests\" being the same thing but with special rules! Wow, originality. Not to mention that the story will only progress with the completion of these Irregular Quests. I was not nearly as engaged by the story in U than by the turn-based combat games, but after all, it's probably harder to time random dialogue sequences in the middle of an X combo, right?\nEven if the story is not as good as the previous ones, It is still good enough to keep me playing, and the humor makes it funny as well.\n\n[b] The Mechanical Bit\t[/b]\nThis section will include graphics, sound, all that stuff.\nGraphics:\nMuch like the rest of the games, the graphics are eh, good enough. The textures have been ripped straight from the other games and so were the enemies. Just look at the Rival Mech and Herobo from Neptunia 1, etc. \nSound:\nThough Idea Factory takes a lot of songs from the first games, like $100 and Nepgear's theme, I don't care, because those songs are great. The opening song is also what I've come to expect from these games, and Idea Factory once again delivers. \nOptimization and Hardware for all of you PC Nerds:\nI run an Nvidia GTX 970, and it works like a charm. 300+ FPS at the most lag-inducing times, and from what I've seen, it has worked on the equivalent of a mac. Good for Idea Factory, making their games playable.\n\nIn Summary: Whether you're a new person to the series, or a hardcore Neptunia fan who's in it for another game, like the rest coming out this summer (Victory II I'm looking at you), these Neps you're getting from this Nep is well worth the Neps spent on this Nep.\n\nNep.\n", "timestamp_created": 1465081627, "timestamp_updated": 1465081627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800604462623596191", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23366172": {"recommendationid": "23366172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146522541", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 234, "playtime_forever": 3276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2256, "last_played": 1616120680}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is more for fans...really dont expect a good hack slash...the fan service is good so well if you are fan of neptuna and have control then go for it... games is very easy (unless you do dlc...that thing is hard cause takes too much time kill) is not really good for replay ...but well is a neptunia", "timestamp_created": 1464978857, "timestamp_updated": 1464978857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509332954883575439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23351037": {"recommendationid": "23351037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117981791", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1075, "last_played": 1472032159}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun battle survival game.

The unlock system is a pure grind and is poorly presented -- once all unlocks for killing a particular enemy are done, there is no indication of this, meaning the player has to constantly check all the progress all the time. Further, while each individual character can be customized, generally there will be the same accessories that you would want equipped all the time, making it just cumberson to repeat the equipping process for all characters (not to mention having to do it again when a better equip is unlocked).\n\nAll in all, while the Neptunia style is generally there, it hardly does enough to warrant playing this game.

It has become something of a trend in recent years for all manner of series to have their own 'Warriors' spin-off.\nWhen it came to Neptunia's hack and slash spin-off, I anticipated something along the lines of the 'Dynasty Warriors: Gundam' series; lots of characters from the Neptunia francise, with the Lily Rank system following along the lines of DW:G3's operator system.\nTo put it simply, I expected to have more than ten characters; I was at least hoping a few Makers would be featured in this game. Perhaps it was naive of me to expect Compile Heart/Idea Factory to actually put some effort into their games, but I was trying to be optimistic about this game.\nAll that said, however, I was not massivly disappointed with this spin-off. The characters all use their Hyperdimension designs and personalities, all the CPUs are given some respect (even the Candidates, who seem to have become the series' chew toys as of late), there's around 10-15 hours of gameplay if you simply plough through it all, and the Lily Rank system was more fleshed out and entertaining than usual, with short voice clips available between all characters as their ranks go up.\nCharacters are hardly balanced, gameplay-wise. Vert is insanly mobile; Uni, Rom and Ram are highly mobile with long range attacks. This makes them more effective for most of the game, while Blanc and Noire are basically useless. Fortunatly, while Purple Heart is not as mobile as Vert, and Purple Sister use melee instead of ranged attacks, the Nep sisters are easily the most powerful characters(as they damn well should be.)\nI do appreciate that the designers bothered to make character designs and movests for Denkiko and Famistu(both of whom were previously Chirper-only characters) however, I was left to wonder why IF and Compa, who do appear in this game, are not playable. Again, this links back into the overall lack of Human characters here, but why put them in the game in the first place if you won't allow me to play as them?\nOverall, it's a decent hack and slash. Just don't expect too much from it, and try and purchase it while it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1463369419, "timestamp_updated": 1463369419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540660381317138672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22973891": {"recommendationid": "22973891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043156328", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1474924107}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyperdimension Neptunia U is an unusually low quality game for the series. If you hadn't already guessed, this game is a Dynasty Warriors-esque game where you need to mow down waves of enemies to win. But the game lacks even the most basic features anyone has come to expect from the Hack and Slash genre. \n\nThe main problem is that the game never tries to do anything more than that. DW and every variation at least has some variation on killing enemies - your objective is rarely just 'Kill 1000 dudes': they're far more often to the effect of capturing areas, defending teammates or killing key enemies to push the battle in your favor in sprawling maps where there's plenty to do. As it turns out being stuck in a claustrophobic space with no reason to do anything other than spam your light attack gets boring real fast.\n\nAnd that's quite the issue. The game never requires you to do anything other than spam one button. Even in the most basic of this genre, considering whether to use a single or multi-target move or expend a special bar is always present. But here, using anything but the patented 'spam x' strategy is horrendously inefficient. You might question the use of efficient in a context like this, but it will be at the forefront of your mind when playing this game. There is an ungodly amount of grinding. If you want to complete this game, you will need to grind. Each. And. Every. Character. There is no catch up mechanic. The only way to level those character you don't want to play but have to is to find yourself a nice long mission with lots of enemies and switch your brain off for a few hours.\n\nIn addition, the game seems to have a hard time conveying itself to the player. There are numerous points which are scarcely explained or expanded upon. Quite often I had found myself in a mission killing hundreds of enemies only to grind to a scrreching halt as only one enemy appeared on the map. In order to complete the mission I had to defeat the last 50 enemies one by one. These were also bosses so they took at least a minute to kill. This turned a five minute mission in a twenty minute mission that was painful to play. Even after searching all over the (very small) map for additional enemies, there was nothing. I refuse to believe the devs were genuinely incompetent enough to consider this sort of thing a mechanic, so I can only assume this was a glitch.\n\nFor some reason there is also no autosave. Maybe in the hopes you'll accidently erase your progress and waste more time?\n\nToo much of this game feels like cheap padding to push the playtime of the game upwards to justify its price tag. Unfortunately the core mechanics are far too barren to even consider it. Ultimately there is no reason to enjoy this game: the graphics are upscaled vita models, the soundtrack is tiny, the gameplay is incredibly boring with zero depth or interesting mechanics and the story is hardly interesting enough to justify the slog. If you're interested in a Hack and Slash, try Dynasty Warriors 8, Pirate Warriors 3 or Hyrule Warriors. All three are far more developed and interesting than this game.", "timestamp_created": 1463223417, "timestamp_updated": 1463223417, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490065217018127441", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22970618": {"recommendationid": "22970618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107465446", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2801, "last_played": 1466156545}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play a Dynasty Warriors game or Hyrule Warriors or Dragon Quest Heroes. Seriously. This game is the definition of mediocrity and monotony. It isn't really bad but there are just flat out better games that are more worth your time. Let me just list the pros and cons to make it simple.\n\n[h1]+Pros[/h1]\n+Typical Neptunia conversations and humor : either a pro or a con based on your tastes\n\n+Just the right length (If you just play the story mode) : The story mode only barely feels like it is getting too drawn out. It feels more average and bland the more you play though.\n\n[h1]-Cons[/h1]\n-SO GRINDY : To finish the extras in this game, you have to grind with every possible character pair and beat the same 50 floors 5 seperate times. I feel like over 20 of my hours are just grinding this stupid tower and trying to get these lily ranks.\n\n-SUPER EASY : Just mash a button to win. Go HDD with Rom and mash the standard attack button. Your HDD gauge will never go down. Trust me on this. This strategy works for most characters. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO THE TOWER. YOU WILL (and I know you will) TURN ON CHEATS TO MAKE IT GO FASTER BUT IT ONLY MAKES IT EASIER AND MORE BORING.\n\n-The mechanics never really change : You unlock very few new skills and the game isn't deep enough to satisfy for the 30 hour grindfest.\n\n-I AM INSANE : I HAVE 100%ED THIS GAME. WHY? I HAVE 100%ED EVERY COMPILE HEART GAME I'VE REALLY PLAYED ON STEAM SO I FEEL OBLIGATED TO. MY LIFE HAS GONE DOWN THE DRAIN. DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. 100% A FUN GAME. 100% A BAD GAME.

The levels are just thrown at you with no real structure as to what is next, making you have to look through them all to find which ones you should be doing.\n\nThe SaHD:  As a riff on the Senran Kagura games, your clothes can get ripped in this game.

A bit hard to begin with, because it's not the same type as the re;birth series, but you learn pretty fast how to control the characters. Since it's a hack'n slash, fights are really fluid. You don't have to wait for your turn, and it surpringly works really well on my computer while I have the lowest configuration (I can easily reach 60 FPS, while I had to stick with 15-20 in Re;Birth 2). Of course, you can only control one character at a time, but again the fluidity helps you get over it, and fights quickly become easy to handle.\n\nSecondly, the characters. Such a pleasure to see again all the CPUs and CPU Candidates, with their usual talks and personalities (I wouldn't have mind seeing more of Blanc's cute persona). And a big plus since the game is FULLY voiced in English. No scene with only Japanese voices or no voices at all, you can enjoy hearing English. I don't mind Japanese voices, but the community was eagerly waiting for something like this.\n\nThirdly, the graphics. It's not meant to be realist, and it's better that way. Mainly because a Neptunia game drawn like The Last of Us or Uncharted 4 would look strange, but also because it keep with the anime environment. And you can really see it improved through the game, with amazingly drawn curves (Not those ones) and shapes, rendering a really pretty world with no angle where there should not be any.\n\nFourthly, the audio. Again, wonderful musics that fits well with the scenes, the environments and the characters. We can hear again some musics from the previous games, as well as a few new ones. And that opening is AMAZING.\n\nYeah, I know, I can't end it without speaking of the main selling point of the game, if you haven't heard about it you're probably going out too much, It's the best idea in the world : Ripping-off clothes when you get hurts too much. With a possibility to unlock unbreakable clothes, easily breakable ones and already ripped-off clothes. BEST. IDEA. EVER. I-it's not like that's what made me buy it or anything... Baka!\n\nJokes aside, I shall give that game an average score of 9.5/10\n\nGameplay :  9/10\nCharacters : 10/10\nGraphics : 9.5/10\nAudio : 10/10\nStory : 9/10\n\nIdea Factory International managed to fully gets the wishes of the fans and combine them in this game, even though it's a tiny bit short.

Those fans won't be disappointed. You can choose from the main CPU's and their candidates (poor candidate-less Vert) as they battle in a Dynasty Warriors-esque spin on the franchise.\n\nSpecial skills are unleashed via a pop-up menu accessed on a button press (controller recommended here), with your SP displayed as little blue pills in your status bar. Each pill represents 1000 SP, and each skill consumes a multiple of 1000 so it's a resource you'll run out of quicky. Fret not, however, as the enemies will often drop Hero Drinks which replenish your HP and restore some vital SP.\n\nYou can choose up to two characters per battle. One character will fight and the other recovering HP in the background, which you can switch at will. All characters have a transformation or 'HDD' mode true to the original games, which vastly increases your stats and even changes your skills in some cases. Use of this mode requires you to fill an 'EXE' guage which fills faster if your character is out of combat.\n\nGetting hit results in damage to whatever outfit you happen to be wearing. This means two separate sets of damage, both for your standard outfit and HDD modes. The exception to this are the two journalists, Dengekiko and Famitsu who use the same outfit for both modes as they don't have a 'true' HDD mode.\n\nDestroying your outfit means taking more damage overall, but heavier hits and more chances to fill the EXE bar, which means more opportunity for unleashing HDD mode. In addition, the EXE bar also grants you a super move which can empty an entire room and demolish boss monsters in mere moments. This can be used in HDD mode as well for a truly devastating attack, though it drains the EXE bar and you will revert back to normal afterwards.\n\nIn addition to the action, there is plenty of voice work the fan favourite VA's from franchise. For me, just listening to their banter is as entertaining as the action itself as they constantly break the 4th wall and make subtle and not-so subtle references to other video game franchises.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend the game. It knows exactly who it's target audience is and gives them what they want. Newcomers to the series might feel a bit lost and won't understand some of the references made (some refer to prior Hyperdimension games) but can enjoy it for what it is.

Details below. Only buy it if you're a Neptunia fan that feels the need to play all the games. If you like this type of combat game, just wait for Senran Kagura since that's the much better original this game is trying to rip off.\n\nThis game does not deserve the high review rating it has. Don't buy this game. I'll start with the positive things about the game, because they run out quick.\n\n1. Game runs at a solid 60 fps and looks decent\n2. The combat is fun for a while. Animations are great, some characters play really smoothly.\n3. The dialogue is still the usual we've come to enjoy\n4. Appearance customization is nice\n\nNow for the bad things, in order of importance:\n\n1. Weaker story/dialogue than the other games. A lot of charm in the Neptunia games comes from the dialogue between characters. The way this game is set up, that happens a lot less frequently. It's just quest after quest after quest and then eventually you'll get something, and the cycle repeats. If the dialogue was good/frequent enough, it would make the game bearable. Unfortunately it isn't.\n\n2. Holy hell is this game grindy. Every quest, no matter what kind of \"twist\" they try to put on it, is the same: kill a bunch of enemies. Some take forever to die, the bosses take forever to spawn, missions take a long time for no reason at all. Achievements are even worse. For example, Neptral Force requires you to play through 50 floors 5 times, since the requirement is to beat all 50 with all 10 characters (it's only 5 times because you can run through it in pairs).\n\n3. The combat gets boring quick. It's fun at first, but you do so much of the same so often you'll eventually get sick of it. It's even worse if you want all the achievements, since that requires you to do \n\n4. Enemies have no variety. They are all exactly the same, you never change your strategy for any of them, they just look different. And the health bars are damn near invisible so you can only tell if you killed something by the death sound which gets annoying when repeated.\n\n5. The game is not hard at all. This makes it feel even more like a chore because since it's so easy, you'd wish it goes by faster, but it doesn't.\n\n6. The quest layout isn't optimal. Ideally, it would list quests by level or quest type. Instead, it separates each quest by map (the maps do not affect gameplay enough to warrant this), making finding level-appropriate quests incredibly annoying.\n\n7. Equipping accessories is annoying. Since in this game you can only send out 2 people at a time, there's no need for items to be limited. That means equipping accessories on one person won't prevent someone else from equippping it. The problem with this is that there's basically no reason for anyone to have different loadouts, yet they do, so it takes like 5 minutes to change everyone to the same loadout.\n\n8. While the game looks decent, it's just upscaled 720p. There's a mod to fix this, but we shouldn't have to install a mod for this sort of thing. Resolution won't go higher than 1080p either.\n\n9. The music is not fitting in the least. Since they're just using tracks from the previous games, sometimes they'll stick an unfitting track on an unfitting map. This is a battle game yet you'll have non-battle music playing all the time, it's oddly distracting.", "timestamp_created": 1462079194, "timestamp_updated": 1462081229, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

need less goddamit! LESS IS MORE! [/h1]\n\nFinally, Neptunia spin-offs are starting to appear on steam. What that means is: \n1. More games for the fans and newcomers.\n2. ...Let's face it you're all here for the animu fanservice, aren't ya?\n\n[b][i] Story [/i][/b]\n\nRight of the bat the game informs you that it's a spin-off and the story is non-canon.\nDespite that the cast is still the same good ol' CPU goddesses and their sisters. They are accompanied by two journalists Dengekiko and Famitsu, and together they try to uncover a new Scoop. Yup, that's pretty much the entire plot.\n\nThe story's quite short, and unless you're playing the game once a week or so, you'll finish it in a jiffy.\n\n[b][i] Gameplay [/i][/b]\n\nAs stated before, this is a spin-off. Instead of a JRPG, NepU is an Action Beat-'em-Up with RPG elements, it's quite fun. The controls are fluid. Characters have special skills, combos, transformations (just like before) , though the amount of combos could have been more varied.\n\nThe game also features the \"Costume Break\" system. It gives the characters a boost in stats... and it's for fanservice purposes too: get hit enough times and your controlled characters will get their costumes ripped to shreds with only a few scraps left to cover the goodies. Depending on whether you like the cutesy characters running around almost naked it's a hit or miss. Luckily the feature can be disabled midgame for those who don't like it.\n\n[b][i] Graphics and Sounds[/i][/b]\n\nThe game retains what is great about the previous Neptunia games - the colorful atmosphere, funky battlemaps to fight in and good looking character and enemy models (though a lot are the same as in the previous games from the franchise).\n\nThe soundtrack is typical Neptunia - Funky, with some 8bit mixed here and there followed by JRPG battle rock themes. I didn't get bored of those. (Some themes reused, but not a lot.) A great plus is that there is a sound gallery for listening to the previous Nep game tunes, great for relistening pleasure.\n\n\n[b][i] Problems?[/i][/b]\n\nA game can't have zero downsides right? Of course. There were reports of crashing, blurry 1080p graphics,sound, controller and performance issues on launch, luckily most of the issues were either fixed, or are easy to fix thanks to the community findings.\n\nAnother little problem that sparked some controversy in community discussions was the Costume Break, and how it looks \"wrong\" on the younger members of the cast (the Goddess' siblings), I can't say which side is right, but it's something to think about, as some parts of the world have very harsh laws regarding this topic.\n\nAnd finally probably the most talked problem - the difficulty. The game is well, too easy. Mobs can swarm you but they attack very rarily and deal insignificant damage, and even then you usually have a partner character that you can switch to. You can equip accessories that lower your stats yes, but that unnatural difficulty raising doesn't feel rewarding at all.\nOf course there are DLCs with harder quests, but by the time you get to them, the main story is finished, and unless you want to play more against one-shot mobs, those quests aren't worth the time.\n\n[b][i]Summary[/i][/b]\n\nNepU - the first Neptunia spin-off on steam started it off strong - a solid different genre game with it's own fickles and trickles. While it has some problems with it's low difficulty, fans of the franchise will enjoy it. And for those who are checking out this franchise just now, go ahead. Though you might want to wait for a discount if you're unsure if it's a worthy buy, though for a casual fun game - I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1461699468, "timestamp_updated": 1461700302,

A port of the Vita game. All characters have light/strong attacks, aerial combos, special attacks (a.k.a SP Skills), and a temporary transformation ability (HDD/CPU mode) which changes up some moves and increases the character's power and survivability. Characters may use a powerful super ability (EXE Drive) once transformed which will revert them to their regular state. You build SP and meter by landing attacks. You usually have to kill everything in an arena to win. You can take two characters into battle and swap between them as necessary. The game encourages you to swap by filling the transformation meter of the inactive character first, then for the active character.\n\nThe playable characters are the CPUs who have CPU Candidates, and the CPU Candidates themselves, plus Famitsu and Dengekiko. Characters gain EXP and level up, increasing their stats. Killing monsters nets you medals for each type of monster (Dogoo, Pixelvader, etc.) which you can trade in for permanent stat boosts, equippable stat items, or weapons. Also, as two characters complete battles, their friendship rank (Lily Rank) goes up, conferring bonuses to each character. You also get costumes, and a sound test mode.\n\nStory's your standard Neptunia fare of \"evil thing appears, go murder it\". The writing is very similar to the main Neptunia games and the characters retain their personalities. Once you finish the main quests, you unlock a tournament mode, and then a 100-floor tower to work up.\n\nThe port has a 60 FPS lock. It will at times slow to below that for a few seconds, usually after many particle effects, or switching windows. The game runs natively at 720p, causing blurry assets, but can run at 1080p with better anti-aliasing using durante's GeDoSaTo program. The options menu is extensive for a port, and can be viewed on the [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_U:_Action_Unleashed]PCGamingWiki[/url]. This is on an i7-2600k with a GTX 660Ti.\n\n[h1]Some Positives[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Characters all control tightly thanks to the decent framerate.\n[*]Tsunako's character art is stellar as always.\n[*]Particle effects are good-looking and not overly taxing.\n[*]Character models are good quality.\n[*]Music is cheery when it needs to be, and omnious when it needs to be.\n[*]Port is rock-steady and well done considering the source.\n[*]Smashing hordes of monsters feels good in a musou-game kind of way.\n[*]Each character's personality comes through in their unique moveset and combat quotes.\n[*]Surprising amount of items to unlock for min/maxing purposes.\n[/list]\n[h1]Some Negatives[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Ranged/Spellcaster characters are extremely overpowered compared to the melee characters due to how hitstun works and how enemies tend to swarm you in melee range. Monsters will likely never touch a ranged character if played properly. It certainly feels bad when you avoid using your favourite character because she's objectively worse.\n[*]The L button centers the camera. The X button is the light attack. L+X activates EXE Drive, nukes the screen, and knocks you into your regular mode. It's a pain.\n[*]L must be held for a second to center the camera. Tapping won't do. This has no place in an action game.\n[*]Two parts of the game are left untranslated, probably because they had no subtitles. The tournament commentary, and the Lily dialogue between characters.\n[*]Tournament mode is a waste of time. The game is clearly not balanced so one-on-one combat ends pretty quickly.\n[*]Speaking of on-on-one combat, sometimes the game ropes you into fighting lone minibosses/bosses. The game is clearly not designed for this.\n[*]One ranged enemy type fire projectiles that will stunlock you into oblivion. There are no recovery i-frames to thwart this.\n[/list]\n[h1]Some Things To Read And Decide For Yourself If You Like[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The localized English is very, very liberal with their translation. If you actually know Japanese you'll probably find yourself sliding a Glock between your teeth during extended cutscenes.\n[*]You will do a lot of the same thing over and over.\n[*]You might not want to let people watch you play this.\n[*]Low skill ceiling. For melee characters, you figure out the optimal combo with the widest area of effect and least hitlag, then enter HDD for the rest of the quest. For ranged/casters, you enter HDD as soon as possible and fire while moving.\n[*]Rom and Ram are basically the same character save minor changes in moveset and the behaviour of their projectiles in HDD. I know they're similar according to the lore but they could have played up Rom's affinity for ice magic and Ram's strength a bit more.\n\nEither way, if you like the characters this is a way to finally see them in action. The combat is decent enough, and smashing monsters with Neps doesn't really get old if you have a good podcast on.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nReminder that Nepgear did nothing wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1461385039, "timestamp_updated": 1461385039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492264419794082642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22578882": {"recommendationid": "22578882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043328878", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1303, "last_played": 1462933254}, "language": "english", "review": "Dynasty Neps: 10/10 for Nepgear spam and soft costumes that... feel nice to the touch...", "timestamp_created": 1461378415, "timestamp_updated": 1461378415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519549190998077393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22549278": {"recommendationid": "22549278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111563882", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3472, "last_played": 1475988111}, "language": "english", "review": "Just got the game, opened game, good music already (Tho I can sense it have some port issues as I need to press Right Click in Menu to exit out)\nAnd also, it's Neptunia games, one of the funniest out there with girls breaking the 4th Wall so constantly that 4th wall doesnt exist in Neptunia games.

In here, you take control of one of the familiar Neptunia characters and fight against huge hordes of monsters and occassionally bosses.\n\nGraphic-wise, the game isn't much different from other Neptunia games already ported to Steam. The textures are a little blurry here and there, but it's nothing too bad. The animations for characters were also redone, and it's fun to watch their different combos.\n\nIn terms of music, it reuses a lot of tracks from the previous games, even including some of the favorites, like old battle themes and nation themes from each game. On top of that, it adds a few of its own amazing battle tracks, most of which playing during different HDD transformations - and all of them are awesome, whether you're talking about Perfect Purple, Black Brave, White Wings, Greedy Green or Eager Editor. They simply have that kick and \"oomph\" to them that makes them so satisfying to hear.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's pretty much what you would expect: you deploy on missions with a tag-team of two characters, defeating monsters, with a clear goal, which is usually \"beat X monsters\" or \"defeat the boss\", with some variations ever now and then. The difference is that you will take on tens or even hundreds of monsters at once, using characters' various abilities, from standard attacks, SP skills, to EXE Drives. You can also activate HDD to gain heightened stats and attack power, as well as a new, upgraded set of combos. You can also freely swap between team members at any given time, with the one in the back row slowly regenerating her health.\nAnother unique or... kind of unique feature is the Costume Break, where if your character takes enough damage, her clothes get ripped up for... fanservice's sake. It also affects your stats, lowering defense but increasing critical hit chance and giving you 50% extra EXE Drive gauge instantly. The presence of this mechanic is honestly not surprising, considering it is Neptunia, and it was also made by Tamsoft, known for their work on even more explicit but similar in nature [i]Senran Kagura[/i] series.\n\nStory-wise, it's not nearly as good as the main series' RPG games. It follows our Goddesses as they are being interviewed by two new playable characters, Dengekiko and Famitsu (rather obviously based on Japanese gaming mags) as they take on a slew of new monster-slaying Quests, with a new emerging threat... which is so shallow that even the characters comment on it being so. While the extra scenes and the fourth-wall-breaking humor is like always top-notch, the story mode only takes about fifteen-twenty hours to complete, and that's not speedrunning it. Also the game is surprisingly easy, mostly due to how the stats scale and how the monsters aren't very mobile, even bosses just following the general \"get close and launch an attack\" schtick... [spoiler]well, at least outside of Gamindustri Gauntlet set to the highest difficulty level, and the Hard Mode DLC missions... and who can forget the final boss of the Neptral Tower being a stupidly-huge damage sponge, extending the fight to insane lengths? Thank God for cheats, even if they suck the challenge out of the game, at least they make it a little less tedious.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]Speaking of said Neptral Tower, being supposedly the final post-game content, it has rather idiosyncratic floor levels, frequently taking between ten seconds and five minutes in completion time, on top of level scaling that is just all over the place. You can have one floor have a reccommended level of 25, then the next having 5, and the one after that 44. On top of all that, to fully clear it, you will have to get all ten playable characters through this, and since you can only have two characters at a time, it'll take you a total of [b]five times[/b] to do.[/spoiler]\n\nThe last nitpicks from me is the fact that the roster of characters isn't balanced very well (shooter characters like Uni are hilariously easy to beat the game with if you know what you're doing), and sometimes even going HDD isn't the best option (Vert loses a lot of mobility and speed when she becomes Green Heart).\nAlso the series suddenly switched from using DirectInput controllers for Re;Birth games to using XInput ones. It's a little annoying on my side but nothing I can't work around easily.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game until at least the general repetitiveness of the post-game content kicked in, but it is admittedly a short experience that definitely will not be appreciated by anyone who isn't already a Nep fan.

You will fight unyielding hordes of enemies simultaneously until the conditions of your current mission are satisfied. Set in a video game consoles inspired world, you will find many enjoyable references to other video games scattered throughout as you play.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe game revolves around controlling one character at time on missions that take place in an arena like field. In most cases an optional second character can be waiting in the wings to take over for the current character if need be. Each mission has a success condition that must be met before the event is allowed to end. Typically, a mission involves killing unending throngs of monsters and often includes a few bosses sprinkled in for good measure. Since you are just one character, you have a number of abilities to help you achieve success. There is the normal attack, which is very effective in its own right, the heavy attack that is generally much more effective than the normal attack but has a drawback. Heavy attack helps to damage your costume each time you use it. Using these two types of attacks together allows you to make powerful combos. There are also special abilities that each character possesses that can really help turn the tide of battle in their favour. Once you have either been damaged enough or have done enough damage, a super powered option (HDD) becomes available. The HDD powered option is something like a new character entering the field.  It shares most of the same abilities as the character that summoned it but all of which are far more powerful than the normal version of them.\n\nA battle damaged costume on a character reduces their defense but increases the rate in which their super power charges up. It\u2019s a trade off but since the super power versions is significantly more powerful, it is generally worth it to let the costume become ruined through the over use of powerful attacks. If you prefer to make the game more challenging there is an unlockable outfit that can\u2019t be damaged thus reducing the rate in which the super power charges. There is also the ability to start the round with the costume already damaged thus making your life more difficult early on as you wait for the super power to charge.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent on missions either doing them for the first time or repeating them to farm medals from the monsters found in that particular mission. Medals are used to unlock new weapons, power ups, and equipment in order to aid you to complete the more difficult missions. You will find yourself grinding away for them to some degree. Some monsters are common enough that you will hit the 999 cap without needing to farm them, others show up less often so you may have to actively hunt them down in old missions. Luckily missions can be completed rather quickly so it isn\u2019t that painful to grind a mission repeatedly. This is especially true if you are supremely overpowered for that particular mission.\n\nThe charming mystery story of Hyperdimension Neptunia U revolves around two Gameindustri Journalists trying to outdo each other by getting the better scoop. They follow the CPUs (Console Patron Units) and CPU Candidates around out in the field trying to get material and images for their respective magazine articles and news reports. If you are a fan of visual novels or other games that put more emphasis on story and less on actual gameplay, Hyperdimension Neptunia U should be right up your alley. The game often finds itself broken off into long conversions taking place among a selection of the ten characters in-between missions. For the most part, the missions themselves really have no impact on the story and are just used as a device to transition between dialogues. There is nothing really wrong with this though as the fully voiced dialogues between the characters are almost always very humourous and fun to listen to. The way the characters interact with each other and have their own playful rivalries and friendships going on makes the game feel alive. There is no real method to impact on the conversations though so if you were to replay the game, you would hear the same dialogues each time. There are no prompts to select a topic or idea for them to discuss. You are really playing more of a passive role during these times.\n\nOverall Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is a game that should satisfy Hyperdimension Neptunia fans as they get to interact with their favourite CPUs again and hear more of their story. Albeit, it is a story set in an alternate dimension and not considered cannon to the rest of the Hyperdimension Neptuna story. For people who like Visual Novels or Arena style Action battle games, Hyperdimension Neptunia U is a great place to get into the Hyperdimension Neptunia universe. There is a lot of story to enjoy without a lot of gameplay/questing getting in the way of it although there is no real way to drive the story yourself. If you are classic JRPG fan you may not like Hyperdimension Neptunia U as much as you would the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth series, which is an excellent series in its own right and you owe it to yourself to check it out. \n\n[list][h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[*]The Hyperdimention Neptunia characters are back in an all new game\n[*]While not as long as the Re;Birth series, U is a very lengthy game\n[*]The characters feel alive, as if you are actually listening into potential real life conversations among friends\n[*]Great Visual effects and accompanying Audio. The characters are all well detailed including some interesting \u201cfan service\u201d thrown in there as well if you are into that sort of thing\n[*]Fully voice acted\n[*]The controls work great for this game. Very fluid and easy to control. Making a combo doesn\u2019t involve memorizing tons of nerve racking key presses in advance\n[*]The idea that costumes can be damaged by the enemies attacks and through wear and tear makes for a more realistic element in the game \n[*]Unlockable content that helps make the game more enjoyable and stretches out gameplay\n[*]Paid DLC are reasonably priced for what they give\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[*]Missions are very repetitive and not overly challenging once you get the hang of them. They feel like they were just thrown in as an afterthought to help break up the story a bit\n[*]There is no story during a mission and the characters frequently repeat the same phrases to each other\n[*]Combat is repetitive\n[*]Since you have little impact to the story yourself, there is no real draw to replay it right away. Since it is a long game, I am perfectly fine with that, but it could be a negative to others who enjoy seeing multiple stories unfold in one game\n[*]Achievements are a real grind fest[/list]\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\n\nDespite the fact combat and missions are repetitive, the mysterious and charming story behind Hyperdimention Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is enough to keep you wanting more. If you are a fan of the Hyperdimention Neptunia series, go for it, you likely won\u2019t regret it. If you are new to the series and a JRPG fan, I\u2019d say start with the Re;Birth series and then get U to enjoy more story related to your new found friends. If you are a fan of Bullet Hell style games where you are massively outnumbered and are fighting to survive, you likely would love U if you equip the forced Level 1 only accessory.

Each of these regions have their own deities (to which they refer as CPUs) that oversee them, along with their candidates.\n\nThese CPUs and CPU Candidates, along with two Gamindustri Journalists, are the playable characters that you can choose to play as in each quest you engage (though there are some quests that restricts which characters you can use).\n\nWhile this take differs heavily from the early ones in the series in terms of game play (as it focuses more on a straight-up action/hack n' slash theme), it carries on the charming, comedic, and quirky story of our heroines.\n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n\n    [*][b]Excellent Art Design[/b] - This factor has always been present in games published/developed by Idea Factory, and that standard is still upheld in producing this one which is impressive to say at the very least. Also, the game has plenty of [i]\"fan-service\"[/i] that is dedicated for their fans with the addition of the [i]\"Costume Break\"[/i] feature.\n\n    [*][b]Fluid Controls[/b] - The game plays absolutely smooth especially when you're using a gamepad. There's also a mapping tool to change the button assignment that fits to your play style.\n\n    [*][b]Great Audio[/b] - From the great game soundtracks up to the impressive voice overs (which is both available in English and Japanese versions), the audio that is featured fits the theme of the game perfectly. You can even chill out and listen to the tracks that is available on the world menu.\n\n    [*][b]Plenty of Contents to Unlock[/b] - There are tons of equipment, quests, and even a new game mode that you can unlock as you progress through, which contributes to the longevity of the game.\n\n[/list] \n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n\n    [*][b]Short and Repetitive[/b] - Unlike the RPG versions of Hyperdimension Neptunia which showcases an average of at least a hundred hours of gameplay for the scope of the whole game, this hack n' slash spin-off could yield a total gameplay time of less than 70 hours to complete and is mostly a one-mode game which is repeated in a succession of quests.  \n\n    [*][b]Inadequate Difficulty Levels[/b] - Honestly, if you look and consider that this game is pointed at casual gamers, the difficulty of the game is perfectly balanced. However, considering the gaming community as a whole, the difficulty level is relatively easy to the extent that I rarely fail an attempt on a quest, even when using characters that are below recommended level.\n\n[/list] \n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Verdict[/b][/u][/h1]\n\nTo make it short, [b]Get it![/b] \n\nFor those who are new to the franchise and is interested in trying the game but is concerned if they should get the other games first, do not worry as this game isn't heavy in terms of story and it is worth the buy. \n\nAnd for the long time fans of the series, getting this is a must.\n\n[quote]If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/]reviews[/url], or follow our curator group at [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GoodGamesGR#curation]Good Games Giveaways & Reviews[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1460310444, "timestamp_updated": 1460599846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822713196277618408", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22343844": {"recommendationid": "22343844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019434872", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1460794653}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll give the short summary first. \nIn case anyone isn't familiar, this isn't a title made by the usual HDN folks, but rather a project farmed out to Tamsoft.

I presume it has solid DirectInput support since the games hail from Sony consoles, but I'm not 100% sure).\n-All quests list their level requirements, so you'll know if you're about to get some much needed stress relief out of colorful monsters or be pounded into mulch.\n\nCons:\n-The writing and humor. I don't know if it's just bad writing or a localization issue from the game being caught in the petticoats of the western nanny-states, but... Based on my experience with the HDN series, this was a big beacon that this was handled by someone else. If you've ever played a Senran Kagura game, it's about on par with that. If you haven't, just pretend that there is no story.\n-I know that character balance isn't very big in hack-n-slash titles, but... There are certain characters that you'll bring out for certain quests and otherwise never touch again.\n-Maybe, I'm just spoiled by the PC ports made by IF and Compile Heart, but... Somehow, the options menu is inferior to what you usually see on Vita or 3DS titles. Yes, you get windowed, fullscreen, and borderless windowed support up to 1080p, but... There's nothing above that, there's no graphical options what's-so-ever, and there isn't even an option to toggle how quickly you want the text to be displayed on the screen and are locked to the slowest pace in existence.\n-My biggest gripe of all, though, is the camera. First of all, it drunkenly swings around, with the options making it far too rigid or much too loose. Also, unlike the other HDN titles I've played, there's no way to zoom the camera out, so I hope that you like having your camera be close enough to your character's head that you may as well be able to reach in and pick bits of dandruff out of their hair.\n\nEdit: Rephrased TL;DR.", "timestamp_created": 1460309609, "timestamp_updated": 1460616532, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22338506": {"recommendationid": "22338506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082995144", "num_games_owned": 20600, "num_reviews": 251, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1460290314}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Half naked females!!!  Check.  Fun Hack and slash action!!! Check.  Having the wife walk in on you while you're playing a game with half naked anime girls using suggestive language and bouncing around on your screen.....  Priceless.. [/b]\n\nWhile I was playing Hyperdimension Action Neptune U, I was quite conflicted, on one hand I was nervous that someone would catch me playing the game.  I'm a full grown adult male but something about playing video games with half naked females prancing about still strikes the teenager in me.  All hot blooded American males have been there, that extra sense [b] Spidey Sense[/b] you get during alone time [b] ahem[/b], your vision becomes 20/20, you could hear a pin drop on a feather mattress, and your eyes fluctuate between the television and the door.  Even though you're totally into what you're doing, like a tiger you prepare, ready to pounce on the remote control and change the station.  The weather channel firmly ready to go on, nobody suspects anything when someone is watching The weather channel..  Unfortunately looking back, I now know.. if you walk in on a surprised teenager, and notice the weather channel on the television, you should fully know something was rising but it wasn't the temperature.\n\nEnough about my teen years, it's time to talk about HANU, a spin off of the popular Hyper dimension series of video games.  The game is chocked full of humor, intrigue, sexual tension and enough half naked females to give Cinemax a run for it's money.  On top of the scantily clad females [b] (no I'm not talking about me Silly)[/b]  the game tells an interesting story, offers up fun combat, a story about rivalry, humiliation, and redemption.  Also it's a major bonus that the developers gave proper time to ensure the lady bits moved and flowed as realistically as possible.  \n\n[h1] The Story[/h1]\n\nThe game takes place in a world known as Gamindustri [b] (Game Industry) [/b] a world protected by divine  females known as CPU's or Console Patron Units... [b](Holy dang, a Central Processing unit, awesome)[/b] and their sisters the CPU candidates.  The game is situated after the previous games in a time of peace..  No major threats in sight boredom begins to reign supreme.  In an attempt to dispel the boredom two of the worlds leading journalist decide to write articles, Dengekiko decides to stick with the CPU's, she wants to write about them completing a series of quest and help bring the Goddesses extra fame and popularity.  \n\nMuch like Dengekiko, the second Journalist Famitsu also wants to write an article about the CPU's but as an added twist she decides to focus on the CPU candidates, thinking that documenting the struggle of the candidates would make a far more interesting article.  Both groups head off to write their article.  Eventually after the rousing success of both ladies articles the news agency decides to have the two Journalist write another article, this time they join with the CPU and CPU candidates to take on a series of quest, the competition to see who can write the best article is on, and we as gamers are the winners because we get to play this amazing game.\n\n[h1] Combat [/h1]\n\nThe combat is a silky smooth hack and slash experience with half naked anime girls.  Special attacks aplenty, and one really explosive attack known as HDD mode, which is essentially when they become super powered versions of themselves typically floating around doing amazing damage while at the same time taking little to no damage.. It's a complete visceral experience which will leave the gamer highly amused, intrigued and wanting more.   The combat is very similar in nature to Dynasty Warrior games, loads of enemies on screen at once, you button mash and watch as your overpowered female heroine slashes and crashes through them like a hot knife through butter..  [b](ok a few of them have ranged attacks as well, so I guess those are like hot pellets through butter)[/b]\n\nHealing is achieved by picking up bottles of potion dropped by enemies, a great strategy for the non exploration stages is leaving the potions alone, killing enemies and retreating to the potions location when you need it.  The enemies also drop coins exclusive to that version of enemy, you can use those coins to unlock special accessories, weapons, or upgrades for the ladies which can be very beneficial during combat.\n\n[h1] Pro's [/h1]\n\nSmooth and fluid combat\nGreat characters\nInteresting enemies\nHumorous non PC dialog \namazing voice acting..\nScores 10 on the fap o meter.\n\n[h1]Con's [/h1]\n\nCan be kind of difficult to understand what's going on at times.\nIf you're a PC bro, you'll hate this game as it appears very sexist\n No Bananas...  [b] just kidding [/b]\n\n[h1] Recommendation [/h1]\n\nHighly recommended game, and pretty amazing, a great addition to the Hyper-dimension series of games.  If you're a fan of half naked ladies [b](who isn't)[/b], err well the half naked ladies part sounds sexist...  If you're a fan of hack and slash combat, humorous stories, and totally outrageous non political correct fun, you should totally grab this game immediately....

The game itself I would highly reccommend especially to people who found the original series too grindy or hard for them to get in to. \n\nFor one there seems to be some compatibility issues with Windows 10, go figure. The game should auto run in compatibility mode for Vista but that means cutscenes run in a small box in the corner of the screen for me. Not terribly horrible as so far the only cutscenes have been the OP and the start up credits. And on top of that running it in windowed mode doesn't work. It just freezes at the OP and you can hear the menu running but can't see it. To fix this I just found my screenshot folder and used that to navigate to turn it back to full screen, because the screenshots show the menu. These problems, while annoying, don't bother me anymore.\nHowever I do have a weird frame rate issue where the frames keep dropping to around 30 and locking there and the game just runs horribly it was meant for 60fps action at half that your characters are in water. It doesn't do this in menus and everything else runs fine its only when i launch up the mission does this happen. Upon testing it seems to be the mobs causing this which for worse computers would make sense, but I can run the game fine at 60 with no issues. But every so often i'll launch the game up and this will happen. Sometimes just letting the game engine run with it will fix it, other times closing and going to do something else, for me it was pay Rebirth 1, and then going back fixed it. This keeps happening and while i'm happy its not permanent, it is a mild annoyance. \n\nLong story short, don't buy this game expecting a flawless port with no issues. Buy it because it's a great game that's tons of fun and be prepared to face these issues.", "timestamp_created": 1460227984, "timestamp_updated": 1460228476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507735610008239746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22308695": {"recommendationid": "22308695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030081025", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1460669675}, "language": "english", "review": "diet senran kagura", "timestamp_created": 1460157061, "timestamp_updated": 1529863181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22299870": {"recommendationid": "22299870", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994041478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1460137526}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a bit like a Dynasty Warriors-lite, but with kawaii anime grills and clothes shredding.\n\nObviously it's a must buy as far as I'm concerned.", "timestamp_created": 1460120833, "timestamp_updated": 1460120833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560767054557800293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22287683": {"recommendationid": "22287683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043927425", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1874, "last_played": 1460913062}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that kept me company while I was laying in bed dealing with cramps so 8 hours non-stop with this game sure did the trick because I ended up with a massive headache and burning eyes. \n\nA real great game to play while in bed with a controller.", "timestamp_created": 1460049451, "timestamp_updated": 1460049451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22282023": {"recommendationid": "22282023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056103384", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1466559553}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is azmazing !", "timestamp_created": 1460022144, "timestamp_updated": 1460022144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22281619": {"recommendationid": "22281619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095667843", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1473275509}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, since i bough this game i always play the game every time", "timestamp_created": 1460018993, "timestamp_updated": 1460018993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22280160": {"recommendationid": "22280160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043979353", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1516439542}, "language": "english", "review": "Relatively average hack and slash game with decent visuals.

If you are not a fan of this franchise and want to give it a try, then you should start with [url= store.steampowered.com/app/282900/] Neptunia Re;Birth 1[/url]\n\n[h1]Introducing[/h1]\n\n[b]Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed[/b] is the 3rd spinoff of the Neptunia franchise by Idea Factory, and the 4th game to be ported to PC. Unlike the Re;Birth games, this game is action-based (hence the title), so expect some confusions at first. I recommend you change the voice to Japanese to enjoy this game to the fullest.\n\n[h1]GOOD elements of this game:[/h1]\n\n- [b]Fresh and humourous atmosphere[/b]. Fortunately, this game retains a fresh and humourous appearance, which made the mainline Neptunia games. You will encounter many references, jokes, and 4th wall breaking moments in various characters, conversations, and even in-battle dialogues.\n- [b]Smooth, fast-paced hack n' slash gameplay[/b]. This is a Musou-type action game, so expect a gameplay similar to Sengan Kagura or Dynasty Warrior. Also this is a very good way to release stress.\n- [b]Pretty good music and sountracks[/b]. Personally I really liked the opening theme of the game (Venus no Harmonia - Asami Imai). The soundtracks include many tracks from the previous Neptunia games, and are pretty appropriate for an action game like this one.\n- [b]Excellent optimization[/b]. Recently, there are many bad PC ports by Japanese companies (Such as Naruto Storm 4, Tales of Symphonia, and Disgaea). However, IFI did a very appreciable work of optimizing this game, making it runs fluently even on a 5-year-old PC. Basically, if your PC can play Rebirth 1, then it can max this out at ease.\n- [b]Some best-looking badges that I've ever seen.[/b]\n\n[h1]AVERAGE or DEBATABLE elements of this game:[/h1]\n\n- [b]Many fanservice elements [/b]. Personally, I have no problem with fanservice, especially when it appears in a spinoff. Anyway, you can turn it off completely after a few battles, if you don't want it.\n- [b]Pretty limited customization[/b]. For each character, there are about 3 weapons, 3 skills, a few costumes and a fixed combo set; which is nowhere as near as mainline Neptunia games.\n- [b]No mouse support, and you cannot change music in battle[/b]\n\n[h1]BAD elements of this game:[/h1]\n\n- [b]The plot is half-baked[/b]. I'm not gonna spoil anything here. This is generally a problem for spinoffs, but I'm sure they can do it better.\n- [b]Quests can be repetitive and grindy[/b] after a long time of playing. For this problem, I advise that you should do a quest several times with different characters, and shouldn't play it too much in a day.\n- [b]Textures and sprites are extremely low-res[/b]. You'll notice this immediately if you've played Re;Birth 3, or if you trigger a Costume Break with Vert.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\n   Despite having a weak plot and a flawed quest system, [i] Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed[/i] still contains many humour layers, plus a smooth and flexible combat system that any Neptunia fans out there will enjoy.

del resto de la saga ahora se vuelve un hack'n slash donde puedes controlar al personaje libremente y atacar cuando quieras dentro del juego podremos usar a un total de 10 personajes las cuales son las cpu's, las candidatas y otros 2 personajes invitados al juego, el modo historia es practicamente pasar algunas quest o mejor dicho todas aunque esta algo corta como ya habia dicho pues la historia termina cuando el jugador como mucho acumulo un 72% de las quest y las que vienen despues son un extra aunque algunas son un reto dificil pero otras no lo son tanto(supongo estos extras es para que el jugador complete el resto que le falta para llegar a 100%) pero no son obligatorios pues la historia ya la habras acabado en este punto y solo podras repetir las quest que quieras ya sea para subir de nivel o conseguir medallas de monstruos para desbloquear cosas como atributos(puntos de salud, ataque, defensa, etc), objetos para equiparselos a los personajes e incluso armas para algun personaje en especifico y que mas digo de este juego pues que es un juego digamos okay pues tiene sus pros y contras una pro que le veo fue el nuevo sistema de combate que paso de los rpg a un autentico hack'n slash pero una contra muy fuerte es que a pesar de que sea un hack'n slash la falta de combos es muy obvia en este titulo pues los personajes no saben realizar muchos tipos de ataques diferentes y casi todo el rato te la pasaras haciendo el mismo movimiento una y otra vez aunque algunos personajes tienen movimientos algo variados hay algunos que casi no hacen movimientos diferentes pero bueno se agradece el intento de los desarrolladores y que mas digo de este juego pues por los graficos tan bien para la epoca aunque no tan perfectos por asi decirlo algun extra pues nada este es mi

At the begining can notice that menu have new options - reaction and narrator voices which belong to characters when we doing something. For example we want to change volume level or just start new game. There is nothing special but still nice to hear something more than \u201cpip\u201d when we choose option. \n\nLike i said before Hyperdimension Neptunia U have different battle system but still in well-known to us dungeons. In main games we had to deal with turn based system. In case of this product is just hack and slash with hundred enemies.\n\nCompared to previous titles we finally got full English dubbing without any shortages. I mean every dialogoue have dubbing. In Re:Birth\u2019s that was really irritating. I like reading but sometimes you just can\u2019t hear reactions.\n\nBut what about Fanservice? Except fight and dialogs must be something more, yes? Of course. When your character receive damage there's a chance for destroy her clothes.

It gets old real fast, though, seeing their clothes get ripped up, so you can equip your characters with unbreakable versions of their costumes. I did that for a while because I just wanted to kill cute things as cute girls, but then I was missing out on getting the boosts afforded from costume breaks, so I put the breakable ones back on.\n\nI don't know what to say about this game. It's short, it's goofy, and just like the original Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1, I fucking can't stand the \"story\" and pointless dialogue. The story isn't remotely compelling and that's obviously not the point, but nothing about it makes you curious about what will happen next. Thankfully the dialogue is kept shorter than usual, and for Hyperdimension standards, that's all I can ever ask for because in the other game, they just took waaaaaaaay too long to finish talking about...I can't remember. That's how bad the dialogue is.\n\nI can see how others might find the 4th wall breaking funny and the cuteness exchange, but it's not for me. \n\nThe first half of the game you're given an over abundance of quests to complete and you go at them at your own leisure. Which ones to do first and which characters to do them with. The only reason why I played for 10 hours is because I do like the hack n slash battle system, and I was worried at first about it being too easy of a mash fest, but there are times where you do get challenged. Not so much that you sweat bullets, but enough to grab your attention back from basically mentally checking out to start paying attention to your spacing amongst the hordes of enemies.\n\nYeah, that's what this game is good for. If you want mindless fun, play it. Turn your brain off and mash buttons and occassionally use the dodge button to get out of \"tough\" spots.\n\nThe sound bothers me, by the way. The music is fine and the voice acting is okay, but god the monster voices are annoying, and thankfully you can turn them off. But then all you're left with his hollow sound effects that don't make your attacks feel impactful despite of the physical force they cause in pushing enemies away. Then there's one real time cutscene that isn't in visual novel form and the mech monster was just silent. I had to close the game and turn it back on with allowing monster voices just to hear pointless stereotypical bad guy monologue.\n\nI DON'T KNOW! I don't know why I ever bother with the Neptunia games. They're like one night stands that feel like a good idea at the time, but you regret it afterward. Great action, but nothing fulfilling to the mind or heart. I got this game for $20 because I did enjoy the visuals and the gameplay, but it left a lot to be desired. This game is good for $5, I would say, not at all worth the full price.\n\nI would only gladly, without regret, pay full price for the next Action Release game IF the developers do the following:\n\n- Have some more structure in tackling quests. Maybe one quest unlocks another rather than having a long list of them to do.\n- Quest variety. How sad is it that I felt relief in a fetch quest of picking up treasure chests that didn't really give me any real items?\n- The FIRST quest felt good in that you had to beat one part of the map to advance to the next, so why didn't the rest of the quests have that?! It was bland, but way better than being confined to ONE battle arena per quest with only a tiny option to move to another part of it.\n- Rebirth 1 was fun for the customization of your characters and dungeons from item collection and crafting. That would be nice to put into this hack n slash spin off.\n- Also, it wouldn't hurt to have more SP skills so it felt meaningful to go to the set up options and equip your characters with the moves you want instead of simply just having 3 per character.\n- Combos should have more customization. Throughout the whole game you have the exact same combos from when you start. I think it'd be better if you earned more moves as you leveled up or even had the option, like in Rebirth 1, to customize different moves you want to have in each link of a combo chain.\n- New monsters. PLEASE! Keep the ones they already have that's fine, but have some monsters that are the same size as the characters and more intimidating than a blob with a happy face. Killing those don't feel satisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't play Hyperdimesion Neptunia games for what they are, I play them for what they could be: solid JRPG's with enough depth that you'd really need a long rope to get out of the deep chasm of customization. But that's not what these games are. They are a shallow waste of time and I have voluntarily wasted my time this week playing a game that has the potential to be so much more.", "timestamp_created": 1459282119, "timestamp_updated": 1459282119, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522989928722381592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22128437": {"recommendationid": "22128437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023066784", "num_games_owned": 1176, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 726, "last_played": 1572274492}, "language": "english", "review": "So this game is quite interesting. I'm quite happy with this game for a few reasons and I will explain them below.\n\nThis game was ported from the PS Vita and was developed by the same guys who brought us the Senran Kagura series. I LOVE the Senran Kagura series for the simplistic gameplay and the very well written story (Oh alright it's about the B00bs too) so how does this game hold up?\n\nThe story is simple. Two characters by the name of Dengekiko (Based on Dengeki magazines) and Famitsu (Based on Weekly Famitsu magazines) are having a battle for best reporter and best articles on the Gamindustri CPUs and CPU candidates. Soon something fishy happens and it's up to the total of Ten characters to find out what's wrong and save Gamindustri... again.\n\nWith writing this simplistic, it has to have a lot of charm, right? Yes. The charm of the characters shines as usual. The humor is well done as you hear lots of funny lines from the characters. Often making video game references and jokes. If you're firmiliar with the humor in Nep Nep games, you'll enjoy it even here.\n\n\n\nNow onto the gameplay. Is it good? Well yeah. It's pretty good but it definitely still has that Portable Game feel with short, easy to do quests and repetitive actions. Not that it's a bad thing. This simplicity makes the game PERFECT for quick play without struggle. Not overly hard and satisfying when you get a long combo string going.  Each character handling pretty well despite a couple handling the exact same way.\n\nEach quest can be taken on with a solo character or a two person team. Taking on quests with two characters is better for leveling up more characters faster. Each character also has an \"HDD\" form or Super mode to put it simply. This enhances the character by making them faster, stronger and gives them a different move set to play around with.\n\nIn the gameplay, there's enough here to keep you entertained.\n\n\n\nThe visuals are nothing too special but they get the job done with the bright and colorful look the Nep Nep games are known for. The characters look nice with the bright colors and all of them are adorable. Not too much to talk about here so we can just move on.\n\n\n\nThe sound is pretty okay with the voice acting and music being the best parts. The characters are fun to listen to and the soundtrack is well done even if quite a lot of the music is from the past Nep Nep games. This game also supports English and Japanese dubbing so there's a lot to love.\n\n\n\nOh yeah. There's a costume break system in this game! If you take enough damage, the character's clothes will rip and it's pretty revealing. Not a bad feature if you're into that sort of thing and yes, there is an option to give them clothes that don't break but it needs to be unlocked. \n\n\nOverall, this is a good game and there's enough content to play for quite a while. If you're into the gameplay style of Senran Kagura and like the humor of the other Nep Nep games, This game is something you'll enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1459275398, "timestamp_updated": 1459275398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22124976": {"recommendationid": "22124976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070885490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1573332775}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game with a lot of action!

However, I cannot recommend this game as a Neptunia fan, an action game fan, a musou game fan, and even a grinding fan. The fact that this game has a 95% positive score on Steam is almost insulting, and here's why.\n\nJust have three raw uncut gameplay videos showing off six of ten playable characters in three random missions;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwBAzvirSY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgMwTVZPe2I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC6kmOt8Lj8\n\nAfter seeing even 10 seconds of ANY of these videos you will have seen literally the entire gameplay breadth. EVERY mission is like this and every character plays like this from the start to the end. (Blanc and Famitsu just spam an SP skill, Vert and Dengekiko spam B+Y)\n\nAnother disappointing aspect is the costume break system, where you would assume there would be a large selection of costumes to highlight this. Unfortunately you're only met with major disappointment when you realize you only have access to everyone's default costume, two recolors of the default costume, and the swimsuit. (you only get the base costume and one recolor in HDD Megami form!) Not even the maid outfits for the Candidates from Re:Birth 1 make an appearance.\n\nTo top the disappointment cake off, after spending way too much time Spamming X, sometimes Y through the main \"story\" you are rewarded with a 50-floor tower that's just the same thing that you have to clear with every character. This game is a hell of a grind for the 100% achievement, stretching about 2 hours of actual gameplay time to around 20+ and that is no joke. (that's 20+ hours of getting in a corner and pressing X or Y until the mission is over!)\n\nIf you're looking for a musou game on PC that actually has some gameplay in it, get Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. It goes on sale often enough and that game gave me around 100 hours of gameplay for only slightly more than I spent on this.

What's with the \"U\" in the title then?\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia U Action Unleashed will bring you action indeed. It's a \"warriors\" type game where you have hordes of enemies on screen and you do flashy combos and constant button mashing (X/Square/U are your friends). With ten characters to play as each with their own style of attacking, you'll want to try out many combinations and wipe the enemies clean. Of course in the original nature of the \"warriors\" game, it can get very repetitive. However, there is one thing I'm sure you're all here for that will actually wanna make you keep playing and not mind the repetitive nature, the Costume Break.\nYep, when your girls lose clothing, you'll end up wanting to keep playing because you're now given fanservice all the way to the end of the quest. Most of the enemies may look tame and not attack often, but they can still gang up in numbers and possibly land a ton of hits enough to rip your clothes apart (and in cheap cases for tough missions, knock you down faster than you can register as many X buttons). In fact, you can even find pre-torn clothes for the girls to wear and bam, instant fanservice from start to finish. Enjoy the jiggle physics as well!\nU probably are thinking right now, is this game worth it? Well, it's a pretty short and easy game that can be completed in 12-15 hours depending on your skills. There are a couple of post game content to keep you playing a bit longer and I appreciate that at least. And well, it's Neptunia, there's humour in the rather simplistic slice-of-life-esque story. But in the end, I still liked this game. Once you get used to the repetitive nature, you will find fun action and glorious fanservice to be had.

Gud stuff. But seriously though.\n\nTL;DR Quickshot\n\nPros: \n\n+Nep and company now in fast pace combat\n+Peformance compared to the rebirth series a huge improvement. I never saw a single frame drop that wasn't my fault, or something I was running in the background.\n+Fluid controls, solid movement.\n+Still good, totally, totally wholesome nep humor as with its previous games. \n+Oh yeah, clothes break now. Panties and bras galore. Good stuff. \n\nCons:\n\n-No real native support for gamepad, which the game was CLEARLY designed for. I mean, what the hell devs? It can still support controllers but don't expect a full support like it was on the PS VITA. \n\n- 8-Directional movement instead of full analog movement, this should not be a limitation with today's software and hardware progress, at all. \n\n-Game may be a bit grindy for the normal gamer but for anyone who's played JRPGS worth their salt, grinding's fairly normal and is not as bad as it looks.\n\n-Action and gameplay maybe repetitive but refer to my previous con remark above ^\n\n-No real new soundtracks other than maybe one or two at best. \n\n- The damaged clothing was kind of cool at first but it got annoying with further gameplay, luckily there is an option down the line, via events to remove this feature. Gotta say though... finally seeing Vert's panties was pretty good.\n\n-The game sometimes trips out and has issue of deciding to use the gamepad directional buttons or the directional keys on the keyboard. Rather annoying. It appears during Neptral Towers, postgame and namely during selecting and coniguring keybindings/gamepad. \n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n? No Iframes when you get wailed on, so be mindful of slow attacks in a huge mob. You may die very, very quick.\n? Main/Side Quest indication is rather unclear so you may unknowingly miss out on an achievement because you went to the next chapter. \n? Did not experience AMD related problems as it ran flawlessly with no issues at all.\n? Rather poor imbalance moves for the nep girls so you may end up using just a few characters, rather than all of them. \n\n\nFinal Score: 8/10.  Great solid nep game, as the rebirth and these are. Sadly still plagued with controller support problems. May get a bit repetitive for some people but that's just fine with me. \n", "timestamp_created": 1459153246, "timestamp_updated": 1459153246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22100329": {"recommendationid": "22100329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123853619", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1530366886}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, the game itself only use 2GB, and also pretty much good on low spec gaming notebook, so yeah... \nHere's checklist before buying :\n\nYou like Nep series?

I didn't check the frames, but they looked to be above 30 fps.\n-Nep-class comedic and 4th-wall-breaking dialogue are still here\n-Cast of characters includes the CPUs, the Candidates, and the Journalists\n-Locations in the game are also from locations in the canon series\n-Movement and fighting in combat are pretty smooth\n-Moves also look pretty detailed and are fun to pull off\n-Movesets of each character are definitely varied, to certain extent even Nepgear's with some moves borrowed from Neptune\n-HDD of each characters pretty much turns them into a new character (special attacks remain pretty much the same, but superpowered)\n-Final attacks include EXE Drive and Lily Specials -- Flashy and outright devastating attacks.\n-The breakable clothing system:\nThe system makes for an interesting factor in combat. Every time you pull off a Heavy Attack, your clothing takes a bit of damage everytime. When your clothing gets broken, your defense weakens, but you're stronger + your EXE Gauge gets a boost so you can turn into HDD faster. I found that to be pretty cool.\n\n[b]NepU Cons & Neutral Points:[/b]\n-Enemy AI is dumb:\nNo, really. They take a huuuge windup time before they attack. Adding onto that...\n-No invincibility frames after taking a hit + paralysis effect after getting hit enough:\nWhen a group of enemies surround you, they usually all windup at the same time. When they attack at the same time, you get stunlocked and 90% of the time, your clothing breaks. Some occasions also happen where you outright die to stunlocking.\n-Repetitivity (to be expected, but I actually didn't find it to get boring enough for me to stop playing)\n-The grind:\nHonestly, I've only beaten the main game as of the writing of this review, but even then the grind wasn't too bad for levelling and for some of the medals. Still, I can see it being very annoying to do in an already repetitive game.\n-The irregular quests:\nI didn't find these to be that fun, honestly. They're basically quests with hidden conditions, but can be revealed through either your own sleuthing in the mission or by abandoning the quest and entering a conversation with the CPUs. They were a change of pace, but I'd rather stick to the regular formula.\n-Character balancing:\nWell, some characters are obviously better than others in the game. (even though I found all of them to be enjoyable) This might be a bit bad to some who like playing their CPU waifu, but I'd put it at a neutral point as all of them can handle their own weight in fighting.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b]\nIn terms of numbers, I'd give it an 7.75/10. To me, that's a mediocre score that isn't too good, but isn't too bad, either.\nOverall? I'd recommend it to a certain extent. At full price, the game isn't worth it. At a big sale, like -40% or higher, it's probably worth it.

Your mileage may vary, I play all the other nep games on a keyboard.\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL: Quirks that might sway some[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Lack of Depth in mechanics[/b]\nNeptunia has never been the series for super in-depth complicated mechanics. It really shows. This sounds like a HUGE minus... However, It's not that bad and simple games have their place in this world. It's all about managing your expectations. It's more of a relaxing buttonmasher instead of a precise, execution heavy action RPG.\n[*] [b]8 Directional Controls even with a controller[/b]\n(There's auto aim/locking for normal attacks, so it's not as bad as it sounds)\n[*] [b]No target locking. The WASD/Control Stick is the only way to choose your target to swing at[/b]\n[*] [b]You must win a couple quests before you unlock unbreakable outfits[/b]\nOutside of \"Hard\" outfits there's no way to disable costume break.\n[*] [b]The steam backgrounds/emotes aren't that fantastic this time around[/b]\nYour mileage will vary. This game features a Common Noire background, which is the first in the entire series. Also it's the only place to craft your Dengekiko and Famitsu background.\n[*] [b]There are built in cheats in this game[/b]\n[*] [b]No real New Game Plus[/b]\n[*] [b]Very limited invulnerability frames^[/b]\n[*] [b]Decent speedgame, if you're into speedrunning[/b]\n[spoiler]Quite a bit of the game is skipped by clipping through barriers, might not appeal to all[/spoiler]\n[*] [b]General lack of hard challenges[/b]\nThere are about 3 quests I'd consider calling them \"hard\", and two of them are DLC. I define hard as having to play thoughtfully, methodologically and exercise some degree of caution. Obviously your mileage will vary. The quests: [spoiler]Famitsu Solo Postgame, Lv99 Neptune/Dengekiko DLC Mission, Lv99 Uni/Blanc DLC Mission[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n^Tip: The most relaible way to get iFrames when you're hit in decreasing order: Switch Partner, Transform, SP/EXE Skill, Dash\nAlmost none of these work if you're knocked airborne, so watch out for that. (All the CPUs can dash once midair in HDD though)\n\n[h1]BAD: These problems are likely to trigger people[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Port issues on AMD[/b]\nI don't have any experience on this since all nep ports have run perfectly on my machine, but some AMD users are clearly experiencing problems with this port. Consult a better source for more details. If you're having FPS issues, ensure it's not runing on your integrated graphics card.\n[*] [b]Weak Character Balance[/b]\nThere aren't many examples of beat-em-ups with good character balance, and this is definitely not one of them.\nIt's less broken than it seems (everyone's HDD is very strong), but there is still a clear distinction between weak/situational characters and very well rounded ones.\n[*] [b]Missable Achievements[/b]\nThis one got me pretty hard. I just spent the 8 hours before this review getting 100% quest completion on a new file because I missed a few on my first playthrough and was locked out of 100%. Since there's no New Game Plus, this is a double whammy.\n[*] [b]Stat inbalance: Clear Dump Stat[/b]\nIt's very obvious which stat is the best once you hit midgame, after you play the game for a bit you'll know which stat to aim for in your equipment selection and which stats are largely irrelevant once you adjust your playstyle for it. [spoiler]Going full glass cannon is the go-to way to play this game, since dead enemies can't kill/interrupt you. See also the next section[/spoiler]\n[*] [b]Snowballing Mechanics: Interruption[/b]\nThis is related to dump stats, but basically both enemies and you can interrupt each other indefinitely. This means that getting hit leads to next to instant death (partially thanks to lack of iFrames).

And here's the thing: The interruption on bosses is dependent on [spoiler]the damage you do.

Closest comparison of this game is probably Dynasty Warriors - but simplier. You are put into the arena, you fight hundreds of mobs, and occassional (mini) boss. Let's break it down into points:\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] Satisfying.\nEven through you don't have that many combos, and abillities are just 2 buttons + animation, it looks very satisfying (who doesn't love 20+ numbers on screen wih 5 and more digits, while everything explodes and your character flies around?). \nIt is easy to master too! I got handle of it in 2 battles. 10 characters also give you some variety in gameplay.\n\n[b]Music:[/b] Hyping up\nJust entering the title screen made me love soundtrack of this game. It hypes you up a lot, and fits gameplay.\nMy personal favorites are surely: [One, two, three] and the title screen one.\n\n[b]Performance:[/b] Great port\nSo, I play on my crappy laptop with i3 and an old Nvidia 520m, and I am hanging around 60FPS most of the time. Drops only happen when I get my camera behind a barrier, or if I stream the game via Steam streaming to my friends (drops to 30fps - game speed slows down, instead of skipping frames).\n\n[b]Visuals:[/b]\nWell, some pictures are kinda blurry, which might be port's fault, but aside of that, game is very colorful.\n\n[b]Controls:[/b]\nI did already touch this in gameplay, but I gotta say, this game is totaly fine with a keyboard. Only problem I often have is a camera (I just don't touch it outside of reset camera button). Button mapping can be a pain at first, but after you learn keys,  it's easy. It is surely better with controler, but as someone who doesn't have one, I am glad I can play with my keyboard.\n\n[b]Others:[/b]\n- Storyline is same as you would expect from other Neptunia titles - Not really super serious, funny dialogue, likable characters.\n- Game also has a lots of Fan Service, which might be a pro or a con, depends on you. Anyway, cloth tearing can be disabled when your characters hits.. lvl 20 i think? You just need a \"hard\" outfit. Althrough it will remove a boost from teared clothes.\n- Also, game is full of reused assets (ASSets har har) you might know from Re;birth 1 or 2... but hey, they made a spin off out of it, and it is fun to play, so I have no problem with that.\n- Quests... well there could use some variety. Most of the time its just \"Kill X monsters\" or \"Kill a boss\" (which means you have to kill X monsters to spawn him). \"Collect an item\" is another \"Kill a boss\", but without \"Kill X monsters\". \n\n\nOverall its a very fun game and a great port with nice to look at combat.

The game was meant for a controller and not much work was put into the thought of keyboard (& mouse) play.\n\nOne piece of trouble with the actual game is that you're practically going through the same dungeon each and every time with a goalset barely different from the last. \"Clear condition\" for a \"quest\" may be to kill 300some enemies or find the exit but it all just comes down to \"go here and kill what you see\" with barely any form of thought into actually doing so, and that's the entire game up to the final boss and its \"end-game\" content.\nThere are a teeny few bit of combos from the melee characters (which having a minute number itself isn't helpful for this kind of game) but the three ranged ones have far less and when they transform it doesn't take much effort to obliterate everything and win harmless since you can keep floating around and shooting while keeping the loads of enemies stunned. The transformations are supposed to be temporary but all the ranged characters can go by transformed for the duration of an entire run because of how much of a mob they can keep hitting.\nWith the look of how practically all of the recycled enemies have always been throughout the series most of 'em don't exactly give off that threatening look so I didn't get a whole lot of fun out of wailing on loads of plush toy look-a-likes. They eventually hit pretty hard but the repetition still kicks in when doing the same task over and over again. \nYou're free to choose which dungeon you go to. Entering and completing \"NEW\" dungeons eventually progresses the story, which itself I found was very underwhelming & short, at least in comparison to its RPG counterparts.\n\nHitting the level cap doesn't take much work especially if going through the \"end-game\" content. Lily rank returns in this game and obviously increases for the partners you choose to go in a dungeon together and as usual the higher the rank with said characters the more benefits they get when paired up. Trying to maximize Lily ranks however proves to be more work though than leveling.\nSupposedly with different Lily ranks per character you can press whatever button or key in the Lily rank menu and the selected pair will engage in small dialogue. If you've got the English dubbing off and can't understand Japanese, there aren't any subtitles to help for that since the dialogue itself is on-the-spot unlike the cutscenes that at least give you an idea of what they're saying if not something completely different because of the localization.\nApparently you can't pause during those VN cutscenes and can't rewatch them if you accidentally skipped 'em unless you've got a previous save in hand for the occassion.\n\nSo it's a badly localized, bare-bones action Nep game without a whole actual lot of Neps at least to give me a proper time with the addition of the usual repetition but with relatively more poor gameplay that more-or-less entices with characters being stripped when hit a lot, which in itself eventually becomes a bore. You can apparently be rewarded with clothing that doesn't break when equipped in case you get tired of the stripping and/or if you're a prude.", "timestamp_created": 1458980223, "timestamp_updated": 1461719499, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599652886390686035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22058226": {"recommendationid": "22058226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133698420", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1052, "last_played": 1550787332}, "language": "english", "review": "Things To Remember before the Review: I've played all 3 rebirths, but not finnished them yet.

So,.... Yay!!!^^\n\nThe game itself feels quite polished for a Neptunia game, but it's also shorter and less \"complex\" than the previous titles. \nVisuals are ok, most 3D assets were recycled from Rebirth1/2/3 anyway (the \"HD\"-textures, models and animations are \"of course\" even older), a quite convenient \"running gag\" with the Neptunia series. \nSomehow the effects during fights look a bit nicer than in Victory.\nMaybe they sacrificed a couple more minutes of their precious time to tweak the shaders, or maybe the game simply runs really well with the current Nvidia drivers. Who knows, and who cares.\n\nThe game goes really easy on my hardware, my primary GTX970 doesn't even bother to power up beyond P2 state and gives me constant 60 fps at 20-30% load, while my second 970 sleeps through all the action that is unleashed. CPU load is even less noteworthy. So, while the first \"rebirth\" tried to hog more resources than it deserved, this port seems to be far better optimised and will probably run smoothly on many laptops and older desktop rigs.\n\nI use a XBoneOne controller, which is imo the best input device for games of this series, but mouse support seems to be further improved as well. ( by which I mean precision and input lag, you still have to manually edit the config file and add your desired key bindings, so a gamepad is still the way to go )\n\nThe rest is simply what you'd expect from a Neptunia game. Nerdy japanese humor, parodies and game references, lots of fanservice and yuri subtext,.. and of course the characters don't just occasionally break the fourth wall, they once more tear it down right from the start.  \n\nSo, yeah... it's a Neptunia game, which means it's as charming as it is flawed.\nA bit simpler and faster paced than the other games of the series, but basicly   moar  Nep Nep .\n\nAnd like any Neptunia/ Idea Factory game this title is also rediculously overpriced.\nI picked it up for 17\u20ac (-40% promotion offer), which imo should be the regular price. \nMaybe even a bit less.\nNeptunia games are fun and entertaining with well written cute waifus, that's why we still buy them.\nBut even if you can create halfway decent sequels by simply writing new dialogue and recycling 99% of the 3D assets, \nneither does it mean that you should, nor that such a garage kit game build is worth half the price of a AAA title.\n\nSo yes, buy it, it's a fun game like the other Neptunia titles, but buy it when it's on sale for half or less.\nEven if it's not about the money because you're super rich or whatever, be patient and do it for the statement^^.", "timestamp_created": 1458930213, "timestamp_updated": 1458931136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527031898498535156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22047225": {"recommendationid": "22047225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074552049", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1458929070}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Dynasty Warriors + Senran Kagura with one big problem, or two.\nMany problems actually.

Look up some things on the game and thought it looked really fun, so I bought it.\nFrom my understanding, this series is an RPG series set to kinda make fun of the gaming industry, and contains many subtle-and not so subtle-nods to things (i.e characters named Famitsu and Dengekiko) and such, and, well..\n\nwao\n\nSo, what I really liked about this game is the fluent combat and the extremely colorful visuals, as well as the pretty cool characters (my fav character is probably Neptune, but my fav character to play as is Famitsu). The voice acting is pretty good, the dialogue and such is entertaining, the music is pretty cool and I like the change of tone when you transform into your HDD mode, and overall the game is quite fun to play. There's some pretty good character customization for each character and all characters except for Famitsu and Dengekiko start with 2-3 different outfit colors & hair colors for their normal and HDD forms, but you gain more weapons and such over time of playing.\n\nBut there are quite a few things that I absolutely hated about this game or just really didn't like; I feel like the sound design is absolutely terrible sometimes, most characters don't feel like they do much to enemies - like you're wacking things with nerf swords (with the exception of Dengekiko, Famitsu, and Blanc), some special attacks don't have sound effects or sound bland and boring even though they look flashy and cool af, and sometimes the enemies are a pain in the ass. There've been multiple occasions where I'd get trapped in a circle of enemies that relentlessly obliterate both my characters in seconds without any hope of escaping. Also, sometimes it feels like the characters are really unbalanced, like how ranged characters transformed into their HDD mode are pretty much untouchable in most occasions. There isn't much of a story, but from what I've gathered, the main series has a much more involved story than this spin-off. One more thing, the combos feel a little strict and you won't find yourself straying from the same combos sometimes. Oh yeah, and there's a weird slow down when your framerate drops under 60FPS (don't worry, the game is reltatively easy to run, just run on lower resolution and/or windowed mode)\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nPros:\n-Fun combat\n-Pretty visuals & flashy attacks and skills\n-Cool and relatively interesting characters\n-Pretty good music\n-Alright character customization\n-Interesting dialogue\n-Easy to run on lower-end computers (for me at least and I can barely run Tera and Skyrim)\n-( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nCons:\n-Awful sound design\n-Weird speed drop with framerate drop sometimes\n-Sometimes frustrating enemies\n-Meh story\n-Kinda unbalanced\n\nOverall, I feel this was one of the best games on steam that I've bought in quite a while.", "timestamp_created": 1458885074, "timestamp_updated": 1458885074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58245617151260376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22034547": {"recommendationid": "22034547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078674774", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1460169821}, "language": "english", "review": "Costume Break \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1458873836, "timestamp_updated": 1458873836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22034364": {"recommendationid": "22034364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085528039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1464642551}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely not like the other installments of this series but I found it enjoyable with the, as usual, hilarious dialogue.

This is a not a Dynasty Warriors/Senran Kagura game with a Hyperdimension Neptunia paintjob, but more of the heart of Hyperdimension with the gameplay of the former implanted. I've never played Dynasty Warriors, but from some quick googling it's about being cartoonishly overpowered and taking out hoards of goarmless enemies, but takes the lead of Senran and keeps you going instead of running back and forth. Oh, and if they get hit theit clothes tear off, that also came from Senran. Of course I'm a sucker for costume degradation, sexualized or not. I love that they kept everything very light, the jokes come so fast one of them had to be pointed out by a character in the game. Having said all that; I'm now going to say that there seems to be a good chance this game will crash on you, its already happened to me 5 times in 67 minutes of play, though don't try to divine an average, it's been totally random.

\"advanced\" nep mechanics like finding items, remakes, stellas dungeon and disc creation.\n\nDispite losing a lot the main game itself is very fun but it isn't super difficult, its very easy to not get hit due to the always included invincible dodge roll and invincible skill use, but it still a fun experience if you just enjoy the nep style and animations, both are done very well and tamsoft did a good job styling nep attacks into this faster form.\n\nAlso if the game is too easy just make sure to do super high leveled content really early in the game because that is really fun and very possible.\n\nThe story is incredibly short and thus the main game is incredibly short but the game tries to offer expansive endgame content instead of super engaging storyline, including a \"endless\" dungeon and a 1v1 arena.\n\nNow the bad, IF are porting these games as is, so the localisation wont change from PSP to PC, so this was localised by a guy from NISA and has a large sum of completely changed lines most of these changed jokes just dont land for seemingly a lot of people.\n\nPlaying through all of the steam released neps so far with no actual japanese knowledge I could still gauge what some conversations were trying to do and how different the localisation took them, this game I couldn't get anything, lots of very obvious butchers of any meaning and completely headflipping of jokes, like changing a kids show theme joke where Ram is being very cute into a barbarian blanc show joke, which blanc doesn't follow up because it doesn't exist in the script.\n\nThis is the first nep localisation I have disliked so strongly, I recomend to turn japanese voices on and listen to the weird stuff that im sure Tamsoft had a ball making these voice actors say, dispite if you dont

want this game.\n\nYou will like this game if:\n-You were/are a fan of the hyperdimension neptunia series\n-You like Dynasty warriors/ Hyrule warriors eseque gameplay\n-You aren't looking for a particularly in depth story\n-You want to turn your brain off, bash some trash mobs and listen to the BGM\n-Idk, maybe your just here for the fanservice, which is literally just canned stripping animations and less clothing\n\nYou will not like this game if:\n-You are looking for a game that has any sort of replayability or multiple endings(only has one ending)\n-You are looking for a game that is long-lasting or has varied gameplay (game lasts about 14hours if you do all of the side missions, around 8 if you just bum rush the main story)\n-You are looking for a good hack-n-slash game. Its an average hack-n-slash game with a plethora of colors and like a hundred enemies on the screen at any given time\n-You are looking for a challenging video game. You could probably beat this game whilst playing tetris.\n\nAlright, now on to the actual reveiw, which  will include more specifics on what the game does, how it is similar and differnt to the main game series, writing style, and other random gripes and praises. Warning: Word soup ahead\n\nReview\nFirst off, the main allure of every hyperdimension neptunia game is the characters, as they are fairly quirky and funny takes on various sterotypes and are generally quite funny. This game... it seems to have forgotten part of that, as eveything that makes the characters who they are is dulled out a little bit presumably because there is less dialouge to work with, meaning the character's individual personalities are shown 75% less and instead is replaced by inter-character interactions... Which would be great if only there was, i don't know, an actual REASON for the characters to interact? like a conflict of interest? or literally anything other than a random string of jokes, compliments and backhanded insults? A huge part of what made following the character development in the main games was the fact that they were faced by a tangible conflict in the form of other characters and subsequently overcame that and became friends/ tentative allies. This game has none of that and instead mostly replaces it with proof of character relation, which basically means the games spends a lot of time talking about how the characters interact with each other, but in a very one-directional way. so yeah thats my veiw on the overall writing style and no, i'm not going to comment on the fact that some of the lines are literally just super-cringeworthy memes. Moving on, the next thing i found intruiging is how they modifyed all of the assets from the main game( everything from game mechanics to maps) and how some of it was good, some of it just weird. The good part is that they made all of the various stats streamlined AF so you dont really have to think to hard about your strategy for hitting things, as well as the way the various meters(SP and EXE) are made easy to manage in a 3d fast-paced game enviroment. I also really like how they did the menus: if i needed to check something, it took like 3 clicks tops. Now the weird parts  are the map implementation and the enemy aggro mechanic. The maps are pretty much copy-paste from the main games, except they added barriers that basicly just railroad you down a single path, which would be fine if these maps served as awesome arenas, but they dont(in fact in some cases you wonder how in the world your supposed to fight in such cramped spaces). However, this problem is partially alleviated due to the inclusion of a few actual arena levels with lots of space, which i thought were the most enjoyable levels. Second flaw is kinda minor in that the enemy aggro ranges dont work right half the time, they suffer from the same problem the enemies in the main series did in that if you do anything but walk in a straight line they lose sight of you and just sit there for like a whole 5 seconds before noticing you again. Again, minor problem that only really presents itself if you try and kite a group for a mass wipeout. Next up, character imbalance, which i realize has existed in the past games and directly corellated with the characters confidence/skillset(which was awesome by the way) but it just doesn't mesh well in the genre because you cant have the party protect the weak character anymore, they are at the mercy of stun-locks and crazy high dps and there isn't shit you can do about it. For example, Rom and Ram are made as glass cannons in terms of stats... except that every other character is a fucking railgun in comparison, complete with reinforced metal plating. This differentiation leads to an unavoidable gap in how fun it is to play one character(the OP one) vs the other(the weaksause character), and thats a problem beacuse the game requires you to use every character every now and then. Next on the chopping block: the story. The fucking \"story\". want me to sum it up for you? [spoiler]You go and fight a big mech. The end[/spoiler]. If you didn't read that spoiler, then just take my word for it: It is more threadbare then the characters after the \"outfit break\" which is a problem because, as I pose at the begining of this giant fucking text wall, this game is about character, but also what the characters do and how they do it. Also, there are points in the writing were it uses taletale signs of leadup, like characters worrying about something hyper-specific or various off-handed would-be foreshadowing, and then does nothing with it and just sort of moves on. Anyways, my next point is the items and equipment system, aka kill stuff and get stuff. Yeah, it does away with the JRPG shop system in the main game and instead uses a medal system where you kill monsters and unlock gear in unlimited supply for all characters. The pro to this is, as mentioned before, stats become easy to manage. The bad part is that customization is narrowed down to which cosmetic outfit your character wears beacause the stat items uprade super linear-like, \"A is better than B in every way\" style. Overall, i feel like the system could  have been a lot more fleshed out, but at least it works(i guess). Finally, the moment you probably would be waiting for if you haven't left already: The combat and challenge. So, as you probably read on the store page, your clothes are not that of Geralt of Rivia whose silken cloth can witstand dragonfire. No, instead they will eventually rip and tear, resulting in fanservice, and(if your me) increased crit rate, EXE drive increase and increased damage recieved. Know how many characters fighting style this fits like a glove? All but 2, those being Rom and Ram, because they have low health and high base crit rate to begin with. This means that the game is mechanicly encouraging you to lose your clothes as it were, and gives you bigger numbers when you follow along, which i guess is to be expected of a mechanic of this variety. BUT this mechanic actually create a weird problem in that it locks the player into an aggressive playstyle because it is so disproportiontly rewarded. As a direct result, the already repetitive gameplay that is dynasty warriors punchy punchy is made even more one-dimensional due to the fact that you pretty much have to play it out in the same style everytime. Maybe this isn't a problem for you because your attack plan is always aggro, but many people like to play hack and slash cautiously, setting up for big efficent mass wipes by kiting and getting out of the way and turning into a damage sponge. Ok, now that that word pudding is done, time for me to talk about the challenge of the game. Basiclly, unless you equip that one item that makes you weak as paper  or go into a quest that is a much higher level, the game hands you victory for free.\n\nThat concludes this reveiw.

Hopefully in future games, they'll make more appearances. \n\nI think if Action Unleashed was more similar to Phantasy Star Universe then the game could have been amazing, but unfortunately it isn't.

If you're fan of hack n slash genre but don't know Neptunia, there are most likely better options out there. That's not to say that this one is bad though. If you don't know Hyperdimension Neptunia this is bad game to start the series - the story somewhat assumes you know the characters already. It's much better to play Re;birth 1 instead.\n\nThe later part is aimed mostly to HDN fans.\n\nOn positives - In this game the good neptunia humor is still out there. The hack n slash mechanics are relaxing, albeit not too demanding, and the characters are distinct enough with their playstyles. I really enjoyed new additions to the roster - Dengekiko and Famitsu. Both are really cute and entertaining. I also love attention to small details in this game - like secondary characters comments during combat, lily rank dialogues, or even small coments the characters make when they are chosen or withdrawn for quests. I'm not really fan of fanservicey stuff, but I love the embarassed faces some characters make then, like Famitsu. It's adorable in it's own way.\n\nOn negatives - while jokes are there, there aren't too much of them, because story is really sparse. Re;birth counterparts are much more rich in plot (THAT plot as well). In addition Fanservicey stuff went a little too far with Rom and Ram. It's not that much of the problem though, as there are unbreakable clothes to equip. Still cringed for a moment. I'm not CFW Trick :( The balance is also not really there - some characters have much stronger combos and control than other ones. But all characters work well, so it's similar to RB games where basically any party worked. Game also lags at times, especially in snow stage for me or at beginning of the quest. Which is weird given my rather high-end PC. There is also an issue of sound - \"Boss of DOS\" track plays to often, and monster sounds gets annoying after short while. Hopefully they can be turned off while keeping godess' (and journalists) voices. And last but not least.... LILY RANKS. Thanks satan for reminding me times of korean grinder MMOs where leveling pace of 0,7% per hour was normal.\n\nTo sum up...\n\nPositives:\n+Good old Neptunia wit\n+Dengekiko and Famitsu\n+Fun hack n slash mechanics\n+Diverse cast\n+Funny enjoyable small dialogues thrown here and there (lily ranks, secondary character comments, character select comments)\n\n+/- Quite heavy on fanservice (but it can be \"turned off\" by wearing ubreakable clothes so it's not the big issue for those who don't like it)\n\nNegatives:\n-Lackluster, sparse story\n-Rom and Ram cloth breaking.... come on IF we're not CFW Trick in disguise :<\n-Characters aren't really balanced\n-Some technical issues - rare lagging\n-Annoying monsters' sound effects and repetitive \"Boss of DOS\" track\n-Lily rank grind\n\nTo me as HDN fan it's solid 7,5/10 game. It's not as good as RB counterparts, but the fun is still there, and if you like Hyperdimension Neptunia games, you'll most likely like this one as well. If you don't know HDN, you should definitely check out Re;birth 1!\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nDecent Neptunia entry, not as good as Re;birth counterparts but enjoyable enough.\n\n7,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1458690634, "timestamp_updated": 1458690792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584212779998779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21991356": {"recommendationid": "21991356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036764760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1452, "last_played": 1471323423}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like how Metal Gear Rising is to the Metal Gear Solid Francise; an unexpected spinoff you didn't know you wanted until you played it.

It was originally released for the PS Vita.\n\nThe story is that Gamindustri is in a very peaceful state, so two journalists called Dengekiko and Famitsu (Based off real magazines in Japan) ask the CPUs and CPU candidates to do some quests that they planned to get a good story going. Afterwards, the gang just completes more and more quests for the journalists, but there's been a rapid increase in quests, and everything is not what it seems.\n\nThe story obviously isn't as rich or deep as the main series, but it still has a plentiful amount of cutscenes and the writing is still solid. However, it isn't a huge chunk of the game like the mainstream titles. Fans of the series will be pleased with it, even if it is a little shallow. Due to the game's simple plot and gameplay, you won't find anything too interesting to write home about. At least the character interactions are still as good as ever.\n\nPlus, the English dub is 100% voiced acted; there are no missing voices in any cutscenes, unlike the Re;birth series. (If that's your preference.)\n\n\n\nYou can choose from 10 characters: The CPUs, the Candidates, Dengekiko and Famitsu. Each of them play a bit differently, and all have their own stats. For example, Uni has a rifle so she's most effective at mid-range and building her special ability, while Neptune does quick but weak melee attacks. It's mostly melee oriented, excluding Uni, Rom, and Ram. The character's melee attacks are different though; some of them hit hard but can't string combos very well, and some can do the opposite. Everyone has the same run speed. There's also equipment that the characters can equip, adding or taking away certain stats like defense and SP. You earn these by killing a certain number of a certain enemy.\n\nRelated to all that stuff, there's a feature called \"Costume Break\" (Yes, this is where the fanservice comes in). If you take enough damage, your character's clothes will almost completely rip apart. What that does is that you're prone to taking more damage. However, you do more damage, so it's actually a risk vs. reward kinda thing. If you like or hate Costume Break, you can get variations of clothes that will affect this by leveling your characters up. There's unbreakable clothes that never trigger the break, easy to rip clothes that'll trigger break very easily, and pre-torn clothes to where you're immediately in Costume Break.\n\n\n\nGameplay is pretty different as you might of guessed. It's something like Dynasty Warriors if you wanna make a comparison. You can bring along 2 characters or go solo, and they fight one at a time. You're able to switch your character at any time unless they're KO'd, and the character in the back will regenerate HP. You have light attacks, heavy attacks, and special moves, and of course you can string together light and heavy attacks. Everybody has special attacks, and they take up either 1, 2, or 3 SP bars. You build up SP by simply attacking enemies. So because it's a Neptunia game, everyone can transform into their HDD counterparts, which upgrades all your stats and gives you superior attacks. (You'll also get all your clothes back if you were previously in Costume Break) You have an \"EXE Drive\" meter which builds as you attack enemies; this is how you go HDD. The character currently not being used will build EXE much faster than the one fighting. This is really all I can say about the gameplay, it is rather shallow sadly. Luckily, it's a lot of fun to slash down dozens of enemies at once, and if you're a fan of hack n' slash or want some dumb but frantic action, this is definitely for you.\n\nThe quests are where you'll choose which missions to do. They all carry a \"recommended level\" that your character should be, and some of them require 2 specific characters to use. The actual objectives are usually very simple. You either kill the boss enemy, kill a certain number of enemies, find a specific item, or locate an exit. There really isn't much variety to the missions, and they're all fairly simple. There are certain quests that don't have an objective, called an Irregular Quest. You simply hop into the mission and figure out what to do. (The description provides a hint)\n\n\n\nAfter you beat the story, you unlock various things, including cheats, extra quests to complete, what's called \"The Gamindustri Gauntlet\" where it's a tournament style type of game mode where all the characters face off against one another in a 1v1 battle. You can pick whoever you want to play as and put the characters in whateve order you like. (You can even have HDD counterparts as separate characters.) If you win, you will win some new cheats and accessories that the characters can wear.\n\n\nSo anyway, Neptunia U is a pretty fun Hack N' Slash that just provides stupid fun in killing tons of enemies with a story that'll satisfy Neptunia fans enough. I recommend picking it up on a sale.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1458663223, "timestamp_updated": 1458726668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759601175785064697", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21984317": {"recommendationid": "21984317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250813438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1458658698}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Hack'n'Slash games and this one looked bananas (and inexpensive compared to the others on Steam, like the Warriors franchise).

Sorta like the Dynasty Warriors games in which you fight hoards of weak enemies and then take on a stronger boss enemy. You know the deal. Lots of combos and special attacks. Has the HDD mode from the other games and ultimate attacks which are very nice to look at. There are a lot of extras as well like items to unlock, music mode, a pause menu that lets you rotate and zoom the camera to get that ideal screenshot of the action. Just an enjoyable experience all around.\n\nI am not even super into the series myself. Didn't even finish the first game even. But I did like the characters and the VN sections. I just could not get into the combat and slow pace of the game. Specifically the weird positioning in combat and the grinding. But this game kept all the good stuff and got rid of the boring combat! Luckily this is just a spinoff that can be enjoyed on its own. So if you want a little anime hack and slash action go ahead and check this out. It has fully voiced VN sections and Fun combat.\n\nNegatives would be the lack of graphics options. This is a Vita port though so it shouldn't be too hard to run or anything. But it would have been nice to have the basic graphics options for a PC game. I had another negative but I forgot what it is. I will edit later if I remember.\n\nSide note. The clothes tearing isn't such a big deal. Some people may be put off by it though. There is a way to get rid of it but you have to get beat up a few times before you unlock the unbreakable outfit. I don't even really notice it myself. You get the little splash when it happens then its business as usual.

But wait! This time it's a Hack'n'Slash ARPG instead of the traditional RPGs that Neptunia players are so accustomed to. So... How is Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed?\n\nFirst things first, the gameplay is rather smooth with natural combos - this is coming from a player who is absolutely trash at action games and prefers to stick to turn-based RPGs, so little issue there. The game runs rather well, even without a high-end setup, though some may find the graphics lacking as compared to other Neptunia titles.\n\nThe aim of the game is to select up to two characters from the roster (CPUs, Candidates as well as 2 new characters) and slash your way through hordes of familiar Neptunia foes. By performing combos, the EXE gauge fills up, eventually enabling the use of HDD, which transforms the character and boosts their stats and granting new combos. That said, this system is simple but rather robust. Another \"unique\" aspect of HDU is the addition of \"Costume Break\", which is basically  a system that reduces characters' clothing as they get hit. Less clothing results in a loss of defense but offensive stats increase. Seems somewhat unnecessary, but hey. It is what it is -.^*\n\nCustomization is similar to the older titles, bringing back some of the costumes from previous Neptunia games. More of a just-for-fun aspect that enables you to make your Neptunia Goddesses look the way you like them. Weapons and Accessories can be swapped out, so theoretically it's possible to challenge yourself considering the games' difficulty isn't all that high (especially compared to the grind factor in previous turn-based RPG titles). But this is a Neptunia game, these games aren't all that hard anyway.\n\nStill the same old RPG x Visual Novel we all know and love however, with a storyline that seems much quirkier than the traditional games, but still filled with fourth wall breaking and Nepnep style humor nontheless. Always fun to read through (plus, as usual, Japanese voices are included if you so desire).\n\nOnly issues so far are some minor gameplay elements including difficulty. Overall a fun title for Neptunia fans, so long as you don't hate ARPGs or dislike the Costume Break mechanic.", "timestamp_created": 1458611418, "timestamp_updated": 1485069765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4992867112159729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21974760": {"recommendationid": "21974760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196245774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1497759755}, "language": "english", "review": "Undressing game, power up through costume break.", "timestamp_created": 1458610692, "timestamp_updated": 1458610692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540827035903930664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21974674": {"recommendationid": "21974674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268928535", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1508873920}, "language": "english", "review": "like hack n' slashers? like fanservice? then get this game! also, despite what the recommended requirements for playing this game, this game runs smoothly on the minimum requirements, with some minor slowdowns here and there.", "timestamp_created": 1458610308, "timestamp_updated": 1458610308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496093928813934326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21974508": {"recommendationid": "21974508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107803433", "num_games_owned": 1044, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1505170921}, "language": "spanish", "review": "11/10 - will nep nep again", "timestamp_created": 1458609432, "timestamp_updated": 1458609432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21974385": {"recommendationid": "21974385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055915632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1607589601}, "language": "english", "review": "breaK Cosume to see daym boobs ! 10/10-IGN", "timestamp_created": 1458608748, "timestamp_updated": 1458608748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496093928813934326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21974254": {"recommendationid": "21974254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043455159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1458795610}, "language": "english", "review": "Completed this game on my VITA.

Alongside Compile Heart's most popular RPG series, Idea Factory has commissioned the assistance of various developers, in order to produce spin-offs. It seems like every year, two or more Neptunia games are being released. Are we heading towards complete global saturation? It's too soon to tell. For now, let's look at the first spin-off to hit Steam: [i]Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed[/i]. In the interest of sanity, I'm shortening the title to [i]NepU[/i] for the remainder of the review.\n\n[i]NepU[/i] is by Tamsoft, the same developer responsible for the [i]Onechanbara[/i] and [i]Senran Kagura[/i] franchises. Those games are known for their fast-paced hack & slash action... among other things, but let's not get side-tracked just yet. Anyway, the plot of this game follows Famitsu and Dengikiko, two rival gaming-magazine writers looking for the next big story. Since Gamindustri revolves around the actions of the CPUs as well as the CPU Candidates, you can guess where this is going. Neptunia and company team up to complete quests and slash hundreds upon thousands of monsters.\n\nFans of [i]Musou[/i]-styled games will feel right at home upon starting this one. Each quest consists of a small arena where monsters constantly spawn. By pressing the X and Y buttons, Nep & the gang perform a dizzying array of moves to decimate these hordes. There are also special attacks as well as HDD transformations for that touch of variety. For most quests, it's best to form a tag-team. Each of the 10 playable characters can team up, so if nothing else, you have Nepgear for backup in case Neptune takes a dirtnap. Your mission is usually some variation of \"kill everything\", but sometimes there can be hidden objectives or mid-boss battles. The heroines also level-up and earn monster-medals, which can boost stats and unlock equipment. \n\nSince this is a Neptunia game and it is by Tamsoft, a little somethin' somethin' is provided for the fans. You know what I'm talking about right? Fan-service. Unlike most videogames, clothes are not immune to damage. Depending on the severity of the attack, the ladies can get stripped to their skivvies. This affects HDD forms as well. The loss of clothes can result in more damage, for you as well as the enemy. Visually, getting stripped affects some characters more than others. For Vert's HDD form, her attire changes from \"leaves little to the imagination\" to \"Who needs imagination?\" In case all of this makes you uncomfortable, damage-immune clothing can be easily acquired. \n\nOverall I think that the combat is fun, but also not very deep. This can be attributed to the lack of difficulty. While the monsters can hit pretty hard, in most circumstances, they'll never get the chance to attack. The ladies of Gamindustri are usually too powerful to be threatened by these pitiful creatures. Their moves have a lot of range, and monsters are easily stunned. When the ladies are transformed, whatever semblance of a sliver of threat that the monsters had slips away. If a quest is giving you trouble, it's probably because you're attempting something that is too high a level. Unfortunately, the level of difficulty never really achieves the right balance. As with the Neptunia RPGs, the challenge of the post-game is in dealing with monsters that have mountains of HP, and are capable of killing level 99 heroines in a couple hits. It might be best to approach this portion of the game with a \"don't get hit\" mindset. There are a couple accessories that trade survivalability for increased damage output. Dodging projectiles and other attacks is pretty satisfying, but for the most part, you'll be too busy crushing everything to notice.\n\nAlongside the lack of challenge is the absence of conflict. Unlike the Console Industry, everyone in Gamindustri gets along like chocolate and pretzels. Didn't the first Neptunia RPG start off with the CPUs fighting to the death? I know they're all friends now, but shouldn't some attempts have been made to introduce a rivalry in NepU that goes beyond mild teasing? In the [i]Onechanbara[/i] and [i]Senran Kagura[/i] games, you might cut through a lot of mindless zombies and kunoichi, but you also have to contend with rivals. These opponents have abilities that are on par with your own. Aside from an optional and underutilized bonus mode, there aren't any instances where the CPUs and Candidates fight each other. \n\nThis to me is the perfect example of a missed opportunity. I've played and enjoyed the three Re;Birth RPGs, and while they're all pretty easy, their storylines feel \"earned\". The characters in these games might have wacky personalities and form-fitting attire, but they also run into problems, argue, and even fight each other. Eventually they rise up to the challenge and defeat the villains that have troubled them throughout their adventure. [i]NepU[/i] doesn't have any real adversaries, and the big bad boss is only fought twice, in two very lop-sided battles. There isn't even a lame excuse for the heroines to fight each other. Even if it was something petty like Noire accusing Blanc for stealing her quests, it would make for a more interesting story. Naturally, this would translate into a more dynamic game, especially if you had to adopt a second style of fighting, in order to deal with rivals. Perhaps these opponents could have monsters under their control, and... well you get the idea. \n\nThe PC port is fantastic. Support for a plethora of resolutions and 60 fps? This game's got them. If you're looking for crashes or major bugs, you'll have to look elsewhere. The load-times are also far better than in the Vita version. I suppose that's to be expected, but it's welcome all the same. While not specifically related to the port, I really appreciate that all of the skits are voiced in English. This wasn't the case for the Re;Birth games, and I found myself defaulting to the Japanese voices, because the silence was irritating.\n\nIn conclusion, [i]NepU[/i] succeeds if you're looking for something different from the Neptunia universe. There are some hilarious moments, and the process of gaining levels and slaughtering monsters is dumb fun. However, this game just isn't designed to remain compelling for a long period of time. Other hack & slash titles, including those by Tamsoft, offer far more depth and content. While this game is just a spin-off, I sincerely believe that more could have been done with it. Even die-hard followers of the Nep-Nep faith should take caution before plunging into this amusing but shallow diversion. \n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1458579758, "timestamp_updated": 1460279089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 381, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904419362545013428", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1285, "total_negative": 149, "total_reviews": 1434}, "cursors": {"AoJwu5uIzdMCc/rlUw==": "Thu Nov 23 16:25:01 2023"}}
