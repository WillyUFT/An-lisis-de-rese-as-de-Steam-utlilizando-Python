It's a really fun game with a surprisingly deep story, I had lots of fun with it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMost of the game is about exploration, you'll usually have a linear path to follow but there are parts where you'll be relatively free to explore before proceeding. New mechanics will be introduced as you go, such as being able to collect items or interact with NPCs. There are also some chase sequences and stealth sections to add some challenge.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game uses 3D graphics, the models look good and the sceneries are great, but the cat has a shabby outline (which is supposedly its fur) that I thought was a visual bug at first, it took me a while to get used to it, but it's not a big deal.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThere's nothing memorable about the soundtrack other than the cute melodies Morusque plays for you when you find his music sheets. The sound effects on the other hand are really great.\n\n[h1]Price[/h1]\nEven though the content is good, the game is too short for its price, so maybe it's better to buy it when it's on sale.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nThe game is pretty straight foward and requires only basic exploration skills, there are some puzzles but they are usually simple and solved during exploration. The chase sequences and stealth sections are arguably the most challenging parts of the game, but still, they aren't that hard, so I'd say this is a relatively easy game.\n\n[h1]Duration[/h1]\nMuch shorter than I expected it to be.

There are only two exceptions, the first one is the \"I Am Speed\", in which you just have to speedrun the game, I've got it on my first try, but I almost didn't make it in time even though I was rushing the game as much as I could, so you really need to be fast, and the second one is the \"Can't Cat-ch Me\", which is one of those highly RNG dependent achievements.\n\n[h1]Problems[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Even though this is supposedly an exploration game, its closed world and linear story make the exploration part kinda limited.\n\n[*]As stated earlier, it's much shorter than one would expect it to be.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1700703160, "timestamp_updated": 1700703160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567099571228027344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151210656": {"recommendationid": "151210656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042440803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 875, "last_played": 1672498839}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, wholesome and entertaining game.\nAlso, cats.", "timestamp_created": 1700703091, "timestamp_updated": 1700703091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151199838": {"recommendationid": "151199838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359686328", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 291, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1700657629}, "language": "english", "review": "Her yerin b\u00fcy\u00fck g\u00f6zlerle kapl\u0131 olan b\u00f6l\u00fcme gelinceye kadar stres atmak i\u00e7in oynuyordum o b\u00f6l\u00fcme gelince kolu ekrana f\u0131rlatt\u0131m.", "timestamp_created": 1700698777, "timestamp_updated": 1700698777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151198772": {"recommendationid": "151198772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210563220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 247, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1700698351}, "language": "english", "review": "Fairly unique game!

Some of the chapters are large villages/cities, where you have an objective, but can spend time just getting lost in the dark and neon side streets/alley.

Allow me to share my thoughts on the experience.\n\nStray, developed by BlueTwelve Studio and published by Annapurna Interactive, takes players on a captivating journey through the neon-soaked alleyways of a futuristic cityscape, where players assume the role of a stray cat navigating a world filled with mystery and intrigue.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Stray is its unique premise. Playing as a stray cat provides a fresh perspective on the game world, as players explore environments from a low vantage point, pouncing through alleys and rooftops. The developers have successfully captured the essence of feline movement, creating an immersive experience that feels authentic and fluid.\n\nVisually, Stray is a feast for the eyes. The game's cyberpunk-inspired city is brought to life with stunning detail, featuring intricate alleyways, towering skyscrapers, and dazzling neon lights that create a visually arresting atmosphere. The attention to detail extends to the character designs, with both the stray cat and the various robotic inhabitants exuding personality through their animations and expressions.\n\nThe gameplay in Stray strikes a balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and occasional stealth elements. As a cat, players can interact with the environment, solving puzzles and navigating obstacles to progress through the story. The integration of the cat's abilities, such as squeezing through tight spaces or climbing walls, adds a layer of depth to the gameplay that keeps it engaging throughout.\n\nThe narrative in Stray unfolds through environmental storytelling, allowing players to piece together the world's lore through subtle clues and observations. The absence of direct dialogue or exposition may not be for everyone, but it adds a layer of mystery and discovery that aligns with the overall theme of the game.\n\nThe sound design in Stray deserves special mention. The ambient sounds of the city, the cat's echoing footsteps, and the machinery's hum all contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. The music, composed by Vivian Lien, complements the cyberpunk aesthetic perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments in the story.\n\nWhile Stray offers a unique and captivating experience, it is not without its minor flaws. Some may find the controls a bit finicky, especially during precision-based platforming sections. Additionally, the lack of a clear objective marker might leave players occasionally wandering in search of their next goal.\n\nIn addition to its captivating features, Stray enriches the gaming experience with a myriad of [url=https://stray.fandom.com/wiki/References]references[/url] to movies, series, and even other games, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to an already enthralling adventure!\n\nIn conclusion, Stray is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant journey that successfully blends an innovative premise with engaging gameplay. The captivating world, coupled with a subtle yet compelling narrative, makes Stray a standout title for those seeking a unique gaming experience. Despite some minor control issues, the sheer charm and beauty of Stray make it a must-play for fans of atmospheric adventures and unconventional storytelling.", "timestamp_created": 1700167065, "timestamp_updated": 1700167065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541825771331787109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150240575": {"recommendationid": "150240575", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075574650", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 327, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1700698963}, "language": "english", "review": "W", "timestamp_created": 1700165164, "timestamp_updated": 1700165164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150226411": {"recommendationid": "150226411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872329609", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 558, "last_played": 1658895051}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a cat person, I highly recommend this game.

You can do many things a cat normally does: knock things off of tables and ledges, meow at people, scratch the furniture, wriggle into small spaces, abscond with small objects, sleep in odd places, and steal everyone's hearts.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet, this game is absolutely worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1699861423, "timestamp_updated": 1699862148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150047363": {"recommendationid": "150047363", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104910807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 744, "playtime_at_review": 510, "last_played": 1700115174}, "language": "english", "review": "kitty", "timestamp_created": 1699854577, "timestamp_updated": 1699854577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150046004": {"recommendationid": "150046004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856214348", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1409, "playtime_at_review": 1409, "last_played": 1699850625}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buena historia y graficos.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699851575, "timestamp_updated": 1699851575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150044632": {"recommendationid": "150044632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167721911", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 422, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1700489786}, "language": "english", "review": "orange cat actvities", "timestamp_created": 1699848888, "timestamp_updated": 1699848888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150044401": {"recommendationid": "150044401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023490380", "num_games_owned": 901, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 317, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1699770167}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my gosh what an adorable, goofy, sad, tear-jerking, terrifying game!! \nAs far as combat or \"action\" there's not a ton to it, you pretty much run away from or vaporize the disgusting tick-like (or headcrab-like) Zurks. This game is primarily an adventure game with some puzzle and point-and-click elements. It also has some stealthy sections, but I was not expecting the horror elements to be so... Terrifying. It triggered something deep and dreadful in me and while it was only a short segment of the game it left a lasting and horrifying impression on me. The main character, Cat, and his little companion, B12, are some of the cutest protagonists of any game I've ever played, and all the robot NPC's are so well fleshed out and enjoyable. I found myself caring about every single (non-evil) character in this game to the point that I was constantly worried about them and wanting them to be okay.\nThe game is short (about 6-ish hours according to my in-game playtime, but Steam clocked me at 13 to beat it fully) but it's short and sweet. It's absolutely gorgeous, every single area is so well fleshed out. The robots feel more alive than some human characters in games, and the Cat is a wonderful character to play as. Not only is he(?) faithfully cat, but you connect with him on such a deep level, and you will feel for him. With this said it is possible to die in the game from Zurks, an the deaths feel horrible, but they're supposed to feel horrible and they work.\nAll-in-all I adored this game. It's so well-done. I loved all the characters, Main, Supporting, and NPC, and the story is one of hope, despair, happiness, and deep, deep sorrow. Play this game if you love cats, robots, humanity in the non-human, a deep, engaging story, or a fun, thought-provoking adventure.\nIf you scare easily, be prepared to be chilled to the bone. And if you are very emotional, be prepared to cry a lot.

cybernetic metropolis, offering a unique and captivating experience that seamlessly blends exploration, puzzle-solving, and heartwarming storytelling.\n\nVisually, \"Stray\" is a masterpiece.

The game cleverly integrates the cat's abilities, such as climbing and interacting with the environment, into the challenges, making for a seamless and enjoyable experience.\n\nOne of the standout features of \"Stray\" is its exceptional sound design. The ambient sounds of the city, combined with a hauntingly beautiful musical score, contribute significantly to the overall atmosphere. The attention to detail extends to the lively and diverse soundtrack that adapts to the player's actions, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments.\n\nWhile \"Stray\" is not without its minor flaws, such as occasional camera angles that may require adjustment, these are overshadowed by the game's overall brilliance. The developers have created a unique and memorable experience that sets \"Stray\" apart in the world of indie games. It's a testament to the potential of video games as an art form and a reminder that a well-crafted world and story can elevate a game to a truly extraordinary level.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Stray\" is a must-play for anyone seeking a fresh and emotionally resonant gaming experience.

Yes, a four-legged, fur-covered, meowing protagonist. It's like if \"Blade Runner\" had a pet-friendly policy.\n\nGraphically, the game is a neon-lit feast for the eyes, with environments so detailed you can almost feel the dampness of the alleyways and the rust on the robots. The attention to detail is so meticulous that you might find yourself stopping just to knock over a few bottles (because, well, you're a cat).\n\nGameplay is a delightful mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and feline shenanigans. You leap, scamper, and meow your way through the city, unraveling mysteries and making friends with the less-furry inhabitants. The controls are fluid, capturing the grace of a cat with surprising accuracy, until you accidentally leap into a chasm because you were distracted by a flying insect.\n\nThe story is a heartwarming tale, set against a backdrop of a world where humans are history and robots are running the show. It's as if someone wrote a sci-fi epic and then let a cat walk all over the keyboard \u2013 in the best way possible.\n\nThe soundtrack deserves a special mention, perfectly complementing the mood with its atmospheric tunes. It's like a soothing serenade for your alleyway adventures, with the occasional upbeat rhythm to match your feline frolics.\n\nIn terms of challenge, \"Stray\" is more of a gentle stroll than a frantic sprint. The puzzles are engaging without being hair-pullingly difficult, making it accessible to gamers of all skill levels.\n\nBut the real star of the show is, of course, the cat. The way it moves, interacts with the environment, and meows with a sense of feline authenticity will resonate with cat lovers and even convert a few dog people.\n\n\"Stray\" is a unique gem in the gaming world, offering an experience that's both relaxing and engaging. It's a must-play for anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to see the world through the eyes of a cat \u2013 complete with all the napping and mischief that entails.", "timestamp_created": 1699716544, "timestamp_updated": 1699716544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149938679": {"recommendationid": "149938679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152126265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1697390443}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the idea of playing from a cats perspective.

From the moment I stepped into the neon-lit streets of this cyberpunk metropolis, I knew I was in for something special.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the game's visually stunning world. The attention to detail in the bustling cityscape, illuminated by vibrant neon lights, is nothing short of mesmerizing. The developers have successfully created a living, breathing environment that feels both futuristic and lived-in. Navigating the city as a stray cat brought an unexpected charm to the gameplay, allowing for a fresh perspective on the world around me.\n\nThe narrative is equally compelling. Stray weaves a mysterious tale that kept me engaged from start to finish. As a stray cat equipped with a backpack-mounted drone, I found myself uncovering the secrets of the city and forming unexpected alliances with other sentient robots. The emotional depth and subtle storytelling are commendable, creating a bond between the player and the characters that goes beyond the typical gaming experience.\n\nOne of the standout features of Stray is the innovative puzzle-solving elements. The integration of the drone as a tool for exploration and interaction adds a layer of complexity to the puzzles, making them both challenging and satisfying to solve. The seamless transition between cat and drone gameplay kept the experience diverse and prevented any sense of monotony.\n\nWhile the controls took a bit of getting used to, especially in cat form, they eventually became second nature, allowing for smooth and intuitive navigation. The occasional camera angles were a minor hiccup, but they didn't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Stray is a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay. It's a must-play for anyone looking for a fresh, immersive experience in a cyberpunk world. The fusion of captivating visuals, a compelling narrative, and innovative gameplay make Stray a standout title that will leave a lasting impression on players.

[[no spoilers]] The graphics are amazing, every detail put into this game was put in with passion and care. 10/10 on the animation as well, it all played out smoothly and in all the game was not just a game but an experience I will never forget. Once I reached the end, I felt my heart ache and admittedly I was both mad and overjoyed with the ending. I needed more and will look forward to Stray 2. PLEASE MAKE IT I WILL PREORDER IT. <3 <3  I need Stray 2 and pray one day that I will have the honor to embark on kittys journey. To find his family. Explore the outside world.

Interacting with robots and engaging in side quests adds a fun element to the experience.\n\nOverall, Stray offers a unique world but falls short in gameplay.

There's that, of course, but there's also a heck of a lot of a lot of stilted biohorror action platforming and janky light stealth. When trying it's best to be a \"vidya game,\" Stray is just a tedious exercise relatively easy trial and error. Should have just stuck to the adventure game core.\n\nWhat it really is for the most part is a screen shot generator. I was expecting that this game would light my RTX 3060 up, but it only stirred the slightest purr from the case fans. The graphics tech on display here is mostly pre-baked textures and excellent art, but they punch way above their weight, delivering gobs of character, mood, and atmosphere. You get about 80 percent of the Ghostwire Tokyo feel without the space heater effect in your computer room.\n\nThe animation is, of course, excellent. Star of the show. Come for the cat; stay for the cat; make the can sleep, scratch stuff, and jump in and out of boxes. SOOOOOO CUTE.\n\nThe story is... OK. Post-post-apocalyptic future. Futility of survivalism. Corpofascism is bad. Lots of Noble Sacrifice. The art and animation sell it more than the writing. It's a kid's game.

[b]Sometimes the camera makes you blind to where your character is, jumping isn't always as responsive as it should be, which can kill you in some areas of the game[/b]. This can be bad, if you want to never die. [b]Not too terrible though[/b], only managed to die a couple times due to this to sentinels, so [b]don't expect the difficulty to be so bad[/b]. A lot of the negative reviews complaining about the difficulty are... Just bad at the game. [b]You can just run with no fear with little consequence most of the time[/b], my deaths are a simple result of that personally. [b]If you play a little safer and more patient, it'd be beyond easy to just never die at all.[/b] [b]The game gives you ample opportunities to get away from bad situations free[/b]; hiding spaces, corners, many types of obstacles.\n\n[b]You can mess around in the environment a bit,[/b] nothing really rewarding or thrilling, [b]though mildly enjoyable for some time.[/b]\n\n\n\n[b][h1]- Story -[/h1][/b]\n[b]The story is pretty cliche. The story events with major characters are predictable, unsurprising, cheap.[/b] [b]Characters a lot of times don't react to things that happen around them[/b], even if the game gives you an action you can do around them that affects their direct near environment, [b]which makes them appear somewhat dead and like typical NPCs, throwing you out of immersion.[/b] [b]Some lines when offering items to people[/b], like Clementine's picture, [b]makes some characters repeat the exact same line as if they were the exact same person, which falls into this same issue of throwing you out of immersion.[/b]\n\n\n[h1]- Personal Statement -[/h1]\n[b]I think the game is alright, so I'd give it a 5/10[/b], but Steam doesn't provide such luxuries. Personally, [b]I think it's got decent gameplay mechanics and environments that are both crippled by mediocre story and characters. Both the story and the characters are frustratingly boring, lacking depth, and feel entirely uninteresting[/b], right up until the end. Even the companion that follows you to the very end, that you get to know and spend time with the most.\n\n[b]Decent game, but definitely not worth the rating[/b] it has due to reviews hyperfocused on the playable character being a cat.\n\n[b]Looking at the achievement statistics reveals that only 41% of players actually finished the game, only 42% got 75% done with the game, and only 47% got 60% done with the game.[/b] Take those numbers as you will.\n\n\n[b][h1]- TLDR -[/h1][/b]\n[b]The story is cliche, the game adopts a kind of Disney, cutesy-style.[/b] This is the reason for my review being a downvote, personally.[b] If you're the type of person that likes Disney movies, you will enjoy this game[/b] unless you also happen to be bad at these types of games, or if you are simply irrationally impatient and quick to anger.\n\n[b]Expect the action of controlling your character to sometimes not be as responsive as you'd like it to be, which might get you killed[/b] depending on what I've said above.\n\n[b]Characters are typically unresponsive to what happens directly in front of them and present no reaction, and showing them the same item can make them spout the same exact line as 8 other characters[/b] you just talked to. [b]This makes them appear very robotic[/b] (pun intended)[b], and lacking in variety/personality.[/b]\n\n[b]Statistics about people's completion of the game, since it's strictly a singleplay story game, reveal a very low completion rate, much lower than what you'd expect[/b] for this kind of rating on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1698538795, "timestamp_updated": 1698579180, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451974391937255859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149087334": {"recommendationid": "149087334", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229005329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1698536963}, "language": "english", "review": "SO CUTE I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.", "timestamp_created": 1698537107, "timestamp_updated": 1698537107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149086799": {"recommendationid": "149086799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399043070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1698532149}, "language": "english", "review": "cute and lore packed game. fun mechanics. and interesting story.", "timestamp_created": 1698536344, "timestamp_updated": 1698536344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149085630": {"recommendationid": "149085630", "author": {"steamid": "76561199077610959", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1698534630}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE CATS BUY THIS IF U LOVE CATS", "timestamp_created": 1698534652, "timestamp_updated": 1698534652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149084318": {"recommendationid": "149084318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044953738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1699074415}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok til the zerks show up", "timestamp_created": 1698532950, "timestamp_updated": 1698532950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149083178": {"recommendationid": "149083178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815686894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1698529938}, "language": "english", "review": "The ending is a little lacklustering.

The opening sequence made me burst out in tears because the black cat looked exactly like one of the cats I grew up with which has been with me since 1999 but has died 13 years ago. At the end I also almost cried because the cat snuggled to the robot. This game was an emotional ride. I had to restart the slums part 1 because my notebooks disappeared after I showed them to elliot which really frustrated me in a way because I had to find all the music sheets and energy cans again on only to miss one badge somewhere and not getting the achievement to get all badges because I forgot to talk to the guy in the factory before obatining the keys after restarting the sthealth section yet anoth hundred times. \nStray is a beautiful and wonderful game in visuals and story but it can also get frustrating. Especially when going for achievements. \nThe Zurk chases are extremely frustrating when using mouse and keyboard btw so make sure to have a controller on hand. \nAlso there might be bugs like the notebooks mentioned earlier but also you can randomly get catapulted under the map when interacting with something on a wall (especially when you meet one of the sons of a missing robot) and the cat jumps. \nHowever it's a cute game and if you love cats, great world building that's not in your face and the cyberpunk genre It's the game for you. \nI needed 12 hours to beat it but only because I took all the sights in and because I sadly had to restart chapters due to bugs. \nI give it a solid 7/10 \nDefinitely a game for cat lovers", "timestamp_created": 1698479858, "timestamp_updated": 1698479858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149031739": {"recommendationid": "149031739", "author": {"steamid": "76561199514374652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1698566017}, "language": "english", "review": "best game", "timestamp_created": 1698479616, "timestamp_updated": 1698479616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149031110": {"recommendationid": "149031110", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013053459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 519, "last_played": 1695105818}, "language": "english", "review": "\u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438 :3", "timestamp_created": 1698478705, "timestamp_updated": 1698478705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149031005": {"recommendationid": "149031005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873715684", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1699157409}, "language": "english", "review": "Immortal cat that meows and shoves things off buildings.\n\nWould buy a cat specifically because of this game :)", "timestamp_created": 1698478547, "timestamp_updated": 1698478547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149028669": {"recommendationid": "149028669", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070773380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1508, "last_played": 1698791249}, "language": "english", "review": "prrrrrrrr", "timestamp_created": 1698474985, "timestamp_updated": 1698474985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149024546": {"recommendationid": "149024546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304777286", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1698468675}, "language": "english", "review": "mrowe", "timestamp_created": 1698468821, "timestamp_updated": 1698468821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149021068": {"recommendationid": "149021068", "author": {"steamid": "76561199156328465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1888, "last_played": 1659843430}, "language": "english", "review": "I meowed.

It could even be a great gift for a loved one or friend who you know likes cats and video games. I'm not fond of cats but I couldn't pass up this game with how unique it looked and it was a fun ten hours to get all of the achievements. I enjoyed jumping on tables and other places that I need not be and knocking everything off, meowing incessantly at any sleeping robots, etc. \n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful. Its setting is urban and many of the areas are rather linear but there's plenty to explore in the bigger parts of the game such as the cities, where the beloved feline is dexterous enough to explore verticality. There's a few 'collectibles' that you can hunt for, such as these cool little badges that can be pinned onto the cat's vest to accessorize it. Climbing and jumping onto platforms is simple enough, you just press one button while looking into its direction and the cat will do its jump animation. The game recommends the usage of a controller but my keyboard and mouse worked perfectly fine. I just had to rebind the 'meow' key, which was left-ALT by default, to another button as it became apparent how integral this command was when dealing with the hostile creatures (more on that next). \n\nTo make the game less of a walking simulator, in the first phase of the game you'll often encounter these giant tick looking creatures (zurks) that will chase you. The second game features flying robots (sentinels) that you'll have to sneak around in order to complete your goals. In general, the game is not at all too challenging and is very much more of a casual experience. Most of the puzzles I had solved inadvertently before realizing it was even part of a puzzle.  \n\nGiven that you can beat the game in less than 5 hours, or around 10 to 12 hours for getting all of the achievements, it can be argued that $30 USD is a bit too pricey for how short the video game is. But if this particular team developed this video game as a sort of experiment then there certainly should be a sequel or prequel that hopefully has more features to it.", "timestamp_created": 1698105156, "timestamp_updated": 1698105253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148759294": {"recommendationid": "148759294", "author": {"steamid": "76561199268461669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1698016189}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely emotional, took me seven hours to complete, and I loved it.

Definitely worth a play through. \n\nBut unlike the majority, I didn't think it qualified as a great game. There were too many questionable design choices. Too many little annoyances and too many missed opportunities to really qualify it as gem. I always felt like there was something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. On two separate occasions I started playing it, got through several hours of gameplay and then drifted away to something else - the first time for so long that I had to boot it up from scratch to remember the story. \n\nStray couldn't decide what it wanted to be: a narrative adventure, a 3D platformer, a puzzler... It added elements of all these  genres but never quite excelled at any of them. Stray did two things phenomenally: it created a world that was truly fascinating and it made that world absolutely gorgeous. But with the gameplay, it didn't quite do that beautiful world justice and that feels like a shame. I am still glad I experienced it but I can't see myself ever replaying it.\n\n+++ Environment / Graphics - Very well done\n+++ World Building - Absolutely gorgeous... the exploration was by far the best part of the game\n+/- Storytelling - A lot of missed opportunities here. Overall structure of the story was great but the storytelling not so much\n+/- Audio - Soundtrack was fantastic but the game was begging for voice-acting. Even if it was just the main character translating what the NPCs were saying\n+/- Puzzles - The puzzles were just okay. A few were decent but most were overly simplistic. Also, way too much reuse.\n-- Platformer Gameplay - By far the most annoying part of the game and existed in multiple sections.

After 6.2 hours spent exploring the mysterious and cybernetic world of a lost cat, it's evident that this game offers something truly special.\n\nStray thrusts players into a beautifully realized, dystopian cityscape where humans have vanished, and robots and holograms now roam the streets. You play as a stray cat with a small backpack and a piece of duct tape stuck to your back, which makes for an unusual and endearing protagonist. The game's exploration-focused gameplay gives you the freedom to navigate this mysterious world as a feline, offering a fresh and immersive perspective.\n\nThe atmosphere and world-building in Stray are its undeniable strengths. The city is a marvel of cyberpunk aesthetics, a curious blend of neon lights, holographic advertisements, and overgrown vegetation reclaiming the urban sprawl. The attention to detail is exquisite, immersing you in a world that feels both familiar and alien.\n\nThe core of Stray's gameplay revolves around exploration, platforming, and puzzle-solving. As a cat, you'll have to leap across rooftops, crawl through tight spaces, and use your agility to solve environmental challenges. The game's puzzles are inventive and often require a blend of observation and lateral thinking, making them satisfying to solve.\n\nThe interactions with the robotic inhabitants of the city add depth to the gameplay. You'll find both helpful and not-so-friendly robots, each with their unique quirks and behaviors. These interactions, often non-verbal, enrich the narrative of the world and your place within it.\n\nOne of the standout features of Stray is its storytelling approach. The game adopts a minimalist, wordless narrative style that allows players to interpret the story's nuances and emotions through their own perspective. The cryptic nature of the narrative may leave some players wanting more explicit explanations, while others will appreciate the freedom to draw their conclusions.\n\nThe ambiance and audio design in Stray are soothing and captivating. The sounds of a bustling city, combined with the solitude of the streets, create an enchanting and immersive audio experience that complements the game's visual aesthetics.\n\nHowever, with its 6.2 hours of gameplay, Stray can feel somewhat short for some players. The game's open-ended and exploratory nature may leave some desiring a more structured narrative or additional content.\n\nIn conclusion, Stray is a remarkable and unconventional gaming experience. As a whiskered wanderer in a cybernetic world, the game captures the heart and imagination, offering a unique perspective and an adventure that feels both peaceful and enigmatic. The game's stunning aesthetics, minimalist storytelling, and the charm of its protagonist make Stray a standout title for those looking for something different and emotionally resonant in the world of gaming. It's a journey that speaks to the soul in subtle and beautiful ways, despite its relatively brief duration.", "timestamp_created": 1697716990, "timestamp_updated": 1697716990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148482758": {"recommendationid": "148482758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314567330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1659546627}, "language": "english", "review": "My ass computer could run this game in only 15 fps and I almost finished this game.\nWith that I can just say that this game is about cats :D", "timestamp_created": 1697716738, "timestamp_updated": 1697716738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148478523": {"recommendationid": "148478523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438421279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1697708289}, "language": "english", "review": "sobbing", "timestamp_created": 1697708330, "timestamp_updated": 1697708330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148466257": {"recommendationid": "148466257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138445772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1695817038}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]8.2/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Beautiful graphics and art direction\n[*] Lovely story\n[*] Cat\n[*] Intriguing world and back drop\n[*] Decently satisfying gameplay and puzzles\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b] \n[list]\n[*] Very short, was able to finish in 4 hours with some exploration\n[*] personally I found the ending to be unsatisfying, not awful just didn't hit the mark for me\n[*] Limited repeatability \n[*] Generally a little easy\n[/list]\n\nOverall Stray is just a really wonderful game, it's beautiful and IMO who doesn't love cats?

Perhaps the cat protagonist, being a cat, isn't at all interested in the world it explores?\nThere is nothing about the plot or the themes explores where a cat would fit. The player character could have just as well been a human, a robot, or anything else. The cat in Stray is only there because it's cute, and perhaps to enable unique world traversal options. Which isn't wrong, just disappointing. I just wish the story leveraged the fact that you play as a cat.\n\nThere are zero environmental puzzles, and there isn't much to explore, with only few areas in the game not being entirely linear. So it's very close a walking simulator, really. The side stories are of the boring Skyrim-inspired fetch-quest variety, to the point where NPCs literally quote Skyrim in a mocking fashion. Why would you make the gameplay intentionally boring and joke about it?\n\nBut despite all that, the game has a very chill and distanced vibe which I loved (chase sequences, quite difficult and stressful, being an occasional exception). Gorgeous neon-lit streets make for great visuals. The kitty is very well animated too, and most of its interactions with the world are quite wholesome. Since when are cats' footsteps this loud, though?\n\nI suppose I was hoping for more of an adventure game, or more of a platform game, and Stray does not excel as either.\nBut the idea of running around abandoned kitchens toppling bottles in a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world is a great excuse for a relaxing atmosphere.\nIf casually walking across high-quality pretty environments as a cat avatar is appealing to you, enjoyment is guaranteed. Just don't expect anything clever.\n\nOh, and there is literally a \"meow\" button too, which has absolutely no use beyond warming the player's heart.

The world-building is incredibly strong, and you get to see it established throughout each level. The attention to detail and the nuance of every location, character, and story-line made me addicted. The mechanics (a lot of climbing!) are fun and easy to pick up on. There are many ways to interact with your environments, and optional things to explore outside of the main plot progression. This game is great at making you want to linger in chapters, which you can conveniently replay anytime after completing them without losing any progress. This is super useful if you want to return for things you've missed. Not to mention that the lighting, sound, and graphics in general are amazing.\n\nAlso, there's a Meow button. \n\nThe characters are all complex in their own regards. Each place is firmly established, and the plot was a tear-jerker for me. If you like cats, the cyberpunk genre, robots, or good games in general, you might like this one. For those who don't play games often: If you are good enough at using your keyboard, you can easily pick it up.\n\n12/10\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSPOILER WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD\n______________________________________\nSPOILER WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nThere are some minor issues I noted. I tried to keep it vague:\n\n1) When collecting the notebooks at the start, they can disappear from your inventory before you interact with the important character to continue the plot. Some people have found that reloading from your last checkpoint (which auto-saves, and will do so if you complete specific optional tasks) helps, but this did not work for me. I simply replayed the chapter and sort of speed-ran it since I remembered all the key locations.\n\n2) Once, a character was not in the required place for a cutscene to look correct. They were interacting with an item but hadn't teleported to the proper location, making the motions in the air while facing away.\n\n3) Once, a character did not continue its animation (outside of cutscene) to allow us to progress further. Reloading from the last checkpoint (mere seconds before) fixed this easily.\n\n4) Stray enemies may fail to run towards you with others and simply freeze and die wherever they end up. This doesn't happen with all of them but it is common for one or two to get left behind this way. This does not necessarily impact gameplay asides from helping a tiny bit sometimes. \n\n5) You can occasionally make your character glitch out at very specific surfaces / spots. No clipping, just a vibrating character model as you keep walking into whatever it is. Does not impact gameplay at all as you can easily stop and continue. \n\n6) Not necessarily a glitch, just adds a little tedium -- if you replay a chapter to get one of the optional collectibles for your companion robot, you have to finish that chapter after interacting and getting the maker filled blue. If you do not do so, it will not save it. Thankfully, the chapters are short and rather easy if you've gotten the hang of it. \n\nOverall not anything that made it impossible to progress, though the first issue made me think so.

It is at most mediocre at every level.\n\nOK, the graphic and sound are all right.\nThe game looks pretty good, although the animations of the main character look a little off to someone who knows how cats move. At some point, I was struck by an intense feeling that I'm looking at a very young cat which didn't entirely mastered walking yet and I think this is a good summary of what is wrong with it. It's all just a little stiff. But I get that animating fluent movements of a cat is really hard and this is nowhere near of being a deal breaker.\n\nWhat is a deal breaker then? The dialogs, or rather monologs because the main character doesn't talk. They are the main focus of the game and I cannot remember a single line that would be clever, funny or well-written. All the characters have as plain one-dimmensional personalites as you can get. Thankfully, the conversations are mercifully short.\n\nThe plot is rather basic but it could work if it was supported by good characters.\nAs it is right now, it main purpose seems to be to break my immersion. You are supposed to be a normal cat, right? Well yes... but you also understand human speech and you are able to perform complicated tasks and go to long missions where you're able to reason logically, keeping your goal in mind, without much instructions. So you're like human in cat's body, except no because you're supposed to be a normal cat. Actually, as a cat you're more competent than all other characters. Most of them is just sitting in one place for years, twiddling their fingers and waiting for some dumb animal to send it for a mission and giving weak excuses why they won't do it themselves, even if the task is to walk a hundred meters to get some book.\n\nNot much to comment on gameplay. This is just walking simulator with scripted pseudo-platforming elements and puzzles that mostly require to just find the interactive elements. In a few cases, you actually have to think for three seconds.\nThere are also fight sequences where you have to fight/avoid enemies and glitches both. I was spoted through a wall a couple times. This are still the most/only engaging elements of the game, although, they are sometimes annoying because they depend on luck too much.\n\nFor someone who doesn't know the language of cats the game may be cute. For someone who does, it's mostly funny because the main character is speaking gibberish.

This game was beyond my expectations and this is someone who was stoked for a cat simulator! This masterpiece is officially my favourite puzzle game and in my top 3 favourite games of all time. \n\nI thought this was just going to be a fun little game where you can play as a cat and do cat stuff, but the devs went above and beyond with this release. The puzzles are clever, the storyline is captivating as well as emotional, and the gameplay is well thought out. There's very few games I'd pay full price for (especially when the main quest isn't crazy long), but this is a game you shouldn't sleep on. Even when you've completed it, there's enough juice left in this lemon to be squeezed for a Costco sized jug of lemonade. I did have a qualm about a certain RNG based achievement, but did it ever feel good to finally have that one under my belt; so I guess I can't be too salty.\n\nSeriously, I adore this game and hope they make more \u2764\ufe0f Well done to the team on this magnificent creation \ud83d\udc3e\n\n[spoiler]P.S.

Sometimes the game selects the wrong thing to jump on (something below instead of above, for instance), and I end up aimlessly jumping back and forth between the same objects trying to select the correct one. \n\nI constantly get lost -- I wish that the little robot buddy that helps me would give better hints than \"go to the building with the orange sign.\" I'm there, but how exactly do I get in!? It took me waaaay too long to find the tiny window I was meant to jump through. I just played for an hour and most of that was helpless wandering around.\n\nI often have the option to show things I've collected to the robots. I usually don't know what to show them, or what I've already shown them. \n\nThe mice enemies (Zurks) are too fast, and sometimes I'm struggling to shake them off while also trying to figure out where on earth I'm supposed to be going. It's hard to complete an escape scene when you're too busy shaking off enemies to know where to escape to!\n\nI love, love, love the concept for this game, but I'm getting so frustrated that I don't think I can finish it.", "timestamp_created": 1696730689, "timestamp_updated": 1696730689, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471428543329238892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147839689": {"recommendationid": "147839689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230122960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1699932323}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sobbing.

It is not the exploration game its advertised as. There are good things about this game, but there's not enough for me to justify recommending it to anyone. \nLet me also be clear, I LOVE cats, not crazy cat person levels or even close to that, but I love them and have 2 of my own. My review has nothing to do with a hatred of cats. My review has everything to do with what's actually wrong with this game.\n\nPros: \n- The Atmosphere is great. Graphics are easily 7.5/10, which is better than what I was expecting. I'm not super into the cyberpunk aesthetic, but I can admit that it was well done here. If you love the Cyberpunk aesthetic and environment, then you'll love this games setting and graphics even more. \n- Soundtrack is pretty good. Specifically the part with the robot who's a musician, but also the general music. The music is simple but that works for the music in this game. \n- Concept is good, even if it was executed poorly. \n\nCons: \n- The story is SEVERELY lacking, Easily Predicable, and anti-climatic. It also seems as though the story focuses more on the robots than the cat. The relationships and dialogue between the cat and the NPCs, the NPCs themselves, or even between the cat and his robot friend feel void of anything. You're supposed to create a bond with this little robot companion throughout the story, but I felt nothing. I expected to have many feelings while playing this game but instead I was simply bored. \n- The platforming is so bad that I feel like you can only barely call it a platforming game. The jumps are all automated and you can only jump where and when the game wants you too (More on that in a second) and you can't even miss the jumps. Like, you just move through the motions without any need for skill (More on that later as well). \n- There's little to no actual exploration in this game. For a game thats advertised as a game where I can explore a world as a cat, there was surprisingly little space for exploration. I think the section that had the most room for this was in the Slums, but even then the game is INCREDIBLY linear. Sure there are a couple collectibles and things that you can find outside of the linear story route that you have to look for, BUT you can, again, only jump and move to places when the game wants you to. You can't just freely climb onto everything in the area, even if, realistically, a cat could totally reach everything in that area. There are specific paths to take throughout the game and that's it. It's not the open map exploration game I think we all actually wanted. \n- Puzzles are ridiculously easy and I know what you're going to say, \"Well its a game made for everyone. Kids couldn't enjoy it if the puzzles were too hard.\" Which, would be fair, but then, why put them there at all??? What's the point of them? The story is simple enough that it could survive without them, the puzzles weren't actually necessary to the plot. There were ways around them. So why have them? If the puzzles in a game are so easy that you can finish the game in under 2 hours without much effort, that's a problem. An already boring exploration game made worse by the lack of stimulating puzzles. \n- Sort of hand and hand with the last point, there's no skill required for this game, which I'm not expecting like Counter-Strike levels of skill in a game like this, but I expect there to be some level of ability needed to complete the game. \n- It's actually, NOT, made for everyone. A buddy of mine can't even finish the game because the chasing sections of the game (which are entirely unnecessary and add nothing to the story by the way) aren't friendly to people with lower mobility and reaction time in their hands. \n- The Price. Way to high for this game and I don't want to hear anything about \"WeLl iT goEs TOwArDS hElPinG StRAys.\" I don't care. There's not enough here to warrant $30. I'd pay $10 at most. \"Well that's not very supportive of the Devs,\" Just like I don't pay for Madden games anymore, I'm not going to pay more money to promote Mediocre games. \"Well this was a lot of work for the Devs!\" And, truly, I applaud them, but not enough to warrant that. \"It's not even that much money\" It is for some people and even so, why spend $30 on a $10 game when I can put it towards a game that's actually going to give me the quality of game I expect for it?\n\nNow I know a lot of you might hit me with the \"Well CLEARLY a lot of people liked the game because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive\" \nAnd that's fine. I'm not saying that you can't like the game. I'm saying you should like it at a lower price. Wait for the sale. \nBut also, a lot of positive reviews is NOT supportive of a good game. Especially with a good, I'll estimate, 75% of the reviews simply saying \"Meow,\" \"*picture of cat made with keyboard symbols,*\" or the chain \"Here's a cat *insert keyboard symbol made cat* 1 like = 1 pet.\" Like that doesn't even say anything about the game. Also it's literally a logical fallacy. \n\nHaving a cat as the protagonist doesn't make a game good. The cat is cute and again, the concept is good, it just wasn't executed well, but let's be honest. The cat is what drew people in and ultimately what makes people give this game good reviews. \n\nDo yourself a favor. Save your Money, wait for the sale, and then enjoy the game.", "timestamp_created": 1696484087, "timestamp_updated": 1696484087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568914413452148438", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147661790": {"recommendationid": "147661790", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001900764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 517, "playtime_at_review": 1220, "last_played": 1700546665}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely VeryVeryVeryVery   ADDITIVE!!!!!!\nLove it.....", "timestamp_created": 1696480648, "timestamp_updated": 1696480648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147660807": {"recommendationid": "147660807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996794984", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1694326583}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego para pasar el rato, aunque no es demasiado tiempo en el que se puede gozar de este juego, se logra disfrutar su historia, ademas de una ambientaci\u00f3n pos apocal\u00edctica mezclado con el futuro.

This game blew me away! one of the best games i have ever played and probably the most immersive experience i have ever had with any game.  I'm not a big fan of very many games would't consider myself a gamer but this game is outstanding.  I saw an advertisement for this game on you-tube and it showed how they actually used real cats with motion suits to get the quality graphics and realistic fluid motions of the cat as the main character.  I thought that was amazing and I instantly bought the game.  I rarely buy things because of advertisements but this one got me interested immediately. I am so glad I got it because it was an outstanding game with an outstanding story.  The story was beautiful as well, as the game play in this game is truly a work of art.  The game isn't very fast paced or filled with action but still has a lot of stressful moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.  I can see how this game might not be as liked by gamers who are used to extremely fast paced action but for me the slower pace was perfect.  DO NOT RUSH THIS GAME! Take your time enjoy the moment! explore and knock things over. Act like a cat scratch the rugs and knock over the pots. Getting into character truly deepens the experience of the game play.  my suggestion is to refrain from looking online when you get stuck its challenging but not impossible like a lot of other games.  If your used to games you could probably breeze through it but if you don't play puzzle games very often like me it might take some time but it is truly rewarding when you figure out what needs to be done.  The game has a good balance it is an adventure game and a relaxing game. It is a puzzle game at times and it is a bit of a horror game at others.  I feel like the game has a pretty big world and not having a map and the perspective of being small helps add to the effect.  This game is amazing and I am so blessed to have experienced it.  I want to thank the people who made this game and i hope development teems make more games like this in a similar style.  a lot of people like me have always been craving a game that fits this more relaxing and beautiful style and this game delivers.", "timestamp_created": 1696205093, "timestamp_updated": 1696205093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147468180": {"recommendationid": "147468180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953261550", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1696306252}, "language": "english", "review": "story was really good and very sad at the end", "timestamp_created": 1696198375, "timestamp_updated": 1696198375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147468120": {"recommendationid": "147468120", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091772868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1697346970}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1696198279, "timestamp_updated": 1696198279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147467559": {"recommendationid": "147467559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354091362", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1661027719}, "language": "english", "review": "Meow?

I thought the idea of playing as a cute little cat was pretty funny the whole way through, and the bits of personality and control I had in this protagonist was adorable.\n\nI thought the premise and the world was entertaining, I liked the science fiction world you are thrown into, even if I couldn't figure out all of the lore, I thought it was unique and chill enough to hook my attention. I never felt annoyed or dower exploring the areas and taking in the vistas and music. The characters were straightforward but endearing to me, and I actually really did enjoy interacting with everything I could find.\n\nThe puzzles and quests were all pretty easy for me to figure out and helped keep the game at an appropriate playtime in my opinion. If this game had been any longer I probably would have gotten annoyed with it sooner or later, and if it were any shorter I would have chided it for not feeling like a full game. Though, since it does still lean on the shorter side, maybe waiting for a sale is more beneficial.\n\nOverall, I don't have much else to say without spoiling the whole experience, I really enjoyed playing as a cat and exploring this underground world.

Yet, beneath the futuristic facades and neon-lit streets lies a palpable sense of isolation that resonates with our own lives in a profound way.\n\nStray, at its core, is a game that captures the essence of loneliness. As you step into the role of a stray cat, you are immediately struck by the solitude that pervades every corner of the city. The world feels vast, and you, a solitary feline, are left to navigate its labyrinthine alleyways, devoid of human companionship.\n\nThe game's visuals are a haunting testament to the art of isolation. The dilapidated buildings, flickering holograms, and the rain-soaked streets create a sense of desolation that mirrors the loneliness we can all feel at times. The cats you encounter in this digital realm, while visually intriguing, never quite manage to fill the emotional void left by the absent human presence.\n\nThe sound design further intensifies this feeling of isolation. The distant hum of machinery, the echoes of your own footsteps, and the eerie silence of a city without people all contribute to the sense of solitude. It's a reminder of the stark reality that many individuals face in the real world, especially in bustling urban environments.\n\nAs you traverse the city, solving puzzles and interacting with your robotic companions, you're acutely aware of the absence of meaningful connections. While there are fleeting moments of connection with the robots, they serve as a stark contrast to the depth of human relationships. This loneliness hits particularly close to home in a world where human interactions are increasingly mediated by technology.\n\nStray beautifully underscores the importance of human connection and the emotional impact of isolation. It's a reflection of how loneliness can be a powerful and often overlooked aspect of our lives. The game serves as a reminder to cherish the connections we have and to strive to reach out to those who may be feeling adrift in their own urban jungles.\n\nIn Stray, the profound sense of loneliness experienced by the protagonist feline mirrors the loneliness we can all encounter in our lives. It serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of human connection, urging us to cherish the relationships we have and to seek out those who may be struggling with the isolation of the modern world.\n\nThis Game teaches us what it is like to own friends who would trust you with their lives to help you.

I'm telling you, this game is WAY more than what it may seem like at first.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, the soundtrack and the visuals in this game are freaking amazing too. The art direction is just fantastic in this game, and in my opinion, it's one of the best-looking games I've ever played. On top of that, it's unique soundtrack just makes this game drip with atmosphere and ambiance the whole way through. Seriously, if you're on the fence about it (like I was at first), just get in and play the game. Like, really, go play it. I'm telling you, you're seriously missing out on an awesome experience if you choose to pass this game up. Don't make me come over there and force you to buy it!

Two of my favorite themes at once - cyberpunk and kittens. To be more exact, a cat is the main character of Stray. However, the game is not about the cat, although he is certainly the key figure of the whole interesting story.\nFrom location to location we are gradually revealed the plot, which keeps us in suspense throughout the game. The adventure itself evokes a whole range of emotions - sadness, emotion, tension and laughter.\nWalking on the roofs here is especially delightful. The protagonist climbs higher and higher, and we get breathtaking views of different parts of the city. An unusual city, the main inhabitants of which are robots.\nThe game turned out to be very \"warm\" also because the robots here are not clear and logically designed machines, but capable of feeling and experiencing emotions inherent in any person. In many of them, literally a couple of lines can reveal the character, it's cool! How our furry hero ended up here, and where all the people are, we will learn as we go through the game.\nSome locations deserve to be desktop wallpapers. The atmosphere of the city abandoned by people, transferred perfectly.\nThe most that I liked is the music. I added every track to my playlist and sometimes listen to it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1695388412, "timestamp_updated": 1695388412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0,

Even the cat is generic and you cannot change that easily, which is pretty stupid IMO, like how could they miss the opportunity to let you change your cat color or fur type? Maybe I want a Black Siamese or a longhair Blue Persian? \nI just cannot finish this, dodging those creatures and pressing the one button to get them off, boring, but I can still recommend it.

Little did I know that this game would be the catalyst for a shift in my perception of life, evoking emotions that I never thought a video game could. The game's ending was a tearful culmination of an experience that has indelibly altered my perspective on existence itself.\n\n\"Stray,\" developed by BlueTwelve Studio, plunges players into a meticulously crafted dystopian cyberpunk world where you assume the role of a lost cat navigating the bleak streets of a decaying metropolis inhabited solely by robots. From the outset, the game's atmosphere envelops you, immersing you in a hauntingly beautiful, post-human landscape that serves as the backdrop for your feline adventure.\n\nThe brilliance of \"Stray\" lies in its ability to weave an emotionally resonant narrative without a single word of dialogue. Through the eyes of our furry protagonist, we witness the loneliness, isolation, and fragility of existence in a world devoid of humanity. The game's masterful storytelling unfolds gradually, and each interaction with the enigmatic robots or environmental clues deepens the sense of melancholy and wonder.\n\nAs I progressed through the game, I found myself connecting with the cat's struggle for survival and longing for connection. The sense of vulnerability that permeates every moment was a stark reminder of our shared vulnerability in the real world, and this resonated deeply within me. \"Stray\" prompted me to reflect on the beauty and fragility of life itself, a theme that became increasingly poignant as the narrative approached its climax.\n\nHowever, it was the game's ending that truly moved me to tears. Without giving away any spoilers, it suffices to say that the conclusion was both heart-wrenching and uplifting. \"Stray\" managed to deliver a message of hope and connection in the face of adversity, leaving me profoundly touched and emotionally raw. It was a testament to the power of storytelling and the impact that video games can have on our lives.\n\nIn the weeks that followed my completion of \"Stray,\" I found myself pondering the game's themes and messages constantly. I began to view my own life through a different lens, appreciating the moments of connection and the beauty in everyday existence that I had previously taken for granted. \"Stray\" had opened my eyes to the importance of empathy, resilience, and the pursuit of meaning in an often tumultuous world.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Stray\" is not just a video game; it's an emotional odyssey that transcends the boundaries of the medium. Its hauntingly beautiful world, captivating narrative, and emotional depth have left an indelible mark on my soul. It reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there is light to be found, and that life's struggles are what make it all the more precious. \"Stray\" is a masterpiece that has changed my life, and I will forever carry its lessons and emotions with me.", "timestamp_created": 1695172916, "timestamp_updated": 1695172916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146621468": {"recommendationid": "146621468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838702287", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1695169091}, "language": "english", "review": "- Upbeat rollercoaster of joy and comedy\n- begins with a peaceful musical and overall upbeat soundtrack\n- ontopoetic meditation on mortality, authenticity and memorable phenomenological journey\n- gorgeous animation\n- cats featured\n\n\u3000                          \uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064", "timestamp_created": 1695172207, "timestamp_updated": 1695173894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796322822570800781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146615237": {"recommendationid": "146615237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308993918", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1695296339}, "language": "english", "review": "So cuuuuute and graphics are great :3", "timestamp_created": 1695161674, "timestamp_updated": 1695161674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146614891": {"recommendationid": "146614891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298415154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1695161108}, "language": "english", "review": "mrow", "timestamp_created": 1695161128, "timestamp_updated": 1695161128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146613354": {"recommendationid": "146613354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198875974880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 357, "last_played": 1695158512}, "language": "english", "review": "Only took 5 hours to get through.

It's supposed to be, or at least I thought it was supposed to be about hope for the future and finding your family, yet every single person you meet, you end up abandoning for next to no reason. Hell, I figured the whole point of the game was to get back to our cat family and the devs even bungled that. This game would have been an easy recommend, despite my other problems, had the devs just had the Stray reunite with his family. It could have been so easy.\n\nMy other problem with this game is the wasted potential. Our main companion throughout the whole game turns out to be the last human who uploaded his consciousness. But as you explore the game you are told that for some unknown reason, the robots all evolved to be more human over time, I thought it would have been REALLY cool if the entire human population of the dome uploaded themselves to the robots due to scarcity of supplies or y'know the virus that was hinted to be going around or were using them as some sort of surrogates while they remained in hyper-sleep or something but because it had happened so long ago, they all forgot. The ending of the game could have been us opening the dome and also solving the puzzle of where all the people went.

Hasta ah\u00ed, toda esa falopa es una idea particular para un juego, pero es mas que eso.\nEs un juego de Aventura (como para encasillarlo en un genero) pero cuenta con varios puzles, que son bastante sencillos en su mayor\u00eda.\n\nA pesar de ser un juego bastante corto, (que al ser tan lineal considero que es una decisi\u00f3n acertada) es destacable como todos los NPC tienen una historia que aporta al descubrimiento y desarrollo de la historia, todo tiene su tiempo justo y nada se sinti\u00f3 forzado.\n\nLo que considero lo mejor del juego: su ambientaci\u00f3n y apartado art\u00edstico/gr\u00e1fico, el cual me parece precioso. Sin duda alguna logra transmitir ese ambiente oscuro y frio combinado con la iluminaci\u00f3n de los carteles de ne\u00f3n por toda \"Ciudad Muerta\", eso sumado a que todo el entorno esta lleno de detalles que hace de su exploraci\u00f3n una experiencia llevadera.\nEl soundtrack me parece correcto, es muy sutil y se adapta muy bien a todo el gameplay (precioso detalle que en la pantalla de carga se escuche el ronroneo de un gato)\n\nEn tanto a su historia es bastante linda y tiene un final bastante triste, pero algo que destaco de ella es como busca dejar un mensaje relacionado al valor de la familia y la amistad en medio del caos que conlleva el futuro distopico en el cual se plantea. Sin contar que desde el comienzo, nuestra misi\u00f3n principal es llegar al exterior y volver con nuestra familia, el vinculo que B-12 va generando capitulo a capitulo con el gato o las palabras de Clementine cuando se sacrifica por el protagonista: \n                           [\"Debemos ir al exterior a toda costa. Ahora formas parte del equipo. \n                           No es que todos tengamos que llegar al Exterior, pero uno de nosotros tiene que hacerlo\"]\nSon algunos de los ejemplos de como se hace incapie en querer dejarte mucho mas que 7hrs de gameplay de trepar techos y resolver puzles. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1695013662, "timestamp_updated": 1695013662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146511839": {"recommendationid": "146511839", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177669801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1078, "last_played": 1695570416}, "language": "english", "review": "ending gmfu 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1695004335, "timestamp_updated": 1695004335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146511436": {"recommendationid": "146511436", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086093394", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1695003574}, "language": "english", "review": "im just a little guy", "timestamp_created": 1695003626, "timestamp_updated": 1695003626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146509704": {"recommendationid": "146509704", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172385397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1028, "last_played": 1695000467}, "language": "english", "review": "cute but sad and very thrilling", "timestamp_created": 1695000543, "timestamp_updated": 1695000543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146505329": {"recommendationid": "146505329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420441193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1658960941}, "language": "english", "review": "love cat", "timestamp_created": 1694993274, "timestamp_updated": 1694993274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146503325": {"recommendationid": "146503325", "author": {"steamid": "76561199384392008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1700264115}, "language": "english", "review": "Bigger W then Fnaf SB", "timestamp_created": 1694990393, "timestamp_updated": 1694990393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146501663": {"recommendationid": "146501663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014233571", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1248, "last_played": 1694987751}, "language": "english", "review": "Meow", "timestamp_created": 1694988117, "timestamp_updated": 1694988117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146500191": {"recommendationid": "146500191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148162088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1694204266}, "language": "english", "review": "ohhhh my heart. my heart has been used a scratching post. 10/10.

I enjoyed the characters but I want more of an epilogue.\n\nI played on Steam Deck and highly recommend adjusting the graphics settings.

It is a very touching story with emotions in the vein of a Pixar movie (not to the same grandeur of effect but that is the style it is chasing) that, if you let it, can open the conversation about sentience in the same way a good, deep sci fi story can. Its choice to see a world through the eyes of a cat is also something that, before i played, seemed strange but now on the other end was a masterful choice that gives the narrative a beautifully alien context. My only words of warning are this, it is DEFINITELY a short game (my game clock says 10 hours but the play through was really only about 4 and a half) so if you are someone who needs 30 hours in their game to feel worth it, this is not for you.

[/h1]\n\n...no matter how pretty the game looks or how fun it is to play as a cat. \n\nAnd that truly is the only thing about this game that makes it stand out over other indie games (which I truly don't think it deserves.) It's very fun to play as a cat and some of the level designs are very clever, allowing you to do certain things because you're an agile little kitty. It's good stuff. But, honestly, half way through the game I forgot that I really was a cat, because you get to communicate with the other robots using your robot buddy. Other than the novelty, being a cat doesn't mean anything in this game. \n\nAlso, the story is thin, relying on a fairly standard post-apocalyptic sci-fi narrative and world design that kind of tricked me into thinking I was loving the game at first, because it kept reminding me of other games that I really wanted to play that had more depth and a more original story.\n\nThis game suffers from making you feel like it's going to be 3-4 times the size and scope that it actually is. I think the world design and aesthetics contribute to that. It's pretty short, around 5-6 hours and not as full as it could be. It's definitely not worth $30. \n\nPart of the reason that the world feels small is because you don't get to know most of the characters deeply because they only say 1-2 lines total, some NPCs say the exact same thing, so it feels kind of hollow and doesn't feel like you're in a real city. Also, since you're a cat, you don't actually speak with anyone for the whole game. You play as a cat but feel like you're basically no one and there's no way to know who this cat is. Since I didn't know who I was, I didn't have any emotional connection to the one companion you're supposed to care about. It's a one-sided relationship. \n\nI don't hate this game. It's a fun little romp and I love being a cat.
