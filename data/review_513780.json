Although it's a shame there's still no option to make game easier or harder (e.g. slower base speed or more obstacle) and letting player choose spefific location/music on it's 5th series.",

Same for their other games, just with the difference that the paid games could not be tested bc their illegal move as additional reason.\n\n(And following that: I advice to not to try to trade theirgames, including this one,  with people you don't know. It will just cause a lot of useless trouble. Other people has the same problem and Fanatical agreed that all their exchange codes has been revoked too.  So this is a problem in general. And not to gorget to say: Fanatical never warned their users. They claim never knowing about that troubles. As I confronted them with the fact that they know it now and if they do something against that (warning their users, confront the publisher,...) they just ignore that. Was a cramp to get some money back bc they see no responsibility on their part. So, even if it's absolutely no intention to fool you, a lot of users will not know that they offer a revoked game btw. you don't know that you offer a revoked game)", "timestamp_created": 1621357420, "timestamp_updated": 1621357420, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91215035": {"recommendationid": "91215035", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997746595", "num_games_owned": 674, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1619856824}, "language": "english", "review": "A jumping dog game.

You'll become the cruelest people in the world and force thousands of animals to die without batting an eye. The game tries to hide this fact by masking it in an endless runner game with cute graphics and great music.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- 10 different animals to choose from with different jumping style\n- You can replay the game quickly\n- 2 minigames\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- RNG-based deaths\n- Minigames are pointless\n- Some letters that are required to unlock minigames are very hard to find\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]To be honest, I don't see any reason to buy this game unless if you want to play a cheap endless runner with cute graphics and great music, which are the only main selling point of this game. There are a lot of free endless runner games on flash websites and the achievements for this game are too grindy to recommend. However, this game is still decent and cheap so I'm still recommending it for casual players who want to play it in short bursts.[/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game uses cute-looking sprites with beautiful, moving backgrounds. Some effects will be applied randomly to display the weather condition, whether it's snowing, raining, or sunny. An extra layer is also applied for day and night, which makes the presentation to be worthwhile.\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\n[b]Characters[/b]\nThe game has 10 animals that you can choose from. Nine of them can be unlocked after you collect enough PugCoins, a collectible that you can obtain by playing the game. It might be hard to go for a high score with the basic pug, your starting animal, so you might want to try other animals that suit your playstyle. However, since you need to adjust your playstyle every time you change animals, you'll most likely end up sticking with one favorite animal to play with. \n\n[b]Endless Runner[/b]\nAlthough it's an endless runner game, the game has two level sets that are repeated after another. The first level set lasts for 300 meters and has easy obstacle sets that you can avoid by jumping anytime you want. The second level set, the deadly one, will last for 500 meters and consists of a lot of difficult obstacle sets where you have to utilize your edge jump or remember the right timing of your jumps. Some jumps require precise timing, to the point that it feels cheap to die just because you are not jumping at the right pixel, especially with the basic pug.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2264530940 \n\nBoth level sets will randomly spawn their obstacle sets and change to the other level set once their time is up. There is no difference in running speed or anything, which makes it pointless to go further than 800 meters unless if you're aiming for achievements or leaderboards, which is broken to begin with. In fact, I even got bored after playing the game a few times and there's no way I'll stick playing the game for this long if not for the achievements and character unlocks.\n\nThe game is mostly an endurance run. You need to learn when to jump in every obstacle sets to reach a high score, provided that you're calm enough to play the game for a long time. Sometimes the game will give a variety by striking you with lightning, which will provide you immunity for a while. However, there is a certain spot that will give you an instant death if you were struck with it, making the game to be luck-based at times. Luckily, this doesn't happen very often.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2264530970\n\n[b]Minigames[/b]\nTURBOPUGDX letters will spawn in certain spots as you play the game. Collecting all letters will unlock a minigame in the next run, which gives nothing but an achievement and 500 PugCoins after you finish it. However, some letters, especially T and R, have a low spawning rate that you have to spend ~1h just to wait for them to show up.\n\nThere are 2 minigames that will be rotated right after another. Both minigames require you to do the same thing: focusing on two different tasks. However, I found that the second minigame to be harder than the first since you also need to guess whether you have to jump or not at certain times. Strangely, I felt more accomplished when I finished it compared to when I finished the 5000 meter run in the main game, which is also one of the hardest achievements in the game.\n\n[b]Length[/b]\nIt took me 13.3h to finish the 5000m run and 19.4h to finish the second minigame. The playtime might vary based on your skill although you still need to grind for more hours to get the grindy achievements.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's an okay endless runner game with cute graphics and great music. Some harder obstacles might look cheap with a lot of edge jumps and small jump timing that you need to execute. You might also need to unlock other animals to get a high score because of how hard it is to play with the most basic pug. The game is just plain boring and I lost motivation after finishing the 5000m run, although the game is still okay because of the good-looking graphics.", "timestamp_created": 1603366643, "timestamp_updated": 1603415306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701279282569885254", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77485051": {"recommendationid": "77485051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801240527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1606642653}, "language": "english", "review": "pug", "timestamp_created": 1602571486, "timestamp_updated": 1606642458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552652478218078613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76435070": {"recommendationid": "76435070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294132025", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1671139826}, "language": "english", "review": "This is lovely game.

It's not exactly a fun way of extending a games life.\nWhile The leaderboard on DX doesn't even work.\n\nIts not a large roster, its 10 characters. Had it been presented as 2 classes with every other character being a slight variation of the original, that would at least be more accurate.The only ability is, you can either jump high, or you can double jump. Every other character from that class is just a tiny little bit different on jump height or speed.\n\nHazards still blend with the level design especially with the theme and day/night cycle.\n\nBtw, Turbo Pug DX overheats CPU\u00b4s.

Players who like, or don\u2019t mind 2D pixel runner games will enjoy the graphics it has to show. I also noticed an Easter egg, where the outdoors will shift from day/night time, depending on how long we play. I like how the game rewards players who survive longer too; whether unlocking a new landscape, achievements and more collectables for unlocking the rest of the crew! There\u2019s also the nice addition of custom skins to choose from, though I never really was into them if it weren\u2019t for the achievements. I haven\u2019t tried the mini games and Jukebox yet, though, so no comment on those features yet. The audio and soundtracks suited the gameplay, with the latter being 8-bit music. \n\nThe only minor issue it has is lack of tutorial and providing controls. (Then again, it is just a 1-key click game, and the goal is self-explanatory.)\n\nThe effects and animations all ran properly and smoothly during my gameplay. No bugs or glitches.

about pugs and one of my all time favourites!! :PugLove:\n\n[b]The good\ud83d\udc4d[/b] \n\ud83d\udc4dGameplay: It's an eternal runner. I'd say the difficulty is average/hard but fair, as in, when you lose you know why you died. You can also unlock more characters that control differently using the pug coins you collect. \n\n\ud83d\udc4dControls: can be played on keyboard or mouse without problems, as you only need to hit space bar/click to jump.\n\n\ud83d\udc4dGraphics: I think this is where the game truly shines. The pixel art is amazing, especially the characters sprites. It's also the most polished and pretty than in the previous games. The levels look much better and more varied too. \n\n\ud83d\udc4dMusic: I would say it's good, fits well with the game.\n\n\ud83d\udc4dDuration: It depends on your goals but as most runners the duration can be stretched as much as you want. It took me 3h to unlock all characters, but I didn't tried to beat the 1# highscore on the leader board, or get all the trophies, etc.\n\nI think it's extremely good for its asking price and offers a lot. You can always wait for a sale (where it is super cheap) if you're hesitant. \n\n[b]The bad\ud83d\ude40[/b]\n\ud83d\udc4eNo Online Mode: it used to be a feature but got taken off due to people using programs to cheat on the learderboars and change scores. \n\n\ud83d\udc4eTrophies: with online mode taken off, it's impossible to get 100% completion because there's one trophy that requires you to play on-line, so Achievement Hunters be warned.

I'll get back to this.\n\nThe controls are awful, expecting precision while the controls have a latency of about half a second. That is to say, there is a noticeable delay between pressing space (or clicking) and the dog actually jumping. It's sluggish. This causes many unnecessary deaths. What makes I Wanna Be the Guy great is the fact that while it expects precision, the controls are tight as a motherfucker, so you learn to play with twitch reaction time. In this game, it's nearly impossible to predict what will happen when you jump. Sometimes, you even randomly get struck by lightning which freezes you in the air and gets you killed. That's not a joke. That actually happens.\n\nThe hit detection is awful. The jump with the crooked box is emblematic of everything that is wrong with it. You can land on top of it and still die. Nothing is consistent. You will die from things that didn't kill you the last time, even though you did it exactly the in same way. I've died several times just running over a straight block. How does THAT work?\n\nAfter dying, the game makes you wait for about two full seconds before you can make another attempt. This is not telegraphed. It's just bad design. Again with IWBTG, you could restart instantly. There was no random latency.\n\nThis game is not fun. I stopped having fun ten minutes in.\n\nThe RNG is completely broken and full of **** (steam failed to censor me). Remember when I said that I made 99% of the progress in the first ten minutes? It's true. I got all the letters except for the 'T'. And then 10 more minutes passed. And then another 10 minutes passed, and before I knew it, I'd racked up an hour of playtime. 50 minutes without picking up a single T. Statistically, this is so improbable that you'd be as likely to win the lottery. If the RNG was working properly at all, then the T ought to have the same probability as all the other letters. There are nine letters: T,U,R,B,O,P,G,D,X. What is the probability of getting a T if the next letter is random? 1 in 9. After 17 letters in a row, what is the probability of NOT getting a T? 8 in 9. But with all 17 rounds considered together, that's twice the set length, the probability of not getting a T on the 18th letter is 8/9 * 8/9 * 8/9... = 12%. And after 34 letters, it's 1.8%. And after 150 letters it's 0.0000000021% (odds of winning the lottery: 0.0000000005%). Yet it somehow managed to continue to not appear despite collectively being on par with winning the fucking lottery. This is not random. Random is equally distributed. Good RNG emulates random by making all outputs of the function equally likely. \n\nThis is not random. This is an insult to the player's intelligence.

Die, die, and die again, this game is the epitome of repetition.\n\nThe input lag on the mouse made that unusable for jumping, and there was no controller support, so I had to resort to the space bar for the game and mouse for the menus. I appreciate what they tried to do with the procedural generation of the tracks, piecing together different paths with different seasons,  times of day and music, but there just isn't enough variation for that to remain interesting for long. The dull gameplay remains the same throughout: jump. Jump over the blocks, jump into the \"coins\"; that's it. And the first unlockable isn't even worth it, requiring you to press jump twice to survive what only took one before, often not leaving you with enough time to react. Die with 70 points, rinse, and repeat until you hit the next thousand.\n\nI was bored well before 14 minutes in, and I had seen all of the core content within the first 5. The art is nice, the music is nice, but the mechanics are so bare-bones as to be an asset pack's example level. I got this game for free, and frankly that's all it's worth.

Plus the game is only a dollar, so that's nice I guess.\n\nHowever,\n\nThere are three serious issues with this game. First, there are some bad hitboxes that leave you feeling frustrated and disatisfied half of the time that you die. Second, half of the characters (the first half) seem to have really unresponsive jumping times, which makes the game very not fun because dying repeatedly because of terrible mechanics is cheap and unfair. Third, there are letters which need to be collected to unlock minigames (which have achievements if you win), but it takes way too long to collect all the letters for minigames which you often fail in the first 20 seconds of playing. The developer somehow completely butchered the spawning algorithm for the letters so that u's appear every other letter, at the least, whereas other letters will randomly not appear for 20 minutes at a time.\n\nThese issues could have been fixed incredibly easy.

I'm not even a big fan of the genre.  Yet somehow even dropping a forgettable 50 cents on this game has left me with the tiniest bit of buyers remorse.  Not because the name lied or the pugs aren't real, but because it misses the main point of the runner genre.\n\n[h1]Rewarding the Runner[/h1]\n\nThe only reason runner games exist, as far as I can tell, is because they offer a steady stream of reward for playing.  Whether it's more maneuvering, going faster, surviving hits, or just simply cosmetic stuff, you're being fed positive reinforcement to give you a reason to keep playing.  Turbo Pug DX seems to do the opposite.  You're tasked with collecting a bunch of objects that give you varying amounts of a currency that very slowly unlocks new characters for you to use in the game.   This seemingly doesn't pick up much speed since after I unlocked a first character after maybe 5-10 minutes of playing, I had to grind through another 20-30 minutes to unlock the second.  I have no idea how far the third will be and I just don't want to find out.   Runners are inherently not fun enough to keep people playing beyond short sessions.  They're usually set up to be repetitive and simple to occupy short periods on people's phones.  Here, I'm stuck slogging through a barebones runner design with nothing but more of the same to look forward to.\n\nThe only other reward aspect is that you have to collect the letters that comprise the title of the game (TURBO PUG DX) similar to the way you would in a collect-a-thon 3D platformer or a Tony Hawk game.  Collecting all of these lets you start the next round in a mini game.  However, you get one shot at this mini game, and the instructions presented for it barely give you an idea for what you're about to encounter.  The first time, I was presented with a timed event of stopping changing letters (spelling out the title again) while simultaneously continuing the runner gameplay.  I ran out of time and was forced to collect the letters in the main game again.  The problem with this is that it throws the letters at you in a totally random way, so I had to grab the same ones seemingly dozens of times waiting for the last one or two I needed to appear.  Then, when I finally got back to the minigame, it was an entirely new  setup where I failed literally within seconds because I had no idea I'd be attacked from behind.  Besides, why would I?  Runners are always designed to have all threats come from in front of you... but I guess that's just not how things work here.\n\n[h1]What little remains[/h1]\n\nThere's no reason to really write more about Turbo Pug DX.  It's just simply not fun to play.  It does have some cool music, but it quickly gets repetitive since you only hear three or four of the many songs available (you can hear them all in the jukebox part of the menu).  I'm not sure why they wouldn't cycle all of the songs as you play, but that's just another entry on the list of disappointing choices made for this game.  Save your dollar or half dollar if it's on sale.   You could spend it on Steam trading cards and probably get better value.", "timestamp_created": 1523178835, "timestamp_updated": 1523178835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53950810432434082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41351963": {"recommendationid": "41351963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155170552", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1524227324}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game.", "timestamp_created": 1523147142, "timestamp_updated": 1523147142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.42233237624168396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41344795": {"recommendationid": "41344795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198816372413", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1521150932}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente juego!!", "timestamp_created": 1523120838, "timestamp_updated": 1523120838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41344511": {"recommendationid": "41344511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198816047840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1521151111}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente juego!", "timestamp_created": 1523119840, "timestamp_updated": 1523119840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41342486": {"recommendationid": "41342486", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982260083", "num_games_owned": 1330, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1523572380}, "language": "english", "review": "The concept is simple and it was fun playing for a few minutes, you can only jump in this game while running, but the unresponsive controls make this a frustrating mess so now it's understandable why I got it for free, not recommended", "timestamp_created": 1523113640, "timestamp_updated": 1523113640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404214054346084595", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41319561": {"recommendationid": "41319561", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962462777", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1524096678}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it story rich?

I wish it is just completely random with all options possible starting at the very beginning)\n-Leaderboards worked for me the first time I played, has not been able to load last couple of times I fired up the game.\n\nNeutral:\n-Difficulty--it was never meant to be an easy game\n-Minigames--Good variety, but so difficult! I wish the minigames were available continually after you unlock them the first time, but you have to keep unlocking them, and I do not last very long in those.It's not too difficult to unlock, but I just want to be able to play it more than once every 15-20 minutes.\n\nConclusion:\nGot the game for free, can't complain. Fun and addicting game. It's a dollar at normal price, so for those who enjoyed torturing themselves with FlappyBird, this is not a bad alternative. It is not as difficult.

Unlocked characters each have their own characteristics, and special skills. Unlocking characters and earning achievements are mainly linked to earning enough pug coins, the 'points' or 'currency' (albeit one you can't 'spend'!) in the game. \n\nDid I mention how cute the game is? The art style is terrific, very colorful and bright, which makes a change from the hours I've spent on the grim and somber, Evil Within. The only aspect of the game that could be classes as horror is the music; 'chip tune', it's not for everyone. \n\nAt least for me, the game has triggered severe motion sickness, so I can't comment on it's replay value. However I can say that the 'runs' seem quite diverse, changes happening to the level/map each time your pug dies. There's elements of the old mixed in with the new: tricky jumps, lava filled pits, and all. (PS: Chests and star buttons are filled with collectibles! Tree stumps, vases, and snowmen won't hurt you, they're part of the background. Don't be fooled!)\n\nThere's tallies kept of your highest score, current score, and your total score, as well as leader boards. You can challenge yourself or play the game to relax - Pug Turbo DX can be the platform/runner game you want it to be: a challenging game or a simple, cute one. \n\nOr both! -:) \n\nPPS: It has adorable badges to display (including a hamster!), as well as cute emojis, backgrounds, and achievements.

Sometimes when its stormy you get hit by a thunder and skip 2-3 obstacles tho most of the times it killes you because you can not jump for a brief moment after it.\n\nOn your way there are \"Pug Points\" to be collected that do nothing else but unlock new pets that sometimes have different abilites such as faster movement speed. They dont help you in getting any further tho.\n\nAlso you can collect letters that if you have all of them form the word \"TubopugsDX\", sometimes it takes ages for the last letter to appear.\nWhen you have all of them, in your next run you have to play a minigame, at least thats what it says. 2 are available and chosen after each other. They are your classic endless running and at the same time doing something else but...sadly both dont introduce you to anything and just throw you right in so that you die instantly.

engine and online skins integrated in menu are interesting. Progression using pugcoins seems less well handled than original. Repetitive and played out.\n\nOther than the TLDR info, I've noticed that not unlocking skins or songs through play affected the addictiveness and longevity of the title quite a bit for me. All I could really do is go for the highscore. The additional skins performed slightly differently in the way the pug jumped and whatnot but nothing remarkable or interesting. Collecting letters for the hidden level was not very engaging either since the hidden level had you use KB+M for the gimmick and this game is best played with a controller. \n\nThe controls did not feel terribly sharp and the procedural level design will stonewall you with rather BS obstacles on a regular basis.\n\nThere are some interesting runner types like Olli Olli which allows trickmoves or the legendary bit trip runner for example, there are runners with multiplayer like Speedrunners.

Simple y para jugadores casuales. \n\nEl objetivo seg\u00fan he podido comprobar en el tiempo que he jugado, es recoger todas las letras de la palabra \"Turbopugdx\" que te encuentras por el escenario, as\u00ed como caritas de perros, cajas o cofres para ir sumando puntos en el global. Puntos que no se te reinician tras fallar. Se acumulan conforme vuelves y vuelves a jugar el escenario tras los sucesivos errores.\n\nLas letras est\u00e1n siempre en la misma posici\u00f3n del escenario, pero van rotando de forma aleatoria cada vez que lo intentas. Por lo que es posible, conseguir todas las letras sin tener que llegar a zonas nuevas. Ademas, cuando se reinicia el juego cada vez que te chocas, empiezas por una parte completamente diferente. La m\u00fasica, adictiva, tambi\u00e9n cambia.\n\nCuando se consiguen todas las letras, salta una fase bonus. Acabada esta, vuelta a empezar de nuevo para conseguir una vez mas, todas las letras de la palabra Turbopugdx.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos est\u00e1n muy bien cuidados, estilo pixel, teniendo incluso climatolog\u00eda cambiante. La m\u00fasica es pegadiza y acompa\u00f1a. \nDentro del men\u00fa, tienes una tabla con las mejores puntuaciones hechas por los jugadores, perros desbloqueables (saltan mas, menos, tienen un estilo diferente) y skins para cambiar por completo la forma de ver de los escenarios. En la pagina de steam, aparece como que tiene editor de niveles, pero no es cierto. Y es un fallo grave en este tupo de juegos.\n\nMe ha salido completamente gratis. Lo recomendar\u00eda estando en oferta a un precio inferior a 0,99, ya que por ese mismo precio, tienes alternativas mucho mejores como \"Geometry Dash\" (que suelen rebajarlo a esa cifra en ofertas).

The custome skins are worse, the only ones that were good was when all the objects were pure black sadly, i.e. \"to hell and back\"\n3)recycle. the game gets redundant and boring so fast simply because your playing the same obstacle over and over and over and over again.\n\nfinally, I would like to mention that there are far better runner games available that are better and dont do what this game is doing.\n\nglad it was free, now i know to avoid this trash.\n", "timestamp_created": 1521122136, "timestamp_updated": 1521122136, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40828931": {"recommendationid": "40828931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814359187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1558799240}, "language": "english", "review": "Useful for casual gaming, and its free xD", "timestamp_created": 1521121660, "timestamp_updated": 1521121660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40828532": {"recommendationid": "40828532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820505171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1596908083}, "language": "spanish", "review": "salta prro de mrda :w", "timestamp_created": 1521120237, "timestamp_updated": 1521120237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40826544": {"recommendationid": "40826544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313518987", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1545552814}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler]Dat Controls[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Level Design[/spoiler] tho", "timestamp_created": 1521112488, "timestamp_updated": 1521112488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396580725908279419", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40825849": {"recommendationid": "40825849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400840960", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1521887156}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say...My lovely game! \nIt is very addictive PLEASE 10 MORE MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP game.\nAwesome soundrack, beautiful levels, missions, never ending (unless you're dead) parkour with cute dogs, map skins customisation but also very repetitive game so that's why others dislike it.

and when you collect a certain amount you unlock a charecter this system would be better if it told you how many faces you need to unlock a charecter and when you unlock a charecter. \n\nanother problem i have is that the game dosent say what each charecter in the game does this dosent matter much but this feature is kind of basic and it would be cool to have it.\n\nand 3 more things that

The longer your run for the harder the game gets as it will become faster and therefore harder to time the jumps. The different pugs/dogs in this game have different types of jumps that makes each pug have its benefits and drawbacks. This makes the game a lot more fun as when you unlock a new pug there will be a new learning curve for you to learn. This add more to the gameplay.\n\n[b] Price [/b]\nThe cost to get this game is very fair and i do recommend to pick this game up if you have some money on your steam wallet that you won't be using. Its not a game that you will be playing for hours at a time but its a game you will like to come back to and try to get a better score. Thats why the price of 1 euro for this game is a good deal.\n\n[b] Graphics/level design [/b]\nThe graphics are very simple for this game just like the gameplay is. It has a simple pixel graphics artwork that works well for this game. What i like about this game is that you can choose how the level looks as you have the option to change the level deign for this game e.g halloween theme.\n\n[b] Overall [/b]\nI think this game is worth getting as the price for this game is fair and its quite a fun game to play when you have free time. I dont see people playing this game a lot in one run but its a fun game to come back to and see if you can try to beat your high score. This game is worth buying at its price.\n\n[b] Thanks HellCow [/b]\n[quote] This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaming_until_end]Gaming Until End[/url], through the

Except for in this game they've made it very charming and easy to see past. Although from time to time, it does feel clunky when playing with keyboard & mouse. I definitely reccomend using a controller for the best experience possibe.\n\n[h1]Art Direction[/h1]- The game, for being what it is, has a very detailed pixel art design which nicely complements its sound track and gameplay. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]- Out of all the variables, ranging from character selection to gameplay, the soundtrack has to be my very favorite part of this game. It is so diverse and easy on the ears. Every course has a different and unique sound that takes away and adds to many genres extremely well. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]- Turbo Pug DX looks like a title you get just for the trading cards. From first glance it looks like something that would just sit at the bottom of your library and you would never think of touching it.

My suggestion is to play the game while you're watching TV or listening to YouTube videos or whathaveyou.  \n\nSomeone can correct me if I'm wrong, but there's really only 1 stage and it keeps going endlessly until you crash into something.  Throughout the stage, the placement of obstacles may change so it's not always exactly the same each time you play.  You can also apply other \"skins\" to the level and there are also weather changes and day/night changes in the background.\n\nShould you get this game?  I say yes.

I think that there's very little leeway when it comes to avoiding obstacles... but that's probably just me being terrible at this game! c: \n\nHaving achievements to reach is nice, despite needing to commit several hours to the game to get them.\n\nThe last thing- pretty much my only real issue with the game- is the changing colors in the background. It may just be me being old and having issues with my eyesight, but sometimes I struggle seeing where the pug is compared to obstacles and boxes that I need to jump over and onto. Using a custom BG helps a lot, so if you decide to play and have this problem, I definitely recommend doing that in the options setting.\n\nIf you don't like casual, simple games, you probably won't like this game.

On top of that the game is considerably [b]unresponsive[/b], sometimes when you want to perfom a consecutive jump, as in Jump > Land > Quickly Jump again, the \"trucker\" won't respond and you'll end up dying...a lot because of this. [u]Other than that all I can say it's just another Runner game, nothing special to it.[/u]\n\n[h1]Personal Experience:[/h1] Horrible, since like I stated before I feel it's a bland game and I'm a completionist \"truck\". I got all the Achievements in about 3-4 hours, except for 2000 Deaths and 500km Run. So being forced to play this game for rougthly 14-16 EXTRA hours due to the last two achievements is just idiotic. I simply don't understand why would they place such extremely time consuming Achievements to such a stupid game; not even Shantae a perfect example of a good indie game with relatively hard Achievements, requires you to sink in so many hours into it.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1] Anyone who bothered reading this, will probably say I'm just \"hitching\" and giving it a negative review simply because the Achievements, which I am to blame for forcing myself to go through them.

Thanks, man!)\n\nPlease ignore the time put into this game.  There are massive grinds for achievements in this game...\n\n[i]Turbo Pug DX[/i] is a very frustrating runner game created in Unity...and it's the 2nd runner I've played involving a dog (the first being [i]Montaro[/i], who is playable in this game as well.)  As like with many runners, you die...often.  The music will be burned into the depths of your mind as you grow increasingly frustrated from constant failures.\n\nIf you get enough letter pickups, you unlock ONE CHANCE at a minigame to play.  Learn it fast, because if you don't, you're dead.  If you want to replay the same event, you must get all the letter pickups two more times.   Why 2 more times?  Because the game is set to put the two minigames in rotation.  If you've beaten one and only want to play the other, you must trigger the minigame you want by only reaching the minigame you don't want to play.  If that's not bad enough, you often get repeat letters you don't want.  Example:  \"U, U, U, X, U, U, P, U, U, U, U, G, U, U, X, U, O, X, P, U, U\"  (That's recorded from a single run of actual gameplay)\n\nThere appears to be a visual error where \"coin\" pickups (which unlock character skins, a few with a different playstyle) can either be picked up twice by being touched once, or they simply don't appear (the latter is true of chests, which grant 5 \"coins\").  You'll find coins to be absolutely worthless when you unlock the last character.  There's also a questionable hitbox when it comes to certain areas and certain characters (much like the final character you unlock).\n\nBut not everything in [i]Turbo Pug DX[/i] is bad.  The game's visuals are pretty good and the programming for the section randomizer is pretty well-done (though some areas will get repetitive and you'll find areas that are devoid of letter pickups...some balancing is in order).\n\n\nIs it worth your money?  Although it looks good, my experience leads to a disappointing \"no\".  For the same money, you'll be better off with [i]Montaro[/i] (which has schoolgirls and pantsu).  I can't stop you from making your purchase, but if you value your sanity and don't enjoy a stressful experience of frustration and hair-tearing frustration...you might want to think twice.  It's not a BAD game...I just don't recommend it due to the stress it induced.\n\n2/10  A very frustrating runner involving a pug and other animals.", "timestamp_created": 1485146475, "timestamp_updated": 1614976941, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519804060459136963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29347199": {"recommendationid": "29347199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246109022", "num_games_owned": 1782, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1485790507}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great but when you try to jump, it jumps after 0.20 seconds or somthing like that", "timestamp_created": 1484786285, "timestamp_updated": 1484786285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.388961344957351685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29273483": {"recommendationid": "29273483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118216949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1485963381}, "language": "english", "review": "I love pupper...\n\nI love dogo....\n\nI love turbo pug <3", "timestamp_created": 1484489049, "timestamp_updated": 1484489049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420950531959533691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29146878": {"recommendationid": "29146878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181830633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1483551782}, "language": "english", "review": "Turboooooo PUG", "timestamp_created": 1483987295, "timestamp_updated": 1483987295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399492710828781128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28993262": {"recommendationid": "28993262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126111641", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1577916124}, "language": "english", "review": "Pug go fast.

Turbopug DX mostly certainly falls into the latter category while also suffering from being just not fun to play. It\u2019s cute motif and deceptively alright soundtrack may be attractive to some along with its low price, but there are certainly much better games of this genre out there.\n\nTurbopug DX follows the typical formula as other endless runners in which your character moves forward constantly and must avoid obstacles while gathering collectibles and going for a high score. Said collectibles come in the form of letters that spells out \u2018Turbopug DX\u2019 along with pug tokens that come in counts of one, five and twenty five which goes towards unlocking new types of pugs and animals to play as - This is all simple stuff that gives the game something to work towards while going for high scores, but unfortunately it falls apart when you actually start playing the game. To start, even with the game being controllable with a single button, I encountered many instances where my input would be eaten upon having my pug land on the ground and try to jump again immediately, like I had to wait for my jump to \u2018cool down\u2019 for a fleeting moment. This had runs frequently be robbed from me since the game runs rather quickly and requires jumps with tricky timing that need to be strung together, and often require the right landing otherwise your jump will be too early or too late and your pug will run headfirst into an obstacle. Jumping simply doesn\u2019t feel good because of the game\u2019s speed, with very little hang time once airborne before your pug plummets like a stone in water.\n\nThe overall issue with Turbopug DX however is that it simply becomes dull and painfully repetitive after twenty minutes once the cute charm has worn off. The level proceeds with obstacle \u2018sets\u2019, but these sets are limited and any sense of surprise is brief, making the game feel awfully stale in no time. The game does cycle between visual styles and even has a whole system to create, share and play with custom skins that are applied over the level, but that can only go so far when the game itself becomes boring and artificial means have to be used in order to freshen things up. Collecting letters to spell out the title of the game does let you play a minigame as a change of pace, but the issues here are twofold: For one, collecting those letters is based off of lucky spawn rates which means that when you\u2019re missing one or two letters you\u2019ll run into repeats more often than not, and split paths in the level can make you miss a needed one. Secondly, failing the minigame once kicks you back to the main menu and you have to collecting all the letters again to have another shot - Completing these minigames grants achievements, so by that margin it\u2019s really not worth the hassle.\n\nEven with a peppy soundtrack, very little saves Turbopug DX from being a cheap yet painfully drab experience. The cute aesthetic is strangely subverted with the fact that your pug can die, not limited to spikes and sawblades that have blood coating some of them - And that\u2019s on the default visual skin. The game is $1.09 (Canadian) so purchasing it will certainly not break the bank, but considering how there are endless runner games on mobile platforms for free that\u2019re better than this, there\u2019s no way I can recommend Turbopug DX unless you\u2019re a fanatic for pugs, endless runner or score attack games - Even then, this one is a hard sell due to being far too generic.", "timestamp_created": 1476696274, "timestamp_updated": 1476696490, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540963470935821533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26050833": {"recommendationid": "26050833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007553496", "num_games_owned": 4367, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1476546118}, "language": "english", "review": "To me a few things are important for the simple one-button endless runners.\n1.

If you like games like Super Meat Boy, I wanna be the guy, and Bit Trip Runner but wish they had a pug as the main character instead well then pony up the buck for this game and get that happy little bastard across the many maps and custom level skins there are!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQPLDXAKtqw", "timestamp_created": 1475746208, "timestamp_updated": 1475746208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503061234951019287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25852665": {"recommendationid": "25852665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073558863", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1475594696}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Est\u00e1 bien, la musica bien, el artwork bonito,\nEs divertido, rapido, y disfrutable, DURANTE UN RATO, \nEs un autoscroler, por mucho que me gusta la diversidad de genero en pc, este no es un juego para el, \nEn movil funcionaria mejor, con completo desconocimiento de si ya ha salido en el,\nPor el euro que vale, solo por la musica merece, \npero verdaderamente no habria ninguna diferencia si lo jugases en el movil, \ndespues de todo solo hay que usar 1 boton y hacerte unas pocas pantallas cuando vas en el autobus por ejemplo\n\nEst\u00e1 bien, es divertido, si est\u00e1 en movil, mejor compralo en movil.\nhttps://youtu.be/t_6rEOSXsds", "timestamp_created": 1475581117, "timestamp_updated": 1475581642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487200826406478882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25844729": {"recommendationid": "25844729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123780081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1607416063}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hands down one of my favorite games in the world.
