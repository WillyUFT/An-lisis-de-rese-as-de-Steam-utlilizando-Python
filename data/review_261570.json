I will analyse the [b]Ori and Blind Forest[/b] from four aspects.\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Project[/th]\n        [th]Score[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Plot[/td]\n        [td]9.0/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Music[/td]\n        [td]9.5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Operation[/td]\n        [td]8.5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Layout[/td]\n        [td]9.0/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overall[/td]\n        [td]36/4 = 9/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n[b]Plot[/b]\nA beautiful and perfect setting with a lovely and meaningful story behind it. I love the profound reflections behind this story on the meaning of protecting nature.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nI guess I have listened its soundtrack for the whole year already, the soundtrack is the highlight of this game, very epic, and the BGM selected for different zones is very in line with theirs plot, environment and personality, as well as the adventure. This is commendable. My most favorite one is \"Ginso Tree Escape\" and this is also where I played the most. Love it. 9.5 points.\n\n[b]Operating[/b]\nFirst of all, it is recommended to operate the controller. It is difficult to achieve lots of actions and a comfortable experience for keyboard operation, so this is a game on the game pad. But there one I am not quite into it is the run-jump. It sometimes makes you feel whether you can reach to the stage or not with great uncertainty. But apart from this, the operation is overall good. \n\n[b]Layout[/b]\nThroughout the game, it is not difficult but quite challenging which brings the vivid layout for this game. Some parts of the world, though you will not get through it if you encounter at the first time, with practice and time, you definitely will pass and enjoy it. And as an achievement player, I have obtained all the achievements already and felt really satisfied. Overall, 9 points.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nI give a rating of 9, which is also in line with the statistics close to the current Steam praise rate. This game is Epic and wonderful. I [b]recommend this game to anyone who should have a try tho.[/b] The deeper and more detailed you play, the better experience and the endless fun you will have.", "timestamp_created": 1700737207, "timestamp_updated": 1700737207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151182770": {"recommendationid": "151182770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236840894", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 815, "last_played": 1634848494}, "language": "english", "review": "The beautiful and challenging adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1700692898, "timestamp_updated": 1700692898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151176816": {"recommendationid": "151176816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405443953", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1618229169}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1700691089, "timestamp_updated": 1700691466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151145665": {"recommendationid": "151145665", "author": {"steamid": "76561199337787374", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 273, "playtime_at_review": 885, "last_played": 1700597870}, "language": "spanish", "review": "My experience after finish the game (Soon all archievements):\n\nThis game is a wonderful experience.

All that being said, I think it speaks to the beauty, challenge and pure FUN of this game that I kept coming back again and again with a smile on my face when I finally got it. It is not an easy game by any means, but I love that it isn't! \n\nI don't play games like this often and this was my first true 'requires building skill if you want to get anywhere' game.

Basically, it's a large click fest. The enemies in this game are quite strong and Ori is kind of weak so most of the time you'll find yourself awkwardly trying to dodge enemy projectiles or attacks (which can often 2-shot you or even 1-shot you no matter how large your health is) while clicking like a madman in order to damage them with your flame. This game is way too much focused on combat (which is not very well done, to make matters worse) rather than exploring which is the best portion of the game and definitely fulfills its role, as returning to areas and finding new items and powers are the best parts of this game.\n\nSo, to sum it up, this game tries to play on visual and atmospheric side in order to hide the fact that the gameplay is full of quite strange designer choices that make the game quite a chore to play as opposed to a fun ride.\n\nNice music and visuals, but a poor story and no real lore!", "timestamp_created": 1691936310, "timestamp_updated": 1697137369, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526132404804229736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144075862": {"recommendationid": "144075862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970862866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1691919102}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a excellent game with a wonderful music and fantastic art style .all in all i like this game", "timestamp_created": 1691919420, "timestamp_updated": 1691919420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584905624389648438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144061623": {"recommendationid": "144061623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295697749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1691904744}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1691904790, "timestamp_updated": 1691904790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143696510": {"recommendationid": "143696510", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100430330", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1691556016}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good game at its time and even now.

W R O N G. the game's design is literally so ungodly difficult which combined with a very much problematic lack of energy pickups makes saving a near constant necessity to make any progress whatsoever. this is due to the game basically not having a checkpoint system; it will literally reset all of your progress if you don't save every 2 seconds. this gets rather annoying because EVERYTHING will kill you. touch a thorn? all your health vanishes faster than haitian relief funds at the clinton foundation. too many projectiles clogging up where you can go? your health drops faster than my credit score. simply touch a slime on accident? it's like watching a mexican kid get slapped by a sandal, that little sucker loses a chunk of his soul. when this game gets into the late stages of the story, things get (even more) difficult. your brain has to operate like the gpu for the james webb telescope. basic accomplishments require millions of tiny micro-adjustments to the point where if people could see what im doing with my hands playing this game i might just get a girlfriend. one last note; I actually really hate the skill trees in this game. you kill so many enemies and get very little xp for each and with different skills having different costs and even prerequisites it gets very expensive to make a noticeable change. word of advice though: max out the blue and purple trees first as those are the ones that allow you to survive long enough to make a save. getting skills barely improves anything and finding things like life cells (pickups that increase your max health because yeah it's not your skill points that do that it's a bunch of hidden pickups strategically placed around the map so you have to repetitively die to learn how to get one) and energy cells (which virtually don't exist) is tedious at best. pls collect my spirit energy", "timestamp_created": 1686974519, "timestamp_updated": 1686974519, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496815264225006104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140141088": {"recommendationid": "140141088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279697195", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 753, "last_played": 1688945249}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't usually play steam games but this was fantastic.

Hollow Knight is one of my favorite games so I thought I would enjoy this game, because it has a similar atmosphere and the platforming action is very similar, but surprisingly it got annoying. There are a couple issues that stick out for me:\n\n1. Occasionally the game will autosave under very bad circumstances. I encountered a part fairly early in the game where it autosaved before a boss, when I had only 1 health point and no energy points. Although I could leave without fighting the boss, it was quite a nuisance to try over and over to make it safely back somewhere I could recover. I would not have chosen to save there had I the choice.\n\n2. Too many areas that are so difficult that you just end up playing them over and over and over and over... Basically \"Nope, I died. Nope, I died. Nope, I died.\" On and on and on. It just stopped being fun eventually. I get that Hollow Knight also has difficult areas, but it didn't bother me like this. What finally did me in was the part where that tree fills up with water. Normally in a game like this, when I lose I at least like to be able to let my fingers relax and breathe and think things through before continuing. This part of the game, when you die it starts you into an area where you will die again if you do not immediately act.

What a beautiful game!  The music, art, and story were an endearing accompaniment to a creative and challenging 2D puzzle platformer in the vein of \"Metroid\".  \n\nThe generous save states ensure that the game doesn't become too frustrating by allowing you to frequently create your own checkpoints to break down tricky puzzles (and there are plenty of these!) into more manageable pieces for trial and error.\n\nMy only complaint is that there isn't more of it!  The game is fairly brief, although there is some additional value for completionists who wish to go back and explore every inch of the world by using their new-found skills to access the previously inaccessible.\n\nThere are also multiple difficulty modes including a one-life mode for the masochists.  But be warned!  While \"easy\" mode adjusts damage taken by enemies and the like, it doesn't seem to otherwise affect the challenging platforming and puzzle elements that comprise the meat of this game.  So, if you were considering this game for the cute story, art, and music and platforming isn't really your thing, \"Ori\" might be a poor choice!\n\nAlso, if you were expecting a game with a lot of combat-oriented challenges, this is not it.  Ori is not a fighter.  Enemies serve as obstacles or pieces in the many puzzles you'll encounter.  Instead of epic boss battles, you'll find thrilling escape sequences featuring challenging platforming under time pressure.  \n\nThe first of which, the \"Ginso Tree Escape\" is one of the most fun and memorable such challenges I've ever experienced, in fact!  It introduces a clever mechanic unique to \"Ori\" (as far as I'm aware?) and wastes no time in getting you acquainted with it!\n\nI was looking for a Metroid-like 2D platformer and \"Ori\" didn't disappoint!  If this style of game is your thing, this one is not to be missed!

All you need to is:\n\n- Chain someone to your gaming chair;\n- Make them play first ten minutes of Ori and the Blind Forest;\n- Listen to any \"awwww\" sounds. \n\nSeriously, this game is so awwww-some that I don't think most human beings have a capacity to withhold such overwhelming cuteness, unless something is terribly wrong with them. Going through Ori's intro sequence is like watching a duckling that falls to sleep next to a bunch of small kittens. This game enchants you quickly, sucks you into its world in a matter of seconds and just like someone who failed the aforementioned test, it will never let you forget it.\n\nIn case it wasn't obvious before and by some miracle you've missed all the screenshots, I'll state the obvious: it's a TRULY BEAUTIFUL GAME. Vividly drawn landscapes and happy fluid animations are parts of its charm, but combined with an ABSOLUTELY GENIUS SOUNDTRACK create a true feast for the senses; one that will only be depreciated by inventing edible strawberry-flavored monitors. The simple act of just pacing around is a great audio-visual experience, but along with the looks comes a surprisingly well-written story, giving our movements a deeper purpose. Despite its simplicity and Disneyesque qualities, it's told quite well, shifting the moods along the ride. While Ori is generally a joyful experience, it can also be full of tension or filled with grim solemnity. Each area has its own mood, making the world feel incredibly alive.\n\nGame's great atmosphere and soothing colors are important for other reasons, namely calming us down. Ori has a QUITE HIGH DIFFICULTY LEVEL, that's usually somewhere between \"that's gonna be a challenge\" and \"Oh, hell no\". The whole game area is one giant level, divided into smaller areas, creating something that gaming PhDs would call \"Metroidvania-inspired platformer\". While at first the road ahead is quite easy and straightforward, Ori quickly learns a bunch of new abilities that broaden the area of exploration to the size of New Caledonia. Curiosity and good eyes are often rewarded with the additional XP and power-ups, so there's a good reason to stray often from our path, but it's also incredibly easy to get lost in the huge sprawling environment. And sometimes you're going to waste time trying to beat a challenge that looks do-able, but it can only be done with certain skills that you don't yet possess. Some sections are just also old-fashionably hard, especially when you had the misfortune of saving the game with a low amount of health. When you painstakingly try to make your way through the level for the 20th time even the beauty of the world around can be lost. \n\nDespite giving us a harsh time now and then, Ori and the Blind Forest remains a PHENOMENAL game. The definitive edition is probably the best way to start the adventure with it, since it offers more content, new abilities, option to adjust difficulty and various quality of life improvements, etc., but you still won't be disappointed by going for the original version.

Do you expect me to grab all those collectibles on the first go?) Better yet, grab Will of the Wisps, which improves in every single way (except for two minor details that nobody apart from me will care about).\n\nThe gameplay is really fun.

The art is probably what stands out the most, but that's only because the controls are so well implemented, they never really took me out of this immersive - and touching - story. Not for a second, honestly.\n\nIt was sufficiently challenging for me as a seasoned gamer, but I'm more than sure it shouldn't be frustrating for any casual gamer who doesn't possess a really, really short temper. In fact, I cannot think of another game that made me care so little about dying and having to repeat the same difficult scenes. To the opposite: I was so excited by them (in no small part thanks to the amazing soundtrack and artwork that surely accompanied), that I sometimes died on purpose at the end of a tough part to try to play it again more perfectly. I feel like this is a really big deal and I hope you believe me.\n\nI can honestly think of only one con: you cannot (as of yet at least) continue playing your save after you finish the game. I wish I had known this before, because I truly wanted to go back and finish it 100% - something I'm not at all used to - but I'm sure I'll play through it again. By the way, I makes me happy that the Ori has TEN different slots for you and your family/friends to start a game on. I don't understand why so many games lack that.\n\nIn short, I HIGHLY recommend playing Ori, and I can see no contraindications to warn buyers of. Gameplay, art and soundtrack are truly remarkable, and the story is surprising and nothing short of beautiful. This is a game that stands out, and one to remember for a long, long time. Thank you and congratulations to the developers for making such a brilliant game, and selling it for such fair price.\n\nI'll finish by quoting another reviewer: \"Oh how I wish there were more games like this one, especially when they come out of nowhere like this one did.\"\n\nOne of the best things I've played.", "timestamp_created": 1682860743, "timestamp_updated": 1682860743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824052989482879639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137514417": {"recommendationid": "137514417", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994932545", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1682806285}, "language": "english", "review": "Waste of time.

[/h1]\n\n[b] Uno de los mejores exponentes de un g\u00e9nero [/b]\n\nMuy a mi pesar, postergue demasiado esta obra, y es que me he estado perdiendo de uno de los mejores t\u00edtulos del que se ha convertido en uno de mis g\u00e9neros favoritos de los videojuegos, y es que Ori and the Blind Forest sabe llevar la formula Metroidvania a un nivel excelso mediante un trayecto que resulta muy... ef\u00edmero. El juego es muy corto, mas en tan poco tiempo ha sabido llegarle al jugador con un gameplay s\u00f3lido, y una historia que aunque demuestre simpleza, es extremadamente funcional para este ambiente.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest es probablemente el juego en 2 dimensiones m\u00e1s magn\u00edfico que he tenido el honor de presenciar, no existe una sola zona, paisaje o recoveco en donde no se note el mimo que le han puesto al crear este juego, la cantidad de capas que posee el fondo es sencillamente deslumbrante, incluso me atrever\u00eda a decir que es de lo mas hermoso que he contemplado no solo a nivel de juegos en 2 dimensiones, sino en toda la historia de los videojuegos. Y a pesar de que en CONTADAS ocasiones Ori puede tener problemas visuales al no ser capaces de distinguir entre el terreno que el juego posee y el fondo de un paisaje, no es nada que considero se le pueda reprender.\n\nEn Moon Studios han encontrado un equilibrio casi perfecto entre secciones de plataformeo y de combate, estando pr\u00e1cticamente combinadas la una con la otra, permiti\u00e9ndonos a la vez vislumbrar la preciosura que se encuentra fuera del foco principal del juego al ponernos una interfaz s\u00faper simple y poco molesta que nada cubre de la pantalla, ya que Ori sabe que su punto \u00e1lgido no son sus controles ni su c\u00e1ndido sistema de lucha, sino como su apartado audiovisual se acopla a lo susodicho, Ori es, sencillamente, una coreograf\u00eda que tiene al espectador bailando al son que \u00e9l desea, cuando lo desea. \n\nY es por ello que en Moon Studios no quisieron hacer de su juego un desaf\u00edo, sino un viaje, y vaya que lo lograron; si bien soy consciente de que la Definitive Edition tiene mejoras como el buen uso de los estanques como puntos de teletransportaci\u00f3n, no me ha gustado nada que le hayan agregado niveles de dificultad a un t\u00edtulo que no lo necesitaba, ya que precisamente eso es lo que un desaf\u00edo es, y no un viaje; esto lo menciono habiendo vivenciado de primera mano la dificultad dif\u00edcil, la cual honestamente creo cambia radicalmente la experiencia que el juego quiere ofrecer, uno de los puntos m\u00e1s fuertes de Ori es su simpleza, que con tan poco, tanto logra.\n\nOtra mec\u00e1nica que posee Ori muy bien implementada, es su \u00e1rbol de habilidades, el cual si bien no es muy variado, contiene lo suficiente como para fomentar la exploraci\u00f3n y a la vez hacerte sentir una sensaci\u00f3n de progreso digna de un Metroidvania, ya que Ori sabe perfectamente d\u00f3nde y cu\u00e1ndo otorgarte las habilidades de su repertorio, y sabe explotarlas al m\u00e1ximo. Es alucinante como es capaz de cambiar tan dr\u00e1sticamente el ritmo y la sensaci\u00f3n tanto de movimiento como de exploraci\u00f3n con tan solo una nueva habilidad o alteraci\u00f3n en el mapa, y es que en este aspecto, Ori es el mejor ejemplo de lo que \"progreso\" deber\u00eda significar en un videojuego.\n\n[spoiler] Si bien es cierto que el punto fuerte de Ori es su sencillez a la hora de narrarnos toda una experiencia, siendo el objetivo del juego conmovernos, lo cual logra con creces... y a la vez no. La historia de Ori f\u00e1cilmente se trata de una especie de... \u00bfperro? que resulta ser la esencia del \u00c1rbol de Esp\u00edritu, y al Ori desentonarse de dicho \u00e1rbol, el bosque se fue a la ruina, para recuperar a Ori el \u00e1rbol emiti\u00f3 una luz que era mortal para los B\u00fahos, lo que nos lleva a nuestro antagonista, Kuro, quien solo quer\u00eda proteger a sus cr\u00edas, al fallar en el intento estorbando a nuestro protagonista, cegada por el odio su \u00fanico objetivo en mente es acabar con Ori, ech\u00e1ndose atr\u00e1s al ver que el \"padre adoptivo\" de Ori le demostraba el mismo cari\u00f1o que ella a sus cr\u00edas.....\nSuena a que tuvieron que acortar su historia para que quepa dentro de la duraci\u00f3n del juego, y que no se me malinterprete, la historia si funciona muy bien acoplado de la maravila visual y la inigualable banda sonora que el juego tiene, simplemente dicho desenlace no se siente... apropiado, es forzado, y aunque se nota que quisieron hacerlo de forma que tocara el coraz\u00f3n del jugador, en mi caso, no lo lograron de esa forma, al menos no mediante su narrativa, ya que todos sus otros \u00e1mbitos me llegan al alma, sobre todo en sus momentos de auge cuando el reloj esta sonando mientras que has de moverte a toda prisa y de fondo suena una pista que a cualquiera fascinar\u00eda. [/spoiler]\n\nA d\u00eda de hoy, comprendo por que este juego es en cierta medida, la \"competencia\" del que es mi juego favorito y el que creo posee el t\u00edtulo de mejor Metroidvania existente, Hollow Knight. Independientemente de que crea imposible para Ori superarlo, si lo considero como una entrada excelente al g\u00e9nero, y en definitiva una de las mejores experiencias audiovisuales que dif\u00edcilmente alguien podr\u00eda olvidar.", "timestamp_created": 1680147914, "timestamp_updated": 1680148097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135630044": {"recommendationid": "135630044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199323292591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1682027854}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1680034452, "timestamp_updated": 1680034452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135586346": {"recommendationid": "135586346", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046973926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 718, "last_played": 1679980205}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Though they are gone from our forest, there is no time to greave.

The platforming aspects do little to make up for this, as the jump (particularly the wall jump) is frustrating and sometimes does not register clicks, and the double and wall jumps are not consistent in their distance despite deliberately trying to repeat particular jumps with the same timing and motions. Maybe it is unfair to compare it to Hollow Knight, where the platforming was smooth and natural and consistent, but Ori just doesn't meet expectations.

Tasked with saving the forest through love, and a lot more violence. Yah that's a good assessment of the game boiled down to its most basic components. -----------------------------------------------------------Love and Violence. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Important thing I should stay is that the vary beginning and end of the game are less games as they are interactive stories. so this game is both an interactive story and a metroidvania. so for like 20 minutes out of a 9 hour campaign you'll be in a story.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now to start with the game both looks and sounds incredible. And I haven't seen that elsewhere. I've seen good lookin', I've seen good singin'. But ain't I ever seen a game that dose both. The game has only a few tracks but there all good and fit the tone Vary well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The gameplay isn't bad ether. its rather good... In the beginning it is just buttin' mashing but a lot of the enemies are areal, as to keep you moving. the jig is to stay in range to damage but keep moving to avoid damage. it can be challenging as sometimes your character would blend-in, in a fight but it doesn't happen often. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Progressing in this game is also a love in hate thing where the game NEVER thinks your dumber than you are. It thinks your a Big brain problem solving man who can take a hint and figure it out. And treats you so, a nice breath of fresh air. The hate part of this is when your playing the game for the first time the game actually over steps and thinks a tad too much of you. So on your first play through you will look up a walk through at least twice, for me four times. One time all I need to know was that there was a lever to pull. But because the game doesn't tell you anything you sometime will question if you even have what you need to progress. HOWEVER take that same statement form progression to traversal and it becomes almost magical. You will find a lot of spots where you question how tf am I suposto get there but then you think a bit more and see the developers were really smart. And exploring in this game is HEAVILY reworded.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My least favorite parts of the game were unfortunately the main events on getting the elements. why?Well you see. This game is not an easy game and has a vary \"get good scrub attitude\" but a healthy one; because you can always see what you need to do, you just gota doit right. Well in these main events, for whatever ression the difficulty skyrockets because their platforming is hard as shit on there own, you cant save in the middle of them so you have to do it perfect and you have no way of seeing further ahead IE knowing what to do untill you die a dozen times. But when you do complete them, wow. I love how the world changes to become more vibrant but also easier to traverse and access more to traverse.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ori and the Blind Forest is a game where whats good is REALLY GOOD and whats bad is pretty bad.but don't worry there's a lot more good than there is bad.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Awards: {Love and Hate} {Optical sugar rush} {Crossbred game tipe}", "timestamp_created": 1679351999, "timestamp_updated": 1693030021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134993253": {"recommendationid": "134993253", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121113147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1679255733}, "language": "english", "review": "w", "timestamp_created": 1679255753, "timestamp_updated": 1679255753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134981586": {"recommendationid": "134981586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169462091", "num_games_owned": 2788, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1609372587}, "language": "english", "review": "Ori and the Blind Forest is like, the ultimate platformer game. \n\nYou get to play as a cute little spirit creature and jump, dash, and glide through a magical forest.

From there it's no real narrative and the scenery is never really as striking anymore, but hurr durr gotta suck off the indie title because it has an artstyle even though the game itself does everything in its power to annoy you. Gameplay itself is pretty generic, honestly it's pretty basic as far as platformers go, but it's Ori's rage inducing segments that feel out of place and really makes me wish people looked at the game more critically. In a game that should really prioritize flow of movement and making traversal feel smooth and satisfying, you frequently run into horrible sequences of obstacles that have you repeating the same segment over and over. These random difficulty spikes are jarring and feel arbitrary. Can't exactly enjoy the scenery when you want to punch a hole through your monitor. For some perspective last I played this my game got soft locked in some death loop area that made zero sense and I haven't played since. Seemingly no one remembers or acknowledges these issues with the game and it's kind of astonishing the way everyone seems to have rose tinted glasses after playing the intro. Maybe that's a testament to it's effectiveness as an opening act but I still have my reservations.\n\nThis is not an overtly bad game but it's merely serviceable, and leaves no lasting positive impression aside from it's intro sequence. The only 2 things I immediately associate with this game is Winnie the Pooh lookin ass and the frustrating gameplay. Yet Ori has always been declared as a masterpiece seemingly by default, The advertising for the sequel is a testament to this where it just feels like the devs pleasuring themselves to their creation. The marketing boils down to them just saying it's ORI again ORI is back the critically aclaimed masterpiece game of the year edition of all time ORI and then they just plaster review scores all over the place. Maybe I'm just cynical but I don't buy it, if we're going to use an accurate scale 4/10 feels fair for Ori, it's okay but it's good points really won't blow your mind or leave you with a strong lasting impression.

The level design is great overall, but these parts seem rather mechanical and bit out-of-place.\n \nHowever, these complaints do not affect the final score that much - this is still a wonderful game.", "timestamp_created": 1674429891, "timestamp_updated": 1674430128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131306954": {"recommendationid": "131306954", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228824027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2979, "last_played": 1674349878}, "language": "english", "review": "cute, good story, pretty visuals, I played this version before the definitive version (still havent) so I was losing my mind a little but that's what makes completing it so much more fulfilling ! all in all def recommend \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1674350666, "timestamp_updated": 1674350666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131262091": {"recommendationid": "131262091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164558401", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1674306620}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the definitive edition first and realized that it also came with the original.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game as a present from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

This is a platform-centric metroidvania, which I love, and want to see more of.\n\nOne major drawback of this game is the extremely limited content. Especially in terms of difficulty. This is a platform-centric metroidvania, yet the hardest platforming challenges took no more than 20 minutes for me to beat on my first attempt. That means there's no endgame.

The main focus is survival, not getting hit, not jumping into the void or thorns or lava.\n\nI also liked that most of the story is not communicated by dialog but cut-scenes.\n\nLoved the boss fights, loved the dungeons, loved the swimming concept and especially the fighting and frequent dying was rather well designed. Never felt like having to wait too long or doing the same stuff twice - this is in total contrast to games like Mega man, Super mario games from GB/NES/SNES era.\n\nThere are so many little parts in the map you can't visit at first, but when you come back later there is some power-up or story element to discover. Assisted by a wonderful minimap.\n\nThe soundtrack is just amazing and embeds seamlessly into the game world. The sounds are well designd and I did not find a single thing I did not like. The music was what drove me to ORI in the first place.\n\nSame goes for the graphics, the Steam Deck did have perfect 60 FPS while remaining cold - low power usage. There was not a single issue with the proton emulation of the game either, except, suspend&resum cycle triggered an audio stutter where one has to restart the game.\n\n# cons\n\nThe story itself is very good, love all the different districts the game visits, characters and especially animations. Where ori falls a bit short is the synchronization, which is keept cross-country, but for me it killed the immersion. Instead I would love a native speaker, instead of a text-bubbles with the foreign language speaker. Nintendo does this universal language stuff in their modern Switch games also which really annoys me. \nI loved the way the text bubbles were rendered into the level tough, just amazing!\n\n# summary\n\nGet this game, play it on the steam deck or switch, it is just amazing!!!\n\nHope more developers would create their games in this way.

But this review isn't about that, it's about the hell that is \"getting all achievements in ORi and the Blind Forest\".\nTo start with the biggest problem of all: Even though the game looks beautiful, the performance is attrocious so you have to turn down your graphics to the point where it looks like a blocky pixel game from the 90s, thus making one of its good values irrelevant.\nSecond of all, the movement, while fluid, has inconsistencies, especially when it comes to wall jumps. Some surfaces are jagged in the weirdest ways and your character just slips off them and falls into spikes. Said spikes usually have weird hitboxes and deal a lot of damage so getting a couple life orbs or being absolutely perfect feels mandatory for any deathless attempts\nSpeaking of which, the game is not at all suited for deathless runs, nor many other achievements it has on Steam. All lasers kill you instantly, regardless of your hp, making some platforming sections horrendous. There even are enemies who shoot lasers and you can probably guess how much fun you're going to have with those. Lack of consistency, poor performance and occasional lag spikes don't help the overall flow. \nThe achievement for finding all secrets is bugged and sometimes doesn't update despite finding a new secret. The map sometimes doesn't show collectibles even if you buy upgrades that should make them visible on it.\nThe gliding mechanic has weird hiccups when you tap the glide button. Tap gliding is required in a couple tight tunnels if you don't want to smash your face against a spike, and the hiccups make it annoyingly difficult.\nIn this version you can't teleport anywhere, making backtracking a chore and you can't access some core story-related areas after leaving them (the \"dungeons\") so if you miss a life cell or some percentage of the map revealed, you need to start over or constantly make backup saves\n\nMost of these problems are fixed in the Definitive Edition, so if you want to have fun with the game, I recommend buying that one, but even DE isn't free of many of the mistakes that this game has in store. The final area, which is the most annoying, poorly-designed hellscape I've seen in a while, is untouched, and just as tedious in DE as it is in this here vanilla version.\n\nMade a bet with a friend to get all achievements, I regret ever agreeing on that.

There is no teleportation feature. Backtracking from one end to another is your only option in the game if you missed something.\n2. There is no dash (not a really big deal if you don't mind running from places to places, also speedrunning is an achievement in the game).\n3. Achievements in this game can be quite glitchy to properly obtain.\n4. Some major-plot areas become locked after you finish, no backtracking to loot stuff you missed.\n5. Once you finish the game on a playthrough, you can't enter that save file again to get 100%.\n6. Terrible performance on low graphics + game has a lot of bugs.\n7. Combat is... just mashing a button.\n8. Level design isn't friendly with the No-death achievement given lasers always one-shot, spiked terrains has weird hitbox, and puzzles has few rooms for error to not die unpredictably.\n\nLeave this normal version to rot and go play Definitive version to save your brain from damage and your friends from all the nagging you make trying to perfect the game.

It's a literal example of the \"Games as Art\" trope and that is not a bad thing, it looks like a moving painting and easily rivals the best of what Japanese developer Vanillaware has to offer. Simply put, this game is one of the best looking action platformers. It's sequel eclipses it that much more. Story wise, without giving away too much spoilers, you play as Ori, a character whose unique appearance belies explanation, but whose story starts off with tragedy. Ori begins their journey to explore the Nibel where the balance of light and dark has gone awry, and finds out what their destiny is. The story is explained in vignettes scattered throughout the game as you progress further within. Fun fact: Ori is a name that means \"My Light\" in Hebrew, fitting since the character you play is literally a being of light. Gameplay wise, it's a Metroidvania, meaning that you are playing through a large, labyrinthine maze that is all connected to a central hub, fighting creatures using your abilities that you have, and yes, you end up gaining more abilities as the game progresses through fighting enemies to gain what are known as ability points, which is a mechanic used to grant Ori, the game's titular main character, new abilities that help them progress throughout.\nAll in all, no matter what platform you get this game and its incredible sequel on, you're in for a treat all around. Ori and the Blind Forest is one of those rare gems that is just stunning to look at and an absolute joy to play once you master the mechanics given to you throughout.

So even though they are marked on the map sometimes, you still dont know if you can actually reach them or not. Sometimes you dont even know right away if you just need to try harder to reach it or if you need to come back for it.

Rhombus shaped stalactites - possibly formed of ice - that damage you. Large boulders of different shapes with different shaped stalactites that instantly kill you but these are mixed together in both the fore and background. The first 'escape' sequence had water rushing beneath you but the vibration felt somewhat appropriate. But in the 'wind' escape sequence it's just a constant uninformative painful shake that seems determined to undermine your control. I stopped playing it halfway through because I stopped feeling like the game would be fair.\n\nOkay I got a stubborn streak I guess - I did complete it. The chase sequences are very cinematic in their own way but I will have to check to see if they feature in the sequel before I play it. I think this game was trying to be Nintendo hard but has a degree of 'fuzziness' on ledges and far too many ledges had unnecessary spikes. It would have been fine in a 'speed test' or 'hard' mode but by the time I got to the games conclusion after spending so long on the final sequence I wasn't in a good mood and that made me overly critical instead of empathetic. \n\nThe games plots too confusing for me to recommend.

I have rarely seen such games drawn so colorfully and in detail.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple, but the mechanics are not the main thing here. The fighting is easy, mostly you need to jump and climb.

Absolutely gorgeous visuals, and the score is fantastic. If videogames are a form of art, then Ori is a masterclass in aesthetics. The animation is fluid, the colour schemes are gorgeous, and the character silhouettes are perfect.\n\nThe mood was touching, with the cutscenes and music playing together to evoke the emotions the devs wanted you to feel, and the storyline's conclusion is sharp, but lovely.\n\nGameplay wise, I had some issues with it. I had to play it with a keyboard and mouse and the amount of wrong inputs caused many a death. A lot of the collision on the spikes in particular seemed a little off, and enemy attacks and Ori's attacks often covered each other to the point you couldn't adjust in time.\n\nMy biggest issue was the escape sequences. The rubber banding in the water level made double jumping awkward, and you basically had to execute the entire sequence flawlessly by memory, rather than reacting to objects coming up. The difficulty levels are somewhat unbalanced.\n\nHowever, the powerups are interesting, and the utility tree helped make the last sections slightly easier. Some of the abilities themselves could have been adjusted to streamline movement, but for the most part they worked with the platforming aspect.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the visuals, the music, the story, and the general mood and environmental storytelling. The beginning levels and finding collectibles was fun, but the later half of the game was irritating and I came close to quitting entirely. \n\nI recommend it for the aesthetics, but not for casual players who aren't in the mood for constant resets, or if precise movement is difficult to manage.", "timestamp_created": 1641546920, "timestamp_updated": 1641546920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107465376": {"recommendationid": "107465376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306219514", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 699, "last_played": 1641494048}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1641494102, "timestamp_updated": 1641494102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107409611": {"recommendationid": "107409611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118406320", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1640714419}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1641423626, "timestamp_updated": 1641423626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107352053": {"recommendationid": "107352053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048292673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 988, "last_played": 1641357312}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is the best game ever 100 of 10\n", "timestamp_created": 1641357359, "timestamp_updated": 1641357359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107277716": {"recommendationid": "107277716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857872926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1641785308}, "language": "english", "review": "Has a really story to it.

The platforming is brilliant. Ori controls perfectly. Movement is tight, but the motion is fluid. The translation of what your hands are doing and what you see on the screen is so intuitive. The pure kinetic joy of moving around the world of this game makes it so hard to put down.\n\nAll of these most basic strengths of Ori is what makes the game so enjoyable since it feeds into the other aspects of the game. It makes exploring the whole map and going after the collectibles fun because no matter how far anything is that you want to get to, you don't mind going there since the journey to that destination as you jump, dash, and run through the world is so enticing. And no matter how many times you die trying to accomplish a section of the game, you keep on doing it because it's challenging fun.\n\nThe level design in particular is marvelous. How the platforms are placed and spaced, both the static parts and moving parts and how the enemies are designed and carefully positioned in the map... all of that feels purposefully done.\n\nThen there are these \"escape\" sections, Indiana Jones-esque sequences which are perfect for giving you that slight burst of adrenaline. There's a part where you run away from a huge boulder. Another part where you run away from rushing lava. But the absolute highlight in this respect is the escape from the Ginzo Tree, which was such a rush.\n\nWhile the game design is one thing, how the abilities are designed to enable Ori to interact with this world is equally brilliant.   You're presented with so many well made sections for platforming and puzzle solving, then you're also given a swiss army knife of abilities with which to solve everything. These abilities are perfectly catered for the goal that they're supposed to help achieve, and there's no one way to solve much of this world, which makes using your abilities all the more engaging.\n\nBesides the gameplay though, the presentation of the game is great. The visuals are amazing and are perfectly complemented by one of the best soundtracks I've heard in years. The atmosphere of the game is so delicately \"zen\", with gorgeously lush and colorful flora.\n\nFinally... dem feels. My god, dem feels. Throughout the game there are only 2 characters that talk, Sein and the narrator and they both don't even talk much. The story of Ori and the Blind Forest is mostly told in vignettes, and it's a testament to this game's writing team how much an emotional punch the game delivers by saying so little. There are several sequences that are especially heartwrenching, but every little touch in this very simple story is just enough to tug at those heartstrings. The game touches on themes of love, kindness, and friendship so clearly that it's sad to leave these characters by the end.\n\nEverything is simply a triumph. I can't think of anything bad to say about Ori and the Blind Forest. I literally can't. I was so consumed by how fun it was to control Ori and use Ori's abilities. I was enthralled by how enjoyable it was to move Ori through this world that was so well designed. And throughout the whole experience, I was also emotionally driven by this brilliantly imagined world, with the music, visuals, and story all coming together to support how good the game is.

The visuals are stunning and the music is a masterpiece on its own. But I think you already gathered that from the other reviews, the reason I wanted to write a review myself is to add some nuance into the mix. \n\nFirst of all, I play games who have generally very tight controls (take hollow knight for example). This game's controls have a more \"floaty\" feeling which I had to get used to. It feels like the controls are less tight (but in reality they are, just keep that in mind). But don't get me wrong, once you get the hang of it, the movement feels incredible and is visually very pleasing.\n\nAs I said the visuals are stunning but can also be confusing at times. Background or enemies that are unintentionally obscured by foreground, not always clear indicators of what to do in certain places etc. I guess this is a compromise they had to make but it can lead to frustration.\n\nSpeaking about frustration: the escape sequences... I find those in my humble opinion very frustrating. Sure they are beautiful (like everything in this game) but they are not really about skill but more so about trial and error (unless you have really fast reflexes I guess). The trial and error part would not be so bad if you did not have to start from the beginning when you die. Some sequences are really long and require almost near perfection to complete. That all said: the pay-off when you complete such a sequence is incredible. I could feel my adrenaline rushing when everything was settled down. \n\nMy final point is that the game is fairly linear for a metroidvania. Sure new paths open up by acquiring new abilities but they are relatively limited and sometimes even meaningless. No fast travelling is available which can be annoying at times: To give an example, you can reach the final mountain of the game pretty early on by following a long path dashing from enemy to enemy. It was a disappointment to reach the final place only to find out that I needed a key to open it. All the way back I went ... the game has several of those moments where it lets you advance pretty far, only to find out that it is still a bit too early to come there, further discouraging exploration. I am not sure if this was intentionally or not but if you use your abilities creatively you can get to places you did not think you could reach. Also, upon completing the game I was not able to explore the world in more detail because your save file gets locked, again discouraging exploration.\n\nAs a conclusion, I really recommend that you give this game a try. The game has some interesting new concepts to offer (which are really satisfying), beautiful art, beautiful music and a very nice atmosphere.

There are many decades old games that are still better platformers than Ori. It\u2019s ironic how developers who more than likely grew up playing Castlevania: SOTN and Duck Tales can\u2019t create a game that topples their places as some of the best side-scrollers ever. This is tragic since Ori was developed over 5 years by a multinational team. It also shows how stagnant the gaming industry has become. When 20+ year old games are still considered the best in their genres, the future looks a bit glum for gamers.\n\nAfter playing a few hours, I noticed Ori suffers from many of the same flaws seen in the today\u2019s bestselling games. First, Ori\u2019s mechanics panders to gamers. Players only need to spam a button to attack. Death is hardly inconvenient because players can create spawn points. Objective markers guide players to their destinations. The story isn\u2019t bad and it was a lot of fun to play the 7 hours.\n\nSecond, Ori\u2019s emphasis is on visuals. Sure, Ori is pretty. But the platforming component\u2014which is supposedly the heart of this game\u2014is lackluster. Controlling the teensy creature is challenging enough without having to precisely land it on microscopic surfaces. Even on a 32\u201d screen, Ori is tiny. On the whole, the critter performs like a wet eel which results in an inordinate amount of frustration. Excellent visuals are trumped by imprecise controls. But numerous other decisions, such as bland map design and cheap deaths mar what could\u2019ve been one of the best gaming experiences in a while but with that... its just \"cool\" or \"good\".\n\nThird, difficulty is often contrived. Ori is a die-to-learn type of game. The developers intended for players to die, frequently. Many of these deaths result from Ori\u2019s imprecise controls. Other times players have to take leaps of faith because the path forward isn\u2019t clear. This happens a lot. And some sequences are just damn frustrating. I\u2019ve read complaints by gamers who died 12+ times completing specific sections. Their complaints stem from radical difficulty spikes. Ori\u2019s difficulty spikes from a 5 to 15 in certain areas. Some deaths are just cheap since players have absolutely no chance of reacting to invisible traps. Difficulty should increase organically, something the best platformers do right. Cheap deaths are\u2026well\u2026cheap. And Ori has too many \u201cgotcha\u201d moments. Ori muddles the distinction between challenging and fun.\n\nFourth, Ori suffers from poor level design. Progression is often hindered because hidden traps or overly difficult trial-and-error sequences stump players. Like the original Megaman games, Ori relies too much on memorization at times. And those games are notoriously tough to beat. Backtracking doesn\u2019t feel natural. That is a bit counter-intuitive for this style game. Its \"good\" as well don't get me wrong but it could be so much better.\n\nLast, Ori is short. People reported completing it in 6 or less hours just after release. Players who\u2019ve taken longer the complete Ori mentioned their insanely high death counts. I read one player died 436 times. That\u2019s ridiculously high. Some of the numbers were high enough to make Dark Souls look easy in comparison. Basically, a decent gamer can complete Ori in 6-7 hours. A less skilled gamer or someone not acclimated to platformers could spend considerably more time. This additional time is attributed to unfair design.\n\nUnderneath its pleasing aesthetics, Ori is an average / maybe \"mostly positive\" platformer. It\u2019s exemplifies how terrible current games really are when a mundane, but pretty, platformer is given such rave reviews. If I would rate it I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 since the Game is overall enjoyable but the \"Chase sequences\" after each \"temple\" are hardly trial and error and at this moment its not \"hard\" its just \"frustrating\" to die and learn that what you did was wrong and you need to do the whole sequence again...", "timestamp_created": 1635526987, "timestamp_updated": 1635533191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61543506383895874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101813228": {"recommendationid": "101813228", "author": {"steamid": "76561199052397122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1678953853}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente graficas y  jugabilidad de ptm", "timestamp_created": 1635513429, "timestamp_updated": 1635513429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101786312": {"recommendationid": "101786312", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072480234", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1634873556}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1635469826, "timestamp_updated": 1635469826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101741379": {"recommendationid": "101741379", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027115560", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1635399490}, "language": "english", "review": "I may be a bit late to the party, but Ori and The Blind Forest is a game everyone should play, a great metroidvania with a lovely story, and an absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\nWhile graphics aren't the most realistic thing ever, its an indie, and indie games are beautiful, the art style is one of my favorites and it definitely gives you the nature vibes this game is trying to show.\n\nReally enjoyed it, 10/10 now I'll try the Definitive Edition.", "timestamp_created": 1635400315, "timestamp_updated": 1694968390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101705187": {"recommendationid": "101705187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986569114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 320, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1635333932}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego de plataformas hermoso con una banda sonora espectacular.

It feels great to play and review a game that actually lives up to the hype.  For so long, I avoided playing through the Ori series.  Part of the reason for my abstinence, was skepticism about the high praise the game was getting.  I saw several reviews and glimpsed at a few playthroughs here-and-there for a few years, and never got enough motivation to dive in and see what all the fuss was about.  How I have wasted my time.  This game is amazing.   I wish I played it sooner, and was able to take part in experiencing it for the first time with the rest of the world.  I love this game.\n\n\nMore:\n\nOri and the Blind Forest is great.  That is simple and accurate enough praise to loosely capture the experience of playing it... yet there is so much more to it.  I thought that I had the general idea of what the game was before I played it.  Yet, I was wrong.  The artwork, the music, the story... I had heard all about them.  The experience of it, however... the sum of all of its parts... was something else entirely. \n\nIf you've heard anything about it, then you have probably heard about the artwork.  This game is gorgeous.  Even 6 years after its release, the timeless visuals, attention to detail, and unique character designs still look amazing and fresh.  A true spectacle, captivating and enchanting to behold, Ori evokes a sense of wonder and amazement while immersing you in a colorful, dangerous, and deep world.\n\nThe soundtrack is second to none.  If you love atmospheric music, then you will love the soundscape here.  While traversing the world, there are slow and soft piano melodies, accented with strings, and perhaps wind instruments.  I am not a musician, but I know a good tune when I hear it.  I'm almost certain that I am not accurately conveying the grandiosity of the soundtrack in this review... nor can I.  Just play the game.\n\nOri starts the journey as most things do... very small.  The game opens with a respectably long cinematic, which does a great job to get you invested.  Granted, it's not the best, or most unique story around, but it does a perfectly good job ushering you into the world on the other side of the title screen.  I did feel a bit disappointed after the opening.  I had a lot of questions, and I felt confused about what exactly was happening... however my understanding was more than sufficient to get the journey started.  After finishing the game, I really have no complaints about the story and how it began.  However, when I started, there was a feeling of doubt.\n\nYou meet lots of cool customers along your way through this world.  I did not see one enemy, or character design that I did not like.  This game definitely has its own 'feel' to it, and you can tell that the design team were all on the same page, or at least really vibing together when they were working on this.  I truly felt like I was in another world while I was playing this game.  So much so... that I just had to go back.\n\nIt goes without saying... the game isn't perfect... because, no game is.  No game can be perfect.  If a game is perfect... it's probably because the person scoring it is the same person that made it.  I'm sure there are people who think this is perfect.  I wouldn't even attempt to argue with them about that.  I'm sure there are also people who think this game is horrible (those people, however, I would give a verbal jabbing).  I had my fair share of vocal outbursts and heavy criticism while playing through this.  There were times when I thought that I absolutely hated this game.  Those times were when my progression was halted due to what I consider to be poor design.  It happened often enough that it did leave a bad taste in my mouth about the overall experience, yet it pales in comparison to everything else that Ori is, so much so, that it is almost not worth mentioning.  If I told someone that a glass marble that I was holding was a perfect sphere... and they broke out their laser micrometer to prove to me that it wasn't... then I would just agree to disagree.  I don't think Ori is perfect... because there are some parts that seem non-intuitive, and almost mean from a design perspective.  Some parts of this game appear as if they have been designed to be frustrating, hard to understand and predict, or that the designers wanted the players to fail / wanted the game to be more difficult.  Those times, though frustrating beyond belief, are to Ori and the Blind Forest what a microscopic scratch on a glass marble is to its overall 'roundness'.  \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the problems with Ori and the Blind Forest are strangely inconsequential and monumentally frustrating at the same time.  So much of this game is amazing, that those problems become microscopic in comparison.  I cannot remember the last time that I loved a game that caused me so much pain.  Ori and the Blind Forest is a perfect example of a something being perfectly-imperfect.  That is a phrase that I hate to use, yet it exists because of phenomenon like this.  \n\nI love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1634570822, "timestamp_updated": 1634570822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101227705": {"recommendationid": "101227705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330332243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1060, "last_played": 1635075349}, "language": "english", "review": "its a pretty good game", "timestamp_created": 1634519355, "timestamp_updated": 1634519355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101127901": {"recommendationid": "101127901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009749761", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4004, "last_played": 1659259274}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifull graphics and sound. interesting story.

I had a lot of trouble discerning enemy attacks (green, purple, orange) from my attacks (white), as well as the orbs received from killing enemies (yellow). I also had trouble discerning hazards and platforms from the foreground and background. I died a lot. I spent some time gathering health orbs but it doesn't really matter, there are plenty of insta-kill hazards scattered around. So I saved often. However, you can't save during boss sequences so I ended up doing the same sequences over a dozen times. The tension disappears after so many tries, turning the game into a slog with the same bland repetitive music playing throughout (I found the music to be forgettable). Ori's little death gasps became a droll metronome.  \nThe story is literal nonsense, you're a leaf from the spirit tree that fell off in a windstorm and this somehow kills nearly everything in the forest. The narrator (the spirit tree) intones \"OOOba DAAba DOOba\" over every cutscene, explaining how you (Ori) are important to restoring the light (but not too much light?) to the land, with a secondary expository NPC (Sein) explaining in detail all the McGuffins you're fetching or turning on. It doesn't matter at all: all you need to know is an owl hates you. \nThe one interesting mechanic which actually made the game fun would be the \"Dash\" mechanic, where you can get close to a projectile and press a button to dodge/boost in a direction, while the projectile goes in the other direction. This is used effectively for some fun mechanics, but I sometimes had trouble figuring out which projectiles enemies were \"dash-worthy\": you can't use dash on everything. \nIf you're looking for a platforming challenge, I'd like to recommend Celeste. If you're looking for a good Metroidvania, I'd recommend Symphony of the Night, Carrion, or Super Metroid. \nBut maybe you'll love this game, all I can tell you is I felt relief upon finishing and don't feel the need to ever play again.", "timestamp_created": 1632509902, "timestamp_updated": 1632510533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99836711": {"recommendationid": "99836711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052194790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 898, "last_played": 1632403970}, "language": "english", "review": "Ori and the blind forest is a game for those whom are seeking a challenging game with a beautiful story.\nAs someone who usually avoids game's focused on jumping puzzle mechanics i decided to give this game that had been sitting in my library a chance and i was very please with the game a a whole though with only a single issue.\nThe story was brilliant and paired with its art style and minimal voice acting brought a certain emphasis to the music helping it create a emotional pull for the player that draws you in to get lost in the story and makes you want to see what happens next.\nThe change of gameplay was interesting and challenging but the single issue i have with it was the fact that you cannot replay and explore once you finish the main story so be cautious if you wish to 100% each map do it before moving on to the next part of the story as some will become locked after you leave.\n\nIn total if you are looking for a change in gameplay that will challenge you and give you a good shorter story than usual Ori and The Blind Forest is a great game to pick up and play for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1632404999, "timestamp_updated": 1632404999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99715072": {"recommendationid": "99715072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211718504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2823, "last_played": 1678338801}, "language": "english", "review": "The soundtrack is Amazing, the Story and Art style is so beautifully crafted.

I encountered no bugs.\n-Okay gameplay\nClassic metroidvania. It starts a little slow. You gain new powers. I think dashing through enemies and projectiles and launching them is the best ability. It is original. Problem is when you get that you can just dash through enemies without fighting.

Ori's journey through the world to bring life back to everything is heartening, but I also love Kuro.  At the beginning she was painted as this terrible being that brought famine and darkness into the land, but the story does bring to light why she acts the way she does.  The final achievement before the game completes is my favorite because it demonstrates that love conquers all, and that is a very powerful lesson to teach, especially with a younger audience.  \n\nThe soundtrack beautifully demonstrates all of the emotions going through each of the areas of the game, from the scenery to the chase scenes.  I couldn't think of any better way to compose the soundtracks for each of the sections of the game.  I have purchased the soundtrack both physically and digitally so I can listen to it wherever I can.  \n\nThe achievements are also very plausible and give harder ones for people that are achievement hunters and like the challenge in games.  While I am one of those people, I personally thought the Find All Secrets achievement was really difficult.  I played through the game 3 times and I still couldn't get all the secrets to trigger so I could get the achievement.  However, I do realize those are for the people that want the challenge, and the game is otherwise perfect and wonderful.\n\nOverall, I absolutely would recommend playing the game (please do play the original first and then the Definitive Edition since there is added content) and then playing Will of the Wisps~  20/10", "timestamp_created": 1628141652, "timestamp_updated": 1628141652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96937680": {"recommendationid": "96937680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235797248", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1628119914}, "language": "spanish", "review": "que estas esperando compralo de una amigo", "timestamp_created": 1628092993, "timestamp_updated": 1628092993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96895097": {"recommendationid": "96895097", "author": {"steamid": "76561199030476540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1689444672}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good.

Beautiful cutscenes. I have to put this game's OST in my top3 OSTs for sure. The OST is very fitting to the elements, therefore very immersive.\n\nThe plot is pretty good. It's objective, no stalling and the ending is very wholesome. I love all of it.\n\nFun gameplay, the classic metroidvania formula, the world is well designed to favor Ori's skills. It has a great variety of scenarios that never stop to shine. And plus, this game has challenge, particularly Mount Horu and the Forlorn Ruins were pretty difficult. It has a very decent puzzle solving aspect to it, you have to think a bit to get through some challenges.\n\nI admit I thought in the beggining that by having only one way of directly attacking (early-game) the game would get too mashy, but the game has some attacking method variety that are later unlocked and as well provides you upgrades to skills and attacks, making them stronger and allowing them to hit more enemies at once, so that prevents the game from getting too reliant on spamming. Other than that, skills will give you more mobility and it'll be possible to find more secrets. In the start it can be hard to get the hang of it, but it gets easier to get around the more the game goes through.\n\nIt's a grand game, literally, the map is huge, tons of places to explore. Due to this reason, getting to a side to another takes forever, you have to stay tuned to the map all the time to go through several branches and splitting paths.\n\nHowever, it's a game I consider to be short, you can finish it under 10 hours and get a 100% in 13. The 100% is not very demanding, I even got 99% of all in my first try in 13 hours! It gives me a \"want more\" sensation, but I ain't gonna complain about that. I enjoyed every second of this game and I recommend to every single person out there.

Overall I had a great time and the game's certainly very enjoyable when you're just going for a casual run! Great enemy variety, the different areas are all very pleasing to look at and fun to explore and of course the abilities you unlock along the way are really fun to use. My biggest issue with Ori is that after beating the last dungeon of the game you can't backtrack anymore, in fact your save file becomes useless. All you get is a save file on the menu screen saying \"complete\" which kinda sucks. Besides that a lot of enemies in this game just straight up one shot you, it felt more common to get one shot than to take 2-4 hits to die even with health upgrades. This isn't a massive issue until you die from one of these enemies that were off screen. Certain enemy attacks also blend into the background and forground making it hard to dodge. Ori's certainly a beautiful and well designed game but it has its flaws. I'd rate it 6.5-7/10.

This review is specifically for vanilla Ori and the Blind Forest, as I never knew what was different in the original version versus Definitive Edition so I took a shot at this out of curiosity.  This version cannot be purchased separately anymore and is included when purchasing DE so you can't accidentally buy the wrong version, but even just 20 minutes in it becomes apparent what improvements were made in Definitive Edition.  \n\nThere is no fast travel in this game unlike DE, so you must hike everywhere at all times.  There are points of no return where you cannot return to a previously finished area in case you missed a collectible and wanted to revisit/backtrack unlike the later edition.  There are some minor bugs that exist only in vanilla and not DE, but DE is simply the better experience because DE won't ever put you in a position where full completion can become impossible if you do things out of order.  The game itself plays largely the same as DE, but there's no major point to playing vanilla unless you REALLY wanted to double down on achievements or something.  DE is simply the better game and provides much needed updates this game should have had since the beginning.\n\nSeriously just skip this version if you think playing this first and then playing Definitive Edition is the way to go, literally just pretend vanilla isn't a thing.  I have played DE and WotW loved them both and gotten all the achievements in them, but there is a good reason this version isn't sold separately anymore.

That's very interesting. The bosses are just obstacle course-type escape sequences that force you to use every ability you've learnt up until that point. I say 'just' because that's not typical of a metroidvania, not because it's bad. The game is phenomenal on all points.\n\nControls are sharp and concise. At no point did I ever feel like I died because it was the game's fault. Jump mechanics are similar to modern platformers where you can control yourself a little bit mid-flight. Combat is rather muted compared to other similar games. You will have foes but very few you need to defeat and most of which you need to take advantage of to improve your own mobility.\n\nGraphics are as much as I'd ever want out of a side-scrolling game and the art is virtually unparalleled. Even when you're focusing on not falling in lava, you can't help but gaze at the stellar backgrounds AND foregrounds. There's nothing you don't want to look at.\n\nThe story's great, very touching and hopeful. Extremely family friendly, in fact I would recommend this to anyone of any age or walk of life.

I love this game, its gameplay, its fantastic mechanics, and its weird folklore. But I'm giving this a thumbs down in the hopes that someday, when I play the definitive version, I can give it the thumbs up. The original Ori, while brilliant, is too beset by the \"Outlast 2\" problem: chase sequences where if you fail to execute a long string of complex moves perfectly, you die. At the end of the Ginsun Tree level, I died 50+ trying to execute what are a series of tough bash moves. I'd always hit most, but even one mistake would force me to start over. That kind of trial-and-error tedium really drains me. It takes a fun game and makes it unfun.\n\nYou should get Ori, but get the definitive version and hope that some of the sequences are a little more polished and less tedious than in the original game design.

This is just a gorgeous experience of a game. But calling it a game sells it short for what it *actually is*. It's so much more than just a game that looks pretty. The game is soothing, emotional, stressful, terrifying, heart breaking, and in equal measure heartwarming. \n\nThis is an interactive experience. Sure some of the puzzles are difficult sometimes, and the escape scenes are stressful, pushing your skills and capabilities to your limit, but it is NEVER unfair. When I've died I have known exactly why, and have grown for it. Sure, I needed multiple attempts to get it right, but it is so rewarding to get it right. No puzzle is too obsuce to not figure out after a bit of prodding.\n\nThe game's presentation, animations and the outright fantastic artwork is just wonderful. With very little dialogue the game tugs at my heartstrings with the visuals, and the animations alone. Some segments of the game look like cutscenes, but are in fact controlled by you the player.

It gives a really vibes on its music, calm and serene, the artwork, graphics, animation movements are all great, probably one of the best for platformer.\nI can see the development team put a lot of efforts in the story, graphics, music and gameplay. It was really fun to play, and I got addicted to it for days before I finished the whole game.\nHowever, the control is painful, especially for keyboard players, as my hand and fingers almost got a cramp pressing the damn glide button, I think the control is actually quite bad for a well polished game like this, sometimes you have to press it again and again in a short period of time, only to dodge the spikes and obstacles, and sometimes you have to hold as long as it can just to glide through the stream of air. It could be much better if using a controller to play this game. But it isn't so friendly to keyboard players, as the shift button is really not the best position to either hold it for a long time or pressing it repeatedly, your hands would really get screwed. I guess swapping the button assignments of bashing and gliding/climbing would be much better.\nOn the other hand, the game is pretty straight forward, IMO it lacks variety compared to Castlevania and Bloodstained. The monsters are pretty much the same and they don't really stand an important role in the way of your journey, just to let you bash through them to find new paths, or restoring energy or health. For me the monsters set up in the game is also very important in a platformer game, however I think this game lacks it.

Pertenece al g\u00e9nero de los metroidvania, por lo tanto las influencias quedan claras desde el vamos, presentando caracter\u00edsticas como un mapa enorme el cual ser\u00e1 explorable poco a poco mediante la obtenci\u00f3n de habilidades necesarias para proseguir.\n\nLa primera impresi\u00f3n remarcable de este t\u00edtulo son sus efectos visuales, ya que no s\u00f3lo cada entorno est\u00e1 cuidad\u00edsimo hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle e interconectado con el resto sin tiempos de carga, sino que hacen gala de una animaci\u00f3n en la vegetaci\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s elementos del escenario muy fluida y suave, dando como resultado zonas que a pesar de estar en dos dimensiones se sienten vivas. Todo este trabajo en los bellos efectos visuales tuvo como inspiraci\u00f3n las obras del mismo Hayao Miyazaki, en palabras de sus creadores.\n\nEsto es ejemplificado muy bien por su protagonista a trav\u00e9s de la jugabilidad. Ori es un ser peque\u00f1o de luz que se mueve a velocidades altas y con movimiento gr\u00e1ciles, de modo que el control debe ser muy preciso para manejarlo por los escenarios que si bien son bellos est\u00e1n a rebosar de peligros por todas partes, siendo muy f\u00e1cil morir en demasiados puntos. Y en eso el t\u00edtulo destaca por mucho, siendo un verdadero placer recorrer el bosque Nibel en sus extensos y bifurcados caminos los cuales guardan todo tipos de secretos que, contrario a muchos otros juegos, este t\u00edtulo se niega a que alguno sea relleno ya que todos ellos son potenciadores que le otorgar\u00e1 a nuestro protagonista mejoras en salud, energ\u00eda o puntos de experiencia en un muy sencillo \u00e1rbol de habilidades a completar, convirtiendo as\u00ed a la peque\u00f1a e indefensa criatura en una verdadera m\u00e1quina de matar. Adem\u00e1s, la rapidez de Ori al correr cobra especial importancia en esta versi\u00f3n, puesto que contrario a la definitiva en donde las fuentes m\u00e1gicas que forman los puntos de guardado tienen la opci\u00f3n de teletransportarse entre ellas, aqu\u00ed hay completa ausencia de dicha opci\u00f3n aunque no ser\u00e1 una tarea tan engorrosa recorrer a pie el mapa como a priori puede parecer gracias a la celeridad de los movimientos del protagonista. En donde s\u00ed flaquean los escenarios es en otorgarles variaci\u00f3n de enemigos, puesto que siempre nos enfrentaremos a los mismos tipos de monstruos con ligeros cambios lo cual les resta cierta identidad tanto a ellos como al entorno al recibir la fauna ese poco inter\u00e9s, contrario a su flora. El combate es, adem\u00e1s, muy simple y limitado por lo que los enfrentamientos apenas se perciben como tal y la ausencia absoluta de jefes es una muestra inequ\u00edvoca del penoso trato que recibieron los enemigos. A estos problemas se le suma la facilidad del t\u00edtulo, porque aunque Ori puede morir sin mucho esfuerzo como se mencion\u00f3 anteriormente, la capacidad que nos brinda el juego de poder guardar la partida casi donde queramos, siempre que dispongamos de un punto de energ\u00eda, le resta dificultad considerablemente haciendo que despreciemos la importancia de los peligros del entorno al ser el castigo por morir regresar al \u00faltimo punto de guardado muy r\u00e1pidamente para volver a intentarlo. S\u00ed, el ensayo y error est\u00e1 presente y puede entorpecer e incluso arruinar momentos de especial importancia, problema que en la futura edici\u00f3n persisti\u00f3 y se intensific\u00f3 con el a\u00f1adido de los modos de dificultad, menos en el modo Una Vida donde s\u00ed que se le brinda al escenario el respeto que merece por la posibilidad de perderlo todo por un descuido.\n\nToda la trama narrada en Ori es tan concisa y directa que muy pronto nos pondremos en marcha a resolver el conflicto, el cual tratar\u00e1 de la cl\u00e1sica lucha de la luz contra la oscuridad con ciertos giros de tuerca en determinados puntos de la historia para justificar tanto las acciones del antagonista como las nuestras. El resto del casting, si bien es muy limitado en cuanto a cantidad y s\u00f3lo uno de ellos es explorado m\u00e1s a fondo en la versi\u00f3n ampliada del juego, todos cumplen un rol importante en la historia y ya sea por sus dise\u00f1os o trasfondo se les acaba cogiendo cari\u00f1o. \n\nSumado a todo lo dicho, la m\u00fasica es merecedora de recibir su propio p\u00e1rrafo. El trabajo de Gareth Coker es digno de aplaudir, puesto que a trav\u00e9s de sus composiciones la m\u00fasica dibuja perfectamente los paisajes visuales del juego, los cuales acompa\u00f1an a la perfecci\u00f3n al dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico de los escenarios d\u00e1ndole un uso extra para enfatizar ciertas acciones del protagonista, ya sea si encontr\u00f3 un secreto o recibi\u00f3 un poder de uno de sus antepasados, resaltando el momento con una pista corta para enfatizarlo con m\u00e1s fuerza. Si bien sus melod\u00edas son un tanto reminiscentes unas con las otras, destacando el leitmotiv del tema principal presente en varias de ellas y sonando especialmente en los momentos m\u00e1s importantes de la trama, es una banda sonora muy eficiente que ser\u00eda ampliada posteriormente junto a nuevas zonas a explorar en la versi\u00f3n definitiva.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest es, a grandes rasgos, un decente metroidvania destacando por mucho su \u00e1gil jugabilidad y que si bien puede pecar de ser un poco lento y aburrido en un comienzo, no tarda mucho en abrirse en posibilidades. Sus personajes son escasos pero entra\u00f1ables, y el dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico junto a la banda sonora forman un juego muy bonito visualmente. Pierde fuerza por su facilidad y no inventa nada dentro del g\u00e9nero, pero en s\u00ed es una experiencia agradable tanto para los amantes del g\u00e9nero como para los reci\u00e9n llegados.",

I played until after the Forlorn Ruins. If it gets better after those, I sadly won't have accounted for that in this review.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and while there are some things it does really well, the consistent style over substance approach it takes in it's design really cause too many problems for me being able to recommend it.\n\nThe visuals are really pretty, but they do a very poor job at communicating vital information to the player. Everything is consistently flooded in blooming light effects, which oftentimes camouflages the main-character, who also is a blooming light effect. Platform edges can be hard to distinguish since the game insists on everything looking organic and unique. Which I admit, looks very nice, but it makes precision jumping unnecessarily complicated. Many platforms are unstable and swing around when jumped onto. While, again, looking pretty, this often causes problems as gaps that you are intended to jump across become too wide and you end up missing. Important visual clues like spikes are often hard to see due to these aesthetic choices as well. And speaking of spikes, Ori tends to easily get stuck in them and get hit over and over, due to the low amount of I-Frames. I honestly would have preferred instant death pits to spikes that essentially do the same, but slower.\n\nI do like the idea of players generating their own checkpoints, but I found the implementation poor. Since creating checkpoints costs energy, you always need to consider if it's worth the cost or whether you'd rather risk pushing a little further. Since energy is also used for attacking and opening doors, it always feels punishing to create a checkpoint. It's also easy to forget about when you're starting to enjoy yourself and getting into the flow. Since this game also punishes slight missteps very harshly though, I often ended up replaying large sections due to forgetting about the checkpoint mechanic. Sure, I mostly have myself to blame for that since the tools to circumvent this are there (unless you used your energy for too many charge attacks), but I would have preferred a classic and more forgiving checkpoint system.\n\nAs for combat, that's a very mixed bag for me too. The standard weapon is an auto-aiming short range missile weapon, that unfortunately is so bright that it constantly obscures enemy projectiles and makes dodging them hard for all the wrong reasons. It's also very weak, even when upgraded, and doesn't feel fun to use at all. It gets a lot better with some of the mid-game upgrades. Charge attacks are sufficiently satisfying to use, the dash that reflects bullets is really fun, and the ground pound feels quite good too. So it can be quite satisfying, but it takes some time to get there.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game are when it allows you to go fast and string together cool stunts of aerial movement. Especially some of the later upgrades are very satisfying to use in that regard. The sequences that made heavy use of the air-dash were easily my favorite parts of the game. I am feeling some issues with how this game carries momentum, and again, the aesthetics often hinder you in making jumps with the required precision, but overall I'd say the movement is pretty good in this game.\n\nOne of the major selling points to most people seems to be the emotional story and atmosphere of this game. I don't think I am the right person to talk about this, I don't feel sad if I witness bad things happen to characters I barely even got to know first, so I found it confusing and unengaging. Important elements of the world are never explained, and the main tool to drive the plot forward seems to be \"magical neon light touches things and does context-sensitive things\". Since we never learn how magical neon light is supposed to work, it's left to the music to tell me how to feel, since I really can't figure out what it's supposed to do in any given scene. Also, this game thinks unskippable cutscenes are ever acceptable. Combined with the aforementioned very punishing gameplay, this has caused me a great deal of annoyance. Use your own judgement on this one. I know a lot of people liked the story, but to me it just felt like the game wanted me to feel sad for no reason.\n\nI'm sorry, but I really can not recommend this game. In a genre that has outstanding gems like Iconoclasts, Hollow Knight and Dust, this just has too many shortcomings to be a serious contender in my book. It definitely does have it's strong points, and when it does something well it does it really well, but I just found too many annoying flaws to ever really enjoy myself for long.
