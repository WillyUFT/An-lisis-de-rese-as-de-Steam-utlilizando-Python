I liked the card's visual and background graphics which change accordingly to the story progression. The music is fine, voice acting though a little bit mediocre. But all in all, it works together.\n\nThere are 40 levels in total divided into 8 \"worlds\". Each level consists of 9 Solitaire games and a set of goals that have to be completed before moving to the next level. If you don't meet the goals you need to repeat the whole level, which can happen occasionally. As you clear the board from the cards you can uncover collectibles - various materials and eggs of magical creatures. When you find an egg you can then keep it on an active spot, where it will hatch as you play. If you have enough of the desired materials you can then evolve it! The pets are just collectible for your amusement and don't serve any other purpose, which is a shame on one hand, but when we consider the overall amount of pets (32), it would be a bit too much of a hassle to give them some active bonuses.\nWith every win, you are also collecting money which you can spend on getting sweet bonuses that are quite helpful in the long run.\n\nMy only complaint concerns the amount of grinding that is necessary for you to collect and evolve all the pets. Finding the collectibles is random and I simply didn\u2019t have enough magic most of the time. ^^\n\nAs I said, [i]Faerie Solitaire[/i] is a good relaxing casual game.

While it attempts to offer a unique twist on the classic solitaire gameplay, there are far superior solitaire games available that outshine it in terms of features and overall enjoyment.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of Faerie Solitaire is its lack of innovation and depth. While it introduces some minor gameplay variations and incorporates a fantasy theme, it fails to offer the level of excitement and strategic depth found in other solitaire games. The mechanics quickly become repetitive, and the game fails to captivate and engage players over extended play sessions.\n\nMoreover, the visual and audio aspects of Faerie Solitaire leave much to be desired. The graphics are rather simplistic and lacking in detail, failing to create an immersive and visually appealing experience. The sound design is also lackluster, offering little in terms of memorable music or atmospheric effects that enhance the gameplay.\n\nIn comparison to other solitaire games available on the market, Faerie Solitaire simply does not measure up. There are numerous alternatives that offer more engaging gameplay variations, challenging levels, and stunning visuals. These other solitaire games provide a more fulfilling and enjoyable experience, making Faerie Solitaire pale in comparison.\n\nWhile Faerie Solitaire may appeal to some casual players or those specifically seeking a fantasy-themed solitaire experience, it pales in comparison to the many other superior options available. If you're looking for a solitaire game that offers more depth, innovation, and overall enjoyment, I recommend exploring the wide range of alternatives that exist.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\nA Mediocre Card Adventure: Faerie Solitaire falls short of its potential, lacking innovation and depth compared to superior solitaire games.

Each area has a different soundtrack, but it's mostly like a background sound to me, not full on music.\n\nAs simple as they are, the scenes, backgrounds and card sets are pretty darn good. The story was quite good and engaging, especially because they put it in in such a neat way. After each stage, you get a short sentence or two of the story and a bigger cutscene version each chapter. It even CONTINUES into the next games!\n\nIf you enjoy solitaire games, I would give this one a shot. The difficulty mostly comes from trying to beat the challenge levels but again, most of those are pretty simple.\n\nYou can read my full review with stats here: https://jaderexeverythingsite.wordpress.com/2021/11/04/faerie-solitaire-remastered-game-review/", "timestamp_created": 1606428679, "timestamp_updated": 1656698999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80009376": {"recommendationid": "80009376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978230672", "num_games_owned": 1423, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 1345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1294, "last_played": 1621638536}, "language": "english", "review": "It's one of the earliest? and better Solitare/Spider card games.

In the moment I write this review, on \"9/8/'2020'\", I can affirm that Faerie Solitaire stands above all of them.\n\n__\n\nThe gameplay premise of Faerie Solitaire is as you may imagine: You play a lone game using an in-game typical, customized 52-card playing deck. I had no idea how to play Solitaire; thankfully the in-game tutorial explains it. These arrangements, each called \"hands\", come in groups of nine, and each five hands comprise a \"chapter\". Each chapter has different difficulties.\n\nIn addition to the basic card gameplay, the game has a \"Fae village\", or something to that effect. As one plays the card games, one amasses money. This money may then be spent on objects in this screen, which when activated will offer new abilities and tricks that will offer, in turn, new ways to play the game. This is one of the most impressive aspects of the game in my opinion, as it takes the simple premise of \"solitaire\", and turns it on its head in a way that empowers a user to devise skill and strategy to overcome the hurdles of randomness.\n\nI've spent about five to ten minutes deliberating on how to represent Faerie Solitaire's visual and sound design in a way that avoids spoiling readers' expectations, and while keeping this review within Steam's character limit. I've chosen to simply say this:\n\nThe visual and sound design render an experience I for one consider enigmatic and wonder-inspiring, rendering indeed a sensation of the world itself being bigger than ourselves, and our role as indeed simply wandering through it, seeing it, hearing it - even as we're doing so by screens rather than a map, and we are somehow playing solitaire to pass the time.\n\nThe story, while admittedly rather corny, has come to grow on me. Admittedly, don't go in expecting much; the story's just a footnote in and of itself; its main victory is as a light first step into the SubSoap's flagship universe. While in this initial installment the universe isn't quite fleshed out [spoiler]as much as in later installments[/spoiler], various entries, the overworld map design, and the names and descriptions of events and places, give one's mind what is needed to piece together the beginnings of a varied world with life of its own.\n\nIn the way of gameplay, my recommendation is almost entirely pure. Each cited gameplay mechanic gives one what is needed to turn a simple solo card game into a strategy card game.\n\nIn the way of aesthetic, the game's position as a studio's first project does indeed show. The way the characters are drawn reminds me, frankly, of my own art style back in elementary school, being drawn in a sort off-key way that is not unsettling, but admittedly showing of newcoming to the world of drawing.\n\nIn this gentle, high-fantasy world, the protagonist- yes, there is a speaking, visually-designed protagonist- is a pale-skinned kid in late 90's/early 2000's-esque wear with his hair up like he's the son of a hair stylist and a coffee shop barista. In and of itself harmless, except he seems to be portrayed as already being part of this world rather than being warped into it.\n\nThis may just be my bias as a Tejano looking for a world to disappear in- or else liking when such different characters have an explanation for the mismatch- but this can break immersion just a tad when he's on-screen. Thankfully, when that happens, there are usually voluptuous fairy-girls in swimsuits on-screen to look at instead.\n\nThe wording for the pet entries is also oriented toward how ye contemporary whippersnappers speak, mixed in with the essence of a sales pitch. This does no harm, and its at any rate understandable given the open nature of taking one's first step into a new industry, as SubSoap has with Faerie Solitaire. My musings on this further would not fit in the remaining review character space.\n\nHaving played Faerie Solitaire for ninety hours and counting, I would say I've gotten well more than ten dollars' worth of enjoyment in my relaxing and getting lost in the Fae experience; however, I can understand that ten dollars may seem sketchy for a \"simple\" digital card game.\n\nFaerie Solitaire is definitely a game to be played on and off over time when one wants to relax and enjoy oneself. Buying Fae Solitaire's like planting a fruit tree which may take a while to start growing fruit, and from which the fruits grow one at a time. Yet come those fruits do, and for a good long while. I've played about 90 hours and I intend to go back in after I'm done writing this review.\n\nI fully recommend Faerie Solitaire, at full price, for those who would like a relaxing experience with a surprising amount of depth to it, with additional content to dig and find if you decide you'd like to, for those evenings you come home from work and just want a nice game to calm your nerves, and yet give your brain some easy exercise.\n\n-Ryan Rodriguez/Ryarod/An Easy Target.", "timestamp_created": 1599593292, "timestamp_updated": 1599593312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479425370693206787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74904073": {"recommendationid": "74904073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081998949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4040, "last_played": 1625380429}, "language": "english", "review": "I have really enjoyed this game the music is very soothing.", "timestamp_created": 1598382170, "timestamp_updated": 1598382170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74819404": {"recommendationid": "74819404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198977495680", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1609744627}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game everybody.

For what it advertises, Faerie Solitaire delivers 100%.  I'm just not convinced that there's any need for this game.  What does Faerie Solitaire have over the classic Spider Solitaire preinstalled on most Windows machines?  The answer is Grind, the core game loop of Faerie Solitaire revolves around grinding hand after hand.\n\nStory Mode is boring and artificially stretched out, slowly drip feeding you bits of dialogue every 9 hands.  The story isn't even good, the protagonist is annoying and incredibly unlikeable, constantly crying or running away.\n\nUpgrades are expensive, you'll probably have to get through about 70% of story mode before earning enough money to buy all the upgrades.  Considering the length of the campaign it's a pretty significant grind.  Aura Ring is probably the most useful upgrade and synergizes well with extra undos once you figure out the trick to trigger a charge.\n\nChallenge mode is difficult, but not because of anything interesting, rather the game just ramps up the level objectives presented in a typical game.  For example, instead of filling the purple bar in three minutes, you must do it in one.  You can cheese some of these stages by switching to Story mode to collect more Wild cards, but I think this was intended.\n\nGetting 100% Achievements will force you to evolve all the pets (pets do nothing BTW), which is heavily RNG dependent as you need roughly equal amounts of the three droppable resources (Wood, Stone, and Magic).  Variance was the killer for me, by the time I finally got the last Stone I needed, I had in the excess of 33 Wood and 39 Magic.

achievements that depend completely on luck and chance, it is plain random hell, the achievements in question are \"Hatch'em All\" and \"All Grown Up\" that asks you to collect all the pets, it is really a game of probabilities, just plainly random, it was boring like hell to do it, I remember that i finish the game, and then it was so boring to farm and wait for the drop luck, that I only played a few matches a day and it took me more than 2 months playing at that rate, so that it would not be so tedious to find the drop.\n\nI really do not recommend it to any Hunter, stay away from this game, since in my case it was 53 hours, but in the steam forums there were people with more than 120 hours and they still don't get the drop, it really sucks.\n\n[b]Summary:\nDifficulty: 1.5 /

\nLike regular solitaire you flip through cards to match numbers/royal cards up and down however you don't get to cycle back through cards, you get one go through and that\u2019s it for the level so you need to be careful and pick which direction is best to go with the cards to get the most out of each one. \n\nThere are some objectives and features inside each level such as frozen or over grown cards that to unlock you need to remove the one selected card to continue which is best to try to get done asap so you don't get overwhelmed when you begin to run low on cards before tackling it. \nYou can find eggs which you use XP earned through levels to upgrade them (purely cosmetic)\nYou earn money each level which you can use to get small upgrades like extra undo's, seeing the next card up etc\n\nReally chill game to just play off to the side, stimulates your brain more than regular Solitaire and requires more thinking and thought to do well. \n\n[h1]8.2/10[/h1]\n[i]- Brainless game

It's also an easier way to play Solitaire.\nTo be honest, despite the name, it's not really like how you play the real game of Solitaire. For one there's not different suits of cards. You might see multiple of the same card like an Ace or a 10 but there is no 10 of Diamonds and a 10 of Hearts or so on. Each card does have differences and even themes. Most have pictures of a creature on it. But they all act like they would be in the exact same suit if you were playing the real Solitaire. Just put a 2 on top of a 3, then put an Ace on that 2, followed by a king, then you can put an ace on the king again or a queen and so on and so forth. \n\nYou play by trying to clear a full hand of Faerie land themed cards. They are laid out in front of you with some cards turned face up. you have a card drawn and a stack of cards beside it. Say your card is a 9. Look on the cards laid down and find either a 10 or an 8 to put on it. \nYou can build up combos of cards to rack up more points and gold as well to buy upgrades for your Faerie Land. These upgrades grant things like more Undos, starting with the progress bar already partly filled, having the ability to peak at what the next card in your stack is, and even abilities like an Aura ring used to destroy any card you want after 7 moves of failing to move a card.\n\nThere are also Eggs you can find at random in this game. Which once hatched, become a baby creature. You can find magic dust, rocks, and wood under cards as well. And a varying number of each of these is needed to evolve each baby creature into an adult form. There are achievements for finding all the eggs and growing the pets. \nNow this is where the main complaint comes from for this game for most players. But is fixed in the remastered version.\n\nFinding an egg is completely random chance. and the more rare eggs like the Rainbow eggs, for example, are even harder to find. It can take a very long time just grinding through the game over and over waiting for a random egg to appear under a stack of cards you clear. I personally played through the story mode 3 full times and was on my 4th run before I got the last egg. This makes getting those achievements a bit tedious and a ridiculous grind that takes hours. I think took me about 90 hours of game time to get mine. I've heard that some people have had to play for upwards of 150 hours before they get their last egg. It's all random chance. \n\nThis though, has of course been fixed in the new version of the game. Where they added a time cap to how long it can go between eggs you find. So if you go for too long of time the game will give you an egg at mercy anyways.  A nice improvement.\n\nAlso in this game you have a Spare card system that you can unlock. Where you can get cards 2 through 10 as spares and on the side of the screen. Just clicking one puts it on top of your hand and changes the card there to give more options on how to play and rack up even higher combos.\n\nThere are even some obstacles on the cards. Some stacks will be covered in thorns and cant be played until you finish a different stack and get the roots under it. And some cards are frozen in ice. The ice ones there is also a fire card in one of the stacks which you have to get and it melt's the ice card making them playable. It's a fun little feature.\n\nThe game's story is actually not bad. And surprisingly deep for something like Solitaire. But I won't go into details of what the story is, I'll leave that for you to discover. :D\n\nThe voice acting by the main character can be slightly annoying at time with his over dramatic delivery of the lines, but other than that he does a fine job.\n\nOver all I give this game a great thumbs up but I will lessen it's score a little due to the Egg achievement issue. Which was fixed in the remastered version.\nI give this game an 8 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1530941044, "timestamp_updated": 1543251127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647458732128143311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42771942": {"recommendationid": "42771942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042008907", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1498351515}, "language": "english", "review": "there was a time on tf2 where everyone had this game despite nobody knowing how to play solitaire and nobody bothered to learn because they were too busy worrying about tf2 dying in 3 years time \n\n2/10, not enough depth of gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1529179642, "timestamp_updated": 1529179642, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433333337306976318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42235923": {"recommendationid": "42235923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099453662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1608197519}, "language": "english", "review": "Good to pass the time ......", "timestamp_created": 1527235595, "timestamp_updated": 1606364349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42229064": {"recommendationid": "42229064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993549754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1375, "last_played": 1417334021}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun way to play solitaire!

It offers challenge and story modes.\n\nChallenge mode is what you would expect. Complete certain goals to beat the challenge.\n\nThe story mode is quite banal, but I guess it fulfills its purpose. It is divided in stages, which are subsequently divided in challenges. In order to complete each of these challenges, certain requirements have to be met. In the process, money will be earned and spent buying certain buffs that will help complete the missions. The game can be played in 3 difficulty levels, which means quite a few hours just for the story mode.\n\nThe main criticism stems from the technical aspects. The game has a really defined dated look, with subpar graphics and resolution limitations. \n\n[b] In summary [/b]; a well executed PC implementation of a card solitaire that will serve as a time killer for fans of the genre.\n\nFor more PrivateJoh\u2019s personal (re)views you can check [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32042143-PrivateJoh%27s-personal-%28re%29views/] HERE [/url].", "timestamp_created": 1521241525, "timestamp_updated": 1523909785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40787161": {"recommendationid": "40787161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041856540", "num_games_owned": 909, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1581647910}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The good:[/h1]\n+ Pleasant, streamlined gameplay\n+ Relaxing gothic music and fitting ambient sounds\n+ Collectible upgrades and pets\n\n[h1]The bad:[/h1]\n- The game either runs in \"regular\" full screen mode or in a tiny window, no customisable resolution or windowed full screen mode.\n- Some mechanics are confusingly explained - I wasted multiple spare cards by the time I figured out how they worked, because of the misleading explanation.\n- Ridiculous & nonsensical story.

Well, it's actually a very fun game. It can get quite addicting too, if you're not careful enough. Playing cards, right?\n\nAnyway, so what is this title about? The name pretty much summarizes everything. The only thing is that there's also this background story and objectives to be fulfilled, in order to try to keep the player more immersed in that realm. I didn't pay much attention to the story, to be quite honest. I just wanted to beat every level as fast as possible while I was playing.\n\nNow for an overview: The graphics are ok, I only thought annoying the fact that the full screen resolution is so awful. The sound effects can get really annoying after some time. The music is ok, I actually loved one of the songs available. As for the gameplay mechanics, besides the premise of solitaire, there're also some RPG elements. The more combos you make, the more money you get. With that cash, you get to unlock certain power-ups that can help you a lot. You can also get to find some resources every now and then some eggs, but I'll have to get back to that in the next paragraph.\n\nOk, so there're also trading cards (which are always nice), and some achievements to unlock. And that's the part where this game kicks you in the nuts. Well, you can get more than 90% of the achievements just by playing the regular game, no big deal, right? Now, if you want to get every single one available, get ready for an endurance round. Remember the eggs from before? There're lots of them, and every now and then (really rare), you get to find one in the levels. After you find them, you can hatch them, and also evolve them through the experience points that you gather while playing it (it takes ages, just for the record). There's actually an update which actually allows you to purchase the eggs you couldn't find so far, but the prices (which are already expensive), rises exponentially. So, what do you do? You check the community guides, and what do you find? Everything is about those stupid eggs!\n\nSo, overall, how obnoxious could these devs be, to the point of basically pushing the players to their limits just for the sake of a couple achievements. This is simply ridiculous, you just don't do that, especially when you're planning to release a sequel.\n\nOk, now that the ranting is over, this is a fun game, really. Just be careful with the \"Platinum\" trap. It's surely not worth it. If you doubt what I'm saying, I read that there was this guy who had to play this thing for more than 225 hours just to find all the eggs.

I am literally grinding playing casual just to get enough time for each to hatch, nothing else.  Wondering at this point if I really WANT those last two achievements.\n\n2) As others have said, wait for a sale. Not worth the full $10 but have seen it down to a few dollars or 99 cents.\n\n3) The storyline is a bit dark. Cute faeries and all, but all through the game the story tries to be suspenseful and ends up just plain depressing with no real closure.  Ends on a note implying there will be a Faerie Solitaire 2, but after 6+ years I highly doubt it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482793961, "timestamp_updated": 1482793961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28690015": {"recommendationid": "28690015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082661574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522011527}, "language": "english", "review": "On Sale, this game is amazing for the price.

For this reason I thought long and hard on whether it is fair for me to give a negative review to Faerie Solitaire, considering that the core gameplay - the solitaire - is solid. There are a bunch of mechanics to remove cards, add cards and various initial layouts. It's still very repetitive, but I guess fans of the genre accept that.\n\nThe graphics are terrible, I hated them. And no, I don't mean the technical aspect because I understand a game from 2010 might have aged poorly. The art direction is just abysmal, the colour palette, the ugly faces of the faeries, all of it was continuously driving me up the wall. The story is annoying, the voice acting is annoying. The pet system does [i]nothing[/i], it feels like it was slapped on as faux-content. The base building system is okay but you run out of upgrades quickly and then there is nothing to do with money. The last two achievements require so much grinding it would put some Korean MMOs to shame. \n\nI suspect there is a target demographic out there that loves this sort of combination (otherwise it wouldn't have 91% positive reviews at the time of writing), but I have found myself too far removed from it to be able to give a thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1482754618, "timestamp_updated": 1482755125, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452872544527053833", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28584697": {"recommendationid": "28584697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079888979", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1591464250}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a FUN solitaire game, just wish there was more to it.", "timestamp_created": 1482564346, "timestamp_updated": 1482564346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527374982833862305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28579991": {"recommendationid": "28579991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117528564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1785, "last_played": 1421961091}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome (y)", "timestamp_created": 1482551672, "timestamp_updated": 1482551672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465838491916656494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28355939": {"recommendationid": "28355939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046389250", "num_games_owned": 548, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1396758834}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a good game, but you will enjoy it so much.\n\nSeriously, this game does nothing particularly well, but it will still entertain you for hours as you shuffle cards around like a moron.

Cards are setup in a formation on the board and the player has to chain them together in continuous sequential chains (8 > 9 > 10 > 9 > 10 > J > Q, etc). That's all there is to it. Really. Suit and colors don't matter and may as well not be there at all.\n\nWhat you see on the first level is pretty much what you get for the entire game, and it makes the game just about as mind-numbingly easy and repetitive as you would expect. Even the \"challenge\" maps don't really offer a notable increase in difficulty. Other gameplay mechanics that are introduced a little ways into the adventure mode, such as thorns and ice walls, are actually the exact same as the usual mechanics - the only difference between these mechanics and conventionally blocked stacks of cards is a graphical effect. The upgrade system is mostly inconsequential, granting little bits of extra info or allowing room for error. The Aura Ring is the only upgrade that comes close to being significant in the long run, adding a way to occasionally force a card off of a stack. Unfortunately, its high cost means it won't be available until the mid-to-late game.\n\nThat's pretty much all there is to the gameplay, so what about all the dressings? Unfortunately, there isn't much to speak of here either. The soundtrack gets repetitive pretty quickly. The storyline is pretty generic and leaves off on an annoying cliffhanger for a sequel that doesn't exist (and considering the fact that this game came out 6 years ago by now, probably never will exist). Completing adventure mode didn't take me even half as long as the alleged 14 hours mentioned in the description (which, to be honest, is probably for the best). The 40 unique locations are nothing more than different forgettable graphical backdrops. \n\nThe pet system feels tacked on and unneccesary. Finding and evolving them is just a matter of grinding the game out until you're lucky enough to randomly find the eggs and evolution resources. Preparing a given pet for evolution is a pure time sink, done in the background automatically while you play the game normally. The only thing evolution grants you is a small image of your fully grown pet alongside a descriptive sentence or two. There's absolutely no incentive to grind for pet evolution aside from this and a couple steam achievements. Incidentally, if you are going for said achievements, you can probably expect to sink ~50 hours into the game after completing a <10 hour story mode, if I had to guess.\n\nJust about the only thing positive I have to say about the game is that the artwork for the world map and the cutscenes looked fairly nice.\n\nIf you want a casual card game and traditional Solitaire is too challenging for you, then maybe this is worth considering.

Faerie Solitaire is as you can imagine a solitaire game, with enough interesting dynamics and collectibles in-game to keep you interested.  If you like a good old traditional game of solitaire with some new twists, and maybe want to play a game you can pass the time with while you are also doing other things, this is a good bet.  This game tends to be on sale or in bundles with reasonable frequency, so I'd try to keep your eyes peeled so you don't have to pay the full price tag however.  It has equal parts addictiveness and mindlessness that make it a good go to if you want to pass the time.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[*]Simple and effective UI layout.  Within your first round of playing you'll see the \"twist\" that they have put onto solitaire and will be able to pick things up rather easily.\n[*]I like that they added collectibles in the form of pets into the game.  What is more motivating then winning?  Winning and also getting that fat loot!\n[*]This is a great game to run in windowed mode in a low resolution and work on something else or kick some Netflix in.  While it takes a good amount of thought process to get the best possible card outcomes, it can still be done without laser focus.\n[*]They try to inject some story into the game, but at the same time don't push it down your throat.  The story isn't memorable, but for this type of game should it need to be?  They did a solid job of letting you skip what you don't want to see, and just play some cards.[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[*]The level or stage progression feels a little wonky.  You can see the levels represented at the top-left of your screen for each world, but at the same time it could have been more clearly represented.\n[*]They could have probably added more playtime into the game if you could also use your cash for buying things for your pets.  Mostly specific to upgrades that will give you advantages in the game (more undo chances, more cash, etc.)\n[*]The full price tag on this game could probably be called pretty steep.  While I enjoyed this game, I can't imagine spending more than $5 on a game which is fundamentally based on solitaire.[/list]\n\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1472923344, "timestamp_updated": 1516988117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544827640056610107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25275068": {"recommendationid": "25275068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076893189", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 2018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1731, "last_played": 1418318441}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Solitaire with some other features to keep it interesting and make it a little different.

If all you're into is playing cards, you will enjoy this game.  The art style was bright and colorful, which I loved.  The story was decent until the ending.  The developers clearly intended to make a sequel as they ended the story without any resolution, which was disappointing.  The concept of collecting eggs and hatching them using gathered resources is great, but the execution falls flat. \n\nThe egg drop rate is too high overall as often after hatching/raising an egg you will have several other eggs already waiting in your inventory.  I don't think I ever ran out of the resources to hatch eggs either, making them rather useless.  I never had the opportunity to plan out what egg to hatch based on resources because I always had more than enough.  The rarest eggs do take longer to drop but they are manageable.  I think I had all but one egg hatched by the time I finished the story.  That dreaded last egg though.  Apparently it purposefully has a very low drop rate and I have given up on trying to get it after playing through the story twice, doing all the challenges, and countless free plays.  It leaves a bad taste that after getting all of the other eggs with ease, the last is designed to be next to impossible to get.  If you have to force people to continue playing your game by holding one last achievement over their head, then you are too insecure about your game.   It turns the game into a grind.  I don't start up the game thinking \"Yay I can relax and play some solitaire for fun\", but rather \"Maybe this is the time I'll finally get lucky\". I think this was a poor design decision that drains the fun.\n\nIf you are considering buying this game for the easy achievements, don't.

They are also working on a remastered version, so I'm interested in seeing what's new there.", "timestamp_created": 1464940087, "timestamp_updated": 1464940087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50304943323135376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23307611": {"recommendationid": "23307611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998626524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1483413278}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright game. Nothing special, but you can spend some time with it.\n\nThe basic idea is pretty close to your average solitaire, but with some twists to make the game more interesting. Such as thorn-covered cards, which you need to uncover by getting rid of another pile first, or frozen cards that you need to melt with a 'fireblast' card in some other pile, which you need to get rid of first. Also, there are unlockable power-ups of sorts. In its core, though, it still is a pretty simple solitaire-like game, so it does get repetitive and boring pretty fast. Unless you are into that sort of games, of course.\n\nI do recommend the game, as it has a pretty original feeling to it, it's made pretty well (despite looking pretty amateurish here and there \u2014 such as the pets, I'd say), and even has an adventure mode with a voice-acted story.

They already gave them custom images based on the pets, so they could've elminated card suit all together and streamlined the instructions. As it stands the suits only serve as a distraction.\n\nThat aside, I do enjoy this game. It's fun to figure out the best sequence of cards, and the longer the chain you're able to string the more satisfying it feels to end the combo. I thought the ending was far too abrupt, but considering that the story is thin and non-essential in the first place I suppose I shouldn't complain... BUT I'm going to anyway: The crying fairies got old fast. I'd like to see them... y'know, do something.

No, I wanna get cards through playing games because I feel like I\u2019ve worked for them and also I get to play things.So I usually look for cheap stuff on Steam and I found this game called Faerie Solitaire and it had a pretty okay rating and it was under a dollar, so I was like, \u201cwhy not?\u201d\n\nAnyway, the game is basically Solitaire but easier and wrapped in a fantasy setting. There\u2019s a story, but there\u2019s no real relationship between the gameplay and the story so it definitely feels like an excuse plot; the art for the cutscenes is nice though. However, because of the added gameplay elements (like being able to change the number of your current card) and the removal of some (suites don\u2019t matter in Faerie Solitaire), Faerie Solitaire\u2019s easier experience grabbed me. Okay tranquil music plays while you\u2019re playing and it feels like a zen experience. Levels give you objectives to meet before you clear all the hands in a stage, but except for the challenge levels, you can probably meet those objectives with no problems.\n\nIf I had a gripe with the game it\u2019d definitely be the egg mechanic. You sometimes find eggs while playing the game and you can hatch it to get a creature, and the creature you have with you gains experience as you play until you\u2019re able to evolve it. The problem is that the drop rates of the eggs suck; if the steam discussions can be believed, it honestly seems like an everyone problem than a me problem. Like sure, these creatures have no additional gameplay benefits aside from being a thing, but if you\u2019re a stickler for accomplishing everything in a game, the drop rates of the eggs makes it aggravating as the last two achievements is hatching all the eggs and evolving all the creatures.\n\nBut yeah aside from egg hell the game\u2019s okay. I liked to play it while watching something in the background and if the drop rate stuff gets fixed I can go back to it and finish everything I guess.

In other words, this game intentionally lowers your testosterone level, which may be good, if you're having some health issues, but it is quite boring in the most cases. Well, even if you DO need to lower testosterone level or don't care for that matter at all... sadly, but besides of being an easy game about saving fairies, that thing doesn't bring any noticeable amounts of pleasure or complacency I usually expect.\n\nI must say there: I'm speaking about one particular game!

The basic solitaire game doesn't need too much attention - you can play it, while there are something else is going, and it can be a moving meditation of sort... but it is not about Faerie Solitaire. There are too many insignificant details, that always keep you a bit distracted by themselves. So to play that game you actually need full observation. And there are way too little to do in there with the full attention. A paradox. Relatively speaking, you can't play it with one eye, and it is not worth to stare at with both eyes.\n\nTo finish talking about that game, there is one of those hatred luck-based achievements, which you can try to unlock by ages.\n\nIn sum, it is a small casual game, which you can gift to some non-gaming girl.

As someone who's never dabbled much into solitaire, I figured I would spend an hour looking at this and chuckle at the whole thing. Weirdly, even though the story is a wonderful schlockfest of campy tropes and no connection to the actual gameplay or goals whatsoever, I couldn't stop playing.\n\nSolitaire is a simple and admittedly boring game, one that is meant to pass time when there is nothing else to do and no one to play with. With only the lightest added perks such as monster collecting, light goals to reach, interesting card set ups and the removal of having to match specific suits, FS turns the whole trite affair into an exciting and wildly engaging affair that I couldn't put down for the next 3 days. I found it best served with some podcasts in the background so as not to feel like I was wasting my life away, but there is an amazing amount of content her from such a simple concept.\n\nAfter it got its hooks in me, every hand I practically twitched when I didn't clear the boardfor fear of missing out on a new monster egg for my collection that might've been hidden behind those last two cards. The impressive difficulty curve the game presents is also kind of amazing, which is not something I was expecting at all. Fascinatingly complex set ups can lead to a surprising amount of forethought and tactical card plays that can make or break a run. Of course, like all games that surround the old 52, there is no garuntee you'll be able to clear the board, but Faerie offers a variety of unlockable tools that make the prospect more and more plausible. One tool in particular can save a hand for total defeat, in which if you can't make a move in 5 turns, you can zap a card and make it your base. It adds an extra layer to an already complex layer of moves, and once I got into the grove I could rip through hands at unbelievable speed. It's hard to describe just how rewarding this game can be without playing it yourself.\n\nOf course, there are flaws. Plenty of them. The art used to differentiate the cards are not very appealing, the soundtrack can become grating, and the voice-acted story is cheesy and oh so teeth-grindingly bad. Somehow, though, this doesn't detract, but somehow amplifies the glory of this weird little game. While I wasn't neccessarily chomping at the bit to hear the next chapter in the riveting saga, there is a genuine aloof passion to the whole story that I can't help but admire. There is tons of great art in the game that just didn't seem to get used on the cards, but they do help stimulate recognition, to the point where I stopped paying attention to the numbers all together. This is not to say the art is bad; quite the contrary, but that goblin they put on the king cards really begged for a punch in the face. Of course for the soundtrack, you can always turn the music off and put something more to your taste on.\n\nNot exactly a game I expected to like, and definitely not a game I'd come to love.

What do we have here? Our age old, classic card game that we practically grew up with since Windows 3.0 - or as your grandmother's generic hobby - combined with a pretty fairytale and collectibles? I'm in!\n\nThe scene opens up to the realm of fairies, threatened by an unspeakable conspiracy. A dark, evil force that we fail to identify enslaves the inhabitants of the realm for its own dark purposes. A kindly old wizard approaches, and declares us as the only possible candidate to save fairies from their torment... with our solitaire skills? (I owe this joke to my friend [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036498823/recommended/38600/] Solanum Nigrum[/url]. It was originaly in his review, but I couldn't bear myself not to include it, due to the joke being perfectly definitive.) Yes, it is solitaire. Yes, it has a story... and the story actually ends with a huge cliffhanger, so you'll be anticipating for Faerie Solitaire 2 before you know.\n\nAside from your usual solitaire gameplay, Faerie Solitaire contains some surprises. You earn cash as you progress through various levels of the story - or in any casual game - to obtain upgrades for your gameplay. The gameplay also sets some goals for you in each level, that raises the stakes a bit more, either with time limits or a certain number of cards that you have to make a combo with. You are also entitled to collect some magical eggs that will hatch into various magical beasts. These beasties gain experience as you play and they may be raised into adulthood for their own achievement set.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game for a low price that you can pick to pass some mindless time, with interesting features. I also gotta mention that the art is surprisingly beautiful for a casual game. I adored the profile backgrounds and emoticons! I know, I know, it is girly... But I am a girl anyhow.

It doesn't affect the outcome of the game in any way but if you enjoy collecting pets/achievements, you'll find some entertainment in it.\n\nAll in all, it's a simple but smooth card game that can be played by kids or adults and can be fairly addicting.

I was quite surprised with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like Solitaire-style card games, faery themes, and raising dragons, then you might enjoy this game. \n\nThe aesthetics are decent - the amount of detail in the cards are very simple. The music and sounds are okay - they do add to the mystical/relaxing vibe emitted by the game - but I quickly muted the music in favor of my own.\n\nControls are super simple and only involve mouse clicking. There is no tutorial, but tips are always provided when a new element is introduced. The learning curve is mostly non-existent to minimal depending on your knowledge of card games involving a standard deck of 52.\n\nGameplay consists of you trying to clear a randomized arrangement of cards before running out of cards in your deck (Solitaire-style format). You start by drawing a card, and must click on cards in the play area to interact with your active card. Unlike Solitaire, you can click on cards exactly one value higher or lower than your active card. For example, you start a level and draw a 5 - you can now click on any 4's or 6's in the play area (note that you cannot click on 5's). Chaining combos are important in this game because it will allow you to build up your score meter faster, resulting in more money awarded and a better end score. Your end score fills up a \"global\" meter that is shown at the end of every level (or hand). After 9 hands, you must have accumulated enough points to free a captured faery. There is always one level objective that lasts for all 9 hands (ex: achieve a 8-chain combo), and completing this will boost your score and money. \n\nNew mechanics are added as you progress through the game to keep things challenging. One includes a vine stack that cannot be accessed until you clear a separate stack of cards that has a flower at the end. Another common one is an ice stack of cards that can only be used if you first click a \"fire\" card, which is usually located beneath many other cards.\n\nMoney is used to buy upgrades in the Faereland in the form of buildings. These upgrades will give you things like an extra undo (you start with only 1 and can get up to a maximum of 3) and a count of how many cards are left in your deck. Sometimes, resources will also drop when you clear a stack of cards - these are used to hatch and evolve your dragons. Yes, dragons.\n\nAfter playing for a while, you will eventually find a dragon egg (there are a large number of dragon variants). You can hatch them once you've accumulated enough resources (there are 3 kinds). Your dragon will start as a baby, and you can select one active dragon at a time - your active dragon will gain experience whenever you win a hand. Once your dragon receives enough experience, it will evolve and have some lore you can read.\n\nBesides the standard story mode, there is a challenge mode and the ability to replay previous levels. \n\nOverall, the game plays well for a Solitaire-based game with extra elements to keep it from running dry. If you are interested in this style of gameplay, then give it a try. I try not to mention price if I feel it is unnecessary, but I got this game when it was discounted at 95% ($0.54 CAD) and sincerely think that this is not worth the full price at all ($10.99 CAD). The content is just far too shallow to warrant that price, when countless other titles exist for the same, if not lower price. \n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1431473938, "timestamp_updated": 1431473938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466360867023468018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15805232": {"recommendationid": "15805232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109402990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1434054138}, "language": "english", "review": "I saw this game and I thought it'd be a really cool twist to Solitaire.

While the narrative may not delve into profound depths, it maintains one's interest sufficiently and functions as a charming tale in its own right.\n\nThe gameplay itself presents a level of simplicity yet deviates from conventional solitaire. Instead of pairing suits until depletion, players aim to formulate combinations with the goal of removing them from the board. The larger the combination, the higher its worth. Progressively, players unlock capabilities including automatic linking of non-combinable cards, additional hold cards available at the player's discretion, and the ability to construct faerie edifices with added perks such as extra undo options.\n\nEach round consists of nine hands, and the entire game comprises around 27 rounds, divided into narrative chapters. Each round comes with specific objectives, such as attaining a particular card total combination or accruing a certain number of points within a specified duration. Progression to subsequent rounds is only permissible upon completion of all goals, thus potentially necessitating round repetition.\n\nIn conclusion, Faerie Solitaire struck me as a pleasurable game with a suitable level of challenge yet sufficiently relaxed to accommodate distractions or periods of low motivation. It's highly accessible, suitable for brief gameplay sessions, and an excellent choice when unsure of what to play next. Therefore, I highly recommend Faerie Solitaire with a rating of 9 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1426055122, "timestamp_updated": 1690767532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14831513": {"recommendationid": "14831513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022995003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1527290495}, "language": "english", "review": "When you start, you odly cant stop :)", "timestamp_created": 1426040328, "timestamp_updated": 1426040328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493011921644210815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14828755": {"recommendationid": "14828755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184131714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 773, "last_played": 1433042042}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice, layed back puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1426025318, "timestamp_updated": 1426025318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4870319664478302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14817985": {"recommendationid": "14817985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152591734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1468571827}, "language": "english", "review": "Great!", "timestamp_created": 1425966728, "timestamp_updated": 1425966728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14817248": {"recommendationid": "14817248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064494426", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 670, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1425958628}, "language": "english", "review": "This kid friendly Majong style solitaire that is probably better than Magic 2015.

It is something to play should you want to just aimlessly pass the time away. If you have any other games on your list to play, then I suggest playing them first. Don't get me wrong, the game is decent in its own right, but mainly for younger ages, casual gamers, grandparents, or those odd people who actually classify themselves as \"gamers\" because they play facebook games. It has a few unique factors to it such as pets, achievements, and objectives, which utterly make it seem more and more like it truly does belong on facebook. \n\nObjectives start out easy and gradually increase with difficulty as you progress through the short and thin plot of the game. If you do not complete an objective on that level then you must start it over completely. This is something that will utterly allow you to waste more time should you so wish. Achievements vary but are relatively simple to grasp and accomplish by just playing the game. Lastly, you can find eggs and other \"mystical\" items as you progress, and they allow you to hatch them and raise your own pets/creatures over time. There are baby and adult versions of each creature--it evolves when you acquire the appropriate materials and earn enough exp (which you attain by simply putting time into the game I believe). The point of the game is to fill \"Faerie Land\" with creatures and release trapped Faeries by playing the card games somehow...

There are additional aspects like win money to buy upgrades, and collect creature eggs and ingredients to evolve them. However, the difficulty curve is uneven, and the various aspects never integrated into a cohesive experience.\n\nBasic gameplay is solitaire, the kidn where you have a bunch of cards, only some were open (but the unopen ones may be face up so you can plan better). You have the remainder of the deck, and you have ONE open card. The objective to to match your open card with the open card on the deck that's one higher or one lower (color/suit is irrelevant) and attempt the clear the entire board before your deck runs out. You can achieve partial success by removing most of the cards (which fills up the purple power meter), and if you managed to clear the board you get \"perfect\" hand (and bonus reward)\n\nYou will also need achieve up to 3 objectives by end of 9 hands, which consists of a level. Each \"stage\" is composed of multiple hands, and there are 8 stages overall, resulting in a lot of solitaire play. Some additional complications, such as \"frozen\" or \"thorn-locked\" sections and timed goals makes things interesting, but this game is really for people who can play LOT of solitaire... of one kind only. \n\nThe story line and combat is not really integrated into the game itself, much like Puzzle Kingdom or Puzzle Quest. After all, this is solitaire, with no competition except against oneself. So somehow, while the story is fairly compelling, with a twist mid-game, the game doesn't quite \"feel\" much like going on a quest, but more like uncovering sections of a story book, doing some unrelated stuff to unlock the next chapter. And that really distracts from the game. \n\nFurthermore, the game's difficulty curve is not even. The powerups that you can buy can affect the game greatly. There are a stage or two where you need to get THREE perfect hands out of nine hands total. That turned out to be VERY very hard without a certain powerup. \n\nTo add some \"value\" to the game the developers added \"pet collecting\", as you can find magical ingredients and occasional some magic creature eggs when you clear the board (i.e. get \"perfect\" hand) and if play with the baby creature enough hands, and have the right ingredients, you can \"evolve\" the creatures into \"adult form\". However, there seem to be no relation of the creatures to the story OR the game, so it felt as if it's tacked on to FORCE some completionists to replay the game to get all creatures and/or their adult forms. \n\nThere are some challenge levels not related to the adventure mode, but that's not much fun there. \n\nAs you win each hand you accumulate some monetary winnings that can be used to buy certain powerups, which gives you extra UNDO, peek at the next card in your deck, and so on. Those can be quite expensive but can make your late games easier, esp. the power to \"zap\" a card off the board. But again, the monetary value isn't integrated into the story much. \n\nOne very annoying aspect is sometimes there are timers, like \"fill the purple power bar in 2 minutes\", but there is no timer on screen that tells me when my 2 minutes is up!  (And there's an impossible achievement: get a perfect hand in under 1 minute)\n\nAll in all, Faerie Solitaire is an indie game that tried to marry a story to soltaire play, but didn't quite succeed, as the various elements sucha s pet, money, and story don't mesh. \n\nThe game ended on a cliffhanger, leaving it to the sequel. Let's hope the sequel is more... integrated than this first attempt.

They make it easier, at least in the early levels, but it's still by and large luck, and you'll occasionally get a board start with all the 4s in a row on the bottom, and all the 3s and 5s behind them so that it's flat impossible to play that hand.  Want to reset so you get a hand you can play? Too bad, you have to do a set of 9 hands in a levle, and resetting means losing all your cash and items and starting back from the beginning of the hand, meaning you wasted the last 8 minutes you were playing.  Like real solitaire, it's luck-based, but real solitaire just shrugs and lets you play again.  In Fairie Solitaire, it lets you know you're a failure for something beyond your control... other than just not playing the game.\n\nOf course, even if you are a perfectionist, there's very little reason to want to go back.  There's an award for beating a hand in less than a minute, but a more reasonable pace is about 2 minutes a hand, and there are 9 hands a level, 5 levels a stage, and 8 stages... That is, 6 hours if you never have to repeat things... and you WILL have to repeat things.\n\nHands and levels are little different from one another.  They do have things like a \"thorn patch\", which is a line of cards that only opens up when you clear some other line of cards, or an \"ice wall\", which is a line of cards that only opens up... when you clear some other line of cards.  Basically, it's the same tricks over and over, but with a different icon for it. Get ready to grind, because they couldn't think of anything more to add to solitaire.  (Note that even the positive reviews here say that this game is EXTREMELY repetitive.)  Note that levels basically repeat the same placement patterns and hoops to jump through, just the exact order of cards is different, so expect repeating levels to get VERY old VERY fast.  In a supposedly 6 hour game, some of these people have 20 hours or more...\n\nThere's voice acting, but it's tied to the music volume for reasons I can't comprehend, and the music is far, FAR louder than the voice, so you have to crank it down to a whisper so the music doesn't deafen you.\n\nThere's a \"pet system\" but it's really just randomly getting things about 0.01% of the time when you clear a line, and then getting told you are \"leveling up\" this thing by just doing what you were doing, anyway.  Pets do nothing.  At all.  You can't even see them in the corner of the screen as you play.  They just require you select them to have them invisibly gain XP to invisibly grow up (after you give them resources that are also random drops) so that you check another box off on the way to completion.  Plus, there's a ton of them there, since, of course, if you're going to tack these things on just to extend gameplay, you might as well make them drop rarely, have a ton of them, no player control over what you get, and put out an achievement for it if you Gotta Catch 'Em All.\n\nIt's also bizzarely unoptimized, lagging on my computer and using up all the CPU it can get in spite of it being a rock-simple sprite-based game.\n\nAlso, if you look at the art and think you might want to play it just because you like fairies or something, keep in mind that they basically don't appear much.  Even the pets are things like robots instead of fairies, at least the ones I got, and most of the time, the fairies are just yellow glowy bits in a jar you get to release for nothing more than a \"Thank you :D\" at the end of a level.  99% of the game has no fairy onscreen, just cards.  They only appear in a few still images, all of which appear in the screenshot gallery, or between stages.\n\nAll told, it looks feels, and plays like the sort of game marketed to older women who don't play anything but casual games, and the amount of quality and effort that went into the game reflects the sort of mentality of someone with only enough skill or dedication to pull off something just barely excusible to ship to a less discriminating customer base if you just have a fairy theme in it.  \n\nI got it for $0.50 on a 95% off sale, which says a lot about the game, and I sold the cards for nearly enough to pay for itself, but it still wasn't all that great an experience...

It's the concept of Solitaire combined with a story campaign. Poured into the mix are also RPG elements, challenges and some achievements. While not astounding this game is good. However I gave a point less for the tedious egg gathering which works in a really funky way. As you see above I have played about 68 hours in total, that's becuse of the totally random egg appearance combined with a bad way of generating them. And this game does not add enough fun and gameplay variations to play it for almost 70 hours (or more if you are unlucky with the egg generator) for most people. I would still recommend it as it is relaxing and fun for the most part.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1412431722, "timestamp_updated": 1495267279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651611328125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12355904": {"recommendationid": "12355904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019447021", "num_games_owned": 1765, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 1726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1726, "last_played": 1412390180}, "language": "english", "review": "I...  guess I recommend this.  I mean, if you like solitaire, this is a solitaire game, and it plays well.  It's similar to tripeaks solitaire.  In between the solitaire you have some story bits in the form of text during loading screens, and them some sortof cut scenes, which isn't terrible and can be skipped, and maybe has some suspense to it if you don't guess what's going on.  You're some kid tasked with chasing after the fairies to save them from something evil, or something like that.  And you play a lot of solitaire to save them, because it is pretty apparent you have the fighting skills of Atreyu from The Neverending Story when he killed the wolf simply by holding the sword the right way as he cowered when it pounced.\n\nI played this for about 27 hours and got all but two achievements.  Then I quit, because it's a painful grind to get all the eggs to randomly drop.  Then I came back after a couple months and my save game is deleted.  I looked online and this is a common issue, and the game does not and according to the devs will not support Steam's cloud sync.  Better find and back up your save game regularly.  Maybe even before finishing each level, because some of the tasks get really annoying when you play ten rounds to find that you didn't win enough of them, so start over.\n\nSo bottom line, it's cheap, tho not as cheap as that Klondike or Spider solitaire built into your Windows install.  You might see where the story is going long before they reveal it.  You may rage quit when you play fifty games in a row without an egg drop.  Your save game may just magically cease to exist.

I was surprisingly impressed.\n\nFaerie Solitaire is surprisingly solid and engaging, easy to play and still satisfying with crisp sounds and a nice style. Gameplay is random but still functional at the start, with new mechanics added gradually to alleviate the problems of random card draws. In a few hours, you can 100% any level by pure skill and planning. The progression system is solid, although collecting all the eggs is too random. The only bug that stands out is the first card not counting for Aura Ring if unused. It can be worked around by drawing the next card and using Undo, but it's something that should've been noted and fixed.\n\nIt is basically a free game that would be played online or on mobile, but it is polished and engaging enough to be worthwhile. I probably have 30 hours that haven't shown up due to playing offline. Offline play is one strength I would also consider; achievements unlocked offline will pop on Steam when you check the in-game achievements while online. Keeping this in mind, you can save the last Faerie Land purchase or Challenge stage to complete online, hitting all the offline achievements without backtracking.\n\nThere is a fair amount to enjoy in this game, but it will get old after some time.

If you see this game on sale and you like card style games even a little bit, it\u2019s worth it to pick it up. \nThe gameplay is simple enough. You are dealt a board and you have to make chains from your foundation card. In order words, say your card is an eight. You can place a nine or seven from the board onto your foundation, and you can go up or down. As you remove cards from the board, other cards get revealed. It\u2019s simple enough until they start throwing ice cards at you that have to be \u201cunfrozen\u201d with a fire card, or thorns that you have to untangle by uncovering all the cards on a rose. Then, as you remove cards from the board you might suddenly come across an egg. You can hatch your eggs for little pets. Do these pets do anything? Nope! But I have a baby unicorn!\nSo yeah, this game is highly addictive. Find the game too easy? Try the challenge mode and bang your head against the keyboard. Find the game too tough? Try quickplay or adventure mode. You can also spend in-game currency to unlock \u201ctalents\u201d that help make the game easier like the ability to preview the next card in your deck, or the ability to know how many cards are remaining in your deck. \nSo, to wrap it up, I understand that ten dollars is a lot to spend on a solitaire game, but honestly It\u2019s a great game and definitely worth it to pick it up on sale. The only thing that might turn people off is the \u201cfairy\u201d package the surrounds the play style. Yes, it\u2019s a bit feminine but honestly it\u2019s not going to stop your enjoyment in any way.

I saw a bunch of my Steam friends playing this and went ahead an bought it a while back, but didnt really crack into it until recently. It was a very pleasant surprise. It's solitaire with a few twists and a little story about a kid who finds faeries in captivity and frees them while seeking out the reason all of this is happening. Nothing too deep about the story, but it does hold your interest well enough, and is a nice fable on its own. \nThe gameplay itself is simple enough...it is not exactly solitaire, in that rather than match suits until you run out of cards, you are instead trying to build combos to take off the board using your held cards as the base card for said combos. The bigger the combo, the more it is worth. Additionally, you unlock powers such as being able to automatically link a card that would not normally combo, receive extra hold cards to use when you see fit, and build faerie structures that add benefits such as extra undo-s (which you can use to go back one move if you realize you made a mistake), the ability to look at the next card in your deck, and so on.\nEach round is made up of nine hands, and there were something like 27 rounds total, broken up into story chapters (each chapter is 3 rounds). Each round has a set of goals, which might include a certain card total combo being reached (8, 10, 12, even 15 in some rounds), acquire a certain amount of points, and fill your charge meter within a certain amount of time. You cant move forward until you meet all the goals, so you may end up repeating a round from time to time.\n\nAnyway, I found this to be a pleasant game with a reasonable amount of challenge, but still something you can do while distracted or feeling particularly unmotivated to do much of anything. I guess what I am saying is it is completely accessible to anybody, can be played in small snippets, and easily fills the gaming void when you aren't sure what else you want to play.\n\n9 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1404867029, "timestamp_updated": 1431922694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780364573001861572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11140215": {"recommendationid": "11140215", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982180511", "num_games_owned": 566, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1641, "last_played": 1406835155}, "language": "english", "review": "If there was a 'Maybe' option for recommendation, I would select that. The game is basically a variant on Solitaire where you have one deck you draw from to grab cards from the playing field to clear the playing field. The playing field has differing sized stacks that may sometimes overlap, as well as quirky 'seals' where a stack is locked until a requirement is met (clearing a specific card or clearing a specific stack). \n\nThere are stages, which are broken down into levels, and each level has 9 hands. Each level has a number of objectives that must be completed by the last hand or you fail and must restart the level. It's a pretty simple game and has a friendly atmosphere that is very kid friendly. \n\nI have one complaint about the game though, and as anyone looking through the forums will see it is the same gripe as everyone else; pet eggs and hatching. It is completely luck and time based to acquire the final two achievements, and many people have spent countless hours grinding these out. And it is not as if the pets actually do anything or serve any purpose other than lore and cuteness. The pets are completely pointless and are a huge time sink. I am VERY lucky to have gotten all but one egg (at the time of writing this) in 27 hours of gameplay (idle time spent in my shop when I have nothing to do while watching episodes of Futurama).  \n\nBUT aside from that, the game is solid, visually appealing, has a story (which I skipped entirely so no idea how good it is), and the music is pleasing (up until the 20th hour or so).

It shouldn't be addictive. The artwork is beautiful and the sound effects are pretty nice, but the UI is just north of mediocre, in that it's pretty lo-fi (even for 2010) and the number of different fonts used on a single screen is kind of distracting. There are things that are gimmicky and don't really make sense: the hatching and evolution of pets that do nothing, for example. The writing could use an editor and the voice-acting is\u2026meh. The story is repetitive (once again, I again, yet again), to the extent that I eventually just started skipping the narrative (kudos to Subsoap for allowing this).\n\nSounds pretty bad, right? And yet, I played through to the rolling end credits in a single sitting, then returned to try for some of the more difficult achievements. Faerie Solitaire is much more than the sum of its parts. It's relaxing and entertaining, and it kept me interested with frequent pet discoveries (I like unlocking things). The only gameplay complaint I have is that, in a casual, play-at-your-own-pace game like this, I really don't like the introduction of timers. Some of the objectives require you to finish within a certain amount of time, and I'm just not a fan of time-based challenges.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. I put about 20 hours into it, which works out to 50\u00a2 an hour at its regular price. Mostly because the presentation is outdated, it's a little difficult to recommend Faerie Solitaire at full price when Steam has so many quality titles on offer for a fraction of the price, but I still think it's worth it, and I'm very interested to see what they've learned and improved in FaeVerse Solitaire.", "timestamp_created": 1403676787, "timestamp_updated": 1403676787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10779885": {"recommendationid": "10779885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026908422", "num_games_owned": 4202, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1404441843}, "language": "english", "review": "way better than it looks.", "timestamp_created": 1403664617, "timestamp_updated": 1403664617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10775298": {"recommendationid": "10775298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025617425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2243, "last_played": 1530157638}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this version of solitaire.

Well, towards the end of the pet collecting anyway. At the beginning you get them at a decent rate, but around the halfway mark it starts to slow down. Also, it takes 'time' to hatch and then mature. Each card you click will tick down it's 'hatching' and/or 'growing timer, so it can take a while.\n\nHowever, the pet feature is completely optional. This is the kinda game people buy when they either want a coffee break game, or they're a huge fan of solitaire games.

There's a story mode that throw objectives like \"create a 5 combo\" or \"clear a stage in less than a minute\" or \"get x number of perfect clears\" at you and you can't progress until you clear all of the objectives and pass/fail all 9 stages. It gets incredibly repetitive. Between stages you get some exposition that tells you about the backstory and why you're playing Solitaire to rescue fairies and stuff but it has absolutely no effect on the gameplay and it is there just to look nice. \n\nSometimes when you clear cards you find either materials or a creature egg that you can hatch and equip. After you've equipped the pet for long enough time you can evolve it, provided that you've obtained enough of the aforementioned materials. There are over 30 pets to collect and evolve and not a single one of the pets do a damn thing for the game overall. They're just there to look nice and provide fake replay value. \n\nSince this is a card game there has to be some degree of randomness to it. The objectives for each stage are fixed, but everything else is random. Whether you get eggs or materials behind cards is random. Whether your pet evolves or not is probably random too. The game tells you that it evolves after you get enough EXP but that's just as good as saying \"your pet will randomly evolve as you play.\" Clearing a stage is pretty much random too. Which is great for the challenge modes where you often have to win at least 3+ times to pass that challenge mode.

I got this game for $1 and had a lot of fun with it, but the ending and the egg drop rate left me not with warm fuzzy feelings but feelings leaning more toward annoyance and anger.  Part 2 has become a huge project with 15 parts and last I checked part 4 wasn't even done.  A remastered version of the original is in the works to fix the egg drop problem, but it means starting the game over.\n\nLong of it: I enjoy solitaire games anyway, but thought the fairy theme was really fun.  I was enjoying the story and the sense that something wasn't quite right and I really wanted to know what happened next.  I felt like I was finding pets on pace to maybe unlock them all by the time I finished story mode.  I really liked that the pets had baby and adult forms, but I felt like the evolving process was too slow.  Then I got to the end of the game and after my initial shock upon realizing that really was the ending, I told myself surely they must have released the second part by now since this game is over three years old.  After some research, I discover that not only have they not released part two, they have turned it into this huge project of 15 parts and they haven't even completed part 4.  However, the really frustrating thing is trying to get the last two pet eggs.  After you clear all the cards in a stack there is a chance that a material will drop (used to evolve your pets), nothing will drop, or an egg will drop.  Then IF it is an egg drop, it is a random drop of an egg from any level and if you already have all the eggs in that level you get no drop.  I'm not big on the math but that means your odds of dropping that last egg or two are ridiculously low.  Check out the forums and read the many frustrated posts of people who have spent 100+ hours on this game and still have not found the last eggs.  The developers have responded and said that instead of patching the game, they will be releasing a remastered version that addresses this issue and removes the randomness from the drops after so long.  However, that was announced in 2012 and whenever it is released it means starting over. \nI've put 16 hours into this game and I still have 9 pets to evolve and 2 to find. Like I said, I really enjoyed the story and I like the idea of the pets, but I find the replayability of this game to be really low - aside from the forced replayability of trying to find the last two pet eggs and evolve the pets. \n\nI absolutely recommend this game if you can find it for $1 like I did, if not unlocking all the achievements is ok with you, and if you go in eyes wide open that the ending is a cliffhanger.\n\nEdit - Since writing this review, the developer has decided to release a game called FaeVerse Alchemy which is in early access (still in development).  I have no idea why they would choose to push this in front of Faerie Solitaire 2 (which they agree is overdue).  I understand them pushing it in front of the remaster of the original Faerie Solitaire because they have promised the remastered version as a free update.

It's pure escapism, a low-calorie nutritionless fluff for the reptilian parts of the brain to feast upon. Faerie Solitaire takes this base and adds a variety of new hooks to keep you going, such as adorable pets to raise, a village to upgrade with hard-earned fae bucks, and a whole lot of imprisoned faeries for your generic male hero to rescue. On top of that, the pace is strangely merciless; you jump from one stage to the next without getting a chance to spend your new gold and resources on upgrades. To do so requires shamefully quitting mid-hand, and to actually quit the game itself requires a few more steps of legwork and runs you past the Challenge Mode gift shop before letting you out.\n\nThe gameplay itself is perhaps a few degrees less brainless than that of actual Solitaire, but it's still a game that mostly plays itself and is almost entirely at the mercy of the way the deck was initially dealt. On the easiest difficulty setting, this doesn't matter; it would take phenomenally bad luck not to meet the meager victory requirements for each stage. On the most difficult, you're more likely to get struck by lightning than to win without grinding endlessly for the consumable items that break the game entirely. Regardless of difficulty, the gameplay is the same, a repetitive series of clicks that gives you just enough of a reward feed to make you feel accomplished.

The problem with the story is it is released in such small pieces that it is sometimes hard to follow.  The story is boring, but thankfully the card game itself isn't so bad.  Overall, the game is really easy, and doesn't take too much thinking.

The game continues the storyline as you go through the levels in a artistic view of the surrounding world of the game.\n\n\u2022 Characters: 5/10\no Basically there are a few characters, your character whose identity isnt even known or a focal point, a bunch of faeries who play different roles and make an appearance in the storyline and your pets you can collect and grow.\n\n\u2022 GamePlay: 8/10\no Basically the game is like Solitaire except you can do all sorts of tricks and be encountering certain obstacles which can be destroyed by attempting certain combos. Each level and stage has a unique goal or requirement such as completing a level in a amount of time, having a certain number of combos or making enough money. At the end of each stage you gain a bit of money from you gained during gameplay and as a extra bonus. You can use these extra amounts of money to purchase different abilities and locations - along with the money you also receive or find items during the gameplay which you can use to feed your pet and thus make them stronger.\n\n\u2022 Graphics: 7/10\no The game has a unique art style but pretty much any PC should be able to run this game. Very basic visual design more like a art book. The storyline is depicted through the fancy artwork and the animations within the gameplay and the menus are well done.\n\n\u2022 Sound: 8/10\no The sound effects are like what you would expect in a fairy tale type of setting of a story. The usual magical incantation sound effects and etc. The sounds are actually well done.\n\n\u2022 Music: 7/10\no For each level there's a different track used which plays a soothing calm song representing the stage's environment. The game's menu music is well done, nothing special with the entire OST but it is a nice departure from what you would hear from the usual games as this game's OST fits well with its casual feel.\n\n\u2022 Length: 8/10\no There are several levels and stages with about over 8 chapters with several stages. Going through them and playing the game of solitaire may take you a while - each play should take you about anywhere between 5-10 minutes depending on the number of cards and obstacles.\n\n\u2022 Replay Value: 9/10\no Although there are specific obstacles in each stage the number of cards and which cards are stacked are always different so each time you play any level in any stage it is always different. Along with that even after you finish the game's main storyline there may be some extra items you can purchase or train more pets which will add a few more hours overall to your game time.\n\n\u2022 Player Value: 7/10\no If you are looking for a casual game that doesnt require a lot of PC power - something to get your time by and something that is actually quite simple and can be as fun as a casual game such as regular solitaire - then this is the game for you because it adds more than regular solitaire - a unique way to play the game along with a storyline to boot along with a well fantasy like OST and overall visual design.", "timestamp_created": 1388427697, "timestamp_updated": 1388427697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8433451": {"recommendationid": "8433451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049020554", "num_games_owned": 4075, "num_reviews": 365, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1387336947}, "language": "english", "review": "Not that fun, but decent because of the steam trading cards.

This is a pretty cool idea, but the problem with the game is everything surrounding that idea.\nThe structure of unlocking new levels requires you to perform specific challenges from previous levels, these start off easy enough, but eventually begin to get a bit more challenging. If you fail to complete the challenge, you have to re-do an entire set of levels, which is frustrating, but the challenges also aren't challenging enough to warrent such a stiff penalty.\nThere's also a pet collection aspect that ends up being more of a side-game, kind of like the flower garden in Plants vs. Zombies. However, anything that I unlocked just seemed really uninteresting and bland.\nThe story follows suit, with a swarth of poor voice acting, childish themes, and lackluster art.\nThe presentation and seems a bit cheap, as well... and it doesn't help that the game runs at measly 800x600.\n\nOverall, there is a good game somewhere, buried deep down in the core of Faerie Solitaire. However, getting to that part can be annoying, and even when you do get there, everything surrounding the core game is poorly designed, making the whole package difficult to reccomend.

My friends had gotten into the habit of buying each other embarrasing Steam games to clog up our collection pages. A discounted 4-pack for Faerie Solitaire looked like it would fit the bill. To say it backfired on me is probably an understatement.\n\nFaerie Solitaire is a single-player card game where you have to clear a board of cards by matching them to the neighbouring number of a card on the top of the discard pile. It's simple enough, and the game does a good job of explaining everything as you progress. And with set goals, unlockable abilities and collectables that can be found as you play, there will be plenty to strive for if you want to obtain 100% completion.\n\nThe game's difficulty curve is mixed. Difficulty is controlled by goals that you need to complete along with clearing the board of cards. The normal level are well balanced for a complete playthrough. But if you want a challenge and you decide turn up the selected difficulty, you'll find that it ramps up very hard and very fast. And since this is a game dealing with randomly dealt cards, you'll find that some levels will be impossible to complete unless you get lucky with the cards you're dealt. Not ideal.\n\nThe game also comes with a story which I'd describe as unintentionally charming. You can see the efforts the developer has made in trying to build a meaningful story. But ultimately you'll laugh not because of an in-depth tale, but because the game feels like a 5 year old child that you need to patronise with a smile and a pat on the head. But that's not a bad thing. Ultimately the game is inoffensive, and it's conclusion may even bring a chuckle out of you with its self-directed optimism.\n\nWhile it may not turn you into a faerie-believer, I recommend Faerie Solitaire as a fun distraction that will happily fill that 10 minute gap during the day where you're not really sure what to do with yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1385540290, "timestamp_updated": 1385540290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7776424": {"recommendationid": "7776424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977519420", "num_games_owned": 1009, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2752, "last_played": 1561685092}, "language": "english", "review": "Faerie Solitaire is the best podcast game ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1385508581, "timestamp_updated": 1385508581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550256609916687012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7770424": {"recommendationid": "7770424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969887501", "num_games_owned": 2865, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 794, "last_played": 1535051842}, "language": "english", "review": "By all rights I should hate this...

All this stretched over an 12 hour long campaign of nothing but new backgrounds and a couple of uneventful cutscenes that try to tell a story but fall short in every respect.\n\nEach level also has some objectives you have to meet, and if you don't then you simply have to retry the level from the beginning, over and over till you meet the objectives. There is also a challenge set, with 5 levels with different backgrounds and objectives that are in line with the Intermediate difficulty level.\n\nAlso, there are an excessive amounts of fairies (faeries, because it looks better) that don't serve any purpose to the over all game. Oh yes, and there are pets which don't do anything either, except add some sort of \"replay\" value to the game.\n\nSteam Cloud support is needed here, but not included. There are 30 Steam achievements which are intertwined within the games user interface quite nicely, but I shouldn't really mention the achievements, because they are part of Faerie Solitaire's main flaw (read: bug that the developers aren't interested in fixing). Two of the achievements are related to the (unnecessary/useless) pets feature within the game, which is completely random and unlikely to work as intended. So expect an extra 20 hours of grindy gameplay on top of the already boring campaign if you want all 30 achievements.\n\nTime to complete is around 12 hours, 35 hours if you want all the achievements.

Think of that in the context of the game. There are faries everywhere with their own elemental, beehive junk dolloped like soft-serve icecream on their heads. Glitter goddamned everywhere.

It's like an infant discovering he has hands.\n\nThen there's his voice. Holy Jesus-burger-flipping-meat-patty-CHRIST his fucking voice. It's just bad. Not wildly inappropriate-bad. Not Street-Fighter-live-action-goes-full-circle-and-becomes-awesome-bad. BAD-bad. House of the Dead-bad, minus the irony. Every single line is delivered in this over-excited voice akin to a home-schooled 13 year old excited about going to his mum's book club because he actually gets to meet other people. And it just gets worse and worse because they're playing this whole faerie thing dead-straight so when things get dra~ma~tic, he still sounds like the same bright-eyed cub scout successfully tying a reef knot he was when he first started out on this self-inflicted idiot-quest.\n\nThen there's the way this bumblefuck, shitstumbles his way ass-first through the plot. I swear, it's the most pants-on-head, spoon-in-ear, shit-your-pants, blowing-spit-bubbles-in-your-high-chair retarded thing I have ever witnessed. Did the little spastic ever think to himself, \"Oh gee, I wonder if the dark, creepy looking wizard just GIVING out mysterious staffs of power/civil service jobs is evil? I wonder why all of these faries are fucking terrified out of their minds of the staff and the destructive power I keep on raining down on them from it like the skies of fucking Sodom? Maybe I should stop, esentially, being a terrorist, turn around and go the fuck home?\" He was the catalyst for every bad thing that happened and he did it because he dicked around with a magic relic he got from a robed hobo in the street and was too stupid to simply stop destroying property and killing things. gg, dickhead. I wondered why the fairy queen then entrusted this stone-cold idiot with a magic sword (again, a tool he knew nothing about wielding) when she finally filled the little shit in on the calamity he himself was bringing, but a theory occured to me; it was actually the magic, sex-offender's spellbook bookmark and, by illusion-magicing it into the shape of a sword and sending the little tosschump to his doom, she's be getting rid of the both of them. Spoilers, by the way.\n\nThe actual game has abso-bloody-lutely nothing to do with Solitaire, but the gameplay is much, much better than the free version you have had on every computer since 1995.

It's not a hardcore game, it's meant for casual play.  That said, it does what it does well.  If you're going to play a card game on the computer, this should probably be it.  The audio is good, the animations are solid and enjoyable, and the gameplay mechanics are well polished and fun.  There are unlocks and pet evolving - everything a casual game should have to keep you hooked and make you want to keep playing.  There is also a MASSIVE singleplayer campaign of solitaire.  I beat the entire thing before reviewing this game and it took me a solid 7-9 hours.  That's right folks, 7-9 hours of straight solitaire - and I loved it.  The game functions well, does what it sets out to do in a great way, and doesn't try to overextend its reach.\n\nIf you're looking for a card game or a gift for a person who plays Windows' solitaire regularly this is the game to buy.  Don't buy it thinking it's something besides a time killer or a casual game.\n\nPros:\n\nGood audio\nSolid mechanics\nHuge singleplayer campaign\nUnlocks\nComboing is fun and addictive\n\nCons:\n\nIt's just a card game\nWhen you complete one objective towards beating a level it shouldn't display that objective any more on subsequent hands - you'll know what I'm talking about if you play the game\n\nAs I said, it's a card game; nothing more, nothing less.  However, if you're looking for that, it's a great game.  It does take the main solitaire game and spin it a little bit creatively, but nothing too much to write home about.  One minor thing I would have changed is the way the audio works - when you go up the audio goes up, when you go down, the audio should go down.  But that's neither here nor there.

And that's more or less all there is to it, with a few twists.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, I don't know if this is based on a real type of solitaire card game or if the rules were made up specifically for this game, but it definitely is NOT based on the standard rules of solitaire that I know (e.g. the type that Windows solitaire is). It's much more simple. In fact, it's as simple as a game can possibly be. Seriously. All you do is choose cards that are either one value higher or lower than your \"foundation\" card. Repeat this over and over again, trying to build combos and clear all the cards from the screen. Card color and suit make no difference at all (which makes me wonder why the cards even have suits, but whatever). Aside from the need to strategize a tiny bit, which is required to get \"perfect\" hands (clearing all cards on the screen), not much skill or deep thought is needed. It's a very easy game. At least, the main \"adventure\" mode is. There is also a series of challenge levels available, but those are only moderately more difficult than normal.\n\nTwo additional factors distinguish Faerie Solitaire from being just a standard card game: the use of \"power-ups\" and the story that accompanies the gameplay. The power-ups are special abilities that can be unlocked using cash you earn by playing. For example, you can purchase the ability to see the next card on the pile, unlock additional \"undo\"s, etc. Power-ups are especially helpful later on when the requirements to proceed or attain perfect hands become a bit more challenging. The story plays out between hands in the adventure mode and involves some dude trying to save fairies or something... I honestly just kinda rolled my eyes at these parts because it was really kind of cheesy and pointless. It's not a game killer by any means, but it's also not really integral to the experience (title aside). The game also includes a bunch of collectible eggs that - unless I am completely missing something - don't seem to have any purpose... so I am really not sure what the point is in having them. One final negative is that the game only runs in a very low resolution.There are no options to change this, unfortunately.\n\nSo what do we have? A very easy, good-but-not-great (but addicting) solitaire game intertwined with a cheesy fairy-tale story. Though that may not be a glowing endorsement, this game does have a few good things going for it. If you enjoy mindless laid-back solo time-killers like solitaire, you will probably like this. It's perfectly suited to short pick up and play sessions. And while the difficulty level is low, in this case, that may not necessarily be a bad thing. It lends itself nicely to the laid-back time-killer vibe, but also coupled with the faerie story and collectible eggs, seems like it might be a good game for kids (I haven't tested this theory, but just something to keep in mind). If you don't care for solitaire in any form, nothing else about this game will change that for you. Otherwise, this is good as a mindless time-killer if you can pick it up on the cheap.", "timestamp_created": 1355086273, "timestamp_updated": 1355086273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506782710552215576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "904473": {"recommendationid": "904473", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981577670", "num_games_owned": 1116, "num_reviews": 266, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1371429506}, "language": "english", "review": "some card thing im supposed to get a tf2 item from", "timestamp_created": 1355083252, "timestamp_updated": 1385408152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "1918270": {"recommendationid": "1918270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999714118", "num_games_owned": 2148, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 8190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8052, "last_played": 1371686442}, "language": "english", "review": "This game....

Definitely worth that though past that, it's pushing it. The reasons are pretty simple.\n\nIt's solitaire and it beats the Windows version by a long shot in presentation and aesthetics but comparing a premium to a freebie isn't fair.\n\nYou can spend gold you earnt in rounds on unique power ups that help to get \"perfects\" in the game like destroying cards off stacks, undos and gold boosts.\n\nThere is a pet collecting system which feels tacked on. You find random eggs in-rounds but the chances are extremely low. There's actually people that resorted to using mouse scripts to getting their final eggs. You level up the pets so they evolve but they just sitting there in a picture form. Bad game design in my opinion though you could argue it was a \"bonus\" feature.\n\nSubsoap tried to fit a story into this genre and while their efforts were noteworthy, I found it very uninspiring (though the voice actor was alright) and just skipped most of it. You just go around various stages and free faeries after meeting objectives.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes, I would recommend this game but only if you're a die-hard solitaire fan and the game is going for \u00a31 or less.
