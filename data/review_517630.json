It's riddled with bugs, from vehicles freaking out and stuttering all over the place, to randomly clipping through the world, or just random things not working in general. In just 2 hours of playing this game, I saw more bugs than I have in games releasing in alpha with a single developer.\nNot only is the game buggy, but the AI is as dumb as a bag of rocks, and they all share a single brain cell. I don't think the AI even knows how to fly helicopters. I've seen them crash into each other, the ground, or anything and everything else around them. When driving, they will straight up drive off cliffs to their death at full speed. I had 3 or 4 in a row drive off one after the other while chasing me, and I didn't even lead them to it.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, it just sucks. I was constantly running out of ammo, and collecting data was extremely frustrating. You can't cancel it, it resets any time you get shot or knocked off of it, and it takes a solid 10 seconds of waiting for the AI to spawn before I'd be able to finish collecting the data. They would then shoot me, causing it to reset again. Having to do that 3 or 4 times each time I had to collect data wasn't fun. The flight controls for the helicopters are horrible as well, and it's not something that you can just fix by changing your controls. It's just how the game is. Unlike most games where you'd expect using your mouse to rotate the helicopters, it doesn't, or it does but really slowly. So rotating around is slow and clunky. It's also really stupid that the AI will shoot missiles at their own helicopters if you're hanging from them. Every time I tried to hijack a helicopter, by the time I'd reach it, it would immediately be hit and take damage.\n\nAnother thing that I found frustrating is how many AI they will send after you. You can be swarmed in seconds by a couple helicopters, jets flying overhead dropping bombs, and trucks with mounted guns firing at you. You get overwhelmed so quickly, and when you're just starting out, it isn't fun.\n\nThe game also doesn't like showing or telling you what you're supposed to be doing. After completing every mission, I'd be left confused, wondering if I was actually done or not since nothing would pop up or there'd be no dialogue telling me either. If you use the new AR thing that's supposed to light up objectives, it really isn't that helpful and only does anything when the game tells you to use it.\n\nThe menus are also confusing and the controls are weird. Why can't I just press \"ESC\" to go back? Why does it have to be only the delete button? \"1\" and \"2\" open the loadout menu, which is another thing that just doesn't work how you'd normally expect it to. When customising loadouts, you have to press and hold enter while using A and D to switch between options. I've never seen any game do their menu like this before. Even navigating the map or the UI in general just doesn't feel right.\n\nI normally don't care about graphics that much, but for a Just Cause game, it is kind of expected to look good. And for something that came out in only 2018, even on very high settings, it looked like Just Cause 2 on the Xbox 360. I was also sad to discover that unlike in Just Cause 3 where you can take down entire bridges, we're back to not being able to do that again, which was one of my favourite things to do. What surprised me the most was how badly the cut scenes looked, somehow they looked worst, it was like I was watching someone else playing the game but on the lowest settings it could have been set to. They should have just animated them instead of doing it all in engine, I know that would have been extra work but at least it would have looked good, unlike what's in the game now. \n\nFor only around 2 hours of playing this game, I had to compress my list of complaints down to a few main points. Overall, I was really let down by this game. It just feels like a cheap knockoff. Even though I bought this game on sale, I'm still going to try and refund it. Even at a price tag of $5 for the base game, and a couple dlc packs, it's just not worth the time to play the game, even if this game was free I'd still avoid it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1700759364, "timestamp_updated": 1700759364, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151324390": {"recommendationid": "151324390", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130732703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 327, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1700761674}, "language": "english", "review": "ONE OF THE BEST OPEN WORLD GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED\n", "timestamp_created": 1700747452, "timestamp_updated": 1700747452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474323779344558716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151259679": {"recommendationid": "151259679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118371170", "num_games_owned": 6747, "num_reviews": 409, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 667, "playtime_at_review": 518, "last_played": 1700744953}, "language": "english", "review": "So you liked JC3 did ya?

"language": "english", "review": "I see a lot of people have complaints about this game for various reasons which I can understand. However, in my experience the current state of Just Cause 4 is almost as good as Just Cause 3. Sure a lot of features work differently and the controls are slighter more difficult to get used to than the third game but to me it didn't detract from the experience. I got all the achievements in about 50 hours of game play. I'm glad that they changed how stuff works in this game because playing a game too similar to the third one would not be as fun. My main issue I had when playing Just Cause 4 was resolution issues and minimizing the game can cause it to crash. Turned out those two issues had workarounds. First when I switched to full screen 1920 x 1080 50 hertz the graphics were perfectly fine and actually better than the third games.

Rinse, repeat ad infinitum.\n\nHorrible UI and controls in general.\n\nDriving makes you go mad, and with the amount of driving in this game, good luck. The camera angle sucks, and no way to change it. While driving you will get stuck on every little piece of debris on the road and will constantly spin out of control, and crash.\n\nTerrible missions that are borderline impossible. Defend X mission objective - good luck without some of the DLC with overpowered weapons and vehicles. Waves of enemy tanks spawning from nowhere that will blow your defense object to hell before you even know where the missile came from.\n\nHORRID performance. The game will stutter at times, will go from 160 fps to 20, will microstutter, and some of the \"fixes\" are hilarious. One common fix is to unplug your ethernet cable to fix stuttering. Even blocking all online components of this game doesn't fix the stuttering / lag, but does help a tad.\n\nThe frontlines part of the game aren't bad, just badly implemented. Just Cause 2 and 3 had it down where you just blow \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up, in this one, it doesn't matter. You don't \"create Chaos\" like in the previous installments, instead you fly into a base, flip some breakers, kill endless waves of enemies, die from a single sniper/rocket shot from nowhere, reload the save, and try again.\n\nI love Just Cause for it's mindless braindead fun, but this game is just braindead unfun. Play Just Cause 2 or even 3 (which has it's own issues). This game looks great, when it's running at full performance with no hiccups, which never happens.\n\nIf you want this game, buy the complete edition for like $3, and you'll get a weekend of half-fun,

I played it over 50 hours, which is rare for me, and even got every achievement. As someone who loved Just Cause 3, JC4 is a good followup with some of its' own issues. It removes some things I liked about JC3, and adds other things that I think are good. Overall, I see a lot of people comparing both games, and while that's fair and JC3 is definitely better, this is still a great followup if you want to explore, make stuff explode and follow a dumb (and at times kinda funny) story.\n\nI did prefer the progression system of the previous game; here, you expand your frontline across the island of Solis by finishing missions in specific outposts and causing destruction to recruit more squads. It feels a lot less \"direct\" than in JC3, which makes it less satisfying as a result - you have to navigate to a menu, then choose a region, then expand into it - but it still has the same general effect. Destructible objects respawn after leaving and coming back later, so you can destroy them over and over - good for farming, bad for the feeling of destroying the infrastructure of an island step by step. Progressing in JC4 feels a lot more floaty and disconnected as a result, but you still do the same things you always did: blow up things and be happy about it.\n\nThere's tons of weapons, locations, stunts (a few too many to be honest) and vehicles. The driving system here is massively improved and it's actually fun to drive around! Exploring the island in your wingsuit, parachute and vehicles is as fun as ever, and coloring more and more of the island in your colors still ends up being pretty satisfying overall. It's more Just Cause, just with bad weather. Speaking of: the weather does not impact that much because it is pretty rare. There are sandstorms, blizzards, rainstorms and tornadoes, but they are all confined to rather small areas and once you finish the missions associated with them, you can turn them on and off at will. They never affected too much, but they were visually impressive at least.\n\nThe storyline is forgettable, but told tongue-in-cheek, which I appreciate. Rico is Rico, there are some familiar faces and it's all around a good time. Missions could use some more variety, as you always flip breakers, blow up generators or turbines, or hack and defend consoles, but whatever. More excuses to shoot things and blow things up. Solis as an island is pretty generic; you got desert, rainforest, lowlands and snowy mountains. The game is visually impressive however, and there are some beautiful vistas.\n\nLastly, the DLCs are actually pretty good as well, with one exception. Danger Rising is fun and the Hoverboard is pretty cool; Dare Devils Of Destruction is awesome because the driving is very fun. Los Demonios sucks; the infestations are annoying, the flying enemies constantly pester you and destroying the specific parts in the infestations is a hassle. It seems like a DLC not made for a Just Cause game, but luckily it's short. Still worth getting though just for the complete package.\n\nThe game runs pretty good, with one exception: on my system, any weapon that creates a smoketrail or a smoke explosion caused micro stutters. Some people report explosions in general making their game lag, but that did not happen to me. It was annoying, but rare and not unplayable.\n\nLong story short: JC4 gets a lot of flak, some deservedly, but I think it's still an all around good time. Movement is fluid and awesome, making things explode never gets old, there is a huge variety of weapons and vehicles and I appreciate the developers being willing to try out and swap around some things to see what works while sticking to the original tried-and-true formula. If you liked Just Cause 3 and want more of the gameplay, you can't really go wrong with JC4. And if you don't like some of the changes to progression, it won't take you two hours to realize that and a refund can be made.

This game is not for the faint of heart or those in search of deep storytelling; it's a carnival of explosions and stunts, wrapped in a thin veneer of plot.\n\nThe standout feature of Just Cause 4 is the unparalleled freedom it grants the player. As Rico Rodriguez, the series' iconic protagonist, you have the world as your playground. The fictional South American setting of Sol\u00eds is vast, with diverse biomes that range from dense jungles to towering mountains, and it's ripe for destruction. With a wingsuit, parachute, and grappling hook at your disposal, you can traverse the landscape with ease, creating breathtaking stunts and chaos along the way.\n\nThe game's narrative is serviceable, with Rico infiltrating a rogue paramilitary organization and uncovering a plot involving a powerful weather-controlling device. However, the story takes a backseat to the player's shenanigans. The characters and dialogue are largely forgettable, and the plot is an excuse for the next explosion or stunt sequence.\n\nJust Cause 4 continues the series' tradition of allowing players to engage in all-out destruction on a grand scale. You can tether objects together, attach boosters for propulsion, and send vehicles and structures hurtling through the air. The environmental destruction and physics engine are the game's true stars, offering an endless array of creative ways to wreak havoc.\n\nThe visuals in Just Cause 4 are a mixed bag. The world is stunning, but character models and animations can sometimes feel clunky and outdated. The game's technical performance can also be a drawback, with occasional frame rate drops and glitches, although these issues have been somewhat improved with patches.\n\nThe game's missions vary in quality, with some being exhilarating and others feeling like repetitive filler. The AI can be inconsistent, sometimes providing a genuine challenge and at other times being astonishingly oblivious.\n\nIn conclusion, Just Cause 4 is a game that delivers exactly what it promises: unadulterated chaos and destruction. With 25.7 hours of gameplay, you've likely experienced both the highs and lows of this unpredictable rollercoaster of a game. It doesn't aspire to be a narrative masterpiece, but it excels in offering a vast, open-world sandbox for players to let their imaginations run wild. If you're in the mood for a no-holds-barred, action-packed adventure, Just Cause 4 can be a thrilling, albeit occasionally rough, ride. It's a guilty pleasure for fans of over-the-top, physics-defying fun.", "timestamp_created": 1697696937, "timestamp_updated": 1697696937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148464709": {"recommendationid": "148464709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065285810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1698010350}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the closest thing we will ever get to a mercenaries game again but under a different dev/publisher etc. worth picking up on a steam sale with all the add ons and extras.

However the acceleration kicks in way sooner and goes to 100% much faster in JC4 which makes it feel less sluggish. But it seems to only accelerate in \"one direction at a time\".

the developers to make horrible, nonsensical decisions, because I don't remember the UI to be this bad in JC2 and 3. It's always good time when you can't even use mouse to properly select options, as it skips every odd choice and you have to resort to keyboard.\n\nBut ranting about amateurish UI is small potatoes to the game not even properly working on high-end PC, which doesn't have problem with most games, except those that are poorly programmed.

That's right, in the game about blowing stuff up, blowing stuff up does nothing.\n-There is no more liberating bases/areas, which was the core gameplay loop of the previous games\n-They removed throwables/explosives. No more grenades, no more C4 (which was arguably one of the most fun tools in the previous games.\n-They NERFED ALL EXPLOSIVES, HARD. Almost everything in the game takes 2-4 RPG hits to blow up.\n-Heat levels are ridiculous. If you so much as bump into a car, you immediately are hammered with endless enemy spawns, airplanes, drones, helicopters, everything, and it is really hard to get away because if you have heat and you grapple into the middle of an empty desert THEY WILL SPAWN ENEMIES NEXT TO YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. Makes trying to do anything in the game annoying.\n-Black market equipment drops are way more tedious. You can't get more than one item in a drop, so if you want to kit out you have to request multiple drops.\n-Guns hold very little ammo, so you have to swap guns constantly. It got so annoying I installed a mod to change it.\n\nThere's probably more I'm forgetting.

Same thing, same \"scripted\" single way to do it, we just did it with 3 essentially identical buildings. the second mission i did was the same completely scripted shoot at the same mix of unlimited bad guys that show up every single time until you move to the next place and start the 2 minute \"helicopter extraction\". Except No helicopter showed up to extract anyone or anything, just cool we did it. \nSo I figured I'd try the \"open world\" and help fight back and its useless, they're just spawning all around you without limit, I checked a tower in the distance with a sniper scope, saw clearly that it was empty and headed that direction, then BAM, 2 enemies spawn on the tower and start shooting, a minute later its the whole helicopter coming at me over and over again. Not even that hard to fight, grapple the bottom and steal it.\nI might have kept going to see if the game redeems itself somewhat but the whole thing was just odd and buggy constantly, if you get a feat, you can expect the game to freeze for a few seconds which happens constantly because I kept setting new personal best grapple distances(thankfully this lessened an hour or so in, not the freezing, me earning feats constantly). In addition The game is not actually converted for computer, the menus assume you use a controller, sometimes clicking the choices has an effect other times nothing nor does any thought or effort seem to have gone into adapting the controls appropriately, just remapping buttons to random keys. why do i need to reach over and hit the enter key to \"accept\" something when clicking on the same thing works sometimes in the very same game!\nI guess I got the junk after the series is successful and the publisher gets away with putting anything out.

But it's just a horrible buggy mess. Some of the missions are just based on pure luck. Enemys just spawn how they want and infinitely.

They spawn everywhere and right next to you. \n\nif you punch someone or touch their cars accidently, you are ****ed. They instantly spawn tanks and attackhelicopters. No not onIy normal enemys. Right the hard enemys instantly. Even drones and militaryjets....\nI mean in the beginning it is fun. But it's just so pointless. In a mission where you have to defend a hackingdevice. You can't just kill everyone and hack it. No you have to hack it while hoping not to be hit by an enemy explosion which will interrupt you. \n\nIf you killed all, well they spawn right next to you and interrupt you, with infinite ammo and superaim. I had a helicopter hooked on a wall. it wiggles like crazy and the weapon is not even able to target my direction. But the enemy still keeps hitting me perfectly fine.... \n\nIn some challenges you have to get a Car on a circle on a wall of a building. it's so high, that none of your gadgets can get it SO high. You have to bug it higher and higher with the hook. But you can't target things, because the camera is fixed on some places. If you are to slow the car explodes. If you are to fast it catapults into the sky and you miss the circle or miss the chance to enter the car while it flys into the sky. So you have restart it again....i mean for what do i need to get the car up there?...Not on a top of a building...no, on a 90\u00b0 ankle wall...\n\nSame for many other things. It's funny it can make fun. Some of the quests are interesting. But in the end the cars feel horrible. They are buggy. Sometimes you just get catapulted into the sky. On a even road. There is NOTHING. But the car just flys away. ....\n\nSome mechanics are awesome. For example, you can destroy some bridges. There are some Weathercatastrophes, but they just look fun. But don't do much. You can have a lot of fun with the hookgadgets. But it just feels like a funny ragdollsimulator. Not a GAME. \nI really tryed to like it, but i can't take this bugfest as a \"full game\". It's just a funny demo which needs still at least 1 year of work to get out of the prealpha it is in...\nAt least it never crashed on my device. But it often lost the onlineconnection and kicked me out. \n\nSo i can't recommend this game for it normal purpose. If you want to play a fun game and go on a mayhem. Buy JC2 or even JC3. But not this one. I even prefer the DLC-heavy JC3 over this one. \nIf you want to have fun with a buggy mess?

I played JC2 once many years ago, but I won\u2019t be comparing this game to previous entries in the series.\n\nThis game is super fun.  It\u2019s an action movie in video game format.  The hero you play is named Rico because of course it is.  He has a perpetual 5 o\u2019clock shadow, and confronts enemies with his signature leather jacket (sleeves rolled up\u2026 naturally...  Rico is a man who gets to work) and worn-in jeans.  He has holsters crisscrossing his torso.  He speaks in English but with a manly Spanish accent (which probably should have been Austrian in keeping with the action hero genre).   And with his wingsuit, grappling hook, and parachute, he can do all sorts of moves not permitted by physics.  He\u2019s basically spider-man.  That\u2019s one of his super-powers.  The other is that he is practically immune to bullets.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of gunplay to be had, and all that is really fun, but the game is really about movement.  Nothing beats using his grappling hook shoot him over the heads of his enemies while they voice their amazement.  It took me a little bit to get used to the movement mechanics.  Early on, the game introduces timed missions.  These were frustrating; it took me about 15 tries to complete the first one.  But once I had the hang of it, the timed missions were no big deal.  I do admit to nearly rage quitting on the second timed mission.\n\nThe game gives you about 10 mission types (+3 more with the DLC) on repeat.  There\u2019s two variations of timed missions, defend the base, snipe the bad guys, find the right vehicle to gain entry into the stronghold, turn off the switches, destroy the McGuffin, etc..  Then there are a bunch of little missions like wingsuit through the rings within a time limit, drive really fast through a checkpoint, crash a car \u2013 those latter ones can be completely ignored without impacting the game in any meaningful way (which I did).  The DLC missions, particularly the one about the bugs, offer more challenge, but in a good way.  Once of the DLC is a racing mini-game \u2013 but I got motion sick playing it, so that was that.\n\nI had a great time playing the action hero.  I loved Rico\u2019s almost irritated grunts when perforated by shrapnel.  Rico and his allies have an army, but he always goes it alone, flying into heavily defended locales, murdering his enemies, and securing his objective.  Then, moving on to the next one.  Despite the repetitiveness of the missions, I never got bored.  I loved improving my skills around Rico\u2019s movement --  I got a Serotonin jolt every time I executed a particularly slick move.\n\nHighly recommend this for people who like the 3rd-person action genre, particularly if you prefer games that prioritize senseless violence over story.    \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691875774, "timestamp_updated": 1691875774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143992419": {"recommendationid": "143992419", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482911780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1695846570}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good but for some reoson it lags a lot", "timestamp_created": 1691843668, "timestamp_updated": 1691843668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143962968": {"recommendationid": "143962968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046868148", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4177, "last_played": 1692141098}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] One of the best open-world sandbox games out there!

The diverse biomes and massive open world are a treat for explorers and fans of chaotic action. However, the game is marred by inconsistent graphics performance, especially on consoles, leading to frame rate drops and occasional texture pop-ins. Additionally, character animations sometimes appear stiff and lack the polish expected from a modern AAA title. While the explosions and destruction effects are spectacular, they often come at the cost of compromising overall graphical fidelity.\n\nPresentation:\nThe presentation is a mixed bag. On one hand, the game's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. However, the narrative presentation feels lackluster and fails to engage players fully. The opening hours struggle to hook players into the plot, making it difficult to invest emotionally in the story. Furthermore, the cutscenes suffer from awkward pacing and lack of emotional depth, leaving players feeling detached from the events unfolding in the game.\n\nSound:\nThe audio design complements the explosive nature of the gameplay, with satisfying weapon sounds and powerful explosions. However, the voice acting and dialogue writing fall short of expectations, often feeling cheesy and uninspired. Characters lack depth, and their interactions with the protagonist, Rico Rodriguez, lack meaningful substance. This detracts from the game's attempt to create a compelling narrative and diminishes the overall impact of the story.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is undoubtedly the highlight of the experience, offering a sandbox of destruction and mayhem. Rico's grappling hook and wingsuit combination provides players with a unique and exhilarating way to traverse the vast open world. The freedom to create chaos and use the environment creatively remains a core strength of the series. However, the repetitive mission structure can quickly become tiresome. Side missions and activities often lack variety and depth, leaving players longing for more meaningful and challenging content. Additionally, the AI of enemy NPCs is underwhelming, leading to uninspired combat encounters that become predictable over time.\n\nStory:\nThe narrative of falls short of its potential. The plot lacks focus and struggles to find a meaningful direction. The primary antagonist is one-dimensional and fails to elicit any real sense of threat or urgency. As a result, players may feel disconnected from the central conflict, impacting their motivation to progress through the story. Furthermore, character development is minimal, making it hard to form genuine connections with the supporting cast. The missed opportunity to build a compelling and engaging narrative is one of the game's most significant drawbacks.\n\nConclusion:\nAvalanche Studios delivers the explosive action and chaotic gameplay the series is known for, but it falls short in other essential aspects. While the graphics showcase stunning environments, performance issues hinder the overall experience. The presentation lacks the necessary polish to engage players, and the story fails to leave a lasting impression. Despite its shortcomings, fans of open-world destruction may still find enjoyment in the game's sandbox experience, but others may feel disappointed by the missed potential and lack of innovation.  I would rate this 6/10.

those additions dont make up for the fact its one big step back\nthings like enemy AI were annoying because i felt like the Black Hand would go at me for literally anything i did except for walking\nthe new weather system, while being a fun addition at times, generally felt underwhelming, same thing with all of the new vehicle and weapon additions\nas well, this game focuses way too much on its mediocre-at-best written story, which i dont think this franchise should focus so much on story rather just making a fun product\nsome of the takeover missions are just plain annoying and stupidly hard to do for no reason, and in general a major step back from the relatively basic system that was there in JC3. just blowing up stuff and doing some of those extra objectives were just way more fun imo\nlet alone how disappointing a lot of destruction elements were in JC4, and how many of those open sandbox events only really went down to like 2 or 3 bridge types throughout the game, which felt a lot more disappointing compared to how JC3 a significant number of bridges were destructible, even if they were kinda re-used bridges. and even the destructible objects in JC3 felt a lot more fun to destroy and a lot more \"spectacular\" than their depictions in JC4\nhere's to hoping that the development of JC5 will reflect on the things that made the older games good, and make a better game than JC4", "timestamp_created": 1690487572, "timestamp_updated": 1690489088, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607429146766662598",

"language": "english", "review": "Flat out NO!\n\nFirstly... Denuvo.. I don't really understand why there is still this need for DRM ontop of DRM ontop of Client software (like Steam, etc.)... but if that's a problem for you, it's here.\n\nBut more importantly, finally trying this game in 2023, 5 years after release... this thing is too buggy and unpolished for anyone to make excuses for it.\n\nHere's a run down of what I actually played.\n\nMission 1... intro mission. Rico is back to being a barebones nothing with a basic grappling hook and parachute. When you expend primary ammo of a weapon, he just throws that weapon away. The intro mission is almost entirely in a straight line in front of you and up a mountain... yet you are still given constant short distance waypoints to guide you... because clearly you are too stupid to be trusted to get to where you want to go.\n\nMission 2.... The WALKING mission. Apparently the grappling hook was damaged (I couldn't sit through the whole previous cutscene), so all you do here is find your way on foot over this scrap metal bridge into a jungle rebel base. No combat, no platforming or anything. 100% walking and listening to story dialogie between Rico and the woman over the radio.. until you trigger the next story cutscene.\n\nMission 3... Still linear \"level\" gameplay. You are still not allowed to deviate, explore, or enjoy in ANYTHING outside of the missions parameters. Here I had to blow up some objects that were NOT the usual, and clearly identifiable CHAOS structures. I was attacked by a chopper.. grappled onto it and tried to take over, but NO, apparently you are not allowed to control a vehicle yet. So I destroy the chopper, it goes twirling down, and then starts spinning, and spinning... and spinning, slowly grinding its way into the game world's floor. If you still felt somewhat immersed by this point, this sad little glitch would have finally broken you.\n\nAnd at this point I felt I had seen all that needed to be seen.\n\nNew voice actor for Rico. While I am sure he is a talented guy, whoever was directing his acting... was not. You are now playing a Rico that sounds like Pacino's Scarface... Rico Montana... choo know what I mean mang?\n\nAnd Rico, along with every other bit of the cutscenes and voice acting, is taking himself way too seriously. The \"walking mission\" cutscene was all heavy drama, but dumbed down for a 12 year old console audience. No jokes, no satire, just drama. Everything about those old D grade action films from the 80's that Just Cause embraced through over the top comedy and bombast... now is exactly as laughable, in a sad way, as the worst of those old action films. When you do hear Rico throw out a quip during gameplay, it still feels forced and more like an action hero one liner that is meant to sound \"cool\" instead of \"we're making fun of this, and ourselves,\"\n\nAs other neg reviews mention, and are correct.. the feel of the game is off. It's like they tried to port the JC3 framework into a new engine, and while tweaking the physics and general handling, they just gave up half way through the beta and said \"F* it, that's good enough.\"\n\nWhat I saw in the missions of the world also seemed like the world lacks character. A real shame because that South American jungle vibe was something I was really looking forward to, but it really lacks the sense of \"life\" that JC 2 and 3 had.\n\nSave yourself the bandwidth and the time and just go replay JC 2 or 3.", "timestamp_created": 1690456874, "timestamp_updated": 1690456874, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476956844329833984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142874726": {"recommendationid": "142874726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027231590", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1690094335}, "language": "english", "review": "Now I understand why this franchise died.

a pretty big step backwards from the previous game. in just cause 3 you would liberate cities and bases individually, each one presenting a new challenge and a new reward. the story was great, filled with well written lovable characters and great missions. the bases were all unique, featuring crazy new things. there are bases in huge caves, bases on huge mountains, there was one base in a large crater with rivers running around it. i'm not looking these up, i'm telling them from experience because of how memorable they were to liberate. i cant remember any of the JC4 bases in the same way as JC3, mainly because the liberation system is terrible. you do one lame mission, of which there are only a few different types, and take over one or more entire regions. for whatever reason you decided to remove the pistols, even though they were one of my favourite weapons. the story is easy to forget, and the characters have little personality.\nJC3 had:\nMario, the charming guy with the cool shotgun\nSheldon, the selfish, Texas guy with a \"corporate\" personality.\nDima, the awkward scientist with a good backstory\nJC4 had:\ngirl whose name i actually don't remember, i want to say Myra?\nher sister or cousin or something, i don't remember. she runs the black hand.\nthe hacker. she actually did have a great personality, unlike most characters in the story. i'm pretty sure her name started with an L or a Z. i think it might be Liza.\n\naside from removing some of the better guns, including pistols, just cause 4 mainly focuses on sandbox features, with the story and liberation being a secondary and mostly optional thing.\nwhile i do admit i love the sandbox abilities and the added features, i am seriously disappointed with the story and the game design. i can easily beat the story in under a day, and be bored most of the time.\nJC3 also had cool easter eggs like the rubber ducky jet ski, or being able to go the hidden \"boom island\" if you travel far

"review": "[b]Do you like the huge explosions, the destructible stuff and the ease of use of Just Cause 3? then replay it[/b], because this game is in no way good, let alone a good Just Cause (and the bar isn't really that high).\nThis game has so few destructible objects that you'd be forgiven if you thought this is an HD mod of Just Cause 1. The objects you destoy don't matter anyway since once you get out of the loading range and go back they pop back in.\nRico feels somehow worse, as if he's half asleep. sometimes he grapples two objects, sometimes he just holds the other tether wondering what to do, and sometimes doesn't do anything. The movement has this delay that makes him keep walking a few feet after you stop the input too.\nCars are terrible, huge oversteer always except when they just won't turn. Planes turn likes wasps and bikes are even worse. The only good vehicle are helicopters but they get gunned down by everything.\nThe \"heat\" or \"pursuit\" system is so bad that if you have a bit of wanted level when you get on a plane you'll be shot until you die, it doesn't matter how many you down, they keep respawning behind you.\nThe map is soooo boring, towns don't have purpose. Bases are all very bland and forgettable, and the missions suck, besides there's like 4 variations for what? 30 bases?

I come very biased.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThe controls FEEL terrible. They could've literally copypaste 3's control's one to one and have the game handle itself much better. Something about this game feels very, very off. I can't really put this into words, but i'll describe at like this: In Just Cause 3 when you parachute, wingsuit and grapple the game's world works with you and lets you glide across it smoothly. Here - to me, it feels like you have to fight it to move across. \nThe game's world feels very bland to me and doesn't speak much volume as 3 did. feels like a bad redo of Just Cause 2's world and nothing is very unique. \nExplosions feel somehow worse than Just Cause 3 and 2 and the combat is about the same as 3's - though, enemies sometimes have insane aim hitting you with surgery precision in literal mud water or can't do shit and just stand there while you're in front of them.\n\nGraphics: \nI don't know how they messed this up, really. The game again compared to 3's graphics looks TERRIBLE. As typing this will be very painful, I just recommend you see comparisons between 3 and 4, absolutely awful.\n\nPerformance: \nI have an RTX 3060Ti paired with an i7 12700f with 16Gb of 3200Mhz RAM.\nThis is by no means a top-notch setup, but it is well beyond to at least allow the game to run at 1440p, 120-100 FPS. But I can't, not at least at a steady 100. There's way too much stuttering and random FPS drops. The game slows to a crawl of 70-50 FPS at big fights, when shooting an RPG (I honestly don't know why) and some more random shit. Just Cause 3 never really had an issue for me, but maybe my PC is weird. \n\nAnd finally, the story: It's terrible.\nThe games takes itself way too seriously and most characters are completely forgettable and unfunny. step down from 3's action-comedy style story, It doesn't let you get as attached to characters here, the likes of which, for example, Mario (my mannn) from 3.\nThere aren't any funny tropes to characters that captivate you from the start or anything interesting really. Honestly, skip the story when playing.\n\nOverall, though - the game is fun at it's core. It is just a huge step-down from 3 and If you don't have the money, don't buy this game and get 3 now instead, as when it is on sale, it's like 5-11 dollars.", "timestamp_created": 1688990095,

Which is a downgrade for me because I loved doing helicopter assaults and bomber runs in JC3\n-collision physics are definitely more glitchy. The way your helicopter recoils from hitting a drone or another helicopter, or the way ground vehicles stumble over debris and invisible road bumps can get a bit annoying\n-texture quality up close seems worse. In engine cutscenes left me wondering what happened to the texture quality since JC3. \n\nUpgrades:\n+Biodiversity of the map. Map is separated into 4 very distinct biomes. They look great from afar. More diverse than Medici.\n+We're back into more serious tone of the narrative. Characters are likeable and not exaggerated, story feels more personal despite not being set in MC's home.\n+Thematically, Army of Chaos is significant improvement over rebels. They start off with 1 stronghold against Black Hand, establish frontlines, and as their numbers grow and you secure more footholds in other regions - those frontlines move and increase in numbers. There's also a cool dynamic in how you don't just gain squads by leveling up and lose them to move frontlines. When moving into a region reduces the number of frontlines - you free up the squads for other uses.\n+Combat feels more balanced, varied and responsive. Balanced because with just 2 guns of any category and no any-ammo gunlockers everywhere - you scavenge for weapons and ammo more, like we were in JC2. Varied because most guns have alternative fire mode. Responsive because there is a satisfying sound effect for nailing headshots which doesn't leave you wondering whether you should double tap or move on to next target.\n+Enemy has jets and actually uses them to counter your aerial vehicles. They no longer feel like just a set piece of airbases. \n+Challenges are not nearly as crucial for unlocking all the tools, nor are they as time consuming. You get all the aerial moves you had to unlock with gears in JC3 by default, and generally about a 1/3 of all the challenges is needed to unlock all the non-crucial stuff. Do take time for 40 wingsuit challenges tho, these give you 3 charges of rockets to your jet wingsuit.\n\nOverall, worthy addition to the franchise. Hope the mixed reception doesn't ruin the chances of the franchise continuing. Hopefully with less technical issues next time.

Its bad, its really bad.\n\nPlease note I've only played this game for like 50 minutes, and normally I dont think reviews are too valid until you've beaten the game but I honestly dont feel like wasting my time. I also feel like the fact that I was able to construct a list of complaints this long and detailed within 50 minutes speaks to the inherently flawed game design and may save some people from wasting their time and money on a terrible product.\n\nIts a direct downgrade from just cause 3 in mechanics, story, characters, gameplay, objectives and visuals from the previous title.\n\nJust cause 2 was pretty bad in my opinion, and it feels like the guy who made JC2 got put back in charge after JC3. Ammo restraints are back, I never have bullets. They added drone enemies, which while they existed in JC3 they were only in certain areas and they werent that many of them. Now they're everywhere, very small, very fast and they're super tanky, (which exacerbates the ammo problem). They tied grenades to the guns and removed your infinite bavarium C4 charges. Weapon dumps are far more limited, they arent clearly marked and they mostly carry one or two weapons. They removed the ability to carry 3 weapons at least as far as I was in the game you could only carry 2- which meant once again you had to choose between rocket launchers and anti personnel items. Vehicles have ammo now... which .... why, and now objective markers are hidden behind some sort of augmented reality contact lens. \n\nThe Chaos system is back, WHY IS IT BACK?!? IT THE WORST SYSTEM EVER! YOU HAD IT JUST CAUSE DEVS! YOU'D FIGURED OUT THE KEY TO SATISFYING SIDE CONTENT IN 3 WHY DID YOU BRING SUCH A TERRIBLE SYSTEM FROM 2? It existed in 3 to an extent but it wasnt intrusive. It went hand in hand with the outpost conquest system so most of the time I didnt even notice it was there. In short the main game progress is blocked until you cause enough \"chaos\" which basically means until you've blown up a enough random red objects, or completed side objectives youre effectively stuck. In this game its tied to the frontline  mechanic which was kind of cool but since it was tied to the tedious side objectives rather than the actual frontline combat it was unsatisfying. Outpost are no longer conquered by destruction, in fact destruction does nothing except generate chaos, the destroyed objects even respawn so your impact on the world is negligible.\n\nSpeaking of red objects, what happened to the destruction dynamics? The ball shaped fuel containers dont explode any more, they sparkle with blue energy now, the radio towers break into chucks like they were built with legos instead of falling over all cool like they did in 3, red objectives have overall less explosions, things just seem to spark now instead of explode.\nWhile we're on the topic of objectives, the whole \"hack the computer\" thing, where if you get shot during the 15 seconds of hacking you get stopped and have to start over is OBJECTIVELY a bad mechanic. I never almost never use the word objectively - you'll always be able to find someone who like something but that doesnt apply here, so please allow me to explain. A person who is playing this game has paid money to play the game, as a mechanic  the hacking system consists of pressing a button and then not playing the game while you wait for it to complete. Whats more the completion of this objective has very little to do with skill or strategy, since even if you kill all nearby enemies, if you have any heat level at all (which you will since these hacking objectives are placed within enemy bases) the game can spawn an enemy and shoot you within those 15 seconds. Therefore this mechanic does not reward intelligent gameplay, it does not reward skilled gameplay, by definition it is not gameplay in and of itself since the player has no agency or input during the 15 second hacking time, thus I assert that this mechanic is objectively bad. Just a heads up, it looks like a pretty core mechanic as well since In the roughly 50 minutes of gameplay I experienced I did this 5 times. \n\nMoving on... Story - I dont care, I reallllllllllly dont care, but as far as I can tell these cut scenes are unskippable. Rico was an agency operative in the first 3 games and he was having some issues with them in 3, which I didnt really understand since Rico was doing good work for the agency in all the games and was still doing stuff for Sheldon in 3, but now he's no longer with the agency, I guess, and he's investigating a super weapon his father built........ what? The writers didnt think to mention in the first three games that Rico's father built super weapons? Also I thought JC3 said that his parents were assassinated when he was a kid, he's like 40 now, if this weapons been around for 30-ish years why is it only now a problem. I paid attention to the main plot of the games in 1-3, based on what was disclosed in those games this makes no sense, if it was explained elsewhere thats just bad writing. As it is the jump from 3 to 4 has already pulled me out of any sort of emotional investment you created in 3 since theyre such different characters. He's also teamed up with some random woman and the game waits all of 5 minutes before trying to pull some starwars plot twist stuff, (oh my god I dont care). Then they're like okay - time to overthrow the government.................................. Dude what? The \"bad guys\" havent even done anything yet except try to kill you when you attacked their military base unprovoked. Uhhh yeah, Rico is terrorist in this one.\nSpeaking of Rico what happened to his character? He was this charming fun loving and playful dude in 3 but in  4 he's this grungy edgy guy, like the most bland main character from some sort of b-tier action movie.\n\nGraphics.......... this looks like a generational downgrade from 3 and I dont know why, also the mandatory cutscenes were locked at like 20 frames per second while the game ran at like 90 FPS, so those scenes were really choppy.\n\nSome side notes, before I leave, the physics in this feel even floatier than before which I personally didnt like, it took any sort of skill out of grappling hook traversal, the wing suit felt slower, and despite my complaint about less explosions earlier the red barrels in this are way too fragile, I brushed one in the first allied settlement you access and it exploded. I didnt shoot it and I wasnt being shot at, it just barely fell over and blew up. Also the first mission where you dont have your grappling hook, it wants you to cross a bridge, there are three paths but it just mission fails you unless you take the one it wants, and it doesnt give you any sort of indication which one is the right path, it just has a marker on the other side of the bridge, I dont know how much they do this later, but since just cause has traditionally been a \"find your own solution\" sort of game I was pretty miffed to be punished for finding an alternate solution. \n\nSeriously if you're looking for a Just Cause game, go play 3.", "timestamp_created": 1688604412, "timestamp_updated": 1688605190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617310404777526855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141399791": {"recommendationid": "141399791", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221220432", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1689798831}, "language": "english", "review": "NICE", "timestamp_created": 1688590811, "timestamp_updated": 1688590811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141393467": {"recommendationid": "141393467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084048180", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1688578899}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, this was a disappointment...\nSave your money, buy JC3, play that.", "timestamp_created": 1688584769, "timestamp_updated": 1688584769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141367113": {"recommendationid": "141367113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198943486164", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1690811284}, "language": "english", "review": "just cause 3 is 10x better", "timestamp_created": 1688560174, "timestamp_updated": 1688560174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509259223937988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141358600": {"recommendationid": "141358600", "author": {"steamid": "76561199503606446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1688163813}, "language": "english", "review": "no its is terrible cant play for 10 min without a crash and before u think i have bad specs i have 4090 and other high end specs so it makes no sense graphics are mid guns mid gameplay terrible", "timestamp_created": 1688549887, "timestamp_updated": 1688549887, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141342252": {"recommendationid": "141342252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835522002", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1688493769}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Los gr\u00e1ficos no me terminan de convencer y los controles son muy raros, el Just Cause 3 tambi\u00e9n tiene controles muy raros pero al menos gr\u00e1ficamente desde mi punto de vista se ve bien y est\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s logrado.", "timestamp_created": 1688527446, "timestamp_updated": 1688527598, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141309848": {"recommendationid": "141309848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068340664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1688492829}, "language": "english", "review": "Just Cause 4 took everything good about Just Cause 3 and threw it in the bin.

"language": "english", "review": "this game is a pretty big step backwards from the previous game. in just cause 3 you would liberate cities and bases individually, each one presenting a new challenge and a new reward. the story was great, filled with well written lovable characters and great missions. the bases were all unique, featuring crazy new things. there are bases in huge caves, bases on huge mountains, there was one base in a large crater with rivers running around it. i'm not looking these up, i'm telling them from experience because of how memorable they were to liberate. i cant remember any of the JC4 bases in the same way as JC3, mainly because the liberation system is terrible. you do one lame mission, of which there are only a few different types, and take over one or more entire regions. for whatever reason you decided to remove the pistols, even though they were one of my favourite weapons. the story is easy to forget, and the characters have little personality.\nJC3 had:\nMario, the charming guy with the cool shotgun\nSheldon, the selfish, Texas guy with a \"corporate\" personality.\nDima, the awkward scientist with a good backstory\nJC4 had:\ngirl whose name i actually don't remember, i want to say Myra?\nher sister or cousin or something, i don't remember. she runs the black hand.\nthe hacker. she actually did have a great personality, unlike most characters in the story. i'm pretty sure her name started with an L or a Z. i think it might be Liza.\n\naside from removing some of the better guns, including pistols, just cause 4 mainly focuses on sandbox features, with the story and liberation being a secondary and mostly optional thing.\nwhile i do admit i love the sandbox abilities and the added features, i am seriously disappointed with the story and the game design. i can easily beat the story in under a day, and be bored most of the time.\nJC3 also had cool easter eggs like the rubber ducky jet ski, or

My biggest problem is that the side missions are repetitive and boring. In the previous games, you were free to blow up a military base or liberate a city however and whenever you like to liberate a region. In this game, liberating regions are locked behind repetitive missions where you liberate prisoners or destroy a base but not however you like.

Turn around and new enemies have, somehow, manifested from thin air. This is bad enough on foot, constantly having to mow down yet more cannon fodder from this \"elite private army.\" \n\nTake to the seas? Turn the camera and Bam! A new enemy naval squadron has somehow just deployed from that shallow inlet they couldn't possibly have come from. The air is even worse, since a constant stream of choppers, jets and drones will just fly at you. \n\nMake no mistake, I like challenge, but I'm serious. It. Is. Constant. Game development like that just suggests that the maker couldn't be bothered with meaningless stuff, like challenging enemies, so they just lazily threw in the towel and set them to constant respawn. It's stone cold disgusting.\n\nAnother thing that bugged me was the enemy A.I., simultaneously hyper capable and suicidal. How do I mean? Well, suicidal in that those constant enemy air units will happily commit aeronautical seppuku right into your tail fin, killing the both of you. \"It killed you, right? So it's a good challenge.\" I know someone will think that and they are stupid. A good challenge is something that I can actually counter, which I can't if the entire enemy air force is willing to kamikaze me.\n\nAlso, for hyper capable, every enemy sniper is ridiculously, superhumanly skilled. Forget that garbage you see in movies where people just rack up headshots as soon as the enemy comes in view, shooting is hard. Shooting a target zipping along in a wingsuit, while you are in a helicopter bobbing around, should be outright impossible, but I guess that shows what I know, since every shooter can slot one in your dome 9 times out of 10 in that situation, so I guess I just need to git gud.\n\nEven after all of that, what made me ragequit and uninstall the game this go round was when I shot at an enemy tank, whereupon it flew into the air. As it was cartwheeling around at about 150 feet above me it, and this is real, instakilled my own tank with an immaculate shot. I already was, at best, only mildly amused with the game, but if the makers are just going to give the enemies aimbots, why should I play?\n\nThe missions, while I think were more varied than in Just Cause 3's one-two punch of either blow stuff up or drive someplace, were still rather dull. The story was bland. Yet another dictator needs to get taken down. Wow. Never would've seen that coming. The characters in the story were, while not grating or offensive, well...how do I put this...they were too \"quirky and upbeat\" for a gaggle of people who should've been terrorized and victimized for years by a tyrant and his private army.\n\nIf there is something good to say, the landscape was beautiful. That may not sound like much, but I liked the view of Solis whether I was driving, sailing, wingsuiting, etc. Looks like a neat place to visit when there isn't a war on. Speaking of war, I also liked the fact that there were outright warzones on the borders of regions controlled by the good guys and bad. That was a slick touch, even having the ground scorched and pockmarked with damage. Gorgeous, gorgeous, devastation.\n\nUltimately, though, visuals aren't enough. Absurd A.I. alongside dull missions and a bland story mean that, no.

However, as I continued playing; I started unexpectedly enjoying the game as much as JC2 and JC3. I disregarded its bad reputation and saw it in a new light. It is a Just Cause game that spins freshness in the franchise, especially coming out of JC3 (conquering all the settlements that felt similar to another). Of course I do not expect its different take on the gameplay loop to carry on to the 5th game. Conversely, I hope that a lot of its good parts carry over to the 5th game while maintaining the classic JC gameplay loop.\n\nComing out of JC3, what I desired was a diverse sandbox with variety of terrain types and biomes. Although you could say JC3 mastered the gameplay loop, what it didn't master was keeping the players freshened up when exploring different areas. Essentially, the problem from JC3 was the lack of diversity in the buildings and landscapes if you were to compare to JC2. JC4 solved that problem, while focusing (although a gimmick) on the climate and its weather. The story is also involved around manmade natural disasters from weather. I believe the environment you play in is more important than graphics (in which I have no problems with). I see it as an art direction as it also envelops the world with vibrancy.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/517630/Just_Cause_4_Reloaded/#\nNow, was the gameplay loop for JC4 executed well? In my opinion, it gave convenience to conquering the lands instead of finding each location and trying to find the last part to blow up (addicting, although got tiring at the end when trying to complete all settlements). It fulfilled my desire to the do the challenges to upgrade (although not as impressive as JC3). In a sense, the game was amazing with delivering to my desires and cravings at that time. I understand the backlash, in some people's eyes, the game downgraded in many ways.

Headshots are a lot easier.\n+ Grapple options are greatly expanded, allowing for new levels of creativity\n+ The single benefit of the sub-par graphics is that load times are VERY fast (especially compared to Just Cause 3).\n+ The story is a great continuation from Just Cause 3's story.\n+ Lots of fast-travel points\n+ Solis is large and laid out well\n\n+ /- Interesting system of the Rebellion Frontline and needing cause chaos to recruit more rebels to take more areas. Problem is, it devolves into repeated base-takeover missions, with no variation.\n+/- Just Cause games are built on using the same types of missions over and over in different settings. Just Cause 4 doesn't buck the trend.\n\n- - Mounted guns are no longer detachable. What the actual f--k?\n- No health indicator\n- Checkpoint saving only.\n- I suspect it still has Denuvo (the game exe is 274 MB)\n- No weapon or vehicle upgrades (there are a lot of weapons and vehicles to choose from, but no upgrade system)\n- No \"destruction tally / total\" for settlements. Destructible objects reset periodically (sometimes when loading a save). You can endlessly destroy stuff every time you boot the game, but a major feeling of progression is lost. \n- No timer on \"delivery events\" - so what's the point? Drive from point A to point B at the speed of a bicycle? Come on.\n- Stunt challenges now frequently require specific vehicles.\n- Stunt challenges don't appear in the game world unless you've deliberately tracked them from the map by clicking on them. (you'll be visiting the map a lot)\n- Graphics are a major disappointment. I'm firmly in the \"good enough\" camp when it comes to graphics, but compared to how stunning Just Cause 2 and Just Cause 3 were when they launched, Just Cause 4 is a major step backwards with major glitches with anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion. Hair is is bugged as well, resulting in a weird shimmer on hair textures. Textures in general are low-res (I played at 3440x1440). Even explosions look worse than previous games (and aren't as large, either). Where are the graphics from the pre-release trailers that said \"captured in-engine\"? Those graphics look glorious. They're no-where to be found in the actual game.\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967538421]Texture stream-in[/url] is a major problem (JC4 was installed on an SSD)\n- Pre-rendered cutscenes are a pixelated 720p mess. Media codecs have advanced significantly. Great picture quality in a small file size was very doable in 2018 when Just Cause 4 launched. There's no excuse for this.\n- Occasional crashing when attempting to fast-travel (four times in 27 hours)\n- Extended helicopter rampages are impossible now. Numerous enemy helicopters spawn immediately (not a problem) and will kill themselves and you by flying into you if they can't kill you immediately (that's a problem).\n- a very intricate supply drop system is made pointless by all the weapon cases that are EVERYWHERE\n- \"ghost spawns\" are frequent and annoying (enemies are invisible, but can still shoot you)\n- Tanks, helicopters, planes etc. now have a finite amount of ammo. So even if you survive the numerous suiciding enemies, your time in a tank or helicopter will be artificially limited. (\"But muh realism!\" - it's a game, it's supposed to be fun)\n- \"defend the transmitter\" side-missions are bulls--t. You'll spend way to much time re-doing them because there's an enemy you can't see / hit from the provided turret / mounted gun. (This \"hidden\" enemy will destroy the transmitter, requiring a re-start of the mission.)\n- Debris collision physics are buggy. Debris frequently gets stuck under vehicles (even tanks) causing severe handling issues.\n- Vehicle handling is as bad as it was in Just Cause 3.

It's not explicitely *good* per se, the story is utterly forgettable and meaningless, but the gameplay is just downright fun and lets you switch your brain off whilst you look at pretty explosions and making the baddies fly away into the sky with big oversized balloons. If you're coming to this game expecting anything more than a ps2-grade game where the loop is effectively \"go to this place, shoot the baddies, blow up these things, interact with this thing, repeat\", you're probably not going to have a great time of it.\n\n(2, or 1b) this game is janky as balls, man. object clipping is frequent. it's incredibly easy to get Rico stuck in some geometry for a short moment. The wingsuiting tech is weird and sometimes will let you easily turn whilst it wont other times. All adds to the charm but it can lead to frustration, especially when dealing with a lot of enemies in an area, hence this suggestion...\n\n(3) install a mod loader (Ashen is a good one since it just works by letting you press play in steam) and install a couple of mods that make you more overpowered (always fun, and rico is effectively meant to be superman lets be honest here) and/or a mod that completely removes the heat/wanted system. You might think, oh, well, that removes all the challenge from the game doesnt it? and yeah, it kinda does, but for me I found battling both the game's jankiness AND the hoardes of enemies to be extremely frustrating especially on the games various timed missions. Plus it makes all the bad guys just stand around awkwardly like they forgot why they just spawned in in the first place, which is always funny.\n\nwith all that said, its been a lovely little wind down game to muck about in whilst having some videos on in the background. i enjoy games where i basically have just a checklist of things to do that i can slowly chip away at bit by bit and this game is p much nothing but that. as for if its better than jc3 or 2? ehhh that's entirely subjective frankly, but for me this game runs better than those two and it doesnt have the mind numbing repetitiveness of jc3 wherein liberating every town was the exact same process every single time with the exact same objectives every single time.", "timestamp_created": 1682116657, "timestamp_updated": 1682116657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137051323": {"recommendationid": "137051323", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037601055", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 812, "last_played": 1681986553}, "language": "english", "review": "Games mechanics are super bland.

As far as I'm concerned the spring update was scarcely an improvement, the only good thing they added Rico being able to destroy railway bridges and, from what I remember in 2018, finally being able to destroy cement bridges which should have been a feature on release due to it already being a feature in 3. \n\nWhat's even more astonishing is this game doesn't even support water tessellation despite it actually being a graphical feature you can toggle. This game actually looks worse than JC3 in almost every way, driving vehicles and flying feels worse than 3, and somehow they fucked up motorcycles more than 3, when JC3 already severely downgraded motorcycle movement from JC2. The main story is... okay at best. they took out liberating settlements and the new system felt shitty in 2018 and it still does in 2023, however the DLC narratives are probably about as good as the story a piece of toilet paper has after you wipe your ass with it. The cherry on top of this shit cake is how horrible the rebel's colour scheme for vehicles are, From JC1-JC3 I've enjoyed every factions colour schemes for vehicles but here, only the black hand prevail in fashion.

your in a helicopter and all of a sudden the chopper goes flying off to the right because you barely tapped a destructible rock on a cliff, but i think part of that is hilarious at the same time and adds to the fun because you then have to ddecide in a split second if the copper will survive and you can recover or you need to bail and open your parachute. 8/10 for me", "timestamp_created":

And I would like to think i did a pretty good job of that. The game at its core is similar to the other ones, blow shit up complete quests etc etc. \n\nBUT the things you will interact  with to actually play and enjoy the game, the menus, the story, the dialogue, driving vehicles, all feel very rushed.\n\nCutscenes are super short and poorly written, the voice acting feels like they used the wrong filter for the audio. AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE MENUS. Playing on PC you are forced to use the enter keys, backspace and the arrow keys to navigate. You cant just click on stuff. AND WHY ON GODS GREEN EARTH IS THE NUMBER 1 KEY, THE KEY YOU USE IN LITERALLY EVERY OTHER GAME TO SWAP WEAPONS WITH... WHY IS IT THE MENU BUTTON!\n\nEdit: having finally beaten the game this review doesnt change much and goes further to note that vehicle physics are awful. Vehicles don't have ANY traction off road. You grind to a halt and cant accelerate or steer for garbage. \nAnd on more than one occasion parts of the environment will get stuck inside of vehicles and auto detonate them. sometimes in missions where you need to protect the vehicle you can do nothing more than helplessly watch as the health bar plummets towards zero.\n\nas a further note, the world is large and empty. its fast travel here, wing-suit or fly (because driving is RARELY an option) to the location do a quest and rinse repeat. There are way to many challenges outside of missions don't even bother collecting them all. its simply not worth the headache.\n\nIn terms of combat encounters, they all feel either way to easy or way to hard, there is little in between. which is really unfortunate due to the fact the guns and gun play feel pretty alright. \n\nI'm unsure of what kind of substance these developers were smoking but the execution and design of this game falls flat in every turn.\n\nThe only thing I can say that is positive about this is the gun play feels alright. BUT  even that takes a hit in some missions where you simply need to be better to have a victory. \n\noverall do not buy this game for anything more than 10 bucks. and go in with little in expectations.

Both the good and the bad.\n\nFirstly, I've waited a long time before choosing to buy this game. I've watched some many videos and read reviews and opinions. I've done my best to keep my feelings unbiased as well. \n\nI'd also like to say that I can see the developers tried to go in a new direction and also had good intentions. I can see in some areas they really did put effort in. But their approach and design choices were not very good overall and this has left me disappointed in the game. However there is good too and I do not feel it's right to simply bash a game and pretend there isn't anything good about it IF there is good.So here is my review.\n\n- The world is beautifully designed. I feel like it's an improvement over the 3rd in some ways. Not in every way. But definitely some prettier things to see overall. Graphically, I am not impressed overall. But it's alright. However there ARE some eyesores particularly with the water both ocean and river. \n\n- Gameplay wise I found that some steps were taken forward. But I am sad to say that many seem to have been taken back. \n\nI like the challenge of the combat with the enemies. It's got some fun to it however I do feel it could have benefited from further balancing. Sometimes missions and general gameplay get a bit too unfair. And more annoying rather than fun.\n\nThe missions are too repetitive and tedious. I am not a fan of it and honestly I think they could have done better than the same defend this, flip these switches, destroy these generators and so on. \n\nI hate that there is no longer a real reason to destroy all the \"red objects\" and thus liberate the locations. This mechanic was genuinely a favorite of mine and they removed it.\n\nThe destruction feels less in this one and whilst I've found some new things to destroy, overall, it feels less. Even bridges can no longer be destroyed which is quite saddening honestly.. I enjoyed that feature.. \n\nIt seems the developers have tried to turn Just Cause 4 into a more serious game rather than sticking to it's random fun and silly factor. Its very clear when you look at the storyline aspect. However their attempt to make a good story falls short. I can see they tried, but I felt that up to the point I played, that it lacked real emotion. It wasn't well thought out in my opinion and in some ways seemed sort of rushed. As if they threw random ideas into it and tried to piece it together.  They should have rather stuck to focusing more on the gameplay. I can tell just from the early parts of the storyline that it's not something that will truly grip me. However I can see they had the right idea. But just poorly executed. \n\nThe UI is genuinely terrible. I honestly find it annoying. The drops for weapons/items/vehicles is just absolutely dreadful to to use. One pilot for one item, must wait and all that nonsense.. I get you wanted to go for realism. But gosh... I really honestly don't know what they were thinking with this design choice. It's really the worst I've ever encountered in a game and I mean it.. And the same goes for the UI. The map, the changing of the grappling hook stuff including upgrading of features etc. Just Cause 3 did this very well. But 4 just really failed in pretty much every way here..\n\nBug wise/crashes. Gosh crashes,freezes and all. I am utterly disappointed. Also, don't buy this if you're on Windows 7. Because despite the store page saying the minimum requirements is windows 7 SP1, you're going to have issues playing it. LOTS of freezing, LOTS of crashes. And overall, unplayable. You need to at least be on windows 10. But the thing is, there is a STILL a chance you're gonna have the same problems unfortunately... So beware.. Just take a look at the tech support section on the Steam Forums and you'll see for yourself just how bad it really is. I can only play this properly on 10 or higher.\n\nThe Wingsuit is still really nice but I found they had made some changes in it's handling. I find JC3 to do things better. If one has the DLC for the jetpack addon, it really is far more satisfying to use. It feels (and am pretty sure it is) faster than JC3 and I found myself really having fun just exploring the world with it. The weapons on it, I found it much easier to use the rockets to hit my target than in JC3 and it is overall, fairly satisfying. They did a good job on this part.\n\nThe car chases whilst you're on a vehicle felt faster in missions which I enjoyed as well. It felt nice and more action packed in some ways. This I feel was a good improvement. So plus 1 to them.\n\nFun factor wise, I struggled to enjoy the game overall. The vehicles, the weapons etc.. They had the right idea and direction in their minds. But again, fell short/executed it all poorly.\n\nThe extreme weather was an interesting concept. But it doesn't feel like a selling point for me to be honest. \n\nIn a nutshell. This game has a lot of disappointments. However there IS good in it. There IS fun to be had. And I've seen plenty reviews and so on where people really did enjoy themselves. But for me, I can't personally recommend the game. I feel it's taken too many steps backwards on what makes Just Cause fun and enjoyable. The steps taken forward don't make up for the steps taken back and so it leaves me feeling bored and frustrated rather than happy and immersed.\n\nI would honestly rather recommend buying Just Cause 3 or even Just Cause 2. They live up to the franchise and offer more fun. However if you can get this game on sale for 50-75% off, then I'd say get it. It does offer some fun and it's not a complete failure. But I can't say it's not worth full price and nor can I justify paying the full price. It has some wonderful aspects. But overall, it's a no for me.", "timestamp_created": 1680860987, "timestamp_updated": 1680861146, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511686146259307861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136222237": {"recommendationid": "136222237", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042659494", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1596, "last_played": 1680822969}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who loved the 3rd game, I was obviously stoked for this one.

The game is incredibly easy, Rico can take like 20 gunshots before dying and your health regenerates incredibly quickly, over my 9 hours with the game, I died once, maybe twice. There is no challenge to the core combat loop, with challenge only coming from annoying mission objectives.\n\nInstead of the satisfying chaos system from Just Cause 2 where every outpost and town can be cleared with a fun 100 percent system, we get a generic leveling system that feels like it's just from Assassin's Creed or Horizon ZD. Blowing up stuff is still fun but it lacks the strong backing of the chaos system and generally just feels kinda hollow.\n\nThe main missions feel drawn out and uninspired. A lot of the missions will have you guiding some incredibly stupid NPCs out of a military base, the AI for both friendlies and enemies is incredibly stupid, it's especially annoying in missions when friendlies you rely on to complete mission objectives just don't act how you'd expect them to, randomly stopping for like 30 seconds or getting stuck on a random wall. NPCs will not die, they have an insane amount of health and can probably take hundreds of bullets before dying, but the missions are still somehow challenging because the AI will constantly just break. Also, instead of just escorting one group of NPCs to the exit of the facility, you have to escort 3 groups one by one and it takes fucking forever, it's so boring.\n\nThere are also boring hacking quests where you kinda just stand near a computer waiting for it to download data or something while shooting at enemies.\n\nThe map feels kinda lifeless, JC2 had a big central city that felt alive plus lots of smaller villages, and a lot of military bases \nthat felt at least a little different from one another. In this game, there is one sort of bigger city that is still very small with almost nothing to do in it, all the smaller towns have nothing to do in them, nothing to blow up and usually no enemies to fight and all the military bases feel incredibly similar just being giant concrete blocks that are really boring to look at. The world just doesn't feel alive, there's no reason to ever visit different areas in the game that aren't military bases.\n\nThis game has Denuvo which I hate, Denuvo should be removed from JC3 and 4, I've been blocked from playing this game because it \"couldn't connect to the servers\", meaning I'm being punished for legally owning this game. Squeenix needs to remove Denuvo from this.\n\nThere is some dumb fun to be had here, the combat can be fun despite having 0 challenge and blowing stuff up can be a cool looking spectacle even if I don't really have any motivation to be blowing things up aside from just the fun sparks and fire. The traversal can also be fun, wing-suiting and parachuting around is fun, the grappling hook feels good, it feels good to use the traversal mechanics well to get around the map quickly.\n\nOverall, there is some fun here and you might want to get the game for a very discounted price, but I'd recommend playing Just Cause 2 over this game because the world feels more alive, JC2 doesn't have Denuvo DRM/can always be played offline, and blowing stuff up is more satisfying in JC2 because of the Chaos system.", "timestamp_created": 1680697738, "timestamp_updated": 1681309715, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136139259": {"recommendationid": "136139259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121604990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1353, "last_played": 1680781639}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play JC3.\nThey ruined just about everything that makes the Just Cause franchise worth anything with JC4. \n\nThe story sucks, the world is extremely blend once you get through the first few hours.

The thing that made its predecessor Just Cause 3 fun is taking over military bases by just blowing the shit out of them with missiles and gradually taking them apart one petrol storage container at a time, like eating a large explosive meal that leaves you very satisfied. \n\nWhat they decided to do for this one is to have the bases be the same 4-5 mini-missions spread across about 30 bases. what these base missions have in common are that they are all uniformly bland, boring, and irritating all in their own unique ways, and most require just standing at a console and doing \"hacking\" for 5 minutes while you shoot the dull weapons at the dull enemies. It's such a baffling design decision, because they have all the explosive tanks and whatever scattered around, but destroying them is more or less a waste of ammo apart from seeing the pretty explosions, they don't progress the missions. Even Just cause 2 had that and just cause 2 is fucking tedious to take over bases in. \n\nThe story is bland, and the characters are about as boring as revolutionary war leaders could possibly be. The humour is hit and miss but mostly miss (and to be honest maybe I was just in a good mood when it \"hit\"). Just cause is not a game you go to for a good story anyway but not one of these bland-as-a-cement-sandwich moon-faced cretins has a quarter of, for example, Dimah Al-Masri's personality.\n\nSo we have poor gameplay, ignorable story, and all the good gameplay elements are transplanted from JC3, what do I LIKE about this game? \n\nThe setting! The map is absolutely beautiful, huge, and varied like just cause 2, only with better traversal. For some reason they made the cars all as fast as the bavarium supercar from 3 to push it towards making driving a thing that anyone would ever want to do in a game where you have a rocket powered wingsuit (spoilers: I never used cars in this game apart from in missions). And I like that they made the cars fast, I like that they have Jets and planes and helicopters absolutely everywhere, it's almost like half of avalanche knew what kind of game they were making. Just Cause 4's map with Just Cause 3's mechanics would be a marvellous game. If only the mission designers had ever played a GAME before, it might actually be a fun to liberate however many bases and play through the missions, but instead they went for \"Breaker box breaker box breaker box hack the terminal destroy the generators defend the satellite dish drive the fucking explosive cars in to the river (because god forbid anything explode in this just cause game) et fucking cetera.\n\nIt's an exhausting mess of a game to play through, and the only times I felt like I was having fun were outside of missions, just messing about in the sandbox. They give you like thruster and balloon grappling hooks for some reason, probably so they could put it in the trailer, and apart from the missions where they introduced them I NEVER used them for the entire game, it's like a fun thing to have I guess? Maybe I wasn't creative enough? I don't think it would've saved this from being a slog though.\n\nTLDR: Listen to the other hundreds of reviews that say to get just cause 3 instead, the whole thing plus DLC is usually less than a tenner on steam sales.", "timestamp_created": 1678899700, "timestamp_updated": 1678899700, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875993490219116211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134661225": {"recommendationid": "134661225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135648880", "num_games_owned": 826, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1678816839}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if I played for one hour, this one seems like a downgrade compared to JC3.

Maybe\n\nIf you love guarding missions, or missions that force you to stay in one place while NPCs \"hack\" systems while enemies pop in out of nowhere and attack you from all sides then buy this game. If you hated JC2 or JC3's more free flowing game play and wished that missions were absolutely required to take over an enemy facility then you will love this game. If you love needlessly complex systems that make game play frustrating while trying to deal with a chaotic game then you will love this game. If you love how enemy units would spawn in out of nowhere to attack you then you will love this game.\nIf the above sounds great, then buy the game now and ignore what I say below.\n\nThe good things from this game. I loved feeling like there was an actual revolution going on. Having revolutionaries join in the fight was nice. It really felt like you were fighting a battle to free people. The past games felt like a solo war with the occasional battle with incompetent NPCs that I largely ignored. As cool as this is, it just becomes background noise after a while.\n\nI like that there are weapons with so many different neat features. The gun that turns into a shielded turret and the guns with various explosive weapons. They are kind of fun. But I also miss having separate grenades and various explosive weapons.\n\nThe really big, annoying thing is the missions. I loved the free flowing nature of the previous games. I could approach capturing the map however I pleased. Now I have to perform missions to capture virtually every part of the map. I hated having to complete missions in JC2&3, but I did them when I had to. Missions are a major part of JC4.\nYou have to protect someone or something while waves of enemies swarm you or travel around activating things. There is some variations, but they are not terribly fun.\n\nI miss having the supply drop available. Along with many of the things from JC3. The mechs and jet suite were fun. Yes, you can get them as overpriced DLC, but I won't. It is not a fun enough game to warrant buying it, at least at full price.\n\nLong story short, am I happy with the game? I know that I am not enjoying it as much as JC2 or JC3. I have played 6 hours, and I am honestly getting tired of it already. It has some innovative and interesting things added to it. I wish that they would mix the good from the earlier games with the good from this one for future games. We will see if they do.\n\nIf you are going to buy it, buy it on sale. I don't recommend buying it at full price. If you love the series, then try it.

My knowledge was simply that this was a third-person open-world game with a massive map, lots of side quests, and a reactive and interactive environment (i.e. everything blows up).\n\nI\u2019ve heard that a lot of the fun involved in grappling yourself around the world and blowing stuff - which to be honest, was more than enough for me. Immediately prior to Just Cause, I played three first-person games (Superliminal, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided), two of them with long run times and I was ready for a break from that perspective.\n\nAs the game was installing, I googled about the JC\u2019s franchise plot to see if I needed any catching p before booting the game, but Reddit assured me the plot for each JC game is independent of each other, so with that in mind, I finally clicked \u201cPlay\u201d.\n\nAfter a short introduction where not much is said, done or explained, we\u2019re in control of Rico Rodriguez. There is probably more here to dig into if you\u2019ve played the other games in the franchise, but I did not get much information out of this short intro. Before you realize it, you\u2019re controlling the main character.\n\nAnd then I started pressing random buttons (since the game doesn\u2019t give you a lot of hints of what does what). Shot a grenade, fired some shots, jumped, reloaded, and then I finally found RB and grappled myself to the nearest wall. Then I grappled myself to a tower nearby, and then to the top of another wall, and suddenly I was parachuting across a valley. In 15 seconds I had covered an insane amount of ground already, and it became quite clear to me that traversing through the vast landscapes in this environment was going to be a blast. Rico glides across the geography with ease, and I was looking forward to reaching my objective (flagged by a green marker in the screen, which was fortunately small enough that didn\u2019t distract me, but contrasted enough with the environment that I could easily find it when I looked for it).\n\nWe start going up and down valleys, following some pipes, and you can avoid some baddies by taking the high route and staying out of their way. I wanted to see if the game was going to give me some combat tutorial, so I decided instead to go BOOM on them, which gave me the first chance to fire around.\n\nMy main impressions at this point were: (1) aiming and shooting with the Xbox controller is way harder than what I used to in Deus Ex playing with mouse and keyboard, (2) auto-aim and/or aim correction will be a must for me (I don\u2019t know if it was on by default or not, but I could see the crosshair floating towards the enemy and I was grateful for that), and (3) Rico seems to have a decent amount of health and it regenerates quickly enough that I didn\u2019t have to worry about it too much. I don\u2019t want my experience to be too stressful, so I\u2019ll keep these settings and difficulty levels even if the game offers me the chance to ramp them up.\n\nA few minutes of grappling, shooting and parachuting later, I\u2019m at the literal top of the world (or at least what I have seen of it so far). I quickly went towards the objective, which was a control panel that I hacked while being showered by bullets. There was a short opportunity to drive a utility vehicle into a pile of exploding barrels and I was shot so much and still survived without an issue, and then quickly the tutorial mission ended and I was greeted with the title screen. In less than 30 minutes, I felt that I understood the basic game controls and travel mechanics, and felt very excited to continue playing. While I believe my aim suffered a lot from being on an Xbox controller, movement is the core of the game and it feels much easier to move around with a dual analog stick than with a mouse/keyboard combo and I\u2019ll probably keep playing with the controller.\n\nThe reality is that, after the tutorial, there are still a few additional missions that are aimed mostly at teaching aspects of the game, namely, Supply Drops, territorial expansion, Grapple Lifter, Grapple Booster, and Retractor. You also learn how to manage troops across the map, but at this point, I feel that both the tutorial and the story are quite rushed and not necessarily coherent. Characters are introduced extremely quickly without any background, and then they are fundamental parts of the story and you\u2019re supposed to care for them. Sorry, but I don\u2019t. \n\nIf the story keeps being a miss, the gameplay and the graphics remain a plus. Moving around Solis is a blast. Better if you start at the high ground and can glide across the landscape, but moving to high ground is not a big deal with the help of your grapple. I quickly learned to grapple the ground, gain some momentum and then lift off with the parachute, and this seems to be the main mode of transportation across the island.\n\nThe story tries to tease you about some kind of spontaneous revolution started by Rico, but if we\u2019re being honest, it\u2019s very flaky. It\u2019s just too convenient and hard to believe. It doesn\u2019t really matter so much since your main goal is to gain ground and kaboom things, but it would be a nice plus if you had the world fleshed out a bit more and believable characters instead of just throwing a lot of random story bits and hoping they stick (spoiler alert - they don\u2019t stick).\n\nThat\u2019s when you start to be introduced to more missions. Some of the earlier examples include escort when you jump on top of a moving truck and kaboom all the other vehicles that approach; prisoner liberation, where you go into a base, open some prison doors, protect prisoners, and make everything else go kaboom; and transport, where you drop a helicopter (?) from a container in front of you (??) and become a pilot for someone that I barely know who it is (but it doesn\u2019t matter, as long as you go kaboom at some point).\n\nIt took me a while until I finally figured out the core gameplay loop - it\u2019s all about territorial liberation. When you start the game, most of the map is dominated by your enemy, the Black Hand. You have to generate a type of resource named \u201cSquads\u201d to liberate more territory, and you do so by kabooming things and exploding Black Hand infrastructure more generally. The amount of Squads necessary to liberate an area depends on the neighboring areas, so there\u2019s a strategic element to which areas you liberate, and in which order - so you don\u2019t run out of squad resources.\n\nSome areas also require region strike missions to be accomplished before you can move your squads in, and these missions usually involve visiting the area and causing chaos - for instance, messing with the Black Hand airport in Islas Intichayers, or stealing a warship in Recalada.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that it\u2019s not entirely clear how this system is supposed to work when you first start playing. Sure, the game has a mini tutorial that explains the mechanic, but not the logic or strategy behind it, and since this is such an open-ended world that gives you so many degrees of freedom, it\u2019s hard to even know where to start. I had to rely on a walkthrough after reading on Reddit that, starting in the \u201cwrong\u201d order could cause you to be locked outside regions without troops and with high costs to advance, whereas the \u201cright\u201d order would have you taking region after region for free, if not earning troops when you do so. It\u2019s great that the game is open, but if that openness gets in your way of properly advancing through the game, that\u2019s a failure.", "timestamp_created": 1677711490, "timestamp_updated": 1677711490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705528438091278076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133787642": {"recommendationid": "133787642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084324953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 11229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 10894, "last_played": 1699884692}, "language": "english", "review": "The games good now. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1677570361, "timestamp_updated": 1677570361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133786855": {"recommendationid": "133786855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275990474", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1677562041}, "language": "english", "review": "If you can't even bother to teach your players how to use a unique mechanic that is integral to the game, how can you expect anyone to enjoy your game?

It is not a game i ever intend on playing again or replaying. I am a fan of the series but seeing reviews being mixed i held off and bought on sale and got all of the dlc's i recommend you do the same.\n\nPros- \n*Fun game mechanics.\n*Large map\n*Beautiful areas to explore.\n*Lots of content\n*numerous vehicles to play with.\n\nCons-\n*Sometimes there is too much content. repetition is enough to make you drink with all the stunts and everything this game has you doing over and over.\n*Why can i grapple parachute hoverboard fly launch missiles off my back but only carry 2 weapons at a time.In my opinion this is a great disservice and there should be a weapon wheel with more weapon unlocks being added to it and a primary focus on ammo like in Grand theft auto. (Wow i can't believe i said that either) but that system would work so well in this game.\n*Cut scenes are horrendous. In most games they look better than the game. In this it feels like someone swapped my graphics card for the time being to something from the 90's then right back after it's over.\n*Honestly the story is probably 6-8 hours of this game and the rest is collecting this or that and finding locations.\n*The missions could be longer they don't take very much time at all to finish.\n*the dlc's are ok but i didn't want more stuff to hunt down or a damned hoverboard i was forced to use.\n*I really missed the mechanic like JC3 had where there were locations and you had to destroy things to clear the location. I feel as if that should have been present not solely but mixed in as well as having stunts. Some locations are stunts others are destruction.\n*Grappling hook while parachuting is awful it seems there isn't as much reach as what you had in JC2 or JC3 which would often leave me stranded in free air in scenarios where i did not or could not use the glider suit.\n\nI could probably go on forever but in summary i give it a 2/5. Its fun but after buying it i put it down immediately probably for the better part of 2 years. I finally made it my job to finish this game so it wasn't looking at me all the time and i had another 100% on my steam account.

Rip me up and down for it, I've heard wonderful things about 2 and 3, but nothing good about 4. Literally the only reason I got 4 was tornado go brrr. Note I got every achievement and have a good chunk of hours into the game. Here's the gist of things:\n\nGRAPHICS\n- Its visually pleasing to look at for its release date, for a 2018 game its decent to look at and nothing looks or feels too bad.\n\nCOMBAT\n- It's bare bones. You do one thing wrong in front of an enemy they will endlessly come at you until you either run away or die. It's not like GTA where they get harder as you gain stars but instead its based on the vehicle you're operating (e.g. they send helicopters if you're in one | they send tanks if you're in a ground vehicle)\n\nSTORY/QUESTS\n- I can't make this up, apart from the side quests there are only 10 STORY QUESTS, 3 for each region and 1 for the final mission which was VERY very lackluster. The downloadable content side missions are mid as well. They tried to lengthen the game by locking quests based on the regions you have conquered.\n\nOPEN WORLD STUFF\n- There is an ungodly amount of \"stunt\" open world mini quests to do, I spent literally 14 hours in one day just to finish them (they take way longer than that), they make you do these stunts to unlock new weapons and vehicles. \n\nPHYSICS\n- Mobility in this game is its strong point with the grappling system. Its entertaining to lift enemies and vehicles into the sky or launch cows using the booster perk. The physics can be janky at times, if you shoot a tank at a specific angle with another tank, it will launch into the sky. If you ram a car at a high enough speed sometimes they go flying. Controlling boats and planes are absolutely abysmal and aren't fun to control at all.\n\nBUGS\n- There aren't a lot of bugs in the game, but the times I did experience bugs they were always game breaking. Examples being getting stuck inside a freight boat and not being able to get out or blow it up, or after dying and the lighting starts to flash uncontrollably. \n\nThere's probably a lot more that I could say about this game. Its not a bad game but its no that great of a game, once you finish the story it just kinda sucks after since there's nothing much to do. If you really like Just Cause I'd wait for an 80% off sale or just buy it off of G2A or something, I dont recommend buying this game at full price and I will say I didn't enjoy this game to the fullest", "timestamp_created": 1676967877, "timestamp_updated": 1676967877, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false,

many ways to perform some of the coolest stunts from your favorite action movies that by the time you think you've exhausted all of them, a new idea pops into your head and it's back into the thunderstorm/sandstorm/tornado once more.\n\n- Very well optimized (running on a GTX 1050 2GB mind you, on an I5-8300h, a real potato machine..... and it not only manages to stay alive during a session, but keeps a relatively stable framerate as well, 40-60 range), if not the most graphically impressive game, certainly not as pretty as Just Cause 3 but also more reliably smooth and visually diverse.\n\n- A story that once again doesn't take itself too seriously, features the Latino James Bond and Ethan Hunt lovechild performing badass shit as usual and actually manages to give Rico a somewhat decent and compelling backstory with action movie tropes of family, friendship and rebellion against a tyrannical government that once again works as well as it did in prior entries. The characters are not as memorable or funny as the cast of JC 3 in my opinion, no MOORIO :( but Rico and Sheldon's relationship I thought got a very compelling arc throughout this game, as these two have gone from student mentor, to surrogate son and father, to untrustworthy ally and compadre to finally brothers in arms fighting back against the very agency that made them the people they are today (this gets particularly well-fleshed out in the game's Danger Rising DLC, which was my favorite Expansion of the 3 available in the Complete and Gold editions of the game). So overall, the story fits the action, and the action fits the story, good.\n", "timestamp_created": 1675029185, "timestamp_updated": 1675029185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Instead of blowing up a bunch of stuff until you take over the base, you do tedious and repetitive missions to advance front lines into regions. Chaos now gives you more reserve squads to deploy on the front lines. And the DLC? Don't even get me started on the DLC. It's trash and a waste of your hard earned money. So yea.

If I had written a review after an hour or two I would have slammed it. Although I had read negative reviews so my expectations were low, my initial impression was total disappointment. Having enjoyed JC, JC2 and even JC3 (which I felt was a bit of a let-down compared to JC2) this one seemed all wrong. I think it was mostly because of the new method of taking ownership of territory using the chaos meter and of course the weird menu. But it also felt that the game was forcing me into it too fast and I was just fighting enemy forces instead of being in control of a new adventured.\n\nHaving paid over \u00a310 for everything (which is a lot for someone who normally only buys games at 80% discount in the Steam sales) I had to persevere with the game so I took my Rico away from the main action and focused on the game mechanics and menu so that I could adapt to it, and then played some of the dlc \"side missions\" and challenges at my own pace. That made me feel back in control so that I could then progress the main missions. Gradually the game felt a whole lot better and I started to enjoy it.\n\nAs others have noted, some of the graphics aren't great and the mechanics aren't as good as they should be - grappling hook accuracy varies and some of the vehicles are almost undriveable. The game design is reasonable, although there is a bit too much repetition where it could have been avoided, and some of the challenges are badly thought out and a bit pointless. The extra features of the grappling hook seemed clever but I couldn't get into them. They felt over-complicated and not entirely intuitive. Often I had to edit the mode in order to get it to do what I wanted. That's probably why the designers had created profiles but I just wasn't that interested. I enjoyed the story and the addition of the 3 dlcs lengthened gameplay to more than 60 hours.\n\nI think I disagree with many reviewers: In my opinion JC4 is in some ways better than JC3.

Coming off JC3 I was very disappointed with many of the changes they made here.\n\nThe BAD\n\n1. No handheld explosives like in JC3 - instead you have to either engage with the new grapple systems or use the new alt fire modes found on most guns to get sort of real damage output against objects and vehicles.\n\n2. the new grapple mechanics - imo the balloons are a gimmick which are good for a bit of messing around but not very helpful for actually clearing bases and the novelty wears off quckly. I miss the much stronger grapple from JC3 which could easily pull helicopters out of the sky. The default grapple here feels much weaker even when toggling it to its strongest pull.\n\n3. enemies - once your alert meter goes up it can feel like a chore to get enemies off your back as they seem to pursue you for far longer and further than in JC3. they also seem to spawn more quickly as I rarely felt like I had actually cleared an area because new enemies would always pop up\n\n4. activities - the flashy 5 star/gear system and reward screen in JC3 made every activity feel meaningful. In JC4 side activies like wingsuit courses feel hollow and not worth doing as there arent any great rewards and theres not even a screen popping up to say you did it in most cases.\n\n5. bases - the goal is no longer about destroying red objects - you know, the straightforward objective of each base in JC3 that encouraged using the sandbox to wreak havoc? Red objects actually respawn now and the only point to destroying any of it is getting points towards the conquest mechanic which is token at best. This is already a huge disappointment but then each base now has an actual objective to do. This sounds cool on paper but the missions get recycled a lot and many of them now involve escorting NPCs or protecting an object - which I shouldn't have to explain is a very poor choice for a series about high mobility and explosions\n\n6. vehicles - vehicles have ammo now which seems unnessecary. Some vehicles have enough ammo you'll never run out but others like the bomber jet seem to have enough for 1 or 2 runs before you may as well ditch the vehicle. Ground vehicles like tanks seem to be made out of paper now while air vehicles seem to be able to take more hits than in JC3 which is strange.\n\n7. graphics - my PC is not very high spec anymore so take this with a grain of salt but I swear the graphics are worse here than in 3.\n\nThe GOOD\n\n1. story - its hardly a work of art but the story is fine for the type of game this is. Its mostly held together by a few entertaining characters though Rico himself seems rather low energy for most of the game\n\n2. story missions -credit where its due there are some cool moments here - the region finales involving the weather mechanics are the highlight with tornadoes, thunderstorms and sandstorms. Id even go so far as to say that the best missions here are a way bigger spectacle than any one mission in JC3.\n\n3. map - personally I like Medici more but theres decent variety here with jungle, desert, and grassland regions\n\nAt the end of the day its a JC game and there is definitely some fun to be had here, especially if this is your first time with the series. For me though I felt that JC4 made unnecessary changes to the formula that took away what I liked so much about JC3, and it ends up being a very hollow experience where I finished the game and immediately went back to JC3 instead.\n", "timestamp_created": 1671650493, "timestamp_updated": 1671650493, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128981858": {"recommendationid": "128981858", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082551301", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1689030060}, "language": "english", "review": "Better on sale, but pretty good actually", "timestamp_created": 1671649903, "timestamp_updated": 1671649903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128978204": {"recommendationid": "128978204", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213499629", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1700785987}, "language": "english", "review": "It is good.", "timestamp_created": 1671645156, "timestamp_updated": 1671645156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486111104488372803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128932087": {"recommendationid": "128932087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009634062", "num_games_owned": 1014, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1693712165}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY fun.

I bought JC4 expecting a decent sequel and after a couple of hours posted this critic so... Let's see what I got.\n\n[h1]Loyal to its older brother : 8/10[/h1]\nJC3 was all about having fun with the unrealistic physics, grappling around and using your wingsuit to jump unsuspecting ennemies and destroy their whole base without them being able to do anything against you. And JC4 does it quite well. It even jump starts and bypasses the lengthy upgrading system in JC3 by giving you, right at the start of the game, 10 tethers (more than the 6 tethers limit in JC3) and in a couple of missions (less than 30 minutes of gameplay) provides you with the boosters and the air lifter. Overall, the reason I \"only\" gave it an 8/10 is because they unnecessarily changed the way you free the areas of the map. In JC3 you have to find several spots in each area, destroy all chaos objects and you were done. Here there is a bit less destruction involved and it is more like about completing certain missions, then ordering your \"troops\" to move in another area in which you will repeat the process. I think the idea was to make it feel like Rico needs the island's people to win but it sounds silly considering that the NPCs are just as useless as they were in JC3. Seriously, I just did a mission for which I need to take two NPCs with me drive in a car for several kilometers to destroy 4 boxes. It took me almost 10 minutes to get it done whereas doing it by myself with the wingsuit would have taken me less than 2 minutes. Basically you are still a one man army and you could install a mod that removes every member of the resistance and you wouldn't feel any difference. I think JC5, if it is made one day, should take this one man army seriously : the cutscenes should be about NPCs telling Rico that he needs their help to kill the evil dictator and Rico answering \"Hey, I just destroyed 5 ennemy bases by myself without a scratch, don't worry about me, just stand back and enjoy the show\".\nAnyway, overall it is enjoyable, fun to play and the feeling is similar to what you had in JC3 between the gunfights, the wingsuit/parachute combo, the tethers and the handling of the fun and unrealistic physics.\n\n[h1]Chaos mechanics : 4/10[/h1]\nIn JC3, the usual way you free an area was : head to this area, discover the N settlements in it (small bases, big bases, outposts...), destroy every chaos object in these settlements and the area becomes yours and the rebels now occupy these settlements.\nIn JC4, they removed this idea that you had to cause mayhem and destruction. Basically you do the 2 or 3 missions you can find in an area, during which you will have to kill black hand's soldiers, which generates chaos which grants you \"rebel squads\". These squads are \"stored\" somewhere in your... Inventory ? Whatever, basically you accumulate squads and once you have enough (between 2 and 4 for most areas) you click on the map to say \"hey, rebels, go free this area\", at which point the rebels establish a frontline where the constantly fight the black hand on the borders of this area. Then you do the missions in this area, accumulate a few more squads and proceeed to the next area. I do not like this idea, not only is it a fake way of pushing the idea that \"Rico is just a man, he can't take the black hand by himself, he need help from the rebels who can't even kill a single foot-soldier in 5vs1 in less than 1 minute\" even though you can move around freely on the whole map and utterly destroy any black hand squad you encounter. I really feel like the devs saw a few videos on youtube of players utterly destroying some black hand military bases and decided that \"oh no, we can't have that, we need the player to work hand in hand with the rebels, it's much more realistic than a single man freeing a country !\". I'm not exactly sure what was the motivation here, but it is a big failure, the amount of chaos you have to generate in \"roaming\" when you just mess with the black hand is absurd, i litterally spent 15 minutes destroying almost 50 helicopters and 50 armed cars and killing several soldiers, it only granted me 1/10th of a squad.\n\n[h1]Graphics : 5/10[/h1]\nSimilar to JC3, graphics are not particularly great, personnaly I don't care about this in video games so it doesn't bother me. Just a quick note about the level design : the starting area (wachikuni, terra del qhapaq, hamparas...) looks a lot like what you can find in some parts of Ghost recon : Wildlands. \n\n[h1]Keyboard controls : 3/10[/h1]\nDear video games developers, for the last fucking time, no, no and no, I do not want, under any circumstances, to spend 15 minutes in the controls menu setting up my keys for walking, then for piloting a plane, then for piloting a helicopter, then for driving a car, then for FOR FUCK'S SAKE WHO IN THIS WORLD USES DIFFERENT MOVEMENT KEYS BETWEEN THEIR CHARACTER MOVEMENTS AND THE VEHICLE MOVEMENTS ??? I don't get it. I also do not want to have to go through the 13 different menus to see what action is the 'X' key bound to if I want to use it for something. Binding keys should not be that hard : you double click on an action, you press the key you want to attribute to this action, and if it is already bound the game either highlights the conflict or switches both keys. Then you display every action in the same menu with categories, you do not split it between 13 submenus.\nWhile we are talking about the menus, if you have the sound and the sensitivity set as values between 0 and 100 (it goes even beyond 100 for the sensitivity, I don't understand how scales work in your minds but whatever), you either use a slider or provide us with an input to quickly change it, I don't want to hold my right arrow for 30 seconds to reach the value I want. \nDriving feels as weird as some of the games with the weird driving system I have ever seen like Ghost Recon: Wildlands and Watch Dogs 1. No intertia, your car's tires are basically made of oil, but frankly aside from missions that require me to use a car I stick to the good old wingsuit so it's not that much of a bother. \n\n[h1]Story : 0/10[/h1]\nIf you played JC3 for its story, you're weird. The story of JC3 was worthy of a very low-budget serie Z movie, and the same can be said for JC4. You start by attacking a base by yourself, you handle everything they throw at you, and suddenly cut-scene and you lose and get shot down. Had the game left the controls to you, the final boss would have been dealt with in less than 10 minutes. \nI rated it 0/10 but lets be frank, it is like rating minecraft's graphics 0/10 : the mark is deserved, but just like you're not supposed to care about minecraft's graphics, you're not supposed to care about Just Cause's story. It's a silly story that doesn't make the slightest sense, and it doesn't matter at all.\n\n[h1]Overall : 1/10[/h1]\nHad I posted this evaluation yesterday, the overall note would have been 7/10 and my explanation for it : \n[code]I wouldn't say it is a must play, but it is a decent sequel to JC3. About as fun as its older brother, JC4 is rather enjoyable but unless you are a hardcore fan of the series, I would advise to wait for some discount, I wouldn't considering spending more than 15-20\u20ac for it.[/code]\n\nTurns out that I started the game today, did an Alt+Tab to browse youtube during the startup, then went back to the game once it was one the main menu. It was in windowed mode, which lead me to pressing Alt+Enter to set it up in fullscreen. Since it did nothing and the window appeared to be frozen I pressed Alt+Enter again. It resumed to fullscreen. And started a new game. And erased my current save. Apparently it wasn't frozen. So all in all I just lost around 6 hours of gameplay, but just for the principle of it (who the hell allows only 1 save slot in 2018), I'm going to uninstall it. 1/10", "timestamp_created": 1670891145, "timestamp_updated": 1671648214, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128453957": {"recommendationid": "128453957", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998448193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1673483870}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as Just Casue 3, so far.

This also unfortunately means that the story is again stupid, full of woefully flat, uninteresting characters and their lifeless motivations.\nYou lead the traditional revolution in the role of the protagonist Rico Rodriguez across the fictitious island of Solis. The world is a joy to look at. The landscape is beautiful, rugged, the views diverse and breathtaking. You will look at different types of forests, at snow-capped mountain tops and fly through the hot air swirling over the stony desert. The hills, plains, meadows and fields do not look machine-made, artificial, so there is no problem at all in believing them.\n\nThe game was able to revive slightly with three DLCs, without which I do not recommend buying JC4.\nThe first is called Dare Devils and deals with racing. Of course, racing with absolutely no rules, during which you will use your driving and shooting skills in approximately the same measure.\nThe second DLC called Demons (locally Los Demonios) is the most appealing in my opinion. The whole landscape will be possessed by hellish forces and Rico will have to deal with a supernatural enemy.\nThe latest expansion, Agency Strikes Back, will bring with it the elite soldiers of Rico's former employer - highly trained, perfectly armed and completely motivated. Their motivation: Rico's liquidation.\n\nYou will destroy, scatter, ravage, smash, demolish, blast, shoot, run over, detonate, demolish, launch, shoot and finally liquidate some more..

However. WTF is this game??? It released in December 2018 and the cutscenes look as though they are fresh out of the PS3 era, even on the highest settings. Personally, I have never seen a bigger downgrade in ANY other franchise. Just Cause 3, in my opinion, is miles better than this garbage game that feels as though it took 2 months to make. Everything is worse, from the heat system to the liberation system for towns and bases (virtually non existent), the atmosphere and even the explosions - EVERYTHING! The only positives I can really see with this game are the soundtrack but even then it misses the character that JC3's music had. However I suspect this is to do with how little character is present in the game anyways, so I really doubt the composer is at fault here. Now, my review may seem a little \"rant-y\", but that's because it is. I love this franchise a lot and it's really disappointing to see the masterpiece which was JC3 devolve into such an awful, horrible sequel. I'd only recommend this game if you saw the complete edition on sale for \u00a32 but even then I'd rather you spend that money on JC3 - a game which is very enjoyable and actually feels like a polished product.\n                                                                                                \nP.S.

The game doesn't tell you in your HUD and the only other short cut is to HOLD DOWN R to switch. Why is exit backspace and not esc? Why are some helicopters controlled by the direction you look in, but others you have to navigate pitch and yaw like a flight simulator? \n- Waypoint pathing is a drunk seagull. At one point, one of the missions had you deliver a vehicle under a bridge and the game was so confused about its own waypoint that it basically drew circles around the area using its pathing with crayons, swooping in, shitting all over everything, and then leaving you to navigate on your own.\n- The side missions are basically all vehicle based, but vehicle navigation is decidedly not a strong point. The heat system is somehow much worse in JC4 and after reading several forum posts I still can't figure out when the game decides you drop heat. \n- Not ultrawide compatible. Somehow, the only UI that's broken is when you request travel, upon which your options are hidden unless you change your graphics settings to windowed.\n- They ran out of time to do cutscenes so they inserted storyboards which literally look like filler storyboards you'd put in a game when you ran out of time to do cutscenes.\n\nI've played every single JC4, and every single Far Cry and not only do you not get the story and exploration of FC but JC4 has managed to fix a bunch of things that are not broken.

The game was released in December 2018 and is available on multiple platforms including PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\n\nThe game's storyline revolves around the main character, Rico Rodriguez, who is a skilled operative working for an agency called The Agency. In the game, Rico is tasked with stopping the evil Black Hand organization from taking over the fictional South American country of Solis.\n\nThe gameplay in Just Cause 4 is very similar to its predecessor, with the main focus being on exploration and destruction. The game features an open-world environment that is massive in scale, giving players plenty of space to explore and cause chaos. The game also introduces new tools for the player to use, such as the grapple hook that can be used for traversal and as a weapon.\n\nOne of the highlights of Just Cause 4 is the game's visuals, which are stunning. The game features beautiful environments, realistic lighting, and impressive weather effects. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with a great soundtrack that fits the game's overall tone and action-packed gameplay.\n\nHowever, despite the impressive visuals and sound, the game suffers from a number of technical issues that can detract from the overall experience. Some players have reported issues with performance and stability, and the game's AI can be quite buggy at times.\n\nAnother issue with the game is its repetitive missions and lack of variety. While the game's open-world environment is impressive, many of the missions feel similar, and there is a lack of variety in the game's enemies and objectives.\n\nOverall, Just Cause 4 is a fun and action-packed game that is worth playing for fans of the series. The game's open-world environment and impressive visuals are definitely highlights, but the technical issues and lack of variety in missions can detract from the overall experience.", "timestamp_created": 1669500192, "timestamp_updated": 1682149254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127100361": {"recommendationid": "127100361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271432427", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3566, "last_played": 1680150421}, "language": "english", "review": "game has some amazing physics", "timestamp_created": 1669497046, "timestamp_updated": 1669497046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127087961": {"recommendationid": "127087961", "author": {"steamid": "76561199238878880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 921, "last_played": 1669993829}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good open world game.

Los di\u00e1logos se sienten muy gen\u00e9ricos, los personajes se sienten hechos de cart\u00f3n. A veces el juego se ve bonito, pero la inteligencia artificial de las personas es lamentable.

because it's a cash-cow sequel.'  It's also a bug-riddled bad-physics hell which deserves refunding.\n\nIf this had been released as Just Cause 1, it would've been slammed so hard into the ground by reviews that the only thing 'hot' about it would be its average temperature upon reaching the Earth's mantle.  Just about everything in this iteration is exactly that: an iteration, and sadly not very many are good ones.  The wingsuit controls are SO bad.  The game is full of sloppy ideas that sound way cooler than they perform, physics that just feels more off than the last 3 games, controls and AI logic that are hard to wrap your head around, it's honestly a shame this game has as many cool concepts as it does, because that's probably the only other reason it moved as many numbers as it did, apart from die-hard fanboys desperately clinging to a sinking ship.\n\nIt's also impossible to escape the black hand forces once they start sending air units after you, as they just keep spawning helicopters and drones right behind you indefinitely, or they'll send a jet which is impossible to shoot down without homing missiles.  It's actually easier and more playable to just die and restart at that point.\n\n[b]More Playtime Edit[/b]\n\nGod, it's so bad.  Omniscient AI.  DLC equipment that doesn't interact with other DLC equipment.  Instant death because one random sniper shot you in the face.  Every vehicle but the mech is made of Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and tacky glue, causing you to die if you so much as think about brushing against any terrain for any reason.  Extremely un-fun and spammy DLC enemies.  An entire car-driving DLC in a game where making a left turn over 20 mph is a herculean task.  They even took out all the fun of the jetpack from the 3rd game and replaced it with a total nothing 'upgrade' system that just makes it useless faster.  This game is such wasted potential that it makes me angry.\n\nDon't bother picking this one up.

mechanics are fun to play around with.  Also, what only counts half as much though, is that all of the DLC's are pretty amazing, id even say better than the game itself.\nThe bad:\nThe UI is beyond awful. You dont see how many locations there are, there are no coordinates, you cant use your mouse on map for some reason, half of the map is taken over by icon description. The controls for keyboard and mouse are wonky and make it feel like they just took the console version and shoved it into steam without changing anything..  Completing a location is done by doing some random stunts that feel pointless, tedious and annoying after a while. There are chaos objects, but they respawn, and besides giving points and boomboom, they have no use. For the germans: The sync is just horrible. Everything spanish is pronounced with a hard german accent, this is just lazy. Completionists beware, prepare yourselves for possible grindfest and frustrating comparison to get all locations.\nEven though this game feels somewhat inferior to its predecessor, its enjoyable. However, imho there is too much searching and stunt stuff compared to pure action and destruction.\nBasically, if you dont care about completing and just wanna go for story and stuff, are playing with controller and are okay with a different approach than JC3, are planning to get all of the DLC aswell, go ahead, grab it on sale.

This game is nothing like the 3rd one. I feel like nothing is smooth in this game especially combat and changing grapple options.\n\nMany times I found my guy running on top of a car and refusing to just run off the edge to get onto the ground. He wouldn't just hop down. I had to JUMP high up and over to be able to get down. I tested this many times and found it to happen repeatedly on surfaces that weren't very high up. I could understand doing it on tall buildings to prevent accidental deaths / running off (you have a parachute anyways) but being barely above the ground was a tedious chore. I'd have to grapple, leap, move and then reposition to continue to try to run / grapple onto objectives at times which was a nuisance.\n\nThe weapon layout / swapping was annoying too. I was hoping for a radial menu or some sort of quick selection but the best I could find was scrolling the mouse wheel. You can only have 2 weapons that I've found so far. Half of the weapons I've found aren't even worthwhile to use or have. I feel like the arsenal they put into this game is very poor and poorly balanced as well.\n\nThe grappling system requires you to go to the map, go into the layout system and changing it all over manually just to be able to hot swap to different ones instead of just giving you a radial menu to quick equip grapple effects. I think a radial would've been more intuitive especially for people using the controller (I never found one for controller) to use. So you could swap between regular grapple, to balloons to other effects quickly and without constantly having to go into menu in game to change it if you needed something different mid fight.\n\nI feel like the flow of combat due to these issues was tedious and obnoxious. The developers didn't handle it very well and it is very poor to say the least. The overall way combat is handled is awful based upon my experiences in Just Cause 3. I'd recommend Just Cause 3 over 4 by a long shot.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is the graphics and character design. The way they designed certain character appearances seemed off and horrendous compared to Just Cause 3. In 3 they appeared smoother and more well defined. I'm playing this on higher settings with a modern GPU and they just don't seem well done at all. Even other friends of mine commented on how they preferred Just Cause 3 over 4 for this fact alone.\n\nAll in all this is not a game I enjoy or could get into very well due to the many issues that I have found. I would highly recommend Just Cause 3 over this one. This one leaves much to be desired in my opinion. I'm just glad this came in a HB pack so I didn't pay full price for it. I wouldn't even recommend this on sale. That's my personal opinion. Get Just Cause 3 instead. I believe you'll like it much better.\n\nOverall rating for this game for me is a 3.5 out of 10. I wouldn't recommend it not even on sale. There are better options for \"open world\" action game play.

Blend it, put it altoghter in a nice stew and you get the shit that is Just Cause 4. \n\nLike the developers looked at JC2 and JC3 grabbed the good and turned it into the bad.\n\nThe map, just a large square map, few different biomes with a towns and bases scattered in it. We have a dessert zone, a city zone, a mountain zone, a jungle zone, you know the drill. It reminds me a lot of JC2 map with al the biomes but then shit. Everything feels just smashed onto the map. Town here, base there, airport there, well now we have a map. JC3 knew what it whas and the map felled really like a country (except the upper part of the map, they just gave up on that one), this however feels like somebody looked at the JC2 map and just copied all the elements from it.  \n\nGrappling, what happend there, it feels so fucking slow, same as wingsuiting. The flow has been taken out of it. Maybe because wingsuiting with the jetpack in JC3 felt so fucking good, but this feels just like shit. You can now customise the grapplings with a few different loadouts, like couple a balloon to the thether, you hit a enemy with it, the enemy gets lifted by a balloon that plops out the theter, the game really seems like it wants you to do that. You can also couple a booster to the theter, you shoot it at it and it gets boosted, how fun. You can get creative with your theters if you really want to, but the loadout menu is as you probably already expected shit.  \n\nStory, well nothing interesting, we have some big bad guy on an island nation that wants to destroy the island and the world for some evil reason and Rico is there to stop them with the local rebels. The characters and dialogue are absolutely atrocious even Rico doesn't feel like himself. \n\nCombat, alot of explosions like alot, everywhere all the time, it's fucking annoying is all i have to say. Weapons are the same as always, you have the assault rifle, submachine gun, sniper rifle, smart rifle (that one is new, but shit), grenades, rocket launchers, everything you knew and loved and a few special weapons like a lightning gun. \n\nDriving, bad, but what did you expect?\n\nFlying, just the same as always, nice selection of helicopters and planes, mechanics the same as in the other parts of this series.\n\nNew are natural disasters, like a tornado, and don't mind them, they are shit. \n\nIn conclusion, just play JC2 or JC3. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665911321, "timestamp_updated": 1665911321, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123911821": {"recommendationid": "123911821", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979771468", "num_games_owned": 1591, "num_reviews": 193, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1667208023}, "language": "english", "review": "it's everytime the same. ammo is hard to get.", "timestamp_created": 1665908183, "timestamp_updated": 1665908183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123868574": {"recommendationid": "123868574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030992108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1662632402}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the Just Cause franchise, I like the over the top action and I really wanted to like this one too, and I'm pretty sure I would like it if it would run.

I just couldn't get into JC3's unlock structure. It was too repetitive and boring for my taste. JC4 on the other hand has you liberating key regions (or all of them if you want to), having your guys take over control, but liberating a region means simply finishing ONE unique mission. There are a few repetitions, like escorting prisoners or driving cars with bombs attached into a lake, but I think most missions were unique and the other ones only repeated like once or twice, which is mostly fine. Quite a few of those missions also include a bit of story. Other than that you only need \"troops\" to take over the actual region. You get troops by causing \"Chaos\", but unlike in JC3, where you had to destroy EVERY GOD DAMN thing in a base (and do that like 100 times over to unlock the next mission), here you can simply destroy as you see fit. And most of that is done while on a mission anyway, just happens. By the end I GOT troops for liberating regions, instead of spending them anyway, since I was able to surround them, adding a small bit of \"strategy\" into the mix. I honestly think that combining a game like Just Cause with an RTS wouldn't be the worst idea out there. You set up the Chaos to make your troops push forward, but then you can directly control them or give orders to them ... maybe.\n\nI'll mainly keep comparing this to JC3, so here goes:\n\nRico is finally back to his older self. He speaks with a Spanish accent again, instead of being a cheap Etzio Auditore knock-off, which was honestly were unsettling. He's gruffer, more restrained, less of a goof ball, more or less your typical 90s action hero. I liked that.\n\nSame goes for the companions. None of them are even slightly irritating, compared to the insufferable Mario or the very cringe-worthy scientist lady in the former game ... even Sheldon acts like a person now, instead of the epitome of Texas cowboyism... he's turned into a somewhat likeable character.\n\nThe story is honestly fine for such a game. It's not ground-breaking, it doesn't need to be. My only real complaint is that the villains feel extremely flat. Apart from the very beginning and the very end they don't even appear. At least when going up against the various \"cores\" they could have included the general and fleshed out her story more, since she's related to your right hand woman ... there is room for improvement here. \n\nMission design is alright as well, I liked it more than in JC3, since I felt like actually working towards a bigger goal. The side missions are alright. There's a scientist guy you can help uncover secrets of the past, which is a neat break from the regular gameplay, you're also helping a young commander train his troops on various missions (those are the weakest of the bunch to be honest, since they're mostly just regular gameplay) and help make a movie, which mostly involves racing from A to B, which is, despite the sometimes wonky driving physics, quite entertaining.\n\nSide activities however are desastrously mundane ... you can either fly through a set of 3 hoops with your wingsuit, destroy blimps, or drive through checkpoints with specific vehicles found in the surrounding area. Very boring to be honest, but you need to do a few of those to unlock the actual side missions. You need points to do so ... and to upgrade your grappling hook.\n\nSpeaking of which: The grappler now comes in 3 different configurations: pull, float, boost. Each of these can be adjusted and equipped with various unlockables. None of them are even remotely necessary to complete the game, but it's nice having them ... and people love a good sandbox.\n\nThe island itself is beautiful, actually beautiful, it feels a lot more vibrant than the samey islands in JC3. You have djungles, grassy plains, tundra, deserts and snow-capped peaks, as well as the different weather phenomena, lightning, tornado, sandstorm, blizzard, which can be activated or deactivated, once you finish the respective mission. This was also a big USP of the game, but sadly, these disasters aren't as spectacular as they made them out. And the music overall is really fitting.\n\nGameplay feels more fluid as well, shooting and grappling especially. Gliding, wingsuiting and even hoverboarding all feel okay, and can be nicely combined with grappling. The flying controls are still shit though. Especially the camera, no matter which mode you choose, is atrocious when driving or flying. Helicopters are still a mess to use. Not sure if they'll ever have satisfying controls. That being said: Ain't much better in GTA5 (apart from the camera that is). It just snaps back too quickly and too soon when in fixed mode, but in free mode you're constantly adjusting it on the other hand.\n\nI also don't get why people hate the map so much. I admit it might be a little confusing at the start, but you quickly get the hang of it and then it's quite alright. Fast travel is also much easier and comfortable in this game, as is having multiple different weapons or vehicles delivered right to your doorstep. These are unlocked through either just playing the missions or completing side activities. No longer do you have to find vehicles and drive them to a fucking Mario garage.\n\nWhat else? The DLC sucks... here is where JC3 was a lot more interesting. Demonios can suck my ass, the agency one as well. Both offer minimal story, while re-introducing the hated JC3  repeat repeat repeat gameplay loop, as well as irritating flying enemies en masse! The demolition derby DLC is alright-ish if you just want something different for a change.\n\nAll in all my personal opinion is that JC4 is the best game in the series, despite the pre-rendered 30 FPS cutscenes, but for some reason most prefer JC3. I don't need to understand that, but maybe you're like me ... if you loved JC3, then this might not be to your liking though.", "timestamp_created": 1665179196, "timestamp_updated": 1665179196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123493599": {"recommendationid": "123493599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835734718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1744, "last_played": 1699212609}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun for a new player or an old player Exelent story", "timestamp_created": 1665162220, "timestamp_updated": 1665162220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123488825": {"recommendationid": "123488825", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990466948", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1407, "last_played": 1665155357}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played a bit the first and mainly the 2nd and 3rd JC, I cannot honestly recommend this one.

And I can see that, in a lot of ways this game is worse that previous titles, and has issues. However, for me it\u2019s not much worse, especially after playing the latest, complete version of the game and not playing this immediately after the previous titles. Actually, I really enjoyed this game overall and had a lot of fun with it, so this doesn\u2019t deserve a negative review from me, or even a mixed one. You may be disappointed, yes, but overall, this is a good package.\nJust Cause 4 for me felt like a mixture of Just Cause 2 and 3. It has the main gameplay elements from 3, but the map and completion length are more similar to 2. Gameplay is familiar if you played Just Cause 3. You have a grappling hook, parachute, and wingsuit that you can combo to travel around and help you in combat. The biggest improvement are the grappling hook mods, with tons of customization for different results. If you are bored, just try different combinations, and create your own fun, since this game gives you a lot of tools for that. Also, lots of guns with fun alternate fire effects, like firing an AI drone. My main issue with the gameplay is the driving, it feels clunky and a downgrade. Which is sad because the series for the first time has actual radio stations. And they\u2019re pretty cool to boot!\nThe huge map is more similar to the Just Cause 2 one. In 3, it was beautiful, but had poor variety. Here, you have snow mountains, jungle, grasslands and desert. However, looking at the map, the placement of these zones feels a bit lazy and unnatural. It was much better in 2. Also, the desert is mostly big red formations, and the snow mountains lack settlements. So, while I prefer the map of 2, I think this one is overall better than the map in 3.\nJust Cause 4 also has a lot of stuff to do, similar to 2, however I have an issue with it. Most of the stuff to do is just vehicle and wingsuit stunts, and they\u2019re not even in the locations you discover. This way, you actually explore more of the map outside the locations, but since there\u2019s not much else to track, like collectibles and stuff to destroy in the locations, when I complete a location, I feel I completed stunt events around a location, and not in the location itself. I have no problem with the stunts, but they could\u2019ve added other stuff as well.\nThe story is basic, but that\u2019s a standard for this series, I guess. This time, liberating regions has an army mechanic, that is confusing at first, but enjoyable when you figure it out. You actually push out your frontlines as you conquest more territory, and better yet, you actually see it. There\u2019re battles happening everywhere, especially around the frontlines. I really enjoyed this mechanic, it helps the world feel alive, and reflects your progress. Plus, more chaos!\nThe graphics are alright, and the overall sound is ok. One of the main additions to the game is extreme weather events, like tornadoes. These events are really cool to experience, however they are very underused. The mostly appear in story missions, and rarely in the world. Adding them to more locations would help a lot.\nSince I played the Complete Edition, there\u2019s also a lot of extra content to enjoy, plus fixes and improvements since the release version. There\u2019re 11 extra challenges, where you do miscellaneous stuff in the world, including more stunts. These stunts are harder in difficulty, but doable with some persistence and guidance. Extra weapons and vehicles are also available in the black market, including the awesome Mech Brawler, and the jetpack-wingsuit (why wasn\u2019t this one included in the base game though).\n3 major content DLCs are also available, of varying quality. Dare Devils of Destruction are race events mixed with destruction derbies, using modded cars with weapons attached. It\u2019s cool, and all races are repeatable, although getting high scores can be annoying. Los Demonios adds a supernatural element, and it\u2019s way harder than the base game. However, it\u2019s not the good kind of hard, but cheap stuff killing you in seconds from nowhere. This DLC was frustrating to play, and definitely the worst part of the game, despite the cool concept.\nDanger Rising is much better. It acts as an epilogue, and a teaser for the next game. It\u2019s also harder to play, but in a good way. Enemies have more mobility and health, which can be annoying, but makes sense in the context of the story. At least you\u2019re not cheaply dying anymore. It also has a real final boss, which the main game lacked. You also get a cool hoverboard, with courses available after beating the DLC. This DLC is the most polished, however there\u2019s a bug preventing you to get 100% in it. At most, you can only get 92%, and that lowers the overall completion to 98%. Not a big deal since you can only see the percentage in a menu, but still annoying in a game about completion.\nIn the end, if you can get the Complete Edition on sale, it is an enjoyable experience, even if there are some elements that aren\u2019t that good.

You will never see them coming until you're currently getting shot.\n - Whenever you are flying, which should be one of the many joys of this game, there will ALWAYS be a super accurate enemy plane shooting you from behind.  They have perfect evasive maneuvers and perfect aim.  Again, they, too, are magic and will only appear directly behind you.  There is no way to stop them, and no way to fight back.  This and the helicopters problem makes me think that the developers hate their customers in that they don't want them to fly around the game, DESPITE giving the player a fun jet pack and access to all flying vehicles.  \"You can have these things, but you just can't use them for fun.\" -devs\n - Ground bases magically have enemy soldiers appear in infinite amounts and they, too, are perfectly accurate when shooting at you.\n - Many times something will just blow you out of the sky and you will have no idea where it came from and how it hit you, even though you may have been flying randomly.  It will still hit you and you will just fall from the sky unable to do anything because the recovery times takes about three days.\n\n\nDespite the possibility of this game being a very fun very open-ended open world game full of exploration and multiple side quests to feel like you're making a difference in the game world, and making good progress, the developers have seen fit to completely ruin that with poor enemy programming and garbage enemy cheating.  It's so very frustrating that I cannot play this trash fire for more than a couple hours before I end up hating it because of the problems listed above.\n", "timestamp_created": 1664426452, "timestamp_updated": 1664426452, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122985214": {"recommendationid": "122985214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095524961", "num_games_owned": 844, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1664404777}, "language": "english", "review": "Just Cause 4 looks awful, gladly I got it in a Humble Bundle.\n\nIf you want to play a Just Cause, buy Just Cause 3 looks greater and the Gameplay is much smoother than this garbage. ^^", "timestamp_created": 1664405127, "timestamp_updated": 1664405127, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122979228": {"recommendationid": "122979228", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984263474", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1664394041}, "language": "english", "review": "never played any game in the series until this one. couldnt even make it to the first hour. just feels really cheap. the graphics look about 10 years out of date. the cut scenes look about 15+ years old. and the story is lame. the grapple hook thing is fun for about 20 minutes. enemies are retarded.", "timestamp_created": 1664394428, "timestamp_updated": 1664394428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536571085453033447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122971544": {"recommendationid": "122971544", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969611158", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1664185465}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 Out of this world\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Below Average\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Terrible\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Exciting\n\u2611 Very Good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Easily Boring\n\u2610 Trash\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Clear & Beautiful\n\u2610 Very Good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Terrible\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Elderly\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Super Computer\n\u2610 Super Build\n\u2611 High Grade\n\u2610 Average Grade\n\u2610 Below Average\n\u2610 Old Computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Veteran\n\u2610 Hard\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Normal\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 New Players\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Extremely Long & Painful\n\u2610 Time Consuming\n\u2610 Effort Required\n\u2611 Not Much Effort Required\n\u2610 Easily Done\n\u2610 No Grind\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 Exciting\n\u2610 Interesting\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Minimal\n\u2610 No Story Or Boring\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 1000+ Hours\n\u2610 500-999 Hours\n\u2611 100-499 Hours\n\u2610 50-99 Hours\n\u2610 Quit After First Playthrough\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 Expensive\n\u2610 Slightly Overpriced\n\u2610 Average Price\n\u2611 Cheap\n\u2610 Below \u00a3/$5\n\u2610 Free\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Not Playable\n\u2611 Experienced Throughout\n\u2610 Average Bugs\n\u2610 Minimal Or Fixed Quickly\n\u2610 Very Rare\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2611 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1664384678, "timestamp_updated": 1664384678, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472211569547653198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122957813": {"recommendationid": "122957813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074625962", "num_games_owned": 1674, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1665172720}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels extremely dated, from gameplay to graphics.

Siendo tan continuista no puedo decir que sea malo, pero a mi (que me he jugado todos) me ha terminado cansando hacer tantas cosas tantas veces, sin verdaderas novedades. Y es que, en cantidad de contenido, el juego tiene un mont\u00f3n de cosas por hacer y explorar... pero son todas b\u00e1sicamente repeticiones de cinco o seis modelos de actividades repartidas por las localizaciones del mapa, con excepci\u00f3n de las misiones de trama.

El sonido est\u00e1 bien, aunque el estilo de m\u00fasica es muy marcado y si no te gusta ese estilo pues te dedicas a apagar todas las radios como yo.

Or set a timer so you don't over that 2 hour limit and refund. I went over and can't do that. Stupid me... I really have liked the series and the free destruction in it, was hyped for the 4, and the result is a steaming pile of ****. I tried liking it but i can't. I [b]Just Can't 4[/b].. Remember when the devs took out the button-challenge for bombs and hijackings from JC2 away to streamline the gameplay for JC3? That was obviously the wrong direction for the devs. They want more button smashing, not less!\n\nThere is literally nothing better in this then in JC3, even graphics are similar to 3, it's just more jungle and more UI-crap on the screen that means nothing. So do yourself a favour and pick the Just Cause 3 (last good Just Cause-game) from a discount, put a couple mods in and enjoy much more then you could ever do in this ... game. \n\nNothing works like the previous and well working games. Everything was changed and for the worse. In [b]Just Can't 4[/b] they doubled down on the controls so that many of the buttons need two functions, just so they could cram more things in. \"Just Cause\" and \"buttons-galore\" are not two things that belong in the same sentence. It's like the devs noticed there is thing called keyboard and they could cram more things into it then previously!\n\nI can imagine the discussion:\nDirector: I want buttons for everything.\nCoders: Everything..?\nDirector: EVERYTHING!!!\nCoders: How about two functions for every button!?\nDirector: *heavy breathing*\n\nThe functions are scattered all around the keyboard with little logic. You need several hours to just learn and memorize the buttons and their functions. As a little example, the control options lists 4 different buttons for \"next menu\" and \"previous menu\". Where is that menu? It's button \"1\" where it previously was in \"Tab\". And the grab hook? They changed it from \"mouse right\" because heck, why not! It's only the most used thing in the game! \"Right mouse\" has now zoom aim. And that \"mouse right\" has to have two modes, press and hold, just so they could get more things in! And if you happen to have machine gun with a shield, it's a third button for one gun plus the mandatory reload button! And that previously working grab hook, the biggest and funniest thing in Just Cause-games..? There is now half a dozen buttons for it! You apparently can't tighten the tether yourself anymore, it does it automatically. But there is now two buttons for \"quick-reel\" because that was apparently a priority. Previously used \"F\" for throwing grenades was changed to the industry standard \"Middle Mouse\". Why? So they could cram more buttons for that \"F\"!!!\n\nAnd all in all, everything that previously nice and neat, is now menus, CONSTANT mayhem (whether you wanted or not) and idiotic controls because .. i don't know. They like it confusing. It's not like nobody wanted to play a fun and casual game like Just Cause. More convenient to take button controls, mix them up in a bag and throw them to table and see how confusing they could make everything. I'm not going to spend hours to just get this game playable in menus and with mods, this game is dead to me. Make the next Just Cause like JC2 or JC3 and i'll consider buying.

I booted up the older game just to check if I had rose tinted goggles, but no.

I still don't understand JC4's map, and I've written mapping software before...\n* Some of the vehicle challenges are just chores. Having to find a specific vehicle... bleh. There was a surprising amount of \"search an area for an object\" missions, which I didn't find fun. Just put a waypoint on the object and let me get back to making poor/hilarious wingsuit choices.\n* This might just be my mind playing tricks but I swear JC3's wingsuit controls much better. Responds faster? Not sure.\n* Story is putting me to sleep. This isn't bad per se for a sandbox game, but in this instance it just leads to a dozen near-identical side (required) missions with the exact same objectives in almost the same environment.

I agree with the majority. It\u2019s a very mediocre game. It opens with a horrendous looking cutscene that looked worse than anything I remember seeing in the last decade or so. Once I got to the actual gameplay it looked much better, but still not great. I don\u2019t really mind this though since performance is pretty good.\n\nAfter a short tutorial style mission, you are basically told to go off and cause chaos. That seems to be the majority of the game. No goal or objective or anything, just run around the boring open world mindlessly blowing stuff up. The game does have some story missions, but it rarely tells you where to go for them or how to unlock them. Most of the time you finish one mission and then need to open the map, which feels really poorly designed, actually, all of the UI feels poorly designed. From the map you need to find the mission, then find out what task you need to do to unlock it, which sometimes requires doing several other tasks to unlock other areas of the game. These tasks usually consist of running through a military base and interacting with a few objects. You can shoot enemies and blow stuff up, but you can also usually just run in, click \u2018E\u2019 on a few things, and leave. These story missions are fully voice acted with cutscenes, but the cutscenes are so dull I think I\u2019ve found myself zoning out of almost every single one of them.\n\nThe explosions and destruction are just as good or better than I remember them being in Just Cause 3, but without any reason to explode stuff it got old fast. The game still has mini challenges, like how far can you drift in a parachute that behave exactly how I remember them in Just cause 3. The game doesn\u2019t really tell you about them, it just keeps track in the background and when you come close to beating a friend or your personal best, you get a mini popup on the side of your screen. I really like these and its really cool to see how I stand in comparison to my friends, but it would have been much nicer if they had integrated it with Steam\u2019s leader boards so I could view stuff without needing to boot up the game. A huge step back is the mini objective\u2019s spread across the map, like the wingsuit stuff. I remember Just Cause 3 giving them a score, adding a competitive aspect to them, but now they are just a binary won or lost. A lot of them also feel a lot worse requiring a specific vehicle to complete. I don\u2019t remember this being the case in Just Cause 3, but even if it was, I don\u2019t like this. They also made it harder to unlock vehicles and weapons, which I do not like.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my rose-tinted glasses, but Just Cause 4 doesn\u2019t feel better than Just Cause 3. Either way, it feels like a pretty mediocre game. I probably will still play it more since I already own it and sometimes its fun to mindlessly blow stuff up, but I wouldn\u2019t really recommend anyone go out and buy this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1663041597, "timestamp_updated": 1663041597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805911540985107422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122147027": {"recommendationid": "122147027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082488504", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1667054362}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is like my last braincell during an exam", "timestamp_created": 1662999611, "timestamp_updated": 1662999643, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426645576953887939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122145621": {"recommendationid": "122145621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977345078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1662997073}, "language": "english", "review": "Ugh.\n\nI love the JC games and all but this one...ugh.

It has the most archaic keybindings I've seen in 5 years on any game, let alone one priced this high. Half of the terrible keys can't even be rebound, yet they've managed to make the most complicated imaginable series of settings for every fathomable category, yet none of the bindings are what you need. Picture the complexity of arma paired with the simplicity of roblox. On top of that, the game itself is horribly buggy and terribly designed right off the start. The plot is the exact same thing it always is, but with a new coat of paint. The graphics are marginally better than the second game. \n\nThis 'game' is just an utter scam. It's the Madden of third person shooters. It makes even the newest Gears of War games look like bouts of divine creativity. The maps are always identical to one another and offer no variety. The worlds are always empty and devoid of life. The AI is always horrible and bland. The combat is always horribly uninspired and boring, offering nothing unique at all. Animations are practically recycled from the old games, just like everything else within this horrid experience. \n\nThe first real mission is an escort mission, which have always been the worst thing to ever exist within these barely passable games. They always involve horrible pathing from the drivers, terrible map design that leads to glitches and the vehicle getting stuck, and laughable enemy spawns that you can literally see. The FIRST mission in this 7 0 D O L L A R G A M E is an escort mission where the car gets completely turned around 3 times in a row and then breaks, getting stuck for zero purpose. Full health and at every tutorial ridden junction it stops at, the AI fails to move on when you clear the path and just sits there. \n\nThe tutorials are even terrible, forcing you into buggier sequences where you're forced to jump through their terribly conceived hoops just to progress. The tutorial introducing Grappling hook loadouts, which might have been fun were it not made by apes slapping a keyboard while starving, was so horribly broken that it locked me out of weapon switching. I closed out of the menu accidentally while trying to do it and the game decided that I was no longer worthy of playing. I couldn't grapple anymore, couldn't switch weapons, couldn't reload, and restarting my objective didn't fix that. \n\nEvery popup in this game, of which there are many for some reason, makes this game lag. You're constantly getting popups about achievements, milestones, feats, or just your score compared to your steam friends who also play this game. Even if you have NONE, it still pops up non stop and the entire game freezes every single time this happens. I'm on a 2080 with an i9 and this game can't handle its own popups. The frame rate is stable, but the entire game freezes every time you kill anyone because you get a popup telling you about it. \n\nI have not seen such a blatant scam of a game in ages. This feels like it was made by a team only kept motivated by indentured servitude and the knowledge that their families will die without what little money they receive. I got this from Humble Bundle and I feel horrendously scammed. This game having even mixed ratings, let alone positive ones, is the prime example of how and why the gaming industry has become a joke so old that everyone's tired of even thinking about it. \n\nWhat a fucking joke.", "timestamp_created": 1662622969, "timestamp_updated": 1662624267, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507692337036132813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121902352": {"recommendationid": "121902352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198853996037", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3230, "last_played": 1662590380}, "language": "english", "review": "the blank hand have a serious skill issue if they're so-called \"highly trained\" lmao\ngood game doe", "timestamp_created": 1662590575, "timestamp_updated": 1662590575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121897601": {"recommendationid": "121897601", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986435132", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1662733734}, "language": "english", "review": "Just cause ................ they need more money. \n\nI loved the earlier just cause games, senseless havoc and just careless fun.

You get a quick glimpse of the main bad guy at the start of the game, a quick exchange with his second-in-command a short while later, then nothing. No interaction with the enemy until the very end of the game. There is some interactions with friendly NPCs, but 90% of the game is non-interactive. \n\n2. Missions/Goals: There is a main quest line but it is incredibly brief. However, to perform some of these quests, the game forces you to go out and clear some regions. Clearing regions is the only real game play here.\n\n3. Weapons/Vehicles/Tools: To be honest, I played the entire way through with the automatic rifle I started with and a grenade launcher. Every other weapon had limitations that made them nonviable. As always, the grappling hook and call for gun/vehicle drops and location drops makes up the bulk of world traversal.\n\n4. Graphics/Characters/Environments/Etc.: Very, very dated. Feels and looks like a lot of recycled assets from previous versions.\n\nThis game ruined my faith in the Just Cause series.

that.[/b]\n\nThis is a strange game, it's got a really good world, some decent customizability of the grappling hook and the destruction and physics feel better than ever. The challenges around the world are much more fun than the ones in JC3. The gameplay mostly feels good and satisfying but something went horribly wrong somewhere with this game.\n\nThe mission design is for the most part absolute garbage. Instead of progressing by destroying everything in a given area, you instead have to do a mission in each area. This could maybe have worked, but unfortunately someone thought it was a good idea to make most missions the worst kind mission, a kind of mission universally hated by everyone: escort missions. Usually the targets you're escorting are bullet sponges and don't ever die, but you have to babysit them while they use their roomba path finding to eventually get where they're going. A few of these can be frustrating, when you're tasked to defend certain fragile radio towers from 360 degrees of infinitely spawning tanks, helicopters and infrantry, but there are probably only two or three of these.\n\nLuckily, there are not that many of these frontline missions, but that leaves us the rest of the content, which is mostly various challenges and some side missions. Most of this is pretty good, with the exception of training missions, which again usually include some sort of escort mechanic, but more lazily put together than the story and frontline missions. Usually it goes like this: Pick up two guys in a vehicle and take them with you to destroy some things while they watch. If they left your vehicle make sure to land/park on their toes so they only run around like headless chickens for half a minute instead of two before getting back in. Rinse and repeat three times.\n\nOn top of all this there are a number of smaller problems, including but not limited to:\n[list]\n[*]The military/black hand has no more heat levels, they're now simply either looking for you or not, which causes some strange things to happen like tanks and helicopters responding to minor incidents. Another problem with their response is that it's no longer possible to fight them off to lose your heat like you could in JC3. These things combined makes the military feel more like an annoyance than a fun mechanic to interact with.\n[*]The interface is bad. It feels like they made it for a game pad and then told someone who has never used a keyboard or game pad before to translate game pad buttons to keyboard keys. Luckily the controls in-game are mostly fine.\n[*]Since you're liberating whole areas at a time, essentially everything except for large military bases has no process of liberation, no mission, no things you need to destroy, making most places pretty forgettable.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1659327846, "timestamp_updated": 1659988413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119844401": {"recommendationid": "119844401", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124730469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1363, "last_played": 1660503179}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game but it makes it freeze", "timestamp_created": 1659299887, "timestamp_updated": 1659299887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119841339": {"recommendationid": "119841339", "author": {"steamid": "76561199142765274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1659474753}, "language": "english", "review": "5", "timestamp_created": 1659296186, "timestamp_updated": 1659296186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119833126": {"recommendationid": "119833126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049004448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1481, "last_played": 1659285881}, "language": "english", "review": "Disappointment.

and this is the next game\"\n15. the army of chaos feels more like a sales point. its there to give chaos points an actually reason for existing but it removes the liberation of bases and instead gives incentives taking over land. this adds nothing to gameplay or mission structure. what if they added big battles that you can fight, win or loose in, what if you could train your army to be better and have them help liberate towns. in the end it feels more in the way then anything as you have to use them to move forward in the story\n16. they removed c4\n17. the ui is a mess\n18. the different grapple options are kinda cool but mostly forgettable as its easiest to probably just stick with the retracting one. its mainly there to send goats and cows flying through the air\n19. probably the main problem, they changed the way you liberate bases, instead of blowing everything up, you insted have to do a mission that range from escorting someone, breaking prisoners out, hacking something, ect, kinda like in just cause 2 this is so incredibly stupid. in 3 it gave you so much freedom in the ways you can blow things up and that was essentially the main gameplay. in 4 they hold you arm back and forces you to do stuff you don't want to do, when what you actually want to do (explosions) just sits there teasing you.\n20. why oh god did they remove the c4\nin the end i wonder why i got this rather then just playing just cause 3", "timestamp_created": 1659176860, "timestamp_updated": 1668317754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519412398338317871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119723798": {"recommendationid": "119723798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421169815", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1688048506}, "language": "english", "review": "bowen arms arms", "timestamp_created": 1659129655, "timestamp_updated": 1659129655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119722206": {"recommendationid": "119722206", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229518455", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2302, "last_played": 1660452694}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this game is good it has a great story line (my opinion) and the physics are good (not too well)\n\nThat all i have to say about this game", "timestamp_created": 1659127546, "timestamp_updated": 1659127546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119670119": {"recommendationid": "119670119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820207403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1662747640}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun and an improved gameplay experience over the 3rd installment in the series.\nLove the map and it's versitality.", "timestamp_created": 1659050190, "timestamp_updated": 1659050190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119662443": {"recommendationid": "119662443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358933564", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 684, "last_played": 1694978029}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to mess around in.

The main \"Villain\" appeared like, 2 times. I literally can't even remember his name there wasn't like any fun way to kill him either, he dies in a cutscene. \nIn just cause 1 you jump out of a plane and put a bomb on Mendoza as you're both free falling \nIn just cause 2 you fight Baby Panai on 3 nuclear missiles having a gunfight while also disarming them \nIn just cause 3 Di Ravello appears several times in cutscenes, theres all this propaganda of him and you have a fight in a volcano against a high tech gunship with a gold paint on it in a volcano and you actually have the option to shoot him or to not shoot him in which he kills himself.\nAnd here the dude like, dies in his private jet.\n\nThen the Heat System which is gone. In the all the other games you have heat and you would have different tier of units come after you as more elite troops and vehicles are put against you.\nHere theres none instead you just fight the regular recruits, there are all these unique enemy types yet they only appear in missions and honestly I rarely ever saw them which is disappointing. Also I found in just cause 3 that there were like unuiqe enemy types for every vehicle. There was a specific unit for every vehicle. Tanks bikes and helicopters.\n\nThe ammo is also a bit of a problem in my opinion, I feel like I could never use most weapons since the enemies that use them are rare and instead of just going of weapon type so if an enemy had a shotgun like the pump action one and I had the automatic one I could just pick up that ammo instead of having to get it from the exact weapon. So I would always just carry like the regular SMG and assault rifle with me. Also I don't understand why Rico wouldn't have a sidearm. In the all the games he has dual wield pistols yet here only 2 weapons. I had some fun with the railgun and if I wanted more ammo I could always just fast travel to the crash site where I could always find plenty of ammo.\n\nThe grappling was very interesting however it is very confusing for starters and I also got confused.\n\nThe Challenges were extremely disappointing like it wasn't the same anymore. For wingsuit you just have to through like 3 rings in a few seconds, unlike the old one which was very frustrating but thats what made it so cool, always trying to get the max score and pushing yourself to the limit. I mean the gears that Rico could get were very fun. Things like homing grenades and explosives with boosters on them. I feel like Rico really wasn't as powerful as he was in Just cause 3. \n\nThe only cool part was the agency DLC with the hoverboard challenges. You had a challenge for every submarine and 1 very long course which kind of reminded me of the old challenges and at least they brought back the liberation system.\n\nThe liberation system is very sad.\nThere was like this main base in which you had some thing to do and this wasn't very interesting like they are all the same.\nI really wouldev like to just destroy all of these massive bases and leave everything destroyed instead of having everything respawn every time. The only reason they are even there was just so you could cause chaos to gain \"Squads\" to fully take over an area. Destroying the weather control station missions were the only ones I liked honestly.\nWhen I was playing just cause 3 I liked to liberate every base in the island region and then start the missions which would mean I always had an easier time with every mission so the rebels were always there to cover my back and in some missions I could just walk in freely with no one shooting at me.", "timestamp_created": 1658153310, "timestamp_updated": 1658153310, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118983466": {"recommendationid": "118983466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104571110", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1658255075}, "language": "english", "review": "gg and very ez! recommended", "timestamp_created": 1658100763, "timestamp_updated": 1658100763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490166425704956055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118974932": {"recommendationid": "118974932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318803411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1775, "last_played": 1689436055}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is amazing i love it so much i have it on my pc and my xbox also my dads ps4", "timestamp_created": 1658087956, "timestamp_updated": 1658087956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118971808": {"recommendationid": "118971808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805009985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1367, "last_played": 1662599488}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with unique mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1658083787, "timestamp_updated": 1658083787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118955934": {"recommendationid": "118955934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182770446", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1884, "last_played": 1669643497}, "language": "english", "review": "stress free\n", "timestamp_created": 1658062425, "timestamp_updated": 1658062425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118911143": {"recommendationid": "118911143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154479480", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 7687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 860, "playtime_at_review": 5173, "last_played": 1700682190}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1657987806, "timestamp_updated": 1657987806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118904456": {"recommendationid": "118904456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064031172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 627, "last_played": 1662828446}, "language": "english", "review": "I really really tried to like this game. Loved JC 2 and JC 3. This one is trying to take itself too seriously. \nGraphics: \nvomit looking yellow green trees, muddy brown rivers, a sky that looks polluted, even Rico somehow looks worse, its visually unappealing and no amount of reshading has helped. It seriously makes you wish they just stuck with JC 3 graphics.\nSound: \nThe sound is ok\nGameplay: \nThe pc interface for navigating menus is flat out bad, the worst on earth ever. One would expect a few constants that most other games use: M for map, I for inventory, etc, ...but no, it's 1 for the menu then you have to look because if you're not on the map you have to see if you need to press 2 to go to the map or 3, they change the mapping. Just what one wants to worry about in a JC title, how to navigate a rediculous UI. I don't know if remapping really matters, I found the thought of it so daunting I just plain don't care to worry about it.\nAmmo is always running out, limited, hard to find. The enemies of course are suicidal and never run out of ammo but you're constantly constantly having to worry about finding more guns to switch to and more ammo.\nMods? well unfortunately the game is so unpopular the modding community has pretty much overlooked this title, don't expect any mods that will fix what will you find broken.\nWhat am I supposed to be doing?  Just like JC 3 there's no mini map, it would be preferable if they had one and then had an option to turn it off. But JC3 is still way superior, I was never too confused in that game about what I should be doing. It had personality and a flow. This JC 4 has none.  And going into the Map doesn't help me understand what I'm supposed to be doing. I can't really quite explain this so let me explain how I felt. I found myself asking myself what am I supposed to be doing over and over, I don't even know why I'm being so murderous and why I care for this \"cause\" they are fighting for, they haven't given me a reason to care....it's lost me and no game really does that to me like this one did.

I originally thought that JC4 would just be more JC3, but I was wrong. It sucks that I have to give this game a bad review. I kinda wish there was an in between for the yes and no.\n\n One thing that I did not enjoy was the liberation system. In JC3, there were multiple towns and bases that you could liberate. Those were fun and made you feel like a badass. JC4 on the other hand, has you do strikes on bigger bases instead. I expected the strikes to be fun, but most of them contain the same objectives. I understand that in JC3, it was the same objectives as well: destroy, but those objectives were fun. This game's objectives is just flipping breakers and a few other things that are repeated. After that, you just advance your frontlines into the next area you liberated (if its adjacent).\n\nThe game is definitely worth the price on sale because you can get the game and all the DLC for under $20, and that's a steal. Overall, JC4 is a decent game but just isn't the same as three. Also, Danger Rising is an actually good content DLC. The other two, I couldn't finish because they just weren't that fun.\n\nTLDR: just get the game and all the DLC when it's on sale.

where you just blow stuff up.  Mercenaries 1 and 2 were some of my favorites.  I really liked Just Cause 3.  It was a great game to turn your brain off and just blow stuff up.  Taking out each base at a time as I improved my movement and weapons was great.  So it was really a surprise to find out how much I didn't like this one.  They ruined.. well.. everything.  The things that pop out in my head in no particular order.\n- infinite enemies harass you at all times no matter what.  Not in a fun way, more like being attacked by really weak bees but instead of stingers they just wear on your interest by buzzing around you.\n- Its no longer about destroying bases and big explosions... which i thought was the whole pitch of the JC games.  Seems like stunts are the focus now.  I mean destroying bases isnt even a thing any more.\n- The whole movement thing doesnt feel good any more.  I found it impossible to stay in the air with the wing suit unlike the 3rd one.\n- 3rd game was easy to grapple what you want like enemy planes but I found it more difficult in this game.\n- Driving isnt fun, cant put my finger on why.\n- The map is huge but completely empty of anything interesting.\n- Objectives are not clear as to what they are or why you should do them or what reward you will get.\n- You start with all abilities.

The enemy has infinite respawn/rebuild and you can only free the map through scripted missions. \nFollowing on from breaking the open world nature, the cutscenes and story were less involving than the original Ghost Recon mission briefings. The map mechanics for progress are obtrusive and irritating, in a way that JC2 and 3 never were. Also why did he throw away the Bavarium powered wingsuit? Suit was cash.\nI understand what the graphics are trying to do, having got Rage2, capture the humidity and sunlight/shade of the jungle and they do that extremely well up close, along with the trash and world-making detais, but rendering at distance gives the jungle a kind of impressionistic filter, while the unaliased text gives an unpolished feel.

free version years ago in 2020. Only after revisiting Just Cause 3 did I decide to revisit this game as well. \n\nThis game is nothing compared to its predecessor.\n\n-Liberation, a core mechanic in Just Cause 3 was removed from this game. Why? People might've said it was repetitive but it was nowhere near as repetitive as the missions you do in this game. Every town and base was different and made you use a different strategy, it also gave you a reason to explore the map and would create some epic firefights. In this game, you have to hack this, hack that, wait for some timer or let someone else hack something. Very boring and repetitive. Don't even get me started on that transmitter defense mission, it took me 5 tries to complete. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\n\n-As mentioned by many other reviewers, graphics seem to be downgraded heavily compared to the previous game, even running on the recommended setting could not top the beauty that Just Cause 3 had. The water in particular also sucks, it's a shame because JC3 had beautiful water. Even Just Cause 2 had better water and that was a 2010 game. The water also lacks any physics as well. Things like explosions and basic destruction are also toned down, you can only blow up certain bridges and explosions don't look as nice as in the previous game. I understand people had performance issues with Just Cause 3, but that is no excuse to downgrade it this much, especially on PC.\n\n-No reason to destroy stuff or explore the map. Because of the removal of the aforementioned liberation mechanic, blowing up things, something Just Cause is known for, is not required at all and is a waste of time because it will respawn later. This also means you have no incentive to explore the map, all you have to do is the boring base missions.\n\n-Ammo limits on vehicles. Come on, this is a Just Cause game. I swear they only added this to piss people off.\n\n-No grenades. No C4. No dual handguns that made Rico look so badass. \n\n-Cutscenes look like they were rendered on an Xbox 360. \n\n-No proper day/night cycle like in the previous games. Medici looked spectacular at sunset. Actually I don't recall ever seeing this game at night outside of missions.\n\n-Story is boring. I'm not saying Just Cause 3 had GTA 5 / RDR 2 levels of storytelling but at least that game had memorable characters (like Mario Frigo) and had a good dictator, Di Ravello. The game balanced serious moments with comedic and funny ones. As another reviewer put it, \"at least JC3 acknowledged Di Ravello's presence and he was a thought out character.\" Meanwhile, none of the characters in this game are particularly memorable and the main dictator, Oscar Espinosa is only seen twice, once at the beginning, and once at the end. In addition, the story is now too serious, the comedic moments are gone. \n\n-No introduction and no final boss fight. JC2 and 3 both had introductions that were fun and epic. Firestarter playing and then launching rockets off a plane was badass. In this game, there is no introduction, it cuts to the chase immediately.\nAlso, there is no final boss fight, it is a cutscene instead. Fighting Panay and Di Ravello was fun, I don't understand why we couldn't have the same here.\n\n-Heat is not fun anymore. In the previous game, you had actual heat levels (1 to 5) and the military would chase you. As the heat increased, they gradually bring more and more reinforcements, and then send in helicopters and tanks to try and stop you. It felt amazing blowing up every soldier trying to chase you.\nIn this game however, there are no more heat levels. It wouldn't be bad if the game didn't spam Black Hand units behind you. As the heat rises, helicopters and tanks show up like they did in the previous game, however in this game jets will also attack you. What's the big deal you ask? Well, there is no reliable way to fight back against these jets, they are overpowered too, usually almost killing you. To add insult to injury, the game will not stop spamming enemies and spawning them wherever you can't see, often right next to you. If you are in the air, fighter jets will spawn instantly. They somehow managed to swarm a remote island far from the mainland with their cars tanks and helicopters. Also, it breaks the immersion of a revolution when the Black Hand can chase you deep into Army of Chaos territory, which makes no sense.\nAt least in Just Cause 3 they spawned realistically, you could see the military driving down the road to intercept you.\n\n-Frontlines are a classic example of 'good in theory, bad in practice'. The only practical use I found was to farm Chaos.\n\n-I didn't even bother with challenges. Yes, they're as bad as people say they are. \n\n-Just Cause 3 had a beautiful and vibrant color tone that made it so nice to look at. In my opinion its beauty rivals big dogs like GTA 5. Just Cause 4 lacks this and the game looks pretty bland because of it.\n\n-No incentive to drive vehicles. Just Cause 3 had the 'chop shop' challenges, allowing you to collect all sorts of vehicles. This game lacks that. Why drive when you can fly or fast travel?\n\n-Vehicle physics suck, worse than the previous games actually. Don't get me started on motorcycles. \n\n-Map feels empty. Towns and cities don't feel alive. In Just Cause 3 towns felt alive, after liberating them there would even  be fireworks and street musicians performing.\n\n-Enemy AI sucks. Some enemies are bullet sponges while others are just plain annoyances. \n\n-AI actually sucks in general. I could not complete several missions because some NPC wanted to go somewhere else instead of where the mission told me to go.\n\n-The map is less interesting than previous games. I did explore the map, but I found it to way more boring than exploring Medici or Panau. The desert for example is nearly empty.\n\n-Base liberation missions are literally just copy paste recycled missions. \n\n-UI is trash.\n\n-I nearly forgot about the disasters. They are only used in a few missions and most are then never seen again. Unacceptable, considering how much they featured in this game's marketing. Literally every trailer was just random dubstep music with a tornado or something.\n\n-All DLC's are garbage and are a waste of time and money, except Danger Rising, which is surprisingly okay.\n\nSo, what about the pros?\n\n-You can blow up stuff?\n\n-Weapons are, alright?\n\n-The map is, there?\n\nTLDR/In conclusion this game was a major step backwards for its franchise, it's no wonder that this game was forgotten after about a year and that nobody, not even me remembers this game. Please, do yourself a favor and get Just Cause 3. You can thank me later. It's such a shame because this game had so much potential.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1656519937, "timestamp_updated": 1656519937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Just Cause 4 is still a lot of fun jumping back into the shoes of Rico and wreaking havoc with an impressive arsenal. It is always fun to jump in and pretend to be an 80's action hero, shooting up enemy camps and setting off explosions left and right. The series of games has been a ton of fun to play over the years so I was super excited to play 4 when it came out. Just Cause 4 adds some very interesting weather effects to the gameplay that keep the story interesting.\n     It was still hilarious fun at times, but there are a few game mechanics that were a departure from how the previous games worked that did put a damper on what could have been even better. If you've played any of the other Just Cause games, the way that you would usually liberated town and bases was by taking out specific targets and objectives in each location. But this game changes this mechanic so that your now have a \"Chaos\" meter that needs to be filled to liberate an area or region. This mechanic is probably intended to speed up the game to not seem as tedious, but it is such a departure from the old system that it felt sad to not have to go to each base and town to liberate them. It sort of feels like a disservice to the intricate locations of the game that are very well designed and modeled, but that many players probably won't see because the mechanics don't incentivize players to go explore as much any more. Maybe it's just me, but this was a pretty big let-down for me from what we had come to expect from the Just Cause games.\n     Still a pretty fun game that I would rate at a 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1656198964, "timestamp_updated": 1656198964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.859033167362213135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117609123": {"recommendationid": "117609123", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979282224", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1756, "last_played": 1656204936}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an alright game for the price it is when on sale. As mentioned in lots of other reviews, it's a big disappointment they changed how you take over regions and settlements now compared to the previous games. It definitely isn't as fun to what is basically do one of the same type of 3-4 missions per area you want to liberate, and then click on it on the map to liberate. There is no feeling of progression like in the previous games, where you have to work to find all the things to destroy before you can take that settlement away from the bad guys.\n\nThe grappling hook mods (of which there are many) didn't really seem to be all that important to me. If you have read about how over-complicated it is, and that seems to scare you away, just know that I went through the whole game without actually changing any mods on the different types throughout the whole game. It is not required to beat it.\n\nThe DLC adds quite a bit of things to do in the game, with one of them being overly frustrating at times, which is the Los Demonios DLC. It is very easy to die, and takes quite a bit of patience to complete. It does take patience to complete this one, but it is possible. Overall I was glad it was over when I was done with all the missions for this one.\n\nThe Dare Devils of Destruction DLC I am still working on, but is basically driving on a course with guns mounted to your vehicle, while you try to rack up your score by shooting targets/other cars while keeping in a time limit. It seems alright so far and is a nice change of pace for when you need a break from the open world shenanigans you can get into.\n\nLastly, the Danger Rising DLC adds in a hoverboard you can use, and gives you missions to take down the agency on submarines located in the sea around the world. I have read there are time trials you can do for the hoverboard on these, but haven't attempted any of them yet. \n\nI have seen complaints about having limited ammo on flying vehicles. This doesn't seem to be too much of a problem as you can just request a drop for another flying vehicle and you get a full amount of ammo on the new one you just dropped. If you want to save time, you can just try to hijack an enemies vehicle, which usually isn't too hard.\n\nAll in all, if you want some more Just Cause, and are sick to death of playing Just Cause 2 and 3, this one will make do until the 5th comes around (hopefully with the old settlement and liberating stuff compared to this one). At the price you can get it for sale nowadays, and you aren't trying to be overly critical about every little thing in the game, there is at least some fun to be had by playing it. I know I don't regret buying and playing it at least for the sale price.", "timestamp_created": 1656192624, "timestamp_updated": 1656192624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661759078502655029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117596806": {"recommendationid": "117596806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869508424", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1633, "last_played": 1680463761}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1656179318, "timestamp_updated": 1656179318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117593569": {"recommendationid": "117593569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078303849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1656175543}, "language": "english", "review": "Jesus Christ, this game is SOO BAD.

Instead, you go into a base, complete a repetitive side mission (there are about 3 actual varieties), and use the frontline system to just take the entire region. Causing chaos is honestly secondary and not very important. You blow stuff up, it respawns and you just do it again. Squads are gained without even trying and some regions even give you extra squads without having to cause chaos. The destruction, the completionist aspect of the game is lost.\n\nOh, and remember all those cool races and unique challenges and side missions?

"review": "JC4 is an extremely fun game. BUT, it is pretty janky.\n\nI feel like they forgot how to program physics properly after JC3, and they wanted to nerf the wing suit from one of two awesome JC3 DLCs as much as possible. I don't know what they did to screw up a Just Cause game with the size of the location we're in this time when they made JC3 which had a much larger map.\n\nIn terms of Story, Characters, Gunplay, Vehicles, and Concept... they did a good job on this one. What they got wrong was Physics, and the Control Responsiveness. JC3 had the better of both.\n\nThey added in new tether specific gadgets, which is fun.\n\nFor those who've played JC3 with the DLC, let me lower your expectations. The wingsuit no longer has awesome homing missiles, and now shoots 4 missiles that go in a single selected direction at once. There is no machine gun, and there is no dodging SAMs (though they eliminated the need to dodge SAMs). There is only the Brawler Mech, it can only punch, dash, jump, grab, and make cute beeping \"honk\" noises, and the gravity grab is very unresponsive. There is no orbital lightning laser gun, just a gun that shoots a short and seemingly ineffective beam of electricity (with a grenade launcher that basically creates a small temporary storm to strike an area with a smattering of lightning).\n\nWhat I can say that I love about this game is the new tether gadgets that add new features that all have a set of effects you can use to change how one of three \"Tether loadouts\" behaves. \n\nMy biggest complaint about this game is that the game itself is seemingly free but you HAVE to buy it with DLC and you don't even get to select each individual DLC you want... you just have to get the one that has the most of what you want, and that'd probably be the complete edition. Enemies now immediately alert all others and their headquarters without the need for one to call it in with their radio, which frustrates me and kills the immersion. They also added a new hoverboard that goes across water and has magnetic rails you can ride on in only a few very specific locations... and has no other use than what the game teaches you to do with it. If you run into something, it'll lose all momentum. If you have too much momentum and take a sharp turn, you'll ride it off the intended path. You can't do tricks with it, you can't upgrade it, and you HAVE to propel it with some form of momentum or your grapple hook. It is single-handedly the worst item they could've added in my opinion.\n\nTo the devs, in the words of a man talking to a missile while riding it...

There are more weapons and tools available this time around. The map is large and varied, which at times becomes a pleasure to traverse. This game is heavily about mobility with the grappling hook, and chaos. With no pun to be intended, this game revolves around chaos which can be both good and bad. It will keep encounters fresh with lots of explosions to watch.\n\nThe downside to this is, this can also turn against you. If you aren't aware of your environment, pieces of rubble or explosive devices will collide and be your demise. This is offset from a frequent and forgiving checkpoint system. In addition, guns don't really have much variation in purpose, so there are no upgrades or things to seek to optimize weaponry. Just pick up a gun and shoot. \n\nVehicles come in a wide variety, but unless equipped with weapons they are a sideshow. Controls are not great in vehicles but manageable. \n\nStory is nothing incredible, but keeps the pacing and flow going. It would be noted that the DLC is good if you are seeking an increase in tools (hoverboard, crossbow, vehicles etc). None of the DLCs was incredible by any means, but served their purposes. The demon DLC was more annoying if anything, but the crossbow it comes with is a powerful weapon. It is important to note these DLC are available from the start, so you can use in conjunction with main campaign.\n\nGraphically it runs well, and looks good for the amount that is happening on screen.\n\nOverall I would recommend this if you enjoy the prior titles or enjoy open world chaos.

Destruction is still there, but there's no incentive to engage with it beyond just wanting to blow stuff up for fun. The range of weapons and their unique abilities are nice, but combat is ridiculous thanks to the disparity between enemies, with some being paper-thin annoyances, and others incredibly spongey and overpowered. The controls are finicky and unresponsive, especially when it comes to mucking around with the grappling hook and all of its novelty options. Even when story was never much the focus of the previous games, the writing really takes a dive here, to the point where the plot is pretty much non-existent beyond \"Rico shows up and is now in charge of a rebel army\", and dialogue is painfully bad too. Even on its highest settings the game looks absolutely awful, undoubtedly worse than 3 and possibly even 2 in a few areas, and cutscenes are all rendered on a lower setting as well as being locked at a low frame rate. The DLC packs exacerbate some of the game's worst aspects in the driving, combat and writing respectively, but at least Danger Rising tries to resuscitate the destruction based progression at the last hurdle. There's a couple more saving graces to be found, for one the open world is large, diverse and well-populated with a variety of locations, even if many of them feel reused from one another, and amazingly I ran into very little in the way of bugs and glitches, but overall the game is just a plain old mess that feels like it was made without an ounce of passion. \n\n3/10", "timestamp_created": 1654548571, "timestamp_updated": 1654548758, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50519031286239624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116573839": {"recommendationid": "116573839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081684135", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1654501252}, "language": "english", "review": "HATE.

247, "last_played": 1654301042}, "language": "english", "review": "You might be asking, why am I writing a review for a 3+ years old game that received a lukewarm welcome and was pretty much forgotten right from the get-go. Well, I\u2019m gonna do you one better \u2013 why does JC4 even exist? Looking back at previous releases, it feels like the journey of our favorite firestarter Rico Rodriguez has come to a natural conclusion by the end of JC3. After having deposed several ruthless dictators around the world, Rico set on to liberate his own home country of Medici. That\u2019s where the story ends, at least that\u2019s where it should\u2019ve end.\n\nBut, Avalanche execs demanded more Just Cause, so here we have the fourth installment. The story has never been the highlight of the series, often being just a backdrop to the trademark joyridin\u2018, jet hijackin\u2018, tank destroyin\u2018, missile evadin\u2018, air divin\u2018, chaos risin\u2018 mayhem. Which is more puzzling considering JC4\u2019s 180 storyline focus. Okay, maybe not a complete 180 \u2013 more like an 85\u00b0 turn. Without spoiling much (not that there is a lot to spoil), Rico journeys to a small South American island country of Solis ruled by yet another authoritarian mogul, whose name I quickly forgot after the intro cutscene.\n\nNot that my last 2 surviving brain cells are at fault since you see the main villain exactly 2 times during the entire game! Once at the beginning and once at the end. It\u2019s not like you saw Sebastiano Di Ravello (JC3\u2019s villain) every second mission, but at least the game acknowledged his presence and he felt like a thought out character. There\u2019s also his lieutenant, who happens to be a sister of the head of the rebel army, however, nothing noteworthy ever comes out of this relationship.\n\nI forgot to mention stuff with Rico\u2019s father, then again, he is as prevalent in the story as generic soldier #0468 I threw off the bridge with my grappling hook that time.\n\nSo the story sucks, but you don\u2019t play JC for the story. You wanna know how\u2019s the gameplay. As I have mentioned it\u2019s still the same ol\u2018 helicopter crashin\u2018, military base bombardin\u2018, civil infrastructure demolishin\u2018 fun. Only with several major changes to the core gameplay. For the uninitiated, JC\u2019s primary gameplay mechanic has always been slowly but surely taking over each region until The Big Baddie loses control of the country. You do this by \u2013 causing chaos. You do that by \u2013 liberating towns and cities, overtaking military installations and blowing \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up. Nice and simple.\n\nOnly in JC4, you do none of that. It seems like the devs at Avalanche have lost focus of what made their series, well, fun. Maybe they\u2019ve wanted to adress the issue of repetitiveness of JC, only this isn\u2019t sufficient remedy. In JC3, if you wanted to attack a military base, you\u2019d get in your high-power helicopter and blow up every piece of military equipment you come across. Once you do, the base belongs to the rebel army. Trying the same approach in JC4 is completely meaningless since everything you blow up will respawn after time \u2013 as if you weren\u2019t even there.\n\nInstead, you are supposed to complete missions named Region Strikes. These fall into several pre-set categories \u2013 all tremendously unimaginative, unexciting, repetitive, copy-paste, simply boring. Escorting prisoners, hacking a security console, protecting an NPC while they hack a security console or protecting a point of interest while some hacking is going on elsewhere. Most involve waiting until a bar fills up. After that, you send rebels to invade a region and they do the job for you... *explosionless sigh*\n\nThe rest of the game plays out in this very same basic rhythm. The side missions are not much to talk about either. JC3\u2019s challenges such as destruction derbys, land, air and sea races, have been replaced by what I think someone with severe brain damage considers challenge. \u201eRace through these 3 rings\u201c or \u201epass through this ring in a specific vehicle\u201c are dotted around the map Ubisoft open world style. There are more stimulating events such as discovering lost tombs, however, they never unlock anything substantial.\n\nThat brings me to another gripe \u2013 no upgrade system like the one in JC3. In its place, you have MODs. Completing challenges mentioned above nets you points you can then spend unlocking various modifications for Rico\u2019s signature grappling hook\u2018s 3 primary functions \u2013 air lifter, retractor and booster. All of them serve the purpose one\u2018d expect. It\u2019s a shame you rarely need them, if ever. There\u2019s barely any gameplay puzzles designed for specific grappling hook modifications. Once you unlock them, you will forget about them.\n\nThe same goes for the much praised extreme weather system. Tornadoes, sandstorms or massive lightning storms are delegated to a handful of story missions, where they take a form of a scripted event. Not to imply it isn\u2019t fun to glide around a tornado, pierce through a sandstorm with a train or dodge a lightning bolt \u2013 the game shines at those moments. I just wish the game would\u2019ve done more with them and take advantage of the extreme weather it proudly boasts about.\n\nJC4 puts front and center features the devs didn\u2019t flesh out. Just like The Black Hand, Rico\u2019s \u201etoughest enemies yet\u201c, as the trailers brag, turn out to be more of the same. The AI never utilized clever tactics, flanked me or surprised me. The only challenge The Black Hand poses is in their sheer numbers.\n\nPros:\n+ Extreme weather\n+ Diverse biomes\n\nCons:\n- A visual downgrade compared to JC3\n- Lack of compelling story\n- Repetitive mission design\n- No upgrade system\n- No real challenge\n\nRating: 4/10", "timestamp_created": 1654237430, "timestamp_updated": 1654237430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119,

The gadgets were made overly complex to the point of why bother caring, especially when the base gadgets worked the best. The mouse and keyboard control scheme makes absolutely no sense at all (were the developers on drugs?).

But there is something more important.........It all started when I went to a second hand shop called Salvation army. I stepped inside looking for a adventure time or regular show dvd set. I looked through the dvds when i found a regular show box dvd set. it had no cover but it had 5 disks inside. and on the box read this writing reading, buy this for only $2.99,written in red childrens writing. I purchased it at the counter when a random lady told me \u201coh honey don't buy that i heard bad reviews about those cheap fake knock off discs\u2019\u2019 I told the lady it'll be fine.\n\nI arrived home at 3:40. No one was home apart from my grandpa,who was outside,i popped the first disk called skips the boxer inside the dvd player and it made a really loud noise and popped out. So i tried again but the same thing happened. So i put the next disk in called THE RAGE all in capital letters. I put it in and it showed a static menu all blue with a file called \u201cplay epi.exe. I clicked play first episode and it cut to rigby sleeping. He wasn't sleeping on his usual trampoline,instead he was sleeping outside the house in a puddle. It was raining.  you could hear rigby speaking in a static voice. I could hear him say \u201cStAy OuT\u201d and that was it. I was curious to see what happened next,so i continued watching rigby crying in a puddle in a weird creepy voice when it cut to a black screen. \n\nI waited for 30 seconds till i made sure the episode didn't freeze,when i was doing that it came up with the group of people like Muscle man,Skips,Mordecai,Rigby,etg. All the characters had no pupils. They were sitting on the stairs leading up to the front door,until after a whole minute benson came with a piece of paper. He told Mordecai and rigby to pick up the leaves and dust the house in a normal voice. Off they went headed to the entrance of the house. He told everyone else to wait. Then it cut to a white screen reading \u201cHELp Me\u2019\u2019 Then about a second later it showed benson walking to the stairs with a knife behind his back. He walked over to skips and \u201c whispered follow me\u201d . It showed all the characters looking happy with pupils now in their eyes. Once again another white screen came up saying hahahaha you can't escape! Then it showed mordecai and rigby both looking depressed and as  if they were beaten up. They were in the kitchen cleaning the oven,when a voice could be heard screaming.  \u201cAaaaauuuuuuggghhhhh! Mordecai rigby heeeeelp\u201d It was skips voice that could be heard. The two did nothing as it then cut to a scene of skips dead on the floor with his head detached from his body rolling around on the floor of Benson's office. It cut back to the two depressed looking main characters as they kept working! Benson came down the stairs and was all red in the face. He walked over to mordecai and said \u201ccome with me!\u201d in a squeaky voice. Mordecai followed benson out of the kitchen. Rigby then dropped his cleaning supplies and ran out of the room. Rigby ran upstairs to his bedroom and opened the cupboard and pulled out a rope. He ran over to Mordecai's bed.hung the rope on the ceiling,then on his neck and screamed \u201cHELP ME\u201d and jumped of the bed killing himself. I was super scared so i didn't watch the rest but i got my dad to. \n\nHe said it cut to another white screen saying .avi . Then it showed benson hitting mordecai over the head with a metal pole,Mordecai was crying for rigby! It was night time outside and it cut to muscle man and high five ghost stabbing a dead body saying these words \u201cTHE SACRIFICE MUST BE COMPLETE SO HE WON'T RAGE\u201d . Then it showed them drinking the dead person's blood. Then it went back to benson beating up Mordecai. Mordecai had cuts all over his face. Benson then put his hand up to his face and ripped it of. Blood was everywhere and Benson was laughing as Mordecai slowly died. Then it showed high five ghost and muscle man giving Benson a jar of blood. The show ended with Benson saying \u201cyOu'Re NeXt\u201d\n", "timestamp_created": 1653663942, "timestamp_updated": 1653663942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433070838451385498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116079334": {"recommendationid": "116079334", "author": {"steamid": "76561199159358104", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1669414489}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is a piece of a sh*tty cake :)))\n", "timestamp_created": 1653644259, "timestamp_updated": 1653644259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116070060": {"recommendationid": "116070060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198942659073", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1688941578}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is fun and the bugs are funny to watch plus people get mad about the bugs", "timestamp_created": 1653623003, "timestamp_updated": 1653623003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116067637": {"recommendationid": "116067637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198816318942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1698008154}, "language": "english", "review": "noice game", "timestamp_created": 1653618162, "timestamp_updated": 1653618162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116059958": {"recommendationid": "116059958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992116894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1653602859}, "language": "english", "review": "The good:\nGraphics, sounds, voices, cutscenes, landscapes, a diverse world...

(EG: you can't simply press \"jump\" to deploy parachute when free-falling. No, they make you map a separate \"parachute\" key now. JC has always had way too many buttons and controls, and, you know what makes it more fun.. MORE CONTROLS! *sigh*)\n\n* Some remapped controls ignore your remap. EG: Reload defaults to \"R\" key. Tap to reload, hold to swap weapons. If you remap it, your remap will tap to reload, but you still have to hold \"R\" to swap weapons. How did this pass QA?\n\n* Rico can only carry 2 guns. That wouldn't be so bad, but enemies are bullet sponges. So, you run out of ammo fast. Once out, Rico throws the gun away (!) This leaves you weaponless on several occasions. How do you get more weapons? You have to either air-drop them in (which is a death sentence in a fire-fight or while being pursued) or look for shimmering weapon boxes amidst the landscape.. b/c unlike JC3, the weapon locations don't show up in your HUD to make them easy to find. It makes no sense.\n\n* You also run out of ammo easy because Heat (enemies looking for you and trying to kill you) is very hard to get rid of since ENEMIES SPAWN IN THIN AIR RIGHT BEHIND YOUR BACK. Not even joking. I was across a large river on a desolate hill side. I shot a rocket at an enemy tank across the river. Infantry enemy IMMEDIATELY SPAWNED NEAR ME. I thought I was nuts. So, I tried it again. This time, a motorcycle enemy spawned instantly on my side of the river. They don't even give the illusion of enemies chasing you; they just spawn them right on top of you behind the camera to hide it. So, it's difficult to lose heat. And, they keep ramping up the enemies as you kill them, so eventually you have TANKS, HELICOPTERS, etc spawning all over you! If you go hide in the forest, they still eagle eye you through the trees, too. So, good luck with that sh*t. It's absolutely bottom-barrel BS from the devs.\n\n* And, speaking of BS, some moron at Avalanche seems to think everyone plays JC to muck around with the grappling hook, because they doubled-down on how convoluted it is in JC4. You can only carry TWO guns, but you get THREE load-outs for the grappling hook, where you can mix-n-match retractor, blimp and rocket booster mods.. and those mods have their own mods, like speed/strength of retraction, etc. People play JC to go blow sh*t up, so it boggles the mind that they'd spend so much time making the grappling hook even more gimicky than making the game more compelling to play. It reminds me of JC2 or JC3 where the devs had such a h***-on with doing stupid things with the grappling hook that like 1/2 the achievesments revolved around it, like \"hang someone up and then shoot / kick them\". Just absolutely dumb stuff you'd have to be extremely extra about. For some reason they think that's why people play JC, so that's what they focused on.. and the rest of the game is poorer for it.\n\n* Then they decided the DLC needed more gimicky BS by throwing in a hoverboard which is annoying to use, and you're forced to use it in puzzles on ships.\n\n* And that leads to Puzzles. So many BS puzzles. I just want to blow stuff up. But, you have 30 seconds to go here to unlock this, then you need to hoverboard over a bunch of switches in a place where it's easy to get stuck on crap within 15 seconds to unlock this, then you have 2 minutes to fly all over the place to flip several switches... I JUST WANT TO SHOOT THINGS I THE FACE AND BLOW **** UP! IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE! For the love of god, why did they double-down on the puzzle BS?\n\n* Well, at least you get something for all your hard work, right? I mean, stuff is destroyed, and... NOPE! The game auto-saves. If you quit and continue your game ALL THE STUFF YOU BLEW UP IS BACK. So, your actions have no impact on the game world in the long run.\n\n* And, even MAIN OBJECTIVES have no impact. You not only took control of an area, but also took control of the drone production facility. Doesn't matter. TONS of enemy drones spawn around you in an AREA YOU CONTROL and absolutely wreck you. How? You took over the production facility. How is the enemy getting stronger when you're wiping out and taking over all their stuff?! It makes absolutely no sense, and underlines that YOUR HARD WORK AND ACTIONS DON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Sure, a few friendlies are cruising around, and the frontline of the war has shifted. But, there's still TONS of enemies in areas YOU CONTROL. So, you can't do anything without getting swarmed. Makes no sense.\n\n* There's the usual petty, insulting \"challenges\" padding the game world out, so they can brag about \"hours of fun\". Drive a certain car through a hoop, wing suit through some rings, etc. Bottom-barrel open world BS. Every now and then they'll have \"kill this person\" or \"drive this person here\". I wouldn't mind this if it upgraded Rico and made him better. Like, better weapons, armor, etc. NOPE! You only gain XP to unlock mods for your grappling hook to make it more convoluted. It just reminds you that some dev at Avalanche got off on how great the grappling hook was by trying to cram it down your throat.\n\n* They do have some interesting main missions....until you realize it's a \"did you enjoy that 30 min mission? Well, you get to do it 5 more times!\" Again, typical Avalanche. They have a \"free the hostages\" mission which you get to do over and over again, b/c.. yeah, that won't get boring. Then they have a \"guard the transmitter\" mission where they throw tons of enemies at you that chew the transmitter apart in no time, so you fail it over and over again until you finally give up and uninstall the game. NO JOKE! You'll die a few times, then quit the game, and google to see if it's just you.. and reddits and such are FULL of folks getting demolished on this mission. It's not a fun or challenging mission. It's just an abusive \"F U\" from the devs who seem to not play test of QA their game, and/or think making the player fail a mission over and over again against impossible odds is some how \"compelling gameplay\". And, if you make it past 1 of those.. guess what.. you got more to do, because of course you do, because Avalanche loves to puppy-mill out the same stuff over and over. Good luck!\n\nThere are moments when this game shines.. like shooting out a tire and watching an enemy vehicle flip, or when everything's blowing up and you're having a blast.\n\nBut, you spend more time frustrated with stupid puzzles, unfair enemy respawns, etc than having fun, especially when (like JC 2) heat takes forever to die down (and they start rolling in tanks in like 2 minutes!) causing you to run away with your tail between your legs instead of taking everyone on like a bad-***. And then you hit a wall with some missions (like the transmitter one), and you start to think \"this is not fun.\"\n\nSo, ultimately this is getting a down-vote from me.", "timestamp_created": 1653204973, "timestamp_updated": 1653459899, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824722111225128174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115819594": {"recommendationid": "115819594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273720129", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 537, "last_played": 1657091011}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1653184148, "timestamp_updated": 1653184148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115816293": {"recommendationid": "115816293", "author": {"steamid": "76561199262789401", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1825, "last_played": 1679459113}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En este juego no encontrar\u00e1s una historia super original y elaborada, tampoco misiones super entretenidas, es muy repetitivo pero lo bueno es que la acci\u00f3n desenfrenada y las explosiones constantes ocultan todo eso, si lo que quieres es desestresarte matando a cuanto enemigo se te atraviese este juego es para t\u00ed.", "timestamp_created": 1653178295, "timestamp_updated": 1653178295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115805644": {"recommendationid": "115805644", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004791978", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5361, "last_played": 1653180919}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the way you would liberate the map by sending soldiers to the front lines.", "timestamp_created": 1653162226, "timestamp_updated": 1653162226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115801523": {"recommendationid": "115801523", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049780012", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1653156885}, "language": "english", "review": "the cutscenes are extremely glitchy and the gameplay is the thing that carries\n\nsomehow the time i played on xbox was 100x better\n\n3/10 pc\n\n10/10 xbox", "timestamp_created": 1653157049, "timestamp_updated": 1653157049, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527645885944366455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115769448": {"recommendationid": "115769448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306552393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1691198480}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: It's great but don't expect something that tops JC3 or you'll probably be disappointed.\nOk, I haven't finished the story yet but I like what I've played so far. If you've played JC2 and JC3, you may see that this is almost a mixture of the two. It has military bases similar to JC2 where you don't NEED to destroy everything but doing so rewards you with chaos. Sadly they do get rid of the city liberation mechanic, but I do enjoy the way you progress, feels more like a rebellion and not a one-man army. The open world feels more polished like from Medici in JC3, but the actual environment reminds me more of San Esperito or Panau from JC and JC2 respectively. There's TONS of side missions and objectives, some of which are kind of random encounters like the kind you'd see in JC3. I like what they've done with the characters so far, specifically the relationship with Rico and Sheldon, as they weren't on the best of terms after Medici. Now here's what I don't like, for starters, it's a nitpick I know, but it launches the game on a really low resolution to begin with, you have to raise it manually, which is fine, yeah, but first impressions y'know? I could see the pixels on the title screen for crying out loud! Next is the menus, I've never found the menus of a JC game to really be \"clunky\" they're usually pretty intuitive, but this is getting there, it could definitely use some polish. I REALLY, don't like the absence of a heat meter however, there's a bar at the top right that tells you if you're being watched and if they're pursuing or searching but it doesn't tell you your heat LEVEL, which there definitely are heat \"levels\" even if it doesn't let them be known. This causes situations where you are being pursued for a long period of time, where you do not know how hard they're going to hit you at any given point. If you saw 1 star in JC3 you knew to expect a couple jeeps and bikes, and if it was 5 stars you expected EVERYTHING, tanks, jeeps, APCs, helicopters, the whole nine yards. In JC4, when you have heat it could mean ANYTHING, you could be turning a corner and be greeted by buggies or 2 tanks and a helicopter, who knows, not you! I also did very much enjoy the little collectibles in JC3 like the Di Ravello tapes and the vehicles as a whole. It gave a nice satisfying sense of progression, and it wasn't just collectibles for the sake of collectibles, the vehicles are useful (mostly,) and the tapes fleshed out the story, if those kinda things made it into JC5 it'd be nice. Sorry for the long tangent, hope you found the review helpful!", "timestamp_created": 1653109858, "timestamp_updated": 1653110125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115765704": {"recommendationid": "115765704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880466242", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 929, "last_played": 1682146187}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1653102966, "timestamp_updated": 1653102966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115756655": {"recommendationid": "115756655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807869138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1694551025}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game.

La historia no tiene la espectacularidad con la que cuenta el anterior, donde empiezas literalmente usando de skate un misil que va por el aire para desviarlo, pero tampoco es necesario, el sistema de conquista del mapa es mucho mejor, no te obliga a destruir cada ciudad entera para poder conquistarla, simplemente tendr\u00e1s que tomar determinados puntos que dan acceso a las misiones principales de la historia y con tu nivel de caos desbloquear\u00e1s tropas para ir conquistando autom\u00e1ticamente cada zona. Las armas son mucho mejores, el mapa est\u00e1 lleno de peque\u00f1os puzzles y misterios que hacen que se integren mucho mejor las mec\u00e1nicas de vuelo, gancho, paraca\u00eddas, etc. Un buen juego de acci\u00f3n palomitero, con un punto de complejidad que har\u00e1 que no lo sientas como un paseo entre balas que nunca aciertan, si no como un reto superable pero entretenido.

The map is also still rather unique and beautiful - these are probably the only reasons why I would recommend this game - story and the open-world.\nIt has many technical issues including glitchy physics, response times for keyboard/mouse presses are slow meaning many are either missed or delayed when you are in the action and in terms of compatibility with newer versions of Windows i.e. Windows 11... Well since this game hasn't been updated majorly in the last 2 years there are many issues especially with controller support. If you use a wired xbox controller then it is ok but forget using wireless, with constant disconnects every time you enter the map or menus, then it takes forever to reconnect.\nIt feels to me like JC3 was meant to be the last in the series but this opportunity of a money-grab was too tempting for the devs so here we are having something that is a re-skin of JC3! \nLook, for new players to the series or those who wont mind this sort of stuff mentioned here then it is a good game to play, but if any of these things are deal-breakers for you then maybe its worth pretending JC3 was the last of the series!", "timestamp_created": 1650963299, "timestamp_updated": 1650963299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114477952": {"recommendationid": "114477952", "author": {"steamid": "76561199212523883", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1069, "last_played": 1699420676}, "language": "english", "review": "E", "timestamp_created": 1650927072, "timestamp_updated": 1650927072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114472925": {"recommendationid": "114472925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184804486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 203, "playtime_forever": 1014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1698057230}, "language": "english", "review": "its ite", "timestamp_created": 1650917931, "timestamp_updated": 1650917931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114471692": {"recommendationid": "114471692", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175563244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2090, "last_played": 1677186470}, "language": "english", "review": "gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood", "timestamp_created": 1650915950, "timestamp_updated": 1650915950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114460756": {"recommendationid": "114460756", "author": {"steamid": "76561199020454446", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1625228731}, "language": "english", "review": "It\u2019s so upsetting to see the fourth game of this franchise to be so bad.

There are a ton of small collection and regional missions, and I wasn't sure what many of them unlocked besides some drops. There's a bunch of mini missions where you have to go and do puzzles to discover a lost history of the island, but it does nothing and isn't central to the game's plot except for one early-game mission.\n2. The DLCs aren't very good. Picking up with the comic-style cutscenes of JC3 for DLC missions was okay, but the missions themselves are either attempts to bring back the base liberation mechanic from JC3 (Danger Rising) or a ton of weird flying enemies that are hard to see and track (Los Demonios). The race DLC was okay, but many of the challenges can be beaten by dropping in late-game choppers, which seems broken.\n3. The map is massive, but liberation is not player-controlled in the same way of previous games. In JC4, you complete a bunch of copy-paste missions first (hack a console, defend a radio tower, flip breakers, destroy generators, submerge car bombs in water, or liberate three prisons), and then manually unlock terrain on the map after the story missions. There are chaos objects like previous games, but they don't matter for base liberation. The repetitive missions don't do much more than eat time and unlock a single new weapon, and they get tedious quickly.\n4. Removed pistols, so you can't try and solo a mission on the machine pistols or the revolvers.\n5. Vehicles no longer carry infinite ammo.\n6. Guns don't feel as good as they did in previous games, although some of the gimmick guns can be fun to use.\n7. Story is kinda meh.\n8. A lot of stuff is locked in cutscenes. You don't get to kill Espinoza (main boss) or fly down into the tornado fully. The end of the game lines up with the \"hacking is everything now\" gameplay, but it isn't as satisfying as when you got to take down DiRavello's chopper, execute him, and drop him in a volcano.\n\nI would recommend it so you know whats going on for if/when JC5 comes out, but not really for the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1650680900, "timestamp_updated": 1650680900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114307773": {"recommendationid": "114307773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033990089", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 4632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1740, "last_played": 1678240683}, "language": "english", "review": "Should be called \"Lost Cause\"!\nJC3 was much more fun.

(gliding and grappling hook)\nDo you like GTA V? (vehicle hi-jacking)\nDo you like Metal Gear Solid 5? (Guns, guns and more guns)\nDo you like Mad Max? (Get the DLC for car battles)\nDo you like Tony Hawks Pro Skater? (DLC with hover board grinding)\nDo you like Far Cry 6? (they made their game the same as Just Cause)\n\nIf you said yes to any of the above then you should buy buy buy this game. So much fun in this game you can pretend to be any super hero you want really. Now when I play other games I wish that I had Rico to get me around their map instead looking at it from the other way round.\n\nMap traversing in most games is the boring part, like if you lose a car in GTA V and have to jog for 3 minutes to get a new one, try 3 seconds in JUST CAUSE 5. And you may not ever choose to drive outside of the missions because you get a jet pack and wing suit, this means getting from point A to B is Epic, jump out of a moving car into a parachute, then into the wing suit and then jet-pack off into the skies to glide to the next location, it never gets old! \nI made a mistake in my first play through to turn off the jet pack in the load out menu, because it said you could not complete some of the stunts with it enabled, but it is not any stunts that matter, it is for the stunts that don't contribute to 100% completion, and they are way too hard anyway so thank devs for that! So I actually played the story and quit for months maybe a year and came back to it, completed all the DLC and then took over the whole map and 100% everything (except for the hover board race stunts DLC).\n\nThe game excels at character mobility, its never slow to get back into what you were doing, if you fall into water it is not a problem with the hoverboard it boosts you straight to the surface again then you can jump into the wing suit and jetpack back into a vehicle if you desire. \n\nVehicles, there are many, all with different control schemes, but still familiar, it takes a second to remind your self of helicopter controls compared to jet airplane or even the jet airplane that hovers too. True to life in a way as they all control differently, some cars swap gun and nos controls for some reason not sure why but it only takes a second to realize.  \n\nGun play, it is the only game I have played where you can float above the enemy with a parachute and hail down bullets as go to tactic. You don't really need to get into gun fights at all as you can get around so quickly with the grappling hook you'll just need to clear the area before hacking a console or open a door etc, sometimes easy and sometimes hard to clear the area if there is a giant missile launcher or 2 homed in on your location. There are only 2 gun slots to carry any combination of guns and you can carry 2 snipers or 2 rocket launchers etc any of the strange and powerful guns they have. It's hard to run out of ammo in the action but at the same time you will run out for that gun you carried but always pick up an enemies gun straight away, it's another none pace slowing perk. I have wanted a back up side pistol only in a few situations, I ran out of ammo hanging from a helicopter and I could not hijack the helicoptor with out killing the 2 snipers sitting in the back first, a back up pistol just for that situation would be great. \n\nSome hijacking seems a bit harsh for the Hero to perform, like throwing out an innocent or chaos army member from a helicopter seems a bit harsh when they would probably happily switch seats with Rico and let him drive, they could get out when it is safe like when some car passengers do, they would probably stay in the Heli and get blown up when I jump out of the vehicle anyway so maybe Ricos method of a fall to the ground has a higher survivability rate. \n\nWater, you can swim and boat, the grappling hook means you won't be swimming for long periods either, you can also shoot from in the water with your torso above the water, most games disable abilities like that in the water but not Just Cause 4. The hover board makes getting out of the water so speedy it is a must have in Just Cause 5, along with the wing suit and boosters.\n\nI got the game in a sale for a great price and it is worth full price.", "timestamp_created": 1650406308, "timestamp_updated": 1650406308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114143491": {"recommendationid": "114143491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150142404", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1700356704}, "language": "english", "review": "I have over 1600 hours on my console and would absolutely recommend", "timestamp_created": 1650400387, "timestamp_updated": 1650400387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114101436": {"recommendationid": "114101436", "author": {"steamid": "76561199138497502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 5450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5149, "last_played": 1669234389}, "language": "english", "review": "chaos bugs & that weird camera where i get out of the aa gun & the camera stays at the gun but the character goes & walks off", "timestamp_created": 1650330642, "timestamp_updated": 1650330642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114097391": {"recommendationid": "114097391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798279467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1680746988}, "language": "english", "review": "fun big explosion", "timestamp_created": 1650323109, "timestamp_updated": 1650323109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114076270": {"recommendationid": "114076270", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054279278", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1689622044}, "language": "english", "review": "hehe i blow things up", "timestamp_created": 1650307346, "timestamp_updated": 1650307346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114075339": {"recommendationid": "114075339", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993302734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2588, "last_played": 1650306086}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanta esta muy chulo", "timestamp_created": 1650306111, "timestamp_updated": 1650306111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114070785": {"recommendationid": "114070785", "author": {"steamid": "76561199105714209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1653241654}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1650300018, "timestamp_updated": 1650300018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114052700": {"recommendationid": "114052700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015557259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1650273212}, "language": "english", "review": "No toggle aim.
