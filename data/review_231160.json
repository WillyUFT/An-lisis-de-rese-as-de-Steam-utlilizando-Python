At the time, I thought it looked reminiscent in some ways of older indie titles like Braid and LIMBO; a sidescrolling puzzle game with a mysterious storyline. Having finally finished the title, I can certainly say that The Swapper didn't inspire or captivate me in the same way that either of those titles did. What it does have, though, is an extremely solid set of puzzles based around the game's unique mechanics. Just on the gameplay alone, The Swapper justifies itself as a fun and engaging puzzle game with a really impressive difficulty curve that always felt on-point through my entire experience, with every set of puzzles gradually growing more complex while teaching you how to better use the tools you always had available to solve new problems.\n\nThe story is another matter, though. I don't hate it. It was interesting enough to keep me engaged through the entire game, but after finishing I can only say that it feels like a mess. Some of the ideas expressed are interesting, but the actual text and story beats never commit to saying anything definite or philosophically meaningful, and the open ends feel less like an invitation to explore the ideas yourself as a player and more like an incomplete narrative that the writer hoped they could pass off as deeper than it actually is by just not finishing it. It isn't actually awful; it just feels incomplete and I would have preferred if it had more meat on the bone. If the puzzles weren't great, I would definitely give it a thumbs down just on the story, but as it happens, the puzzles are great -- play the game for the puzzles and the atmosphere, not the story and the mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1693374756, "timestamp_updated": 1693374756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145252225": {"recommendationid": "145252225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271241247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1673197211}, "language": "english", "review": "Game from my childhood, as good as i remembered it.

I think it's one of dozens of games that I've inadvertently collected over the years through Humble Bundles, and when I was browsing my backlog trying to find something to play, The Swapper did not stand out to me at all. I'm SO glad I gave it a chance.\n\nFrom the promotional screenshots the visuals were a bit of a turn off, but the game is so different when in motion with the ambiance and musical score playing in the background. It's got a dark, unsettling, and strangely relaxing--or maybe pensive--vibe to it. It's actually very beautiful, which is not what I was expecting at all. The ending can get quite dark, so be warned if you're sensitive to topics of suicide.\n\nThe puzzles are wonderful as well. The base concept (creating clones that mirror your movement and swapping places with them) is simple enough to wrap your head around, but the game progresses in difficulty in a very natural way that never feels exasperating. I bounce off puzzle games if I get too frustrated or feel too stupid to figure things out, but this game was very \"gentle\" in that regard. I'm also very thankful for how forgiving failure is. There's no big deal made, no loading screens, just: you died? Press A to immediately try again.\n\nIf I have any complaints it's that there seem to be some UX bugs such as the cursor not working (which can be fixed by going to the Beta branches and selecting \"compatibility\") and gamepad detection being hit-or-miss.\n\nOther than those things, I loved The Swapper, would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of puzzlers or psychological sci-fi.\n\n[h1]My Rating: 4/5[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1680821683, "timestamp_updated": 1680821683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136033862": {"recommendationid": "136033862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018185118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 574, "last_played": 1681140007}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome and fiendish puzzles - huge fun :D", "timestamp_created": 1680541335, "timestamp_updated": 1680541335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135975314": {"recommendationid": "135975314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040679034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 948, "last_played": 1680457340}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting puzzles with original concept", "timestamp_created": 1680457402, "timestamp_updated": 1680457402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135516942": {"recommendationid": "135516942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980092851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1679883619}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1679878137, "timestamp_updated": 1679878137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135439304": {"recommendationid": "135439304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058419347", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1456217795}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay is interesting and puzzles are interesting too, but the novelty dies out too fast and a strange theme about life and death comes around.Another one of those strange games to indulge on existential crisis.Comparing the main theme to real life I can say \"Look, I need to eat meat to live a healthy life, so unfortunately whether we like it or not we feed from animal/plant life everyday just to survive (including you vegans out there)\"So for me the entire concept of the story falls flat and unconvincing.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\n\nSwap myself so I live eternally?

I would often solve a room, then get stumped on the next, sleep on it, then the next day, I'd beat it and get stumped on the next. It's incredibly fun, and incredibly well-paced and well-made. \n\nAll of these puzzles are incredibly satisfying, and complicated at times - many require good timing and good platforming - but they're never impossible. The controls are very tight and the world has a great sense of weight. \n\nThe story didn't quite land for me, but it's honestly still more interesting than most video game stories.

I cant go into detail, but if you know, you know. \n\nThe music, sound design, environmental art and even the puzzles amalgamates into transporting the player into another world. No, I did not forget the storytelling aspect of this game, throughout the entire playthrough, the player is given subtle hints as to what the end of the game could possibly be. Yes, possibly be, no matter what you figure out before the end, the possibility still exists that your interpretation could be wrong. The puzzles are also mind bending in the way that whatever direction you walk, or actions you do, your clones will copy you. Here\u2019s the kicker, your clones die and this ties into the story too.\n\nThis was the first game I bought and finished while I was in South Korea, so it holds a special place in my heart. It is a very short experience, but for 15 dollars or your regional equivalent, it is well worth the money spent, if you figure out the puzzles first time around, you could be looking at about 4 to 5 hours worth of gameplay, but if you are like me, then, you are more likely looking at about 6 to 8 hours of gameplay. \n\nThis is one of those games that should be streamed without a camera, and minimal interaction with the chat, this game is an experience and if you dont want to experience it for yourself, then hope for a streamer, streaming this game.\n\nThis game, was my first indie title as stated before, but it was also the shortest game i have played, that has left me with more questions than answers, it left me with a few days, where i did not want to play any games. That little death that you feel after finishing a great game? I call it gaming's la petite mort.\n\nPlay this game, and if you dont want to play a platformer puzzler, or struggle with the puzzles, I will be posting a puzzle solving guide, with no spoilers.

They all rely on the \"Swapper\", a device which allows you to create clones of yourself and switch identity with them. None of the puzzles were unfair or tedious, which is a rare thing in this genre. They are designed around tight spaces and elegant solutions and gave me plenty of those \"Ah! This way!\" moments. They are held together by an incredible dense atmosphere, with brooding or melancholic ambient music, fuzzy lights and empty corridors, nailing this lost-in-space feeling on the head. \n\nSadly, the game suffers from the desire to be too much at once, since it also tries to put a huge emphasis on exploration and story, managing neither in the end. \n\nThe overall level design is clearly inspired by Metroidvania-games, with plenty of corridors, a rather free choice where to go next, and a whopping 6 different ways of transport (on foot, through swapping, elevators, big teleports, small teleports, and transportation pipes). However, unlike Metroidvania-games there is not much to explore - no secrets, no extras, only some additional lore here and there. This makes exploration rather dull, and I could not escape the feeling that some of the later game segments did only exist to stretch playtime. \n\nThe story on the other hand is way too deep for the game's limits. The \"Swapper\" poses questions about the nature of the soul, and at the same time you'll engage cosmic rocks which engage in philosophy via telepathy. Games like Talos Principle were able to show that you can tackle such things if you give them enough room to breathe and to think about. The Swapper, on the other hand, just throws catchphrases like \"What is a soul?\" at you, which comes out more shallow and uninspired in the end than it probably was intended. There is also another story branch going on, but it is kept equally misterious and only starts making sense within the last 5 minutes or so.\n\nOverall I would have enjoyed the game much more with less emphasis on story and exploration and a bigger emphasis on the puzzles. Because in the end I did not have the feeling that I did everything you could do with such a simple and clever puzzle mechanic - I'm sure that bigger, more daring and multi facetted puzzles would have been possible easily this way.\n\nThis sadly also applies to the replay factor: I would love to see the puzzles again one day, but I don't know if I will have the strenght to slog away at the story and running around again. \n\nTl;Dr: If you love puzzle games, and if you are a connoisseur of isolationist deep space atmospheres this is a no brainer. If you find space boring, or worse, if you just want to simply puzzle for an evening, you might want to look somewhere else.", "timestamp_created": 1638916853, "timestamp_updated": 1638931320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105335776": {"recommendationid": "105335776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881706626", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1638074244}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed the lonely and unsettling atmosphere during the first third of the game, and the story had some interesting elements, although it wasn't anything special.

almost entirely the puzzles.  The storyline is mixed in with each puzzle which was dark and intriguing.  Unlike most platformers though, there's no enemies to fight or bosses to defeat.  I played through the game once, I don't think I feel a strong urge to play through it again.  I finished it in about 8 hours total which I felt was about right to fit in all major ideas for the puzzles without overkilling it.  I ended up completing it without getting any Steam achievements.  Apparently the achievements are all hidden puzzles scattered about.  Overall its a good game for the price(it's at $15 currently).  I would even go as far as to say it's a \"must have\" for anyone big into puzzle games.\n\nThe Puzzles\n\nSince this game is almost entirely built around solving the puzzles I'm going to focus much of this review on the puzzles themselves(without revealing any spoilers).  The puzzles have a unique mechanic to it, the creating of clones which mimic your movement and the swapping your consciousness between them.  Those that are really into puzzle games will enjoy the different types of thinking this game requires.  Some of the puzzles I figured out almost instantaneously, but most of them I had to put some thought and trial and error into.  They were just difficult enough to provide a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment for solving each one, without stressing me out in the process. Three or four of them I had to quit and come back on another day with fresh thoughts to solve.  Two of the puzzles I could not solve on my own after putting in a few sessions over a few days(one on Mining Excavation Site 7 and the top puzzle in Metaphysics).  I ended up relenting and checking a YouTube video.  I probably could have eventually got the Metaphysics puzzle on my own but no way could I have gotten MES 7 on my own.  That one was way too convoluted for me.  Very well thought out puzzles overall.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack is mainly ambient sounds and atmosphere, but also has a few minimalist songs here and there.  The soundtrack is worth pointing out because I thought it was very well done and set a correct mood for the game.  I liked a few of the songs so much that I ended up adding them to my YouTube playlist to listen to separately.  In particular liked the Metaphysics puzzle music.", "timestamp_created": 1636072443, "timestamp_updated": 1636072443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648562848567962646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102214487": {"recommendationid": "102214487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011547924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 193, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1501549854}, "language": "english", "review": "Great indie puzzler!", "timestamp_created": 1636043793, "timestamp_updated": 1636043793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101993615": {"recommendationid": "101993615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031018398", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1660053722}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]TLDR[/b] Interesting puzzle platformer with rather simple mechanics, The Swapper stands out due to the tense atmosphere. [18/20\u2b50, 12h\ud83c\udfc5, 3/5\ud83d\udca1]\n\n[b]Context[/b] The Swapper is a puzzle platformer where the player is able to create, and simultaneously control, copies of the player character. \n\n[b]Writing[/b] The player controls an astronaut scavenging an apparently abandoned spaceship. There she finds a device that allows the swapping of minds between bodies, a concept that is central throughout The Swapper\u2019s story.\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] What really makes the game stand out is the tense sci-fi atmosphere, from the mysterious plot line to the visuals and minimalistic soundtrack. Films like Alien or Solaris come to mind. Some of the most memorable moments [spoiler]like those floating outside the ship[/spoiler] don\u2019t even involve any puzzle solving. Although I did feel that it lost a bit of the mystique later in the game due to rather crude and expository dialogs.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] The gameplay is pretty smooth, even if these are not the most original mechanics (some elements of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/26800/]Braid[/url] come to mind, for instance). I\u2019d say the puzzle difficulty is medium (I never had to quit in frustration to clear my mind). You can die, but you just respawn at a checkpoint without resetting the level and without penalty, so no gameovers. You can also reset to the latest checkpoint. The game auto-saves but mid-level progress is not saved.\n\n[b]Value[/b] Perhaps The Swapper is a bit short for its (full) price (I completed it in 12h), although I guess to avoid being repetitive the developers would probably have to introduce new abilities or mechanics. You can revisit levels by backtracking and teleporting. There are multiple progress slots. Achievements only relate to finding consoles in hidden rooms, extending gameplay and providing additional context. They do not need an additional playthrough since you can revisit previous levels. There are multiple endings, but determined only by a last-minute decision. Either way, The Swapper is replayable just for the experience (and revisiting the puzzles).\n\n[quote][i]For more puzzle-game reviews and curated lists check out the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43326007-The-Clueless-Adventurer-Puzzle-Trove/]Puzzle Trove[/url].[/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1635717803, "timestamp_updated": 1672057059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101919973": {"recommendationid": "101919973", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970738675", "num_games_owned": 926, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1635632323}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzler that involves cloning yourself onto various remote platforms, mimic'ing movements, and teleportation to reach your objectives.

There is only one drawback in my opinion, but more to that later. \n\nIn the 2D world of The Swapper, we control a female scavenger aboard a seemingly abandoned space station, and we soon discover the title-giving apparatus that will lead us through our whole adventure: a swapping device that lets us create and teleport to max four copies of ourselves. While only one of those copies can be the one that we control (and \"live\" in) directly, any other copy will perform the same move as we do. We jump right into the well written narrative (I won't spoil you too much here) and discover the different sections of the station in order to solve not only the game puzzles, but also the puzzling story that is well placed in this dark and lonely world, only to be filled by us and our own copies at first.\n\nThe puzzles will introduce you to the swapper mechanics, soon introducing a whole lot of environment changes that you will have to adapt to - swap-or teleport-stopping light, moving platforms, gravity (which nearly lets you forget that it's only 2D) and large chasms that let you fall to death if you aren't quick enough to swap and port yourself to your next copy.\n\nSoon, you will get the same thoughts that I had: am I killing myself here, or is the just created copy me and it was just a picture of me that faded away? Kinda spooky...\nThe background music is rather enjoyable and relaxing,  as is the pace if the game. The way is quite linear, and every real puzzle is set in a closed room that let's you solve it independently. Certain gateways require you to have a number of \"orbs\" that you get for solving puzzle rooms, sometimes you can chose between which room is next, but eventually you will have to do them all - plus, you WANT to do them all, because the beauty of the game lies in the well-thought puzzles. \n\nYes, definitely, it will get harder ans harder. One piece of advice: make a pause,  come back later, try again differently - they are not undoable.\n\nThe only negative thing is the \"shortness\" of the game. While it is surely repeatable (and if you want to experience both endings, you would habe to play it twice as you can't load a savegame, instead you play from the last checkpoint), it is over quite fast - I have about 8 hours on record, some of that time went into try and repeat, some into thinking hard and staring at the beautiful scenery, but also some idling in the background - so I guess you can do it in 4-6 hours with concentration.\n\nOverall, a very very very good game, I am only sorry to not have discovered it before - although it's 7/8 years old, it did not lose any of its magic, gameplaywise, storywise, even graphics - gloomy, dark, entwined background, perfect match for the intense storyline,  if you like dark sci-fi settings. \n\nVery stringly recommended!\nThank you for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1610305226, "timestamp_updated": 1610305226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709930062294006348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84359679": {"recommendationid": "84359679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999664164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1308, "last_played": 1610199327}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice graphics and atmosphere, and unique game mechanics.\nMost of the puzzles are easy to medium, with few difficult ones at the end.\n\nOverall, a recommended game.", "timestamp_created": 1610199996, "timestamp_updated": 1610199996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84282419": {"recommendationid": "84282419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198901023742", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1610183653}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bueno los mas enfermisos puzzles !!", "timestamp_created": 1610103992, "timestamp_updated": 1610103992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511111080646514893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84162235": {"recommendationid": "84162235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306627696", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1609954028}, "language": "english", "review": "Even without the puzzle, the story, atmosphere and philosophy made this game worth playing.\nThe sound and background music are very good too.\n\nThe puzzle ranged from challenging to almost impossible.

It had a lot of potential, but couldn't deliver on it. While it does have its worthwhile points, it is overall an unfulfilling experience. The fact that I had to opt in to a \"compatibility [i]beta[/i]\" to play the thing is not a good sign in any light.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\nOn the face of it, [i]The Swapper[/i] has a relatively pretty game, with detailed environments and a good soundscape working for it. Visually, it's clearly inspired by the likes of [i]Metroid[/i] and a variety of abandonpunk titles, but with enough of a twist that it doesn't feel too derivative. Its appearance is somewhat inconsistent with the stated setting, but that's fine; not everything has to come out of a cookie cutter, so let's be happy that someone decided to innovate. It's also a game to play with headphones, as its soundscape is on the whole immersive and really quite lovely. Well, except for the soundtrack and UI, but more on that later.\n\nThe core design concept of being able to clone yourself, either as a \"do as I do\" automaton or so you can \"swap\" your consciousness into the clone, really adds dimensions to the game. It opens the door for some extremely creatively designed puzzles and encourages some nonlinear thinking to solve puzzles; you need to think in multiple places at once. Players who like to pick at puzzles, trying multiple paths and approaches and iteratively developing a solution will probably love the design; I know I did!\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\nFirst off, the game has some core engine issues. On start, the game was unplayable, with a jammed mouse cursor. It took a trip to the forums and an opt-in to a compatibility beta to even play it. For a title that's been out this long, a bug that renders the game unplayable is inexcusable.\n\nWhile the bulk of the game's puzzles are interesting and well designed, but there are several which devolve into needlessly frustrating split-second timing events with no tolerances. That's fine if the puzzle is the right length, but having to redo large sections because you blew one fractional-second timing step is annoying. Players with a low tolerance for frustration may want to give this one a pass.\n\nWhile the atmospheric sound is a delight, the UI SFX and \"soundtrack\" (such as it is) are just painful. Since there's no way to turn it off, that's definitely a point against the game.\n\nFinally, while there's an interesting setting just begging for story, the story itself is poorly presented and delivered. It feels thin and uninspired, leaning heavily on philosophical implications that have been reused dozens of times in other works, and forgetting that there needs to be a worthwhile plot to thread it together. Ultimately, the plot is very derivative of many other sci-fi works, with a thin coat of paint slapped on and obfuscated with philosophical fluff.. Since the writing for this title fell out of the head of Tom Jubert, that shouldn't be a surprise; Subnautica and FTL were similarly xeroxed stories, and this follows the tradition of minimal-effort writing. Lots of potential, but almost completely squandered.\n\n[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1]\nUltimately, it's a good puzzle game with a clever design concept, but saddled with weak tea for a plot and some pretty annoying bottlenecks to deal with.

I think if i had snacks nearby, i would've finished it in one go.\n\nThis is some amazing gameplay. You are a spaceperson exploring an abandoned space station, which is in orbit around a planet, which is being mined for telepathic rocks. You solve environmental puzzles by creating up to four clones of yourself, which mirror your actions. You can transfer control to any one of the clones. As you explore the station, you uncover more of what happened to the crew, by way of a mysterious woman who communicates with you over intercom, and a series of messages you read on monitors scattered around the place. There's lots of existential commentary in this game, it's nothing groundbreaking, but it's interesting and well implemented, and serves the story well.\n\nThe puzzles are ingenious. Many are pretty straightforward as long as your brain's switched on, but some... mate, some of them are proper conundrums. It's a good feeling when you figure those out. The player character is never in any danger, unless you count suicide by falling. There are no bad guys, nobody's shooting at you, no flesh chomping traps, NOTHING. And yet this game still somehow cultivates a gripping sense of urgency which does not let go. \n\nThe visual design is reminiscent of Neverhood, it has a surreal, clay-like aesthetic to it. The character you control feels like a real human. The animations are eerily realistic, and the way s/he ragdolls is quite visceral. The design of the space station itself triumphs in presenting an eerie, desolate, and very lonely atmosphere.\n\nThe sound design is similarly awesome. The music is scarce, minimal, and very brooding. The sound effects are well chosen, and serve to punctuate the relentless quiet of the sinister landscape.\n\nBottom line, play this game, you won't regret it.

What I wasn't expecting was for it to draw me in so completely, after the matter of a few levels. The mechanics are pretty much what is described on the store page, that you can create a certain number of clones, and swap control between them. One thing I really admire about this game. It makes your brain unlock, your imagination of this simple tool unlock, instead of unlocking things for the tool itself.\n\nLegit:\n+ Incredible handmade visuals\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ Extremely good story\n+ Optional logs to add depth to storyline\n+ Rock Memos\n+ New mechanics keep the story fresh\n\nRight out the gate: every item in this game was a physical clay model that has been transposed into the game. Lighting is a core mechanic to puzzles. What results is probably the most beautiful 2D game I've ever seen.\nSo this was a hell of a find. I'm a big fan of old-fashioned big thinky high philiosophy science fiction novels. I didn't expect to get that itch scratched so well out of my steam library. Especially from a game I ignored for so long.\n\nYou play as an astronaut send to rescue and investigate a ship where something went terribly wrong. Upon landing, you discover a device that lets you duplicate yourself and swap your conscious around those bodies. It seems you are alone, but that's only half true. A consciousness exists within the ship, and its origin is as mysterious as the objects it inhabits.\n\nSo hows the gameplay? Kinda fun! It's not something I wouldn't bore of eventually, but the game thankfully doesn't overstay the welcome. Moving clones around and bouncing between bodies is a lot of fun, and the puzzles are a perfect balance of approachable and satisfying. It would have been very easy for the developers to make this a \"lets laugh at the silly physics\" game. But they didn't. the tone of the story demands otherwise, and the physics are very well done. Likely my favorite thing to do is make a clone way above your head, swap to it, and keep doing this indefinitely to skip elevators. You can do this indefinitely, as the old clones will die below you with a disturbing crunch. It's like having a jet-pack made of compound fractures.\n\nHow's the story? I expect I already showed my hand. To be frank, you won't find much in the way of character development, but that isn't the point. The ideas the game lobs at you about the nature of consciousness is staggering. The backstory of what's happening on the ship is both eerie, inspiring, and tragic. Every single tone was hit perfectly. This is only amplified by the \"FANTASTIC\" sound track and sound design. The sounds of swapping, breaking bones, doors, every effect is perfect.\n\nReplayability? If I were to play this again, it would be to re-experience the story and visuals. The puzzles serve their purpose, but any old guide could make this a two hour experience if that's what you want. I highly recommend you solve them legitimately the first go-around though. I did look up the locations of the ten secrets, though.

This is a gorgeous, atmospheric puzzle game. In fact the creators did such an amazing job using visuals and sound effects to create such an immersive experience I almost recommended it based on that alone.  Sadly, it is just too short and the gameplay too shallow.  The gameplay is based on you being able to create up to four clones of yourself that, once created move exactly as you do. You also can only control one at a time as the primary agent.  It then adds in environmental modifiers that allow you to change whether or not you are upside down or right side up and also control where you can create clones and when you can swap with them.  From these constraints the puzzles arise.  I did want to go easy on this game because you can tell from the credits that it was created by a very small team. But, even still I thin kthere is too little content. As you can see I have five and half hours on record. That was to beat the game and I was really taking my time. \n\nSummary:\n\nGraphics: 10/10 - Excellent, artistic utilization from a small team.\nMusic/SFx - 9/10 - Beautiful, immersive\nStory - 7/10 - Well written, but predictable. Standard sci-fi existentialism.\nControls - 7/10 - Fine for what you need them to be. The aim acts like a mouse pointer which feels awkward a lot because the game does not include enough fine tuning for such utilization (speed only, no control of acceleration, option for snapping, etc.)\nGameplay - 2/10 - The puzzles are so easy they are barely there.  I could have beat the game in 4 hours if I had been in a hurry.  It is more like a \"experiential\" game, and I would have been less offended had it been advertised this way.\n\nIf you are into easy, experiential games, this could be worth your time but it is so short still not at it's standard price.

All of the puzzles rely on the game's one, not-really-that-unique mechanic of summoning a mimic who you can jump to in certain situations.  The lack of variety in mechanics limits how far the puzzles can go and, combined with the short length of the game, makes for a weird difficulty curve that jumps from pretty basic for most of the game to requiring really specific sequences in the final two or three.  The biggest problem, though, is that the dark aesthetic and imprecise movement don't fit well with gameplay that demands split-second reactions and accurately estimating distances.  The rewarding feeling of figuring out the process behind the occasionally complex puzzle is turned to frustration after half a dozen resets because your placement was a few muddy pixels off.\n\nThere's also a story going on in the background about a generic derelict space station that brought something they shouldn't have on board, but it doesn't really do much to explain or resolve anything, it's more about creating a spooky atmosphere than anything.  If anything, it hurts the game due to how badly it meshes with the gameplay.  It's bad enough that the mess of corridors leading to dead-end puzzle rooms is supposed to be a place people lived and worked in or how parts of the story directly contradict how the mechanics work, but needing to travel between each level with the slow, clunky controls so the game can pretend it's more than a series of linearly-progressing levels is just a pain, especially with how many times you have to drop down from ledges just above the fall death height.\n\nUltimately, it's too simplistic and unpolished to be worth picking up over similar titles and massively overpriced for how little content it contains.", "timestamp_created": 1590201823, "timestamp_updated": 1590201823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478456020355224609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69495405": {"recommendationid": "69495405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030740237", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1590970543}, "language": "english", "review": "Normally I despise side scrollers.

The puzzles aren't bad by any means, but The Swapper doesn't try anything new and it's fairly clear that the only thing that separates The Swapper from a simple browser based Flash game is the presence of a game engine giving it a graphical uplift and a world you can navigate around between the puzzle rooms. Take those away and you'd have the traditional screen full of numbered boxes that you choose the next puzzle from each time.

The clones copy your movement, but cannot interact with objects or use the ray gun, and you can only have a set number of clones at a time. You use this mechanic to move your 'main body' around to either travel to different destinations or solve the puzzles.\n \nThe puzzles in the game require you to collect these orbs (only your main body can do so) that are required to power the numerous teleporters you encounter in the game to travel to different locations. There are obstacles that get in your way of collecting the orbs, but I will refrain from mentioning them. The puzzles are all based on how you use the game mechanics and are perfectly logical without having absurd numbers of steps, while still being challenging enough to leave your head-scratching and to give a great sense of achievement once you complete one (there was one puzzle that I couldn\u2019t solve without looking up the solution, and I consider myself good at puzzles, so be prepared to search for solutions online).\n\nThe unique mechanic aside, the graphics are beautiful and the atmosphere is immersive in the sense that you really feel like you\u2019re in a deserted space station with the dramatic lighting and chilling sound effects. The story is deep, if a bit cryptic, which is rare for a puzzle game, and it slowly unfolds as the game progresses. There\u2019s also good freedom of exploration as some areas are optional to explore. The map display indicates unexplored areas as well as the location of the orbs so that you can go straight to solving the puzzles if you don\u2019t feel like exploring everything. \n\nTo sum it all up, this is a puzzle game with an innovative game mechanic backed up by beautiful graphics and immersive atmosphere and driven by a good story, while still allowing some freedom of exploration. However, it is still a puzzle game in essence, so if you don\u2019t like the idea of busting your mind to solve puzzles, then you won\u2019t enjoy this game, as can be seen from some negative reviews. The puzzles are the basis of the gameplay, the rest is navigating through the space station while uncovering the story. There are no enemies to fight. \n\nIf you like puzzle games, then this game is gonna be a real treat. As a puzzle lover, it truly was a wonderful experience for me. I dare call it a masterpiece, even. I never thought that a puzzle game could make me feel that way. The only downside is there isn\u2019t much replay value, to me at least, despite there being an alternate ending, which you need to start a new playthrough if you want to see it. While I would like to retry some of the puzzles, the thought of navigating the huge space station once more is daunting, at least for now, though I enjoyed it the first time. It would have been nice if you had the option to select individual puzzles to replay after completing the story once, sort of like level-based puzzle games. On that note, if you just want to rush through the puzzles, then you might find navigating through the space station a bit tedious, but if you like puzzles, then you should already have some degree of patience!

The progression of mechanics is very intuitive and has good pacing. I have really enjoyed the puzzles and only briefly get stuck on a few of them so far. This is also a game and story that is designed to make you think. The moral implications of the swapper device are presented through the story and through terminals that give you more information. Finding the hidden terminals is a challenge (though there are obviously video walk-throughs in this era of gaming if you are inclined to find them all and want some help). I think they add some useful background information.\n\nI am excited to finish this game and get the whole story done with.

Tiene un muy buen dise\u00f1o de niveles, donde la dificultad va subiendo progresivamente, sin llegar a ser frustrante ni injusta (aunque algunos de los \u00faltimos puzles tienen su miga).\n\nEl apartado art\u00edstico est\u00e1 bien, tanto los gr\u00e1ficos como los sonidos crean una buena atm\u00f3sfera (sin ser tampoco nada del otro mundo). Donde acierta de pleno el juego es en su gui\u00f3n. Por medio de terminales y unos pocos di\u00e1logos, se va deslavazando una trama compleja, con toques de terror psicol\u00f3gico, y que ahonda en cuestiones filos\u00f3ficas como la consciencia del individuo.\n\nEn general, este juego me ha parecido una peque\u00f1a joya (peque\u00f1a porque no dura mucho, en torno a 3-4 horas) por lo completo y bien dise\u00f1ados que est\u00e1n tanto sus puzles como su historia (por cierto, los texto est\u00e1n \u00edntegramente en ingl\u00e9s, pero no es un ingl\u00e9s especialmente complicado).\n\nUna cosa mala del juego son los logros. Si eres de los que les gusta conseguirlos, debes saber que es pr\u00e1cticamente imposible sin mirar gu\u00edas, son terminales que est\u00e1n excesivamente escondidos.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas, si te gustan los juegos de puzles, \u00e9ste es una muy buena opci\u00f3n, y si adem\u00e1s buscas una buena trama, The Swapper es tu juego.\n\n\u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a [h3]7.5 / 10[/h3] \u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013959363\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013959593\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013959450\n=^._.^= \u222b", "timestamp_created": 1583358710, "timestamp_updated": 1583412294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625602185726165771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64425222": {"recommendationid": "64425222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038403647", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1583184084}, "language": "english", "review": "Good puzzles.

Much like \"Portal\" there is a single key mechanic that is fully explored and utilized throughout the entire game. And just like you had to \"start thinking with portals,\" you now must start thinking with the swapper.\n\n[b] Puzzles 9/10: [/b] Every puzzle requires the player to learn the mechanics of the titular swapper, and then experiment, and apply them in new ways. While only a couple of the puzzles near the end might be considered \"hard,\" frankly they are all incredibly well designed. The difficulty varies with your understanding. My only complaint is that I feel they could have been a bit more complex close to the end.\n\n[b] Story 6/10: [/b] The story is intriguing and does its best to shove science and philosophy together. I enjoyed it, but it's not very special.\n\n[b] Graphics 7/10: [/b] At first the textures look a bit odd, but they quickly grow on you, and suit the game's aesthetic very well. Platforms and effects also have pixel perfect hit-boxes, so a big plus there.\n\n[b] Sound 8/10: [/b] Every little noise and bit of music comes together to form a vaguely creepy, yet beautiful atmosphere. You really FEEL like you're in space. My only small issue is that airlocks sound like you're in water.\n\n[b] Voice Acting 5/10: [/b] It works well.\n\n[b] Good Design: [/b] Camera rotates with you in zero-g. Gravity is not constant through the entire space station. The map rotates as you do.\n\n[b] Design Issues: [/b] There are a few random areas where you cannot use your swapper, with no explanation. It can get rather tedious being slowed whenever you walk past certain objects.\n\n[b] Overall: 8/10 [/b] An extremely well-made puzzle game.\n[b] Personal Enjoyment: 9/10 [/b]\n\nClocking in at between 1 and 8 hours for a first play-through, I'd hesitate to say that this game is worth $15.

It was a puzzle game; you have to solve puzzles to literally move forwards.  Suddenly, there was a point at which I could not progress.  There is a place that appears to be the next puzzle, but I could not solve it.  (I think they put it there expressly to annoy people.)  [This is not a spoiler, because there is a gigantic arrow pointing to where you have to go.]  It turns out that you have to stand at a certain spot (not at that putative puzzle), marked with a gigantic arrow pointing upwards... and replicate yourself as high as possible, and then immediately replicate yourself upwards again... such that you end up standing on a ledge.  I felt deeply betrayed.  * Suddenly it is not a puzzle, but instead is about fast and accurate mouse movement -- that is, sheer dumb luck.  * You can not see the ledge you are aiming for, so you can not plan your mouse twitch (not to mention that fact that the whole screenful moves *continually during* [**continually during**] the manoeuvre).  * I imagine that the idea is that the character can see the ledge, but the player can not, so that is just insulting.  * You have to kill yourself repeatedly, trying to be lucky and get the right mouse twitch.  I never had any sense that there was any real skill involved; quite the opposite.  The game premise is that you (i.e. the game protagonist) are exploring, and have the swapper gadget; I can not imaging myself leaping blindly upwards, hypothetically killing myself repeatedly, with no hope of attaining the ledge except eventually absolutely by luck/accident.  There is no sense of achievement for the player in the real world; just the experience of multiple simulated suicides.  Call me strange, but I do not enjoy this.  \n\nI do not think there is any sense in which the thing counts as a puzzle.  (If they deleted the giant arrow, only some sort of obsessed manic would ever find out how to progress.  Indeed, a normal, rational person would put the same effort into solving the decoy non-puzzle.)  If it is the only such instance, then they should never have put it in... but I suspect that the whole game from then on is full of such achievementless non-puzzles.  I shall never know.  \n\nThis is not a puzzle game.  I would have asked for my money back, but I believe there is a 2-hour limit on that.  It feels strongly like the whole thing exists just to get you to the three hour mark before you realise that you were tricked out of your money.

I give it 4/6. It's not amazing, but pretty good. I didn't really understand the narrative of the story, but it seems my brain has a hard time following stories. I tend to focus on the puzzles. You are in space in a spacesuit and equipped with a tool: the swapper. With it you can make copies of your self and move ur 'soul' to one of the copies. You can maximum make 4 extra copies, for a total of 5. So the swapper tool can do these two things: make a new copy and change which copy you control. Additionally time slows down almost to a still when you make a copy, something you often have to make use of. In the puzzles there are lights that prevents the swapper gun from doing certain things. By placing clones of your self or boxes you can disable these lights. All the clones move identically when you move around.

The reason this rating of NOT recommend was due to their lack of post-production support (bug fixes/etc.). I am surprised they didn't fix a number of serious issues with the game even after players complaint about them. For examples: 1) The incompatibility issue at the beginning of the game (players should not have to troubleshoot the game) -- especially at the start of the game. Talking about the first impression is the lasting impression.. 2) After teleporting back to the ship, you can skip the \"moving the box\" puzzle#2 and go onto the next puzzle (the garden). Unfortunately, that will prevent you from finishing the game -- you will NOT be able to go back after your \"drop\" down to the Garden puzzle. 3) The Restore to Last Checkpoint does not resolve #2 issue.  4) There's no Save option.  The Save option would be a better option than the Restore to the Last Checkpoint and the multi-player options.  \n\nOverall the game could have been much better if the designers/develops spent more time testing the game and resolve major issues ASAP.

It had its fair share of the seemingly compulsory, nonsensical, indy-game, faux-philosophical, gibberish which is all too common in the medium (I'm beginning to think most indy-devs must be gibbering lunatics) but you can push past it without missing much...\n\n...the story has a twist, which is appreciated and while it won't knock your socks off, pleasingly it neatly ties a bow on the whole thing.\n\nAnother complaint I have is that I found the written dialogue and voice acting a little obnoxious at times. One of the hallmarks of good writing is being able to enjoy the antagonist and/or villain, but here I did kind of just actually end up feeling viscerally hostile towards and  irritated by the acting and the script...it's not really a great sign when you feel like shouting \"Oh shut up\" or less polite words to the effect of \"Go away\" at the screen...\n\n...for a prime example of what I'm talking about take a look at \"The Old City: Leviathon\" which, if not the quintessential indy-game for bloviated, nonsensical, wordsalad, philosophistry, is certainly a leading contender...\n\n...a little like having some gibbering lunatic follow you around trying to impart his worldview to you...I know that you could argue that this was the point with TOC:Leviathon but you could also argue that this kind of thing  feels like it's becoming almost mandatory for the genre:  it's unfortunate but verbal diarrhoea seems to have, if not a permanent home in, then a long lease on, the indy-game medium. \n\nIt might not be so bad if there were at least some internal logical consistency to any of the stuff, but for the most part it just sound like it's one bad re-write away from exquisite corpse.\n\nThe Swapper didn't have too much of this, but it certainly had it, and in a medium where this kind of  thing is all too common, a little bit wears out fast, and for a game with The Swappers' aesthetic it seems unnecessary and (apart from it being an indy-game) out of place.\n\nThis review might seem to be a little much for an indy-game with the scope, style and aesthetic of The Swapper but when you venture into such lofty territory as philosophies of mind, existentialism and the existence of the soul and with a treatment pretending to high-art (but with none of the subtlety) it does tend to invite criticism...\n\n...it's a cool little game...that's all it needed to be.", "timestamp_created": 1564703321, "timestamp_updated": 1564704674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54352474": {"recommendationid": "54352474", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986793861", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 652, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1564354160}, "language": "english", "review": "Note on a game breaking bug.

Some very interesting looking (organic looking for lack of a better word) texture work with good lighting give the space station a unique and very memorable atmosphere to the game.  I looked up the game and it turns out that the art in the game was not designed digitally.  Instead it was made from photographs of real life clay models that were made for the game.

These copies all move together as one.  The puzzles involve this mechanic as you try to collect orbs to progress.  There are various other mechanics that limit what can and can't be done in certain parts of a puzzle and even gravity changing parts.  It  plays well and the puzzles are just the right difficulty to keep things interesting.  Additionally, not every puzzle in an area is required to be completed to progress beyond to the next area.\n\nOn top of this is a fairly well done story about consciousness all set to a traditional disconcerting backdrop of a space station where once again humans have gotten carried away with doing experiments on things which they didn't understand resulting in a bad time for all.

When I first completed it, I kept thinking about the questions it asks for a few following days. I have a lot of sentiment for this game (mainly because when I finished it 4 years ago, it was my first 100%-ed Steam game), but even when I try to look at it more objectively, I still see a great experience I'd recommend to every sci-fi/puzzle game fan.\n\nThe titular \"swapper\" is a device with an appearance similar to Valve's portal gun that you find at the start your adventure and use through the entirety of it. The swapper has two functions: creating clones of its owner and [i]swapping[/i] their consciousness between the clones. This mechanic is a foundation both for the plot and for all of the game's puzzles.\n\nThe engrossing story is told mainly by text terminals and voiced radio transmissions as well as a few cutscenes.\n\nThe game is not a metroidvania, but its world is structured similarly to 2D Metroid games - you explore an abandoned space station divided into dozens of rooms connected by airlocks. Even though the space station is quite big, navigation is never a problem, since you always have a map of the explored area available upon pressing a button. All of the rooms containing puzzles are clearly marked and there is no item/ability requirement to solve them. All of the means and mechanics you need to know to solve every puzzle in the game are presented to you at the start of the game. The puzzles start out simple and have quite a linear difficulty curve throughout the entire game. The final ones are challenging but definitely doable if you spend some time on them. In my playthrough, I solved all but one of them on my own and only consulted a guide on the last one; but later I rather regretted doing it, since the solution was very logical and I could most likely have solved that puzzle on my own if I spent about 20 more minutes thinking about it.\n\n[h1] Achievement review [/h1]\nMy time to 100%: 7h\nEstimated time to 100%: 3-10h (depends on puzzle-solving skills, guide usage and reading through/skipping the text terminals)\n\n[b]Warning:[/b] all 10 achievements are missable\n\nThe achievement design of this game is pretty much my only complaint. First of all, the game has a Point of No Return with no clear warning. If you progress past a certain point near the end of the game without getting all of the achievements first, you will need another playthrough to get the missing ones. Second of all, the achievements are rewarded for finding 10 secret terminals hidden behind fake walls (or ceilings) at various locations throughout the game. Even though I knew about it before I started playing, I only found 3 or 4 of the terminals on my own. Technically, it would be possible to find all of them without consulting a guide, but you'd need to be on a constant lookout for these fake walls, which is just not fun.\n\n[h1] Suggested completion roadmap [/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] Play the game on your own until you reach the Point of No Return (PoNR). After acquiring all 124 of the collectible orbs, you'll get past the PoNR by pressing a special button you'll find on the space station near the end of the game. The button has a big label plate above it with an inscription suggesting that it's one of the final things you'll do on the station. You don't want to press this button before finding all of the secret terminals and getting all of the achievements. Here's an amazing, completely spoiler-free guide which will help with this task: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196319766]From I to X / Achievement Guide & spoilerless hints[/url]. Depending on your playstyle, you can either search for the terminals on your own and only use a guide once you reach the PoNR or just use the guide from the start.\n[*] After getting all of the achievements, just finish the game to see the conclusion of the story.\n[/olist]\n[quote] If you like what you've read and want to see more reviews like this one, please consider following my Steam curator :) [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1562426212, "timestamp_updated": 1562760598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626648128032684326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53538283": {"recommendationid": "53538283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018345716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1562256441}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome gem, if you are into puzzles and science fiction.", "timestamp_created": 1562257352, "timestamp_updated": 1562257352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53413385": {"recommendationid": "53413385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198877156302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1559498996}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a very fun game if you can actually get it started.

You are on a ship, overtaken by telephatic stones known as the \"Watchers\", and you seek a way out. You have a swapping device which you can use to create clones of yourself and swap between them.\n\nThat's the basic gameplay mechanic that never really changes, and I really wish they would've done more with it. The difficulty of the puzzles mainly comes from restricting colored beams. Red lets you create clones, but not swap to them. Blue lets you swap with clones, but not create them. Purple prevents you from doing either. So you try to juggle around with these beams in probably around 30 or so puzzles (it might have been less), getting progressively more difficult.\n\nNow, something the game does well, is atmosphere. The graphic style is interesting and very well done, and you really feel like you're on an abandoned, creepy space station. You want to press forward and explore the mystery fully - however, this is also where the game's biggest problems lie:\n\n[b]Creativity:[/b] As stated, the game mainly revolves around the basic mechanic of creating clones and swapping between them. Then there's the colored beams - and that's it. While the puzzles get progressively more difficult and they are never unsolveable, they are also not very creative by any stretch of the imagination, mostly because the basic gameplay loop is always the same and never expands like in other puzzle games (with new traps, mechanics etc.) The last few puzzles use a gravity switch, but other than that, nothing. The other problem is also that the game is very formulaic: To advance, you need a specific number of orbs to activate consoles that clear the way; so you go to a puzzle hub area, clear the 3 or 4 puzzles that are all in their own room, and then leave. There are pretty much never puzzles that you need to actually solve to clear the way in the first place, or to navigate the space station, or anything. You just solve the puzzles in their own rooms until you have enough orbs to get to the next rooms. Boring.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] While this could definitely be a \"me\"-problem, the story just didn't make sense to me. The more the game went on, the more it devolved into a story that tried to be way too deep for it's own good. They even had a good basic story there - like, what happens when you just endlessly create and kill clones of yourself just to advance? But that's sadly not where the story went, and in the end I was left a little confused. It seemed like a jumbled mess to me, and in an atmospheric puzzler, I would've liked to see it explained a bit better.\n\nOverall though, it's not a terrible game. If you have a few hours to kill, it provides some good brain training and the atmosphere is great. Sadly, I think there was much more that could've been done with the gameplay, though, and the story should've been a lot more clear.\n\nPersonal Rating: 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1558881036, "timestamp_updated": 1558881417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50833095": {"recommendationid": "50833095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038137144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1558294480}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice puzzle game.

Boy, am I glad I decided to give it a try! I enjoyed every aspect of this brilliant little game.\n\n[b]What is it?[/b]\nThe Swapper is a 2D puzzle-based platformer (with a much heavier accent on puzzle solving than actual platforming). It's a \"platformer\" in the same way Portal is a \"first-person action game.\" Unlike Portal, The Swapper's puzzles involve creating clones of yourself and strategically placing them around a room in order to reach a certain object.\nThe swapper device lets you switch between the clones that are in your line of vision, but the trick is that all the clones move synchronously. To make it more interesting, there are certain kinds of light that either block the swapping or do not let you create clones in their radius. Finally, there is a mechanic of changing the gravitational pull of your clones (kind of like in VVVVVV).\nAll in all, the difficulty of the puzzles is similar to Portal - some of them you pretty much solve as you go, while others might give you pause and make you go \"huh!\" until you figure them out. Pretty light and casual, but still very satisfying.\n\n[b]What's so cool about it?[/b]\nNow, clever puzzles is not what made this game stand out for me. It's The Swapper's amazing aesthetic, atmosphere, and story. In terms of visuals and audio The Swapper is very in tune with LIMBO. These two games share the same sort of muted beauty that perfectly fits their melancholic tone. Coincidentally, the physics of character's movement are also very similar. As you explore the station solving puzzles and opening up new areas (almost in a metroidvania fashion), a very cool sci-fi story with a philosophical undertone unfolds around you, culminating with a tough decision you have to make in the very end. I love how the whole cloning mechanic feeds into the story.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nThe Swapper combines brilliant 2D puzzles with a beautiful ambient environment and a neat story, and does not overstay its welcome.", "timestamp_created": 1554289972, "timestamp_updated": 1554289972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549283921718597412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49912952": {"recommendationid": "49912952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 1832, "num_reviews": 4460, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1554220329}, "language": "english", "review": "Tags: Platformer\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: First and foremost a puzzle game which becomes increasingly difficult as you progress.

The gameplay of The Swapper is easy to grasp, but it is  cleverly pushed to the point of creating challenging, yet deeply satisfying physics based puzzles. The Swapper combines its ingenious puzzle mechanics with a dark sci fi story, a gorgeous, creepy atmosphere, and plenty of mysteries that slowly unravel over the course of its all too brief six hour campaign.\n\nIn The Swapper you are tasked with exploring an abandoned space station and find out what happened to its crew while trying to escape yourself. The game is mostly a puzzler, with Metroidvania elements thrown in. The main gimmick revolves around the use of the \u201cswapper\u201d device, which gives you the ability to create up to four clones and then transfer your consciousness between them. However, each clone follows the same movement as the one you are currently inhabiting. If you move right, all your clones move right, if you jump, all your clones jump, etc. In this way it almost feels like you are remotely controlling your clones, which can feel clumsy at first, but soon you learn to master the system and manipulate it to accomplish your goals.\n\nLike other art house platformers and sci fi before it, The Swapper asks some deep, philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, the soul, what it means to be alive, and what it means to kill. Like its ancestors Metroid and System Shock before it, you\u2019ll read logs detailing the events that led up the space station\u2019s demise, slowly unveiling a horrifying fate. While the setting is classic science fiction, the themes are very human - greed, quest for knowledge, and the dangers of exploration and conquest form a cautionary tale. While the game certainly has some  cliches, its primary threat certainly subverts the genre and its final reveal is both shocking and believable, building from the mechanics of the game itself and the questions asked along the way.\n\nWhile The Swapper may look like a classic metroidvania on the surface, it lacks a few staples of the genre. There are no enemies to fight, (mostly no) upgrades to acquire, and not much backtracking to be done. While you do explore and slowly uncover a large map, the gameplay almost exclusively revolves around its ingenious puzzles. The goal of each puzzle is simple - touch an orb with the clone you are currently inhabiting. Collect enough orbs and you are able to progress deeper into the space station. New puzzle elements are introduced over the adventure which increase their complexity and difficulty while keeping the player interested. This includes classic devices such as switches and blocks as well as more unique elements like areas that block your swapper and areas that switch the pull of gravity. And if you happen to be stuck on one particular puzzle, you usually have the ability to move on to other ones and come back later.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are some of the best in the platformer genre, often testing your spacial awareness, planning, and problem solving. Balancing the actions of four clones can be quite a bit to process, as getting one clone to do what you want often results in another clone falling to his death. However, the difficulty curve is nearly perfect, as the first couple of puzzles are nice and easy and slowly introduce you to the game\u2019s mechanics. By the end of the game, the puzzles will require your logic and deduction skills to be on full throttle.\n\nMy only issue with some puzzles was that a few seemed to rely on very precise maneuvering, almost down to the pixel. In a few instances I thought a solution didn\u2019t work, but it turned out I just needed to stand in exactly the right location, aim my swapper in this other precise spot, etc. In a game like this, I\u2019d rather spend more of my time figuring out the big picture solutions rather than fine tweaking my reticle. Fortunately, this didn\u2019t happen often and didn\u2019t hamper my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nNone of the puzzles, even the ones at the very end, felt unfair. I never found myself needing to lookup solutions and I found my progress to be slow and steady until I knew exactly how, when, and where to setup all my clones. And when you finally do solve a tough puzzle, it really feels like each clone is part of a larger machine, doing its part in harmony with the other clones to reveal the solution.\n\nThe art style and sound design in The Swapper is superb. The visuals definitely took inspiration from other deep space horror franchises like Alien, with dark corridors connecting abandoned labs now overgrown from their neglect. Dim, flickering lighting amplifies the mystery and dread of the station as you feel a constant sense of isolation. The characters and models have a distinctly clay feel, and while claymation is often associated with old christmas specials, it doesn\u2019t detract from the game\u2019s creepy atmosphere. You truly feel like you are far from home, and while there are no obvious and immediate threats, you don\u2019t feel safe. There is the ever lingering feeling that whatever killed the people aboard the station is still out there, watching and waiting. The music is mostly Brian Eno style ambient, with gentle effects used for things like orb collection or swapper use. While it definitely captures the loneliness and permanence of space, the music certainly could have gone in a more horror centric direction. I assume the designers chose not to pursue this avenue because they didn\u2019t want the player to be too stressed. Perhaps the best moment of sound design is the choice to use none at all - whenever you leave the station and are floating through space, the music stops all together, perfectly encapsulating the infinite void that is space. But lack of scary music aside, it is a beautiful soundtrack you could get lost in while wrapping your mind around the game\u2019s intricate puzzles.\n\nThe Swapper is the perfect marriage of atmosphere, plot, and mind bending puzzles. While the setup is familiar, the payoff is far from it. This is a game that makes you think - not just about the challenging puzzles, but about some of life\u2019s biggest questions: what is the soul, what is life, what is consciousness. You won\u2019t kill a single enemy or do much of any platforming, but if you love physics puzzlers and great science fiction, you\u2019ll love The Swapper.\n\n9.1/10", "timestamp_created": 1544119254, "timestamp_updated": 1544119254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47295168": {"recommendationid": "47295168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160415767", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 449, "last_played": 1543945463}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 piece of art.\n", "timestamp_created": 1543946745, "timestamp_updated": 1543946745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566502928733825684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47271963": {"recommendationid": "47271963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298254259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1543591885}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVE the art.

The ratings were in the end the deciding factor, so let me return the favor.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is at its core a puzzle game which has a \"metroidvania\" exploration vibe to it. By solving different puzzles you will progress further and use portals to navigate through the map. The core mechanics of the gameplay is creating clones which you can switch between \"Swap\" and even slow down time to make precision swapping possible. Each clone is expendabel and you really never have a true dedicated body. That is of course only half true as when you occupy a body, can die from fall damage etc. You could by this logic try to explain it all by saying that swapping means transferring your concious, allthough that is not the \"real\" truth.\n\nThere is a set amount of clones that can be there at the same time. They disappear if they die by fall damage or mechanics etc. another way is simply going through the clones with the clone you currently occupy which makes every clone it touches disappear. The tricky part is that while you only \"truly\" ocupy one you still jump or move all the clones at the same time. This together with the different mechanics is what makes the puzzles interesting.\n\nI do not think that any of the puzzles were \"too difficult\". The hard part about the game is exploration. I had a hard time making myself play this game, so I used a guide. The puzzles I did on my own beacuse that was what was the fun part for me, but the 10 achievements... I would probably have found [u]one[/u] at best. Given that, I would say that there is fun for both those who like exploration aswell as the \"brain-teasing\" puzzles with minor platforming, who do not want to bother with the exploration part. Depending on who you are, decide if a guide is for you or not. \n\n[h1]Other parts[/h1]\nThe setting of the game is facinating! The graphic is clear and nice to look at while the atmosphere of space and the station? is mysterious. The atmosphere together with the graphics, the mechanics, the story and controls all make \"The Swapper\" into a unique game through the quality of all parts. The most memorable part would be the story, atmosphere and the [b]Swapping[/b] of course. I must admit that I need to replay and better study the story as I was tired when I rushed through the game. Especially since the ending peaked my interest a bit.\n\n[h1]To Conclude[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Puzzlegame\n[*] Exploration\n[*] Mysterious\n[*] Nice gameplay with satisfying mechanics\n[*] 10 achievments (hard to find)\n[*] Can be finished around 5 hours with guide and solving puzzles without help\n[*] Great immersive environment\n[*] Fantastic atmosphere with stunning graphics\n[*] High quality in all aspects\n[*] Great story\n[*] -Might be unappealing to those who like a more direct approach without to much exploring or navigating where you are.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a very well made game which shines with its unique vibe of high quality and ingenuity. For me the exploration was a bit of a hinder but could still be a very enjoyable experience by having a guide \"holding my hand\" throughout the game. As said before the achievement (secrets) are very well hidden and none of the puzzles felt too hard. You might get stuck sometimes but in the end it is not that complicated and gives you a good \"brain-tease\".\nI bought it at a sale for [u]2,65\u20ac[/u] which was well worth it. I have no idea how long this game will take to fully complete without a guide, so I will not say that it is a too short game.\nI will say however that I can really [b]recommend it[/b] if you like me, like puzzles with some engaging gameplay. It might be well worth it at full price for those in it for the story and the exploration in my opinion.\n\n\n[b]//ECE//[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1541862080, "timestamp_updated": 1541862349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629364371299743652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45715421": {"recommendationid": "45715421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079357653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1562070325}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my fav games :)\n\nGood job", "timestamp_created": 1541741555, "timestamp_updated": 1541741555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45714352": {"recommendationid": "45714352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044470631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1541735736}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good puzzle game.

They start off very simple, but increase in difficulty perfectly, with the last few requiring a good night's rest to figure out. I have to say that for a few of them I felt like I may have solved it incorrectly, but I'm not sure.\nThe ramping is nice, out of the about 30 puzzles, every 10 or so adds a new twist so they never get boring.\n\nThe story, however good, pales in comparison to the other assets of The Swapper. I found it to be thought provoking, but bordering on pretentious at times. Also, many characters sound alike (this is done for a reason) so play with subtitles, or trhe story won't make much sense. One annoyance of mine is that there's multiple endings, but each one requires a full playthrough of the campaign. This doesn't really matter too much, though, because you can just look up the other endings if you don't want to replay the entire 4-5 hour game (although admittedly the second time should be much faster).\n\nIf you've played Little Big Planet, then The Swapper should look familiar. The same style of animation and environmental construction is used, but in different ways. This makes the graphics, in my opinion, one of the best I've seen in a 2D game.\n\nThe music is simple, but it gets the job done. Spooky? Long stretched out violin-ish sounds. Sad? Soft ambient piano. Each soundtrack adds so much to the immersion and ambience of the whole experience, and I would reccomend a good set of speakers to get the full low-end range.\n\nSo, is The Swapper the right game for you?

Obviously as the title suggests, the game is all about swapping to get where you need to go. It's as simple as that. Since the game mechanics are pretty straight forward, I wont talk much about that here in this review. Youtube the game and you should rather quickly get a feel for the game.\n\nAs for if you like it or not, depends, this is a thinking wo/mans game. This game is bound to give you quite some headaches, but in a positive way, the way that puzzles usually do. And its quite exciting to solve these puzzles. \n\nBut unlike many puzzlers, this is one of those that no more than maybe 2 or 3 of them really need youtubing to solve, or you do it like me, go nuts, go raging, screaming and yelling and spending more than 15 hours in the game to come up with a solution.\n\nSome puzzles are easier and some are harder, the puzzles doesn't always get harder as you advance in the game, which is a nice thing, this keeps things flowing rather smoothly, and you can try different puzzles and get back to harder ones at a later time.\n\nAnd let me tell you, even the hardest ones, are doable, I did them without Youtubing, and let me tell you, I ain't no genius, so, if I did it, so can you. However, I have tried to playthrough this game on 2-3 different occasions because of the rage when you plateau and can't really find the solution, but I didn't Youtube the solutions still, instead started from the beginning every time. It has been over 2 years that on and off (just for the I did tell you so)\n\nLet me commend something about this fantastic game, the aesthetics of is out of this world. The music, the sound effects, the controls, the graphics, its all there and then some. The graphics are absolutely brilliant, seriously, they are nothing short of amazing, second to none, and so on. Just watch the trailer and tell me you are not amazed about what they have accomplished. And regarding the sound, it is spot on as well, blending in perfectly, and the narrative voice that gives you little pieces of the story, is absolutely perfect.\n\nThe game also lets you roam around freely and just discover things, however not like an open world RPG this is strictly mission driven. The game has smartly placed portals, so you don't have to do any unnecessary backtracking or going back and forth between puzzles if/when you like. That can be a real tedious task in a lot of game. If you want, you can \"swap\" or run to the other end of the level or just teleport nearby to the action. In that sense you are free by choice to get where you need to go as you please G-R-E-A-T!\n\nI guess by now you know where I am going with this... You have to get yourself this game, it will be entertaining all the way through whilst you play, beside one or two of the complex puzzles. Are you one of these smart thinkers, then you can run it through in 2-5 hours, but that is money well worth spending. I would say around 10$-15$ is a great price for a great game, and if you can get it cheaper all the better. You won't be disappointed.\n\nBut just don't expect too much of the game either, what you see is what you basically get throughout the game. If you have doubts, my recommendation is play it rather than not.\n\nOh, and a final PS. There are only four clones of yourselves that you can make, which will be given to you immediately when you start the game, so you can't upgrade your skills or get anymore more clones, just in case if you ever have a doubt about during one of the puzzles when you are raging. :)", "timestamp_created": 1533489759, "timestamp_updated": 1533489974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564810037612915039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43868182": {"recommendationid": "43868182", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986467745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1533105432}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid puzzle-platformer.

Often the solution was the exact one I was trying except I had my angle slightly off. There was even one puzzle that required you to be so precise that I had to switch to mouse and keyboard just to solve that one.\n\n4/5\n\nAside from my frustration the story was captivating and most of the puzzles didn't overstay their welcome.

Everyone needs to play this game at some point but 6 hours of gameplay isn't worth a full $15 in my opinion.\n\nEDIT: I realized the portion where I had to switch to mouse and keyboard was because the guide wasn't using the proper solutions.

What's great is that, 5 minutes into the game, you will have all the abilities you will use for the rest of the game firmly in your pocket. From then on, it's all about learning to use your powers and your knowledge of the game's mechanics. To me, that is a sign of a great, self-contained puzzle game.\n\nThe game also conceals a surprisingly eerie and philosophical story that I felt was executed VERY well (I recommend turning on subtitles - it will help you intuit more of the story from the game's dialogue.) The story is told through brief text logs and bits of dialogue, with a couple short cutscenes. I felt like it was paced well, and with a couple of excellent twists toward the end! \n\nThe desire to reach the conclusion definitely gave me motivation to finish the last of the game's puzzles - some of which are downright devillish! I actually took a few breaks from the game to let my mind relax, and found that approaching tough puzzles with a fresh frame of mind really helped. Like any great puzzle game, the sense of satisfaction when you FINALLY pick apart a tricky challenge is IMMENSE. Overall, it is a pretty short game; it took me 6.5 hours to complete the game (including all puzzles), but it felt like more than that because of how much thought I put into that time!\n\nThe art style felt a little odd at first, but ended up suiting the game's presentation well in my opinion. The music is minimalist and ambient - not very memorable, but undeniably great for puzzle solving. I will say that the rest of the sound design felt crisp and excellent, though.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this, even as someone who doesn't often play puzzle games.

Easily 10-20 hours gameplay without walkthroughs.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 10/10[/b]\n\nThe central conceit of the game, if you've seen the trailer, is the titular Swapper gun, which allows you to summon up to 4 clones of yourself, then swap between the clones to set a particular one as the \"Primary\". This is significant because only the Primary clone can collect the game's main objective: Orbs, the reward for completing each puzzle room.\n\nAt the start of the game, where a simple series of switches, walls and platforms are the only obstacles, this is relatively straightforward and a room might only take a minute or so. By the end, when swap-free and drop-free zones, gravity reversal zones, blocks and crusher traps come into play, you will probably be sleeping overnight on some of the solutions, after bashing into the problem again and again and again in the best puzzler tradition.\n\nThe controls are very tightly programmed (I played on pad), and there is a convenient slow-motion mode engaged whenever you position to drop a clone, so arcade-level reflexes are not required to enjoy the game.\n\n[b]Graphics: 6/10[/b] The indie production values show here, but I do appreciate all of Facepunch's artistic choices vis-a-vis lighting and background design. It won't make your eyes bleed. Resolution switching works well (I played at 1920x1200).\n\n[b]Sound: 9/10[/b] Excellent score, great use of ambient effects and some really good voice acting as well for the audio recordings you'll find scattered along the way. If you do have a decent speaker set, some of the low-frequency effects are a delightful bassplosion.\n\n[b]Story: 8/10[/b] I won't spoil anything here, but if you enjoy movies like [i]Alien[/i], [i]Invasion of the Body Snatchers[/i] and [i]The Thing[/i], you'll appreciate the delightful horrific touches in the atmosphere the game provides. If you like fiction by the classic sci-fi authors like Aasimov, Pohl and Clarke, you'll likely appreciate the very nicely put-together story, told very sparingly via found audio, text fragments and the fleetingly occasional cut-scene.\n\n[b]Overall: 9/10[/b] I actually bought this in a 2014 Steam sale, got stuck at a early-level room, then set it aside for a few years.

Beginning puzzles are good, the lonesome eerie atmosphere and sense of mystery carry the game well initially. Little snippets of dialog are delivered after every puzzle and sometimes when exploring but they never really relate to much and are more philosophy 101 waxing about the soul and what defines \"you\" etc. \n\nThe problems arise when the game starts throwing hard puzzles at you, which don't have any hinting or foreshadowing at how to solve them, you just have to sort of try everything until it clicks, meanwhile the story doesn't really ramp at all, things are still hazy as ever and the once lonesome isolated atmosphere turns into a bunch of barren empty environments. When finishing a puzzle you get these orbs that unlock doors or interface with terminals, but it's never really anything of consequence, it's just a McGuffin that allows you to proceed, might as well have been stars from a Mario game, I don't see why individual scenarios involving power/oxygen/water/electricity couldn't have been involved to give the game some grounding, why on earth are there just random orbs everywhere?\n\nThere are also sections of the game where you have to leave the airlock, these sections have no gravity, and don't really serve a purpose. There are no objects in the way, the camera and your characters sense of inertia is disorienting (probably intentional) and your swapper is disabled. These honestly felt like they were there to break up the monotony of empty rooms but empty disorienting space isn't much of a step up. \n\nThe dialog stays obtuse late into the game and playing starts to feel like work instead of being enjoyable as there is little to no sense of progress or really any reason to care besides the sense of mystery. I thought to myself \"Do I really want to struggle through this puzzle to get a few lines of dialog?\" That is when I decided I had enough.\n\nAlthough the art style was great I feel they focused too little on the meat of the game, the scenarios, the level design and layout and the context to all the puzzles.

The challenges vary significantly in difficult, even until the very end. Sometimes the puzzles require several precise combinations of clones, positions, and swaps, and sometimes it's plainly obvious from glance, requiring one one or two steps. As this is core gameplay, I would have liked to have seen longer, more tiered challenges, as opposed to a collection of small challenges.\n\nVisually, the game has an almost \"hand made\" appearance. While this is creative and well executed, it left me wanting for more polish. The visual artists were able to craft something so interesting and, in many cases, stunning, yet the final steps of cleaning up animations (specifically movement transitions) were completely overlooked.\n\nFinally, the story. I can't say I was impressed, but largely because I just didn't understand it. You get the sense of some sort of meaning or driving purpose, but the big picture is largely obscured by often difficult-to-hear voice acting and fragmented delivery. In fact, most of the challenges (collecting orbs, opening orb-locked gates) are never even addressed! Does this ship just leave orbs everywhere in case they need to operate? Why is it when you swap your clone lives and copies you, but when story characters swap the old body dies? It's all very convoluted to me, which is a shame, because from what I've read online is that it's a very interesting story.\n\nAll-in-all not a bad game, specifically if you like puzzle platformers. If you're looking for the story though, you may want to read up on it after.

Each puzzle's goal is to collect an Orb, and your obstacles are 3 colours of light - purple, red, and blue. (No point in explaining each function of these colours, much easier to play the game to understand.) The challenge each puzzle offers slowly increases as you progress further through the ship, so it never catches you by surprise. You don't need to collect every Orb before each milestone to progress, but you do need to collect all 124 Orbs (not individual Orbs - after a while they're collected in sets of 3, then sets of 9) to unlock the ending, so you may as do each puzzle while you're still close to them.\n\nAs for the story, you start off ejected from an unknown ship/station in an escape pod, implied to have happened against your will (from the way the character is flailing at the window), and you crash-land on a planet (Chori V) where you find a teleport to a space station, the Theseus. You make your way through the ship, at points coming close to somebody else who seems to be partly talking to you and partly to themself (I recommend turning on subtitles as it may help illuminate you more during these bits). As you travel, you piece together what happened before you arrived, from both sides of the story.\n\nNow, I won't pretend to be a philosopher or intellectual and say this was 2deep4me (or u), but this game has definitely been more memorable to me than other puzzle games I've played, because transhumanism is one of my favourite aspects of science fiction, and both the mechanics and story revolve around it very heavily. As the player in any game, you're expected to take the game as it is, and not think about the bodies you leave behind, or strand in midair to fall to their deaths, or disintegrate to clean up any mess you'd leave behind. Instead, the story instead shows the perspective of the scientists behind the technology, who disagree over the ethics of using the Swapper but can agree they would do whatever it took to survive and retain their own identities. There are 2 crucial moments, one being 2/3 through the game, and is taken from you and is ultimately a decoy, and a second one at the end of the game where you make a decision, on your (personal) stance. Having only chosen one ending, I don't know what would've happened if I had chosen the other, but I found the final scene moving in the best way. The entire game was hauntingly amazing.\n\nBottom line, I would recommend this to anyone who likes good puzzle games with great story.", "timestamp_created": 1527635769, "timestamp_updated": 1527635769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561269044876098633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42268528": {"recommendationid": "42268528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014526826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1593402277}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging puzzles: check\nClaustrophobic, isolating atmosphere: check\nSubtle and thought-provoking story that integrates perfectly with gameplay: check\nBeautiful clay-modelled environments that scale to any resolution: check\nThe ability to create and murder infinite clones of yourself: checkerino\n\nOne of the best games I have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1527313751, "timestamp_updated": 1527313751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42261864": {"recommendationid": "42261864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348368433", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1537659053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pues me gusto el juego...\npero hay un error que no te deja mover el mouse, que arruina la experiencia.", "timestamp_created": 1527292872, "timestamp_updated": 1527292872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42186112": {"recommendationid": "42186112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083958830", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1412388623}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1527034703, "timestamp_updated": 1527034703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42170901": {"recommendationid": "42170901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004565666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1523585752}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good, very pretty puzzle game.

You will have to rethink them a few times before you get them - some of the answers eluded me, and I had to look them up, to my eternal shame. The answers were obvious if I'd looked at it another way! \n\n2)The mechanics work well, movement feels good. I played with a gamepad, which I hated initially but loved when I got used to it. Very easy to control, swapping and cloning mechanics were superb.\n\n3)Atmosphere! Holy shit! Traversing the space station is special - each atmosphere is different and has great music to set the stage. The free floating areas really hit me hard with letting you know how alone you are.\n\n4) The story is interesting and builds slowly without being too cryptic and fake-deep, like many games I've been playing lately (Hollow Knight - I'm looking at you)\n\n5) The art works extremely well even though it might be silly looking in full light, the models are kind of clunky but they contribute to the atmosphere perfectly and add a charm that a fully digital game wouldn't have.

En este aspecto, The Swapper merece la pena, y mucho, ser probado.\n\nPero nada de esto se explicar\u00eda con la misma eficacia si no contara por detr\u00e1s con un s\u00f3lido apartado de dise\u00f1o, del cual, The Swapper, va sobrado. Tanto es as\u00ed que creo que es uno de los \u00faltimos t\u00edtulos que he jugado que atmosf\u00e9ricamente hablando m\u00e1s me han impactado. Y es que nada m\u00e1s comenzar ya sorprende gr\u00e1ficamente con su construcci\u00f3n en base al modelado en plastilina, pero adem\u00e1s lo refuerza con un fant\u00e1stico uso de la luz y de los efectos atmosf\u00e9ricos, traslad\u00e1ndonos por completo a los confines del universo donde transcurre la trama y a expresar a la perfecci\u00f3n la sensaci\u00f3n de soledad e incluso de terror a la que llega sin ser un juego en absoluto de este g\u00e9nero. \n\nDe igual forma, el sonido juega tambi\u00e9n un papel esencial en la creaci\u00f3n de la atm\u00f3sfera de The Swapper, presentando un continuado uso de los efectos ambientales que enfatizar\u00e1n esa ya mencionada sensaci\u00f3n de soledad y que ser\u00edan ya suficientes para acompa\u00f1ar la propuesta de este videojuego. Pero en ning\u00fan caso se puede obviar el fant\u00e1stico uso de las melod\u00edas escogidas para momentos puntuales, puesto que su minimalismo, tranquilidad y belleza no supone impedimento alguno para enfatizar a\u00fan m\u00e1s el aislamiento y la tensi\u00f3n frente a lo desconocido.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, la jugabilidad de The Swapper se basa en mec\u00e1nicas de puzles, tendiendo que hacer uso del \"Swapper\" para utilizar nuestros clones a nuestro favor o intercambiarnos con ellos para activar interruptores o alcanzar zonas que nos permitan continuar avanzando por un mapa de estilo \"metroidvania\" pero que, una vez m\u00e1s, tampoco tiene nada que ver con este g\u00e9nero. En este aspecto, y aunque en realidad propone algo diferente, me ha recordado mucho al estilo de la saga Portal, lo cual no es sino una fant\u00e1stica noticia para los amantes de los juegos de rompecabezas; y recalco rompecabezas puesto que, sin llegar a ser desesperante (aunque en los \u00faltimos compases del juego est\u00e9 al l\u00edmite de ello), nos pondr\u00e1 a prueba constantemente con escenarios cada vez m\u00e1s complejos y en los que tendremos que utilizar nuestros clones con inteligencia y habilidad, midiendo distancias y \"timing\" a partes iguales. Realmente al final se trata de un proceso de prueba y error, tras el cual daremos necesariamente con la soluci\u00f3n, pero en el camino nos daremos cuenta de lo gratificante que en todo momento resulta su resoluci\u00f3n. Lo cierto es que The Swapper es un juego agradable de jugar, que podremos llevar a nuestro ritmo y en el que, aun existiendo ciertos peligros, en ning\u00fan momento nos sentiremos acechados por enemigos que rompan la tranquilidad atmosf\u00e9rica lograda.\n\nResumiendo, pienso que, desde el punto de vista de la jugabilidad, The Swapper ya es una compra obligada para cualquier amante de los juegos de rompecabezas, pero si adem\u00e1s a esto se le a\u00f1ade un dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico y ambiental sublime y una s\u00f3lida trama interplanetariamente existencialista, poco margen queda para que no se le pueda dar una oportunidad a esta peque\u00f1a joya en forma de videojuego.", "timestamp_created": 1520252559, "timestamp_updated": 1537461201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40573967": {"recommendationid": "40573967", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999637285", "num_games_owned": 821, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1520201646}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing game.

At time of writing, that's eleven hours. I don't have much to say beyond \"[b]it's fun, the story's good, and it's worth the standard price[/b]\", but to elaborate a little:\n\nIt took about seven hours to complete the first time through, and none of the puzzles are optional. They also don't need to be. For all save one (the same puzzle most players seem to struggle with), I found the solution without any outside help. For that one problem puzzle, I had to look up a step-by-step guide.\n\nI'd say most puzzles are genuinely challenging, but not truly fiendish. Don't sit and stare at them, the best way to figure them out is to just keep failing. It's always possible to just reset if you need to. If you're [i]really[/i] stuck, just leave and come back later. The game's relatively free-roam and you usually can leave a given puzzle until later if you want to.\n\nI'm not going to give away anything about the story, except that it was deeper than I expected.

[b]Concepto sencillo, eficaz y muy bien llevado[/b]. De por si la idea de poder colocar cierta cantidad de clones en cualquier lugar que este al alcance de nuestra vista y que podamos intercambiarnos con estos, abre la puerta a un mont\u00f3n de posibilidades.\n\n    [*]Utilizando el concepto anterior mencionado, hace que tenga unos [b]puzles muy divertidos a la vez que desafiantes[/b]. Como en cualquier juego de este tipo, los primeros puzles son sencillos para que el jugador se vaya adaptando a la mec\u00e1nica principal, pero a medida que vamos a avanzando la cosa se va complicando y [b]no se vuelve repetitivo[/b] ya que se van agregando nuevos obst\u00e1culos (como luces que no permiten intercambiar o clonar en ciertas zonas).\n\n    [*][b]Excelente historia[/b], en principio no le preste atenci\u00f3n a la historia porque me pareci\u00f3 que era mucho texto y que no valdr\u00eda la pena, estaba muy errado en esto \u00faltimo. Cuando termine el juego estaba muy intrigado sobre la trama del mismo, asique busque acerca de esta. Recomiendo fuertemente prestarle atenci\u00f3n a la historia si se busca una muy buena. Al mismo tiempo se puede jugar tranquilamente sin tener que preocuparse por esta.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b] CONTRAS: [/b][/u]\n[list]\n    [*]Cinem\u00e1ticas, no s\u00e9 si es un bug o qu\u00e9, pero las [b]cinem\u00e1ticas duran demasiado y no muestran mucho[/b], literal por momentos pensaba que se me hab\u00eda parado el juego, pero no era el caso ya que pod\u00eda mover el personaje a mi antojo. No es un problema muy grande pero es bastante molesto.\n    [*][b]Demasiado texto para estar al tanto de la historia[/b], como dije antes, el principal motivo por el cual al comienzo del juego no me interese por la historia fue por la cantidad de texto, que desgraciadamente para muchos [b]est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s[/b].

I was very impressed with this game (and I am not that easily impressed when it comes to things other than coffee or pizza).  Puzzle-based games seem very very difficult to execute successfully, in my opinion--I've seen many a well-thought-out puzzle game start strong and then fall victim to redundancy rather quickly (Talos Principle, anyone?).  This game was just long enough to be satisfying but without dragging on to the point of becoming tiresome.  The story was understated but still fascinating.  This one is a headache, but in a very good way.\n\nWhat I appreciated most about The Swapper was the way it didn't just hand me everything I needed to be successful.  When a new mechanic was introduced, the game didn't go all tutorial, it forced me to learn by doing, by experimenting with this new device I've just discovered, much like one would be forced to do in real life.  As such, the game was very immersive.  On the whole, the puzzles were challenging, occasionally frustrating, but far from impossible.  They took a little juggling, a little concentration, but I only felt hopelessly stuck a few times, and mostly this was due to overcomplicating matters.  On a few occasions I actually laughed at how simple the solution to a seemingly complicated situation really was.  Controls felt a bit clumsy at first but quickly became intuitive.  Graphics make for a bit of eye strain, but fit the atmosphere.  Music is haunting and absolutely spot-on.\n\nI really did love the story; even if the gameplay lacked it would have made the game enjoyable regardless.  Pretty critical points are touched upon, in particular the true nature of identity, but it presents its philosophies subtly and without being preachy, which is always a nice touch.  If you let it sink in, this one will stick with you for a bit after you finish playing it, but you'll be happy to have it there.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511994727, "timestamp_updated": 1511994727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37911950": {"recommendationid": "37911950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112435564", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1511902459}, "language": "english", "review": "ugh.... this game feels really boring. also I couldn't turn off the film grain effect.\n\nI can expect the rest of the game keeps repeating the same sort of puzzles i've seen in the first half of an hour.

I avoided it because I thought it's was one of those games that was popular because of it's aesthetic, looks and atmosphere rather than actually good quality puzzles and a challenging experience. I was so so wrong.\n\nEverything they say is true. Read the other reviews, all the good stuff has been said. Read the critics reviews, they're spot on. And read the 'about' section in the middle of the store page.\n\n[b]TL;DR -[/b]\n[u]My rating:[/u] 5 glowing space orbs out of 5. (See below for explanation.)\n\n\n[b][u]Review:[/u][/b]\n\nThe Swapper explores the iconic Theseus Paradox to it's fullest; how much can an object or, in this case, a person and their mind, change before they are no longer that same fundamental object or person.\n\nWhat is identity and how do we defiine it, by the whole or by components, by the mind or by the body, by memory or by an active working consciousness, must we be animate or inanimate and who decides what exactly defines activity or passivity (maybe rocks are a higher, more intelligent being than humans but we lack the ability to communicate together). Is the core of a person contained in some ethereal soul or is it something more, perhaps it is something less.\n\nThrough the philosophical narrative within, The Swapper leads also to an existentialist exploration of the mind and body, yet I can't tell if the argument is pro 'existence precedes essence' or con 'essence precedes existence'. If we define ourselves by our ability to think and remember, a la Descartes, perhaps The Swapper is just a test to discover whether we are real. Whatever the answer, Sartre and indeed Aristotle would have enjoyed this.\n\nThe IGN review sums it up best for me:\n\n[quote=IGN]The Swapper tempted me with ingenious puzzles, transported me to a fully realized science-fiction world, and made me ask questions about mortality and morality that few video games have ever dared to explore. \nVery few puzzle games have ever managed to marry impeccable challenges with a mature storytelling quite like this \u2013 there's no fluff or extraneous content here, only a prime example of how to create a tight, unforgettable gaming experience.\u201d\n9.3 \u2013 IGN\t[/quote]\n\n[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]\n\n[u]Difficulty[/u] ranges from easy to 'kinda hard'. This is a puzzle game, it needs a bit of logic and foresight to complete. If you can do the easy puzzles near the start you can do the rest - but it may require some patience. This took me 5 hours to complete. Some people say they finished in an hour or so, some people say longer. It just depends. I needed a walkthrough a couple of times but that didn't negatively impact the experience of the game. Nothing was ridiculously hard and there were none of those fake difficulty tricks so many devs like to throw in these days. You will [i]not[/i] get frustrated or shirty with The Swapper. The achievements are for hidden areas, but the hidden stuff are not crucial or even relevant to completion of the game, they do add reams to the story though.\n\n[u]Movement[/u] is easy, never clunky, never laggy or glitchy. All areas are clearly defined and there are no places to clip through walls or get stuck or any of that nonsense. Also, there is an awesome in-game map which displays everything you need to collect or see. SImply go to an area and it will 'reveal'.\n\nWSAD or \u2191 \u2193 \u2192 \u2190 to move & LMB / RMB to swap and clone. Q for map. E to interact. F for 'log book'.\n\n[u]Aesthetic[/u] of The Swapper is central to creating a fully immersive experience in the desolate Theseus space station. The ambient soundtrack is amazing, from the sound of the overhead lights flickering to the noise of air rushing through the empty station corridors. There are many ambient sounds and sound textures used in The Swapper, put on some headphones, close your eyes and you might as well be floating out in space, [u][url=http://youtu.be/at3RXrUwMGg]a trillion miles from anyone[/url][/u].\nThe artwork is amazing, this was made using clay models. What can I say, The Swapper is beautiful and nightmarish. Have a look through the store page pictures and video. I cannot fault it.\n\n[u]Honestly[/u], I can't fault this game at [i]all[/i]. I had no issues, except my own lack of ability on three separate occasions when I was impatient and used a walkthrough.

I bought it not really knowing it was a puzzle game (not my favourite genre) but I was hooked from the moment I launched it.\n\nThings I Liked\n\n- The puzzles. Obviously this is the bulk of the entire game. Never too hard, never too easy. Although saying that, there was ONE puzzle I had to look up. :-) But thankfully a lot of other people struggled with this one too so I didn't beat myself up too much!\n\n- The atmosphere. Eerie, cold, dark and reminiscent of dead space without the jump scares/horror.\n\n- The lack of back tracking and very linear progress. When I first realised that the game would be made up of one giant area to explore I worried that there would be much confusing backtracking. But no, although there is a little backtracking, it's very easy to navigate from one area to the next.\n\nThing I Didn't Like\n\n- The graphics were a little bit blurry. Not a massive deal but noticable.\n\n- The voice actors sounded identical. Especially the women. This made it hard to follow the plot.\n\n- The story itself was not anything special. I was definitely playing for the puzzles alone.\n\n- Not much replayability factor.\n\n- The music was ok, but there was nowhere near enough of it.

No mucho despu\u00e9s de estos nombres, el t\u00edtulo que nos ocupa irrumpi\u00f3 sin hacer tanto esc\u00e1ndalo, pero con una calidad que no tiene mucho que envidiar a los mayores representantes del movimiento independiente. Ad\u00e9ntrate en Chori V.\n\nEl juego es una aventura de puzles espacial donde encarnando a un an\u00f3nimo astronauta tendremos que explorar una extra\u00f1a estaci\u00f3n aparentemente deshabitada. Al adentrarnos conseguiremos un aparato que tiene una habilidad sumamente peculiar: nos permite clonarnos y traspasar nuestra conciencia a estas copias. Esta premisa ser\u00e1 la base del juego, ya que gracias a esta habilidad sortearemos obst\u00e1culos de todo tipo y resolveremos los distintos puzles que nos permitir\u00e1n avanzar por la estaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa estructura del escenario es muy \"metroidvania\", y visualmente es simplemente brutal. El juego de luces y el empleo crom\u00e1tico de colores no solo aporta un estilo visual precioso sino que adem\u00e1s incide en la jugabilidad del t\u00edtulo, ya que algunas fuentes de luz de distintos colores anular\u00e1n capacidades de nuestro \"intercambiador\" y complicar\u00e1 las cosas a la hora de resolver los distintos puzles que, en algunos casos, pueden llegar a desesperar. Aun con ello, el juego no es excesivamente largo, y se agradece para momentos en los que queramos una experiencia m\u00e1s breve entre juegos que resulten m\u00e1s largos. Sonoramente tambi\u00e9n hace empleo de melod\u00edas on\u00edricas y efectos atmosf\u00e9ricos que ambientan de forma \u00fanica este desolado escenario donde se desarrolla el juego.\n\nAlgo que tambi\u00e9n sorprende es la trama del conjunto, siendo una muy org\u00e1nica con el escenario y que se desvela en retazos sutiles y ocasionales di\u00e1logos o audios que nos va contando qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 en ese lugar, con un climax sorprendente y cierta profundidad filos\u00f3fica en su trasfondo. A pesar de esta inteegraci\u00f3n estrecha entre trama y juego, no todo en The Swapper resulta tan bien integrado, ya que encuentro que muchas de las habitaciones de puzles rompen la naturalidad de los entornos y se notan como \"puestos ah\u00ed\" como obst\u00e1culos arbitrarios. Tambi\u00e9n se pod\u00eda haber aprovechado que el conseguir los orbes que te permiten avanzar no fueran solo cuesti\u00f3n de resolver puzles, sino tambi\u00e9n potenciar la exploraci\u00f3n y otras facetas de habilidad, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la inclusi\u00f3n de elementos que enriquecen el juego como la gravedad cero o los portales entre otros.\n\nAun as\u00ed, hablamos de un t\u00edtulo que para unas pocas horas que te durar\u00e1, te propondr\u00e1 un conjunto de enigmas sesudos (y no solo en cuanto a puzles) e interesantes, en un escenario hermoso a la vez que t\u00e9trico y sus chispas de exploraci\u00f3n y desarrollo junto a su trama terminar\u00e1n de empujarte hasta el final, para saber qu\u00e9 ocurri\u00f3 en ese sitio y qu\u00e9 ocurrir\u00e1 contigo.\n\nAn\u00e1lisis extendido: https://showmeyourmoves.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/analisis-the-swapper/\n\nSi quieres seguirme como mentor: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/29569915-Josh-Cell/\n\nMi grupo: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JoshCell", "timestamp_created": 1503657984, "timestamp_updated": 1503657984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55055701732635498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34443685": {"recommendationid": "34443685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006675472", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1503511473}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty game with challenging puzzles and a great scifi story.

I don't think it deserves that and because of it I was let down at the end, but its definitely not a bad game. I still wouldn't recommend this game to my friends though and here's why:\n(Edited for all the people who absolutely hated this review, cheers!) \n\n[b]Here's what its got going for it:[/b]\nOriginal Story and Mechanics\nGood Puzzles\nWell Hidden Secret Terminals\nGreat Looking Game\n\n[b]The Not So Great:[/b]\nStory Doesn't Get Developed Enough\nMost Puzzles Were Only Mildly Difficult\nThe Added Story Provided By Secret Terminals Not Worth It\nLittle To No Replayabililty\n\nI went into this game excited. It had a great rating on steam, puzzle based sci-fi, and it seemed to be more of a short story based game which I actually like more because it means I'm not going to get sucked into some 60+ hour game thats going to ruin my life for the next month. So my critique isn't actually with the length of the game, its in what those four hours gave to me.\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nJust a quick note- The puzzles were mildly challenging, with only two that I had to walk away from, solve a different one, and then come back with fresh eyes to solve it. Quite a few I just looked at and solved right away. The possibly longer gameplay time is because I'm an explorer and like to look at every nook and cranny for clues to the story.\n\n[b]Some Minor Spoilers Lay Ahead[/b]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nI started the game off and was immediately drawn into the story and curious about where it was going to go. It definitely doesn't tell you much at the beginning. The problem is in my opinion it never ends up telling you all that much. It felt like it kept trying to string me along with the bare minimum information it could give out and then by the end my thought was, \"Thats it?\". I'm all for games that don't necessarily answer all your questions and leave you to think about the what ifs and unanswered questions of life and science, and this game does give you some of that,  but this seemed like they started a story, kind of skipped through the middle bits and all the details, and then finished it. Every cutscene and every Watcher didn't have to be that vague and the terminals could have had more information, I would have read two pages instead of the typical one paragraph per terminal. And the secret terminals? I actually only found one of them just going through the story, not knowing to look for them, and after I finished just looked them up online instead of replaying the entire game. Glad I did because they barely add anything to the story. Also as a sidenote- I thought the ending [spoiler] where you don't swap was way better and more developed.

The sci-fi horror setting fits it very well, and the ambiance contributes nicely: flickering lights keep things creepy and mysterious while you work your way forward, learning more with each dangerous step.\n\nThe story is told largely through discovering the background setup via text terminals, which I skimmed over in the beginning, but things spiraled out of control quickly and got intriguing enough that I went back and re-read all of them, which is something the game makes quite easy to do.\n\nThe key to making a [i]good[/i] puzzle games is an appropriate level of escalating difficulty for the puzzles themselves. The Swapper did a great job of that, and most of the time if I was frustrated simply walking away and coming back with a fresh perspective some time later let me see the solution almost immediately. It's rare that a puzzle game gets that balance so right. Of course, there were innevitably a couple puzzles that I think required too much of a leap in logic. That's bound to happen with any game of sufficient length, so I'm not surprised, but I do think those few could've been better designed.\n\nMy only major complaint is about the achievements - it would've been nice for them to be tied to progression, but instead they're all hidden, and hidden exceptionally well. A very thorough explorer might find half during a play through, but I find it highly improbable that any one person would find all of them without a guide. They depend on invisible paths and fake walls without any clues to their location or even presence. They feel strangely obtuse and time consuming compared to the carefully thought out level and puzzle design present throughout the rest of the experience.\n\nWhat limited voice acting exists is good. The soundtrack could have been the defining feature in a game like this, but instead it was sadly forgettable - a non-factor.\n\nThe Swapper isn't a totally amazing game, but it is quite good if you're looking for a story and puzzles that both make you think, even after you've quit the game.", "timestamp_created": 1502564942, "timestamp_updated": 1502564942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34187242": {"recommendationid": "34187242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229339772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1504975204}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice and clever puzzles in an interesting atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1502530010, "timestamp_updated": 1502530010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34159148": {"recommendationid": "34159148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046558973", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1502412321}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with an amazing atmosphere, which was probably my favorite part of it.

It might seem silly and wrong to write such a review but there is a very strong reason to do so, for the two games have a lot in common, target the same audience and came out a mere one year apart from one another - I'd even go as far as to call them sister games. It could very easily be argued that both were trying to achieve sort of the same thing around the same time, therefore it'd be fair to compare them. That said, I'll try to assume zero knowledge of The Talos Principle on behalf of the reader, so that even if you haven't played TTP yet, you'll still be able to glean some useful information from this review.\n\nAlso, this is gonna be a long one, so if you need a TL;DR, I'll give it to you right here: [b]Great game, quite challenging, definitely recommended, but everything it does The Talos Principle does better[/b] (as much as it makes me feel like an asshole to say \"X is better\" on an otherwise positive review of game Y)[b]. If you liked either of them, try the other one as well.[/b]\n\nSo let's get started with the similarities first. The Swapper and TTP are both puzzle games, that much you've probably figured out already. They also both lie on the harder side of the spectrum, which I'm sure you'll be happy to hear (cause who wants to waste their time on weak puzzles, am I right?) But they're also both puzzle games with an underlying story - and it just so happens that The Swapper and The Talos Principle share one writer, Tom Jubert; he is the sole writer of The Swapper, on TTP he is joined by Jonas Kyratzes. The writer link is no mere triviality, for it explains the most prominent similarity between the two games; namely, an underlying narrative that touches on areas of cognitive science and philosophy of the mind. I admit that I'm a sucker for those subjects, and I'm happy to say that the writing on both games does them justice. Following the story isn't necessary for beating either game (at least it won't give you any hints on how to solve any puzzle), but you're strongly advised not to skip it, for it would be akin to throwing a ball of ice-cream in the garbage just to eat the cone that came with it. Other similarities include beautiful visuals and music, a set-in-the-future environment and a subtle feeling of being desperately alone.\n\nSo what are the differences between the two and why is The Swapper not as good as TTP? Well, for one thing, The Swapper is considerably shorter. I beat it in about 7 hours, and I'm nowhere near an expert puzzle-solver. There are some hidden terminals that you can find to unlock some achievements (which I've done as well), but other than that, there's not much replayability. Meanwhile, I've already clocked in 50 hours on TTP, I'm still not 100% done with it, and I know I'm gonna replay the whole game from scratch at some point, just to discover all sorts of easter eggs and hidden messages that I missed on the first playthrough.\n\nAnother grievance I have about The Swapper is that it's one of those puzzle games where figuring out what you have to do in order to solve a puzzle is not always enough. Sometimes you'll find yourself stuck on a level just because you have to fine-tune distances between clones, jumps, buttton presses etc until you get the desired result. It's just a cheap way to make a puzzle game harder than it really is IMHO. Maybe that's just me, but I enjoy playing puzzle games for the \"figuring out what to do\" factor, not for the \"repeatedly trying to perform all the maneuvers right\" one. YMMV.\n\nBut perhaps the Swapper's greatest weakness is that the story is not that well-woven into the game itself. I can't quite explain why without spoiling huge sections of the game, but suffice to say, it feels like the writer and the developers weren't working together as closely as they should while the game was being developed. It's a shame because the story is great, the game itself is pretty damn good, but the two don't form as much of a cohesive whole as I'd wish. That's not the case with TTP; you can tell that Croteam did a much better job communicating with the writers than Facepalm Games did.\n\nSo, in conclusion: Do I recommend this game despite its shortcomings? Absolutely. It may have its flaws but I still enjoyed it a great deal. That said, if you've already played The Talos Principle, you just might find this one just a tad bit underwhelming. To put it in terms of scores, I'd give TTP a 9.5 (though, honestly, sometimes it feels like a perfect 10) and The Swapper would get a 7.5, maybe 8.\n\nPS and side note: I played The Swapper right after beating the main story in TTP, almost back to back, but I had no idea that I was getting into a game with that many similarities to the one I just finished (nor did I know about the common writer link, for that matter).

They thought of us as \u2018Watchers\u2019.[/h1]\n\n[h1]This is a reupload from [url=https://gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/the-swapper-pc-review/]Gao Li Occasionally Reviews: The Swapper[/url][/h1]\n\nIn a future where humanity has exhausted all of Earth\u2019s natural resources, mankind has sent out seven interplanetary expeditions, dubbed the Sisyphus Project, to find something, anything to help them survive. But as they gradually lose contact with them, all hope relies on one space station. The Theseus has been orbiting the alien planet of Chori V for 192 years now and used the materials found there to build a new kind of technology that lets one swap bodies and consciousness with another. Ninety-three years have passed since its last transmission to Earth when a scavenger boards the functioning, yet desolate station to uncover the truth.\n\nThe Swapper (2013) is the first and only production by Finland based indie developer facepalm games. It is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer with action platformer (Metroidvania) elements that starts off on Chori V, but is mostly set inside a space station that has seemingly been abandoned almost a century ago. What makes this title stand out (apart from its premise), is that the playable character, together with its surroundings, was handmade out of clay and then filmed. Using something other than pixelart or meshes in a video game is quite the challenge, but definitely paid off as The Swapper looks and feels unique.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIn an attempt to find anything worth scavenging, the player will explore the Theseus and not only unearth log entries from the crew, but also hear strange voices that seemingly come out of nowhere, as well as transmissions from somewhere inside the station. The controls are easily accessible and the title can be played with either a gamepad with an analog stick or a keyboard and mouse. To reach new heights or activate switches, players will need to use the swapper gun that lets them create up to four different clones of the scavenger. These mimic the original\u2019s movements to a T. Not only will they jump when the scavenger does, but the distance between these versions always remains the same, unless, of course, one of them runs into a wall or dies. To create a replicant, players simply need to aim the gun in any direction and then shoot. They can then even transfer the scavenger\u2019s consciousness into the copy, which comes in handy when a chasm is too wide to jump over or when the current body is about to be squished.\n\nUnfortunately, the first couple of puzzles onboard the station are very uncharacteristic for the experience as a whole; they seemingly rely on high precision shots and quick reflexes that are common to shooters but not to puzzlers. Players then will likely get the impression that this game is not for them as The Swapper does not properly demonstrate that by aiming the gun and keeping the aim button pressed, time slows down considerably, so that quick reflexes are not at all needed. However, once that crucial element is understood, puzzle solving is much less stressful and becomes a matter of figuring out what goes where, which is what players came to this game for after all.\n\nIn that sense, the brain teasers that the The Swapper has are mostly marvellous in design and will keep fans of the genre hooked. They are tough, they are challenging, and they won\u2019t let one go until solved as with every solution, one moves closer to the answer of what happened on the Theseus. With that said, there were three puzzles that I really couldn\u2019t figure out and had to look up only for me to say, \u201cHow did I not think of that?\u201d\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\nUnfortunately, apart from giving players a false impression, the game does feature one truly unfitting design choice. Hidden inside the station are ten rooms, which contain messages from Earth and give additional information on the whereabouts of mankind. Finding these rooms also unlock The Swapper\u2018s achievements. Unfortunately, these hidden areas are so well stowed away that there are virtually no indications that they exist at all. The game doesn\u2019t mention them, the achievement description doesn\u2019t explain how they can be gotten, and all of their entrances are inside walls. Some of them \u2013 like with room V or room X \u2013 even disallow the usage of the gun to detect where the entrances might be found, while others \u2013 like room VI \u2013 require literal leaps of faith to get to them. What makes them painful to completionists, though, isn\u2019t just that they are hard to reach, but that they won\u2019t unlock.\n[h1]Bugs[/h1]\nAchievement hunters should be aware that the game won\u2019t mark the achievements as unlocked on some computers, unless they do some tinkering beforehand.\n[olist]\n[*]For this, one first has to go to the Steam library\n[*]right-click on the game, click on \u201cProperties\u201d, which opens up a new window\n[*]go to the \u201cBetas\u201d rider, choose \u201ccompatability -\u201d under \u201cSelect the beta you would like to opt into:\u201d\n[*]click on \u201cClose\u201d and then start the game\n[/olist]\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nFinally, even though The Swapper does have some setbacks in the secrets/achievement department and while it doesn\u2019t properly teach that time slows down while aiming the gun, it nevertheless is a very enjoyable puzzle platformer.

The game seemed very well done.\nThe newbie learning curve was commendable: Nothing was forced on the player but everything was explained when introduced as new mechanic.\n\nThere's an excellent level design, the game carries it's theme very well and makes good use of all mechanics. As far as I know the swapper in this game is something unique, so far. For an improved gameplay experience without stress and frustration the player may slow down the game when using the swapper device. Very well done.\nInterface and menu design are pretty well done. Especially the map was very useful as it indicates where prograss has and hasn't been made, assisting the player in where to go and where already been.\nCheckpoints exist frequently in the world. Also very well done.\nLoading times for the game's sections are extremely short. Again very well done.\nLater on teleporters may be unlocked to save the player travel time between the sections. Yet again very well done.\nThe only mediocre thing is the time period spent on a full playthrough: if you're solving your way through the rooms the game may be rather short.\nStill the game doesn't feel rushed or unpolished at any point, it's just well done from start to finish.\n\nLiterally the only issue I had with this game was a minor one: No gravity rooms. In those you're supposed to use your swapper's swap-beam for drifting. I'm not 100% sure anymore but I think the game forgot to explain that single thing when it was a new game mechanic. Also the camera turns with the character when drifting through these no gravity areas which may cause health issues for some players (?).\n\nThe game is good to very good (depending on your personal preference) and in any case very well done.\nHowever: This game is clearly not for people that lack patience or do little to not at all care about the story and ambience package.\nEveryone else: Cleary worth buying and totally recommended.\n\nPS: I'm impressed how well designed everything in this game is.

The gameplay is simple but diverse and evolving in application. The mechanics and the way they progress are reminiscent of puzzle games like Portal. You start with the ability to create copies of yourself and then swap between them. As things progress, the game has tricks up its sleeve to bump up the difficulty. The Swapper is set in a 2D space station, where you solve puzzles to unlock new areas, challenges, and secrets. The learning curve is smooth and the end provides just enough challenge. Overall, the game is short but you feel like you get the full, polished experienced.\n\nAtmosphere: I loved it. The Theseus Space Station felt mysterious and novel. The contrasts are fantastic. There's an overall foggy aesthetic that goes beautifully with your crisp flashlight. Blocky, functional hallways and terminals mix beautifully with naturalistic caves and foliage-filled passages. The visuals combine wonderfully with the sound-design. It\u2019s simple, yet always building to something grander. Often the music just ambience that grows into a theme. The sound effects, like your footsteps, are satisfying and add weight to your movements and actions. The atmosphere is done expertly and is a strong suit of the game.\n\nStory: The plot is vague and only told through one character you never directly meet and many terminals spread throughout the station. It seems to follow the oft-used Sci-fi setup where Earth has been drained of natural resources and mankind must set out into space to sustain humanity. From there, astronauts discovered an alien lifeform and you\u2019re left in the aftermath.

Sin embargo, toda la atenci\u00f3n es atra\u00edda hacia una mec\u00e1nica en particular que, al simpatizar tan bien con la trama, concede a la obra una armon\u00eda que evita cualquier disonancia.\n\n[h1]Dise\u00f1o: afirmaci\u00f3n del consecuente[/h1]\nAl implicar cuestiones de \u00edndole filos\u00f3ficas, la obra es ejecutada dentro de una fr\u00eda estaci\u00f3n espacial abandonada a su suerte, varada en medio del ominoso vac\u00edo del espacio; pues el juego comprende que es m\u00e1s sencillo pensar y reflexionar en estado de incomunicaci\u00f3n. Un aislamiento total reina sobre los largos pasillos ampliamente iluminados por diversos tonos de fr\u00edos y c\u00e1lidos; las estancias en su totalidad fueron creadas a base de modelos de arcilla, logrando as\u00ed un apartado art\u00edstico de ciencia ficci\u00f3n que da paso a una atm\u00f3sfera sin paralelismos. Dicha ambientaci\u00f3n acaba ganando vida gracias a la m\u00fasica, compuesta por fragmentos suaves, profundos y calmos que inducen a la cogitaci\u00f3n, pues en aislamiento la meditaci\u00f3n es impuesta.\n\n[h1]El arca de Teseo[/h1]\nEl t\u00edtulo del juego es el nombre del artefacto que porta la protagonista, una pieza de tecnolog\u00eda con forma de arma de fuego. Dicho aparato llamado [i]el intercambiador[/i] posee la propiedad de poder materializar un clon de su portador en el acto a dondequiera que \u00e9ste apunte; dicho clon har\u00e1 uso de la m\u00edmica para copiar cada movimiento del personaje original en tiempo real. No solo se pueden mantener varias copias a la vez, sino que adem\u00e1s con su gatillo secundario se dispara [i]la consciencia[/i] del portador, lo que le permite cambiar de cuerpo con las r\u00e9plicas en pos de alcanzar zonas inaccesibles de otra forma. Por lo tanto, en determinadas ocasiones, el cuerpo original cometer\u00e1 suicidio en pos de que el clon contin\u00fae el viaje; esto se puede apreciar cuando se debe cruzar un precipicio: la protagonista crea un clon al otro lado, transfiere su consciencia y, al seguir, su cuerpo original seguir\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n, cayendo al vac\u00edo. Esto \u00faltimo hace analog\u00eda al [i]Arca de Teseo[/i], una paradoja que dividi\u00f3 la postura de los fil\u00f3sofos desde que se plante\u00f3:\n\n[i]El barco en el que volvi\u00f3 Teseo luego de matar al Minotauro fue dejado en el muelle como monumento hist\u00f3rico, con el pasar de los a\u00f1os sus partes de madera se fueron pudriendo; dichas partes viejas se cambiaron por nuevas hasta que el barco qued\u00f3 nuevo, sin ninguna parte original. \u00bfSigue siendo el mismo barco? \u00bfDej\u00f3 de serlo al cambiarle la primera parte o la \u00faltima?[/i]\n\nSi un individuo reemplaza su cuerpo por uno nuevo, igual al anterior, \u00bfsigue siendo la misma persona? [i]El intercambiador[/i] es una mec\u00e1nica que se usa para dar contexto a dicho planteamiento, y no solo eso, sino que l\u00fadicamente prepara al jugador para m\u00e1s adelante mostrarle las consecuencias de un proceder que a\u00f1adir\u00e1 un giro a dicha cuesti\u00f3n filos\u00f3fica: [spoiler]Disparar la consciencia hacia una persona real, para poseer su cuerpo, y con ello afrontar el dilema de los l\u00edmites de la propia identidad.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]El mito de S\u00edsifo[/h1]\nEn distintos sectores de la estaci\u00f3n espacial descansan grandes rocas que interact\u00faan con la protagonista al estar lo suficientemente cerca. Dichos minerales parecen estar vivos y se comunican por medio de telepat\u00eda. Relatan su visi\u00f3n del cosmos, la existencia y la muerte. \u00bfHabr\u00e1n tenido algo que ver con la desaparici\u00f3n de la tripulaci\u00f3n?\n\nLa comunicaci\u00f3n se desarroll\u00f3 como una manera de superar el aislamiento y poder interactuar con el mundo que nos rodea, pero una roca no puede interactuar realmente, pues es incapaz de moverse, no posee sentidos, pero, \u00bfpuede ser consciente? Si una roca que no posee un cerebro ni reacciones qu\u00edmicas que le permitan ser consiente, \u00bfes capaz de vivir, sentir, pensar?\n\nEstas rocas que presentan vida son usadas para incluir a la ecuaci\u00f3n el mito de S\u00edsifo, parte del absurdismo que juzga si la vida merece la pena ser vivida in\u00fatilmente, despojada de sentido, o si esto es justificativo para el suicidio. Pues, si un objeto inanimado que no puede moverse, expresarse o incluso sentir, tuviese consciencia, \u00bfconsiderar\u00eda su existencia verdadera vida? Por supuesto, la vida vivida es la vida entendida, por lo que a una roca que no sabe el desplazamiento f\u00edsico le har\u00e1 pensar que la vida es solo eso. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 sucede con nosotros? \u00bfQu\u00e9 ocurre cuando se nos despoja de todo aquello que nos hace \u00fatiles y nos da un sentido f\u00edsico en el aqu\u00ed y ahora? La obra presenta de manera procedural, piezas de un gran rompecabezas filos\u00f3fico, preparando al jugador para que  responda una vez no quede m\u00e1s que decir.\n\n[h1]Auto-consciencia del jugador[/h1]\nLlegada una instancia en el viaje, se le otorga auto-consciencia al jugador, para que \u00e9ste proceda seg\u00fan lo vivido y aprendido hasta dicho punto, una elecci\u00f3n. La consciencia consiste en la toma de decisiones en base al criterio propio. Pero la auto-consciencia reside en el porqu\u00e9 de aquellas acciones, en verse a uno mismo, estar al tanto de nuestros pensamientos y reflexiones; la totalidad de pensamientos, patrones y experiencias del sujeto a lo largo de su vida que rigen su proceder. Esto va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de actuar en base a lo que la mayor\u00eda considera bueno, honesto, moral o sus contrapartes; esto trata sobre concebir reflexiones propias sobre el mundo y los sucesos que en \u00e9l tienen lugar, la raz\u00f3n detr\u00e1s de cada decisi\u00f3n, formar una escala de grises.\n\nAl final de la aventura el propio jugador no solo encarna a la protagonista, no se limita manejarla como un t\u00edtere y avanzar nivel tras nivel, ya que llegado un punto debe ser auto-consciente de s\u00ed mismo, de todo aquello que le llev\u00f3 hasta all\u00ed, y se expone mediante un acto a realizar que dista de lo que se ve en otros t\u00edtulos que intentan lo mismo. La obra de Facepalm Games es una de las pocas que logra introducir la auto-consciencia del jugador de manera tan natural, llev\u00e1ndola a un final digno de reflexi\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]Puzles: empuj\u00f3n para aplicar ciencia normativa[/h1]\nPodr\u00edamos pensar que luego de tanto reflexionar sobre cuestiones filos\u00f3ficas el cerebro del jugador estar\u00eda muy cansado como para ponerse a resolver puzles, pero no. Todo lo que envuelve a [i]The Swapper[/i] se mantiene en una simbiosis, es decir, cada apartado ayuda y a la vez se nutre de otro. En  caso, los acertijos son el combustible que ayuda a arrancar las cogniciones del jugador, y mediante dicha estimulaci\u00f3n la obra logra que la persona tras la pantalla se detenga a pensar en lo que acontece, en lugar de solo reaccionar al azar a lo largo del juego.\n\nExplayarse sobre el dise\u00f1o y caracter\u00edsticas de los puzles de \u00e9ste t\u00edtulo es caer en un error, de la misma forma que profundizar en su trama, pues la obra de Facepalm Games busca golpear fuertemente al jugador mediante el asombro progresivo. \u00c9ste es uno de esos pocos t\u00edtulos que sin lugar a dudas deben jugarse sin informarse sobre \u00e9l.\n\nLa obra dista a ser un producto l\u00fadico com\u00fan, sino que est\u00e1 unos pelda\u00f1os m\u00e1s arriba, pues todos sus apartados invitan a usar el cerebro, desde sus puzles, su trasfondo argumental, sus mec\u00e1nicas l\u00fadicas e incluso la m\u00fasica est\u00e1 concebida con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de despejar la mente en pos de lo anterior. Su dise\u00f1o de acertijos mantiene sus mec\u00e1nicas y escenarios sin desviarse, lo que eclipsa en un t\u00edtulo de calidad imprescindible para absolutamente cualquier jugador, y un digno s\u00edmbolo merecedor de representar a la industria independiente.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9059978]Seguir a Mentor P\u00edxel para m\u00e1s an\u00e1lisis y rese\u00f1as[/url][/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1485889886, "timestamp_updated": 1500641901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805594086647033691", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29610855": {"recommendationid": "29610855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034490779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1393203689}, "language": "english", "review": "Talk about an underappreciated master piece.\n\nOn the surface, it's an extremely well done puzzle platformer with a really cool mechanic as its crux... but at its essence, it's a genuinely moving, horrifying and genuinely heartrending sci-fi tale, with some excellent atmosphere crafted in a really unique visual style.\n\nIt's a game that really resonated with me in a really deep emotional level, and I highly recommend it for it.\n\nPS.

By the end of the game, you must complete them all to complete the story. It wasn't until the last two unlocks that it threw me any significant story twists and REALLY made me think. After 6 hours with only ~5 puzzles left to solve that were stumpting me, I looked up their solutions on Youtube, but found a version that didn't give the story away, and I think that was worth it to experience the remainder of the story.

You can also swap direct control to any of the other clones as long as they are within line of sight. Overall this leads to gameplay that's quite reminiscent of Portal, even if the core mechanics are different.\n\nThe game also has a nice unique art style and great atmosphere. The story is pretty decent too, even if it can get somewhat pretentous at times.

I like it. It is not like any puzzle I've met before. It is the kind of game that you spend some time on a puzzle couldnt figure it out but all of a sudden and you was like \"shit how can i miss that.\" The game overall is not hard, you should be able to pass all of them without any walkthrough. The time for game is appropriate for a standard puzzle game with plot. Feel free to rush it out one-time. \n\nOut of the plot, The game did only an above average work. I can see the game tried to discuss and go into some very interesting questions. But all of them seem not enough. \n\n[spoiler] From what I can see, the game try to discuss 'what makes you you' and 'what would you do to live on'. The question of what makes you you is rather integrated throughout the game as you keep creating new bodies and swaping urself with'em. The game focused on this point for a tiny minute and switched to a \"former\" swapper landed on the station some more while ago. \n\nThere were already two individual human brain constrained on the station. These two were terminal illness patients and tried to live on by accepting a contract that the research station staff would keep them alive, in return they would be studied. The game introduced the concept of \"What would you do to live on.\" Suggesting that the two individuals did what they have to do \"survive only as a brain\", so they could live on. \n\nLatter this \"former swapper\" got onto the station. She unsealed \u2026 in brief just say a monster. In order to live on, she let the two brain-people to swap into her soul, creating a triple-character, as there are 3 people in this body. Elaborated on \"She did what she had to, to live.\"\n\nBut these plot only got introduced in the late gameplay, which makes sense as it is a puzzle indie game and you do not expect an early game plot. What i want to say is this \"late\" is very very late. Throughout the entire game, you'll feel like the character you're playing inside the game is watching the \"former swapper\"'s story. In other word is that you're watching your character watching another story happening.  [/spoiler]\n\nThe character you're playing is isolated from the game plot until the very last instance. which makes me feel the plot is very distant. If the game already tried to dig deep into this question, why not start to integrate the player into this entire plot at least from mid-gameplay?\n\nThat's only MY thought on the plot focus. The plot is good, if I was unclear.

I would've forced the player to start out with only 1 extra clone and upgrade along the way or something if you want to make puzzles with fewer clones.\n[/list]\n\nDefinitely an unique, challenging and fun game that I'd recommend buying in sale.\n\nWas this review useful to you?

Very little voice acting but what is there is also very well done.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nI don't want to go into the story too much since one of the compelling aspects of the game is that you start with almost no backstory at all and just get bits and pieces throughout the game which slowly give you an indication about what happened and what your role might be. \n\nSo, just this much (no spoilers): \nYou end up on an abandoned space station and try to find the only other person on the ship who sometimes talks to you via intercom. On your way to the station you go through a series of rooms, each with a puzzle that you have to solve in order to progress. Your only tool is the Swapper, a device that lets you make up to four clones of yourself with which you can swap places. The puzzles all require you to use your clones to reach an orb in an otherwise inaccessible place. \n\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1]\n\nThe developers did an excellent job in designing these puzzles, which increase in complexity over time. New mechanics are added that force you to develop new strategies and keep it interesting. There will be at least a few puzzles that will stump you at first but I strongly recommend to keep trying and not to give up too early. Sometimes it takes a while until it clicks and It is immensely rewarding to figure it out on your own eventually. Playtime for me was 10 hours.\n\n\n[h1]A little criticism[/h1]\n\nThe story mostly progresses by finding memory terminals. Two names that turn up in the documents you'll find are Dennet and Chalmers, both names of contemporary philosophers. This is a not so subtle hint that this game also wants to make you think about philosophical questions like what is identity, are we just our brains or is there more etc.. \nIn this instance the game falls flat (imo). This is a game world in which it is clear that there must be something beyond the physical that you can swap around between clones of yourself that makes that particular clone \"you\".\nIn our world, it is a pretty big philosophical disagreement whether there exists something beyond the physical (a \"soul\", if you are a religious person) or not. So, the game tries to make you think about this question while you are ostensibly swapping your soul/essence/whatchamacallit about. Didn't work for me.\n\nBut I usually don't play games to think about stuff like this, so it didn't really affect my enjoyment of the game.\n\n[b]I wholeheartedly recommend this game![/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1481291528, "timestamp_updated": 1481291528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644550681114196777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28264682": {"recommendationid": "28264682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307940697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1481254875}, "language": "english", "review": "> in space, no one can hear you ad hominem\n+ creepy atmosphere (hehe space pun)\n+ visually stunning\n+ simple game mechanic (cloning and swapping) used to create a solid puzzle game\n+ is Portals without the motion sickness\n+ delves deep into the concept of self and identity...\n+ THAT ending\n\n\n- that ENDING\n- space walk scenarios\n- game makes it look like there's a lingering threat when in reality...we are everything and nothing (that level of philosophical)\n\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1481256652, "timestamp_updated": 1481256652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630962491035461426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28264148": {"recommendationid": "28264148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116610255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 469, "last_played": 1538963929}, "language": "english", "review": "What a lovely game!

It's weird, but in a way that gets the gears in your head turning about existence and identity. It's also a puzzle platformer, one of the good ones like Braid where its mechanics and story are finely intertwined to make a meaningful, unified experience. That really should be enough to sell anyone on The Swapper, but I'll happily go through the details for anyone holding out on this excellent title.\n\nYou play an unnamed astronaut, unceremoniously ejected from a science station onto a barren mining colony. There you find the game's namesake, a device that can create perfect clones of you AND swap your consciousness between them. If you're thinking that opens a whole can of philosophical worms, the inhabitants of the station and colony would agree (if they hadn't mysteriously vanished). As you puzzle your way back onto the station, you'll learn plenty about the device aiding you, its part in the disappearance of your peers, and the creeping existentialist horror therein.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, this is a straight puzzle game. The first few areas introduce the Swapper and its two functions, and the rest of the game challenges you to solve convoluted rooms using those same functions. The fine details help flesh out some of the puzzles; for example, your clones mimic your moves perfectly, so some puzzles call for careful clone choreography across pressure plates or platforms. Aiming a new clone also slows down time, allowing you to make fine adjustments and precise swaps for time-intensive puzzles. There are two kinds of light that can block your abilities as well, along with some gravity shenanigans to spice things up.\n\nSolving puzzles earns you \"security orbs\" which are used to unlock doors and activate important systems. In truth they function like Mario 64 stars, where you have hubs of puzzle rooms and need like 75% of the available orbs to progress, and those margins shrink as you get near the end of the game. There are logs to read, mysterious stones to examine, and some scattered cutscenes that progress the story, but much of what you're doing is moving from hub to hub, solving puzzles.\n\nThis leads to the station feeling less like a functional place and more like a funhouse, but that's seriously my only knock against the incredible atmosphere. While the story and mechanics would by themselves set The Swapper apart as an excellent title, the shadowy corridors and brooding, ambient soundtrack take it to another level. The graphics are all real-world models made from everyday materials like tin cans and styrofoam, but blended together to give an otherworldly yet photo-realistic feel to the station. The detailed textures make the stark lighting pop, and the sharply contrasting colors lend heavily to the unease of the derelict halls.\n\nI'm easily won over by games that have unique plots that they explore fully, but The Swapper starts there and crafts a magnificent experience around its hook. It's similar in some ways to SOMA, touching on the same themes in environments meant to isolate and unsettle you. You'll only get about two hours out of this one, unfortunately, but there some of the best two hours to be found among puzzle platformers, or really any genre. Seriously, don't let any game this polished or intelligent pass you by.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Aunque la he visto en unas cuantas ocasiones, no acostumbro a verla como la mec\u00e1nica principal ni tampoco la hab\u00eda visto nunca tan profundizada. Los puzles juegan principalmente con crear clones que se mueven a la par que t\u00fa y cambiarte con ellos, imponiendo unas pocas restricciones a trav\u00e9s de distintos tipos de luz y jugando en algunos con la gravedad. Los puzles son realmente originales y exprimen sus propias mec\u00e1nicas, al final te acabas sorprendiendo de las birguer\u00edas que puedes hacer con 5 t\u00fas.

Lo recomiendo encarecidamente a cualquiera que disfrute con los juegos de puzles como yo, es una compra segura (adem\u00e1s el precio no es un problema en rebajas).

Another puzzle lies ahead. I take a deep breath and steel myself for the challenge that will undoubtedly unfold before me. Then, I dive in.\n\nThe first obstacle is a ledge, far too tall to jump. I plop a clone at the top, then immediately swap to it. Ahead lies the puzzle, and it looks like a blast. Purple, red, and blue lights, each with different properties that affect my cloning and swapping, bathe the level in literal areas of effect. An inversion plate lies right in front of me, and other is on the ceiling. Two pressure plates, one of which is also inverted, when pressed, open two stone slabs to reveal a compartment in the floor holding more orbs than I can count.\n\nBut I turn around and peer back over the edge. My former self, now a clone, is still down there. He will move when I move. Jump when I jump. But there\u2019s no way I can retrieve him, and there\u2019s no way for him to help me. I smile. Clever, clever Facepalm.\n\nThe pressure plates are both located on a floating platform above my head. I have to walk to the far side of it to place my clone for the pressure plate on top of it, since the blue light only lets me swap, not place clones. Swapping to him, I walk him to the platform, and place a clone on the inversion plate below me. Once it reaches the ceiling, I swap to it, and place an inverted clone on the inverted pressure plate on the underside of the floating platform. The final slab opens in the floor.\n\nBut\u2026I can\u2019t reach the orbs. Moving will move my clones off the pressure plates, and I have no more clones to place. Poor number five. I need him\u2026somehow.\n\nOr\u2026do I?\n\nSome time later, I\u2019m able to open the slabs using only three clones. I ready my aim to place my final clone. I have to drop him right in the opening, else I risk closing it up and ruining my setup. That only gives me a second to swap. No sweat. Done it a million times.\n\nI miss. My clone drops into the pit. \n\nI can\u2019t help but laugh, and realize how much I love The Swapper.\n\nThe aforementioned snippet from my time with The Swapper is only one of the excellent brain teasing puzzles awaiting you, if you decide to embark on this adventure. And there\u2019s no good reason why you shouldn\u2019t. In almost all areas, The Swapper stands with the best.\n\nI don\u2019t usually comment about a games\u2019 audio unless it\u2019s bad remark, but The Swapper has some of the best audio around. I love the distinct sounds of the Swapper gun, the reabsorption of clones, the collection of orbs, and even the sound of falling to my death. I also adore the sounds played at the main menu when the mouse pointer hovers over the different options. I found myself spending at least a few minutes at the main menu of the game every time I played, listening to the sounds I was able to make.\n\nThe score is also phenomenal. It\u2019s uncannily soothing and relaxing, yet also mysterious and foreboding. I love listening to it while working or writing, especially when I\u2019m stressed, or when I need help falling asleep. As someone who usually only prefers main themes, I hold The Swapper\u2019s entire score in high regard.\n\nThe puzzles are all excellent, and the Swapper device is extremely interesting and inspired. Even areas outside of the puzzles are interesting and fun to explore. Facepalm does a great job of taking a tool with only a few functions and using it in interesting ways, most notably by pitting the environment against you. Although few and far between, the zero gravity areas are great examples (using the device not to swap or create clones, but to propel yourself forward). But the best antagonists of the game are the lights.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these effect what you can and cannot do with the Swapper device while you\u2019re aiming into their light. Blue lets you swap to clones, but not place them. Red is the exact opposite. Purple doesn\u2019t let do anything with the device. In writing, this may sound basic. But when multiple lights are shining on different parts of the puzzle that you need to access, it changes your options completely. What could have been a simple situation of knowing where you want to place your clones and swap quickly becomes the question of \u201cOk, where can I place the clones and swap?\u201d Because of this, what could have been boring and dull is not. All the puzzles are interesting and well designed, proposing the fun yet sometimes complex challenge of adapting to the environment and placing clones wisely.\n\nPuzzle games may not be known for their story, and The Swapper does not break any barriers in this regard either, but the plot is enjoyable. Memory terminals hold the majority of the story and what happened to the crew aboard the doomed vessel, and accessing them is often a fun way to use your device outside of obvious puzzle areas. The enigmatic Watchers also hold many secrets and interesting perspectives, but that\u2019s for you to discover on your own. I\u2019m actually most impressed by the ideas in the plot that are hinted at, but never spoken. What is survival? What, really, is life? Like the best plots in games, I am left to my own conclusions and answers.\n\nIf The Swapper were to have a weak point, it would have to be the graphics. Not bad by any means, but for the most part not jaw dropping. It\u2019s clear that gameplay and design are the stars here. And that\u2019s not a complaint.\n\nOver the course of my time with it, The Swapper has become one of my very favorite puzzle games, and is a game that (in my humble opinion, anyway) everyone should play at one time or another. It may be a bold statement (no pun intended) but the Swapper device has all the character to stand toe-to-toe with Valve\u2019s Portal gun any day of the week. Facepalm should be rightfully proud: their game may be about making clones, but The Swapper is anything but one.", "timestamp_created": 1473075983, "timestamp_updated": 1473075983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25333635": {"recommendationid": "25333635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132708477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1533395824}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one amazing Indie Game, the athmosphere of the levels (and the whole game) are amazing, the sounds and music are amazing too, the puzzles are in my opinion mixed some are hard and some are easy to complete, i also do like the ability to clone ur charachter multiple times (total of 4 times) that way the game gets even more challenging and fun as you have to use ur clones to complete certain parts of a level!

The puzzles were very enjoyable to figure out, and the difficulty increased at a fair pace. I loved how the cloning and swaping worked and I found it very innovative and fun.\n- The atmosphere was nice. It was spooky but a kind of pleasant spooky that space should give off.\n- The length was what I expected in this type of side scroller. I didn't feel that it dragged on or felt rushed.\n- The ability to go back to previously visited areas as you progress in the game (especially for side scrollers) is something that I love to see.\n\nCons:\n- The story was bland and toward the end simply confusing. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I wanted to learn more about the Watchers and their history too.\n- The terminal logs you can find throughout the game were lacking substance. I think that hurt the story. One game I can think of that had a similar kind of system is J.U.L.I.A. Among the Stars. It contains the same idea where reading the crew's logs reveals the story to you. The logs in that game worked and resonated with the story well. The Swapper logs on the other hand felt dry.\n- WHY CAN'T I GO BACK TO THE SHIP AFTER I FINISH THE GAME, EVEN AFTER I PRAISED YOU FOR LETTING ME TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE SHIP DURING THE GAME? YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!\n\nThe pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a side scrolling puzzle game.\n\nAlso, there are no jump scares.", "timestamp_created": 1470876368, "timestamp_updated": 1470876368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527261078357696533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24786764": {"recommendationid": "24786764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045898829", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1470708536}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow. I just finished The Swapper and...wow. First, the puzzles are brilliant, with the ability to swap between four clones of yourself making a very intriguing and versatile game mechanic, with new ways to use your clones with every puzzle. The music and sound design is some of the best I have ever seen in a puzzle game and the visual style and presentation were spot on. The story is EXTREMELY thought-provoking, and while it takes a while to actually get a semblance of what the hell is going on, it is a great use of storytelling and I suggest getting all of the data logs to supplement that. I also suggest playing with subtitles, as the only gripe I have with this game would be the sometimes muddled voices, hidden under the background ambience and music, as well as radio-ish effects.
