But, it comes with some caveats. It's a well written game with great dialogue, fun gameplay (if you enjoy the puzzle half of survival horror more than the action half) and some downright inspired atmosphere sometimes. But at the end of the day it drops its more biting commentary for a kind of milquetoast horror supernatural concept. Instead of using the intrinsic horrors of the setting to amplify the survival horror overarching plot, we instead get anime and ghosts. Not that that's inherently wrong, but doesnt fit what the game was building up for.

It's not unusual for office culture to be lampooned, criticised, or taken to bizarre directions but this is the only example I can think of where that environment is turned into a survival horror game. The way this manifests is pretty neat in terms of how it influences the game's structure wherein it's based around various levels of social hierarchy within the company system that the game allows you freely travel between. It also has cute novelties like having your inventory being justified by typical stuff you'd see office workers eat or use for work. \n\nThe gameplay for Yuppie Psycho is very lacking, however. Waiting around in observation of enemy movements is not unusual for stealth games and it has a presence in the horror genre too. But the difference is that, in those games, you generally have an active role in how enemy ai works and you're given a lot more gameplay options than waiting under a desk until the threat moves away. Since the game provides virtually no options of interaction beyond that, it's entirely reliant in how these threats manifest itself. To the game's credit, this comes in a variety of forms. This can be a full screen beam of lights to actual monsters roaming about. But the thing is that none of these threats save for one boss do anything about you hiding which just makes these encounters a dull game of patience until the threat in any room leaves an opening for you to move and none of them are capable of catching up to you anyway (aside from the aforementioned boss) so it's usually easy to avoid them regardless.\n\nThe other element to the gameplay is the resource management. Reading the reviews on here is funny because of how many people got filtered by the concept of resource management which is very common in this genre; yet, I seem to be the odd one out in thinking the game is very generous in how many resources it gives you. In contrast to something like Resident Evil or Signallis, your resources are never for direct combat and you never have to think about using such resources to eliminate threats within a given area. There's no \"fight or flight\" dilemma in this game. There are limited saves  but the game is so generous in its handouts on witch papers that saving is trivial and they always slap down a save spot with a piece of witch paper before any major boss/setpiece so it's rarely tedious if you end up dying. The game's structure is also fairly linear despite how it's laid out so it's also not really a case of considering pathing when utilising your saving resources. There's also pencils, and while a bit more scarce if you're being liberal in using them, once you realise there's only a few instances where you actually need to use them and that avoiding mines is easy it also becomes trivial as a resource. Health only becomes an issue depending on how good you are at avoiding damage and admittedly there are certain setpieces and bosses which can drain you pretty hard, especially if you played carelessly the way I did. But again, the resources are so generous here that I could actually get away with playing carelessly and justify it by abusing the health items. Since the entire resource game comes down to these 3 resources and you have unlimited space in your inventory, maintaining them feels like an afterthought due to how generous the game is about giving them to you. I'm genuinely baffled by the people who find this aspect frustrating. I'd love to see them play something like Pathologic or Fear & Hunger if they think this game is rough about it.\n\nThe third core aspect of the gameplay is psuedo-adventure game puzzle solving. This is amusingly the game's strongest point and frankly what's going to be taking up most players time. While the actual solutions are usually pretty straightforward and obvious, on occasion it does provoke you to investigate areas more to get clues about how solve certain puzzles. This is bare minimum when it comes to the design of these games but I do think a bit more thought was put into this aspect of the game because it does encourage you to jump between floors and snooping around to grasp any sort of solution. They could have pushed this a lot harder to the point you're making interactions with NPCs that change the layout of levels or playing around with item interactions more, but I'll still take this over waiting any day.\n\nThe narrative provides solid hooks due to how bizarre the general atmosphere is and how NPCs seem to have no real reaction to it but I don't think this is dealt with in a satisfactory way. Named characters all fit into office comedy stereotypes but nothing is done with them in the narrative beyond their one note joke. Despite the setting, it doesn't seem to have anything it wants to explore regarding office culture or any specific drama that comes with that. There is light commentary about the cutthroat mentality of classism but aside from two characters this is largely ignored. In both of these cases the whole concept is treated as a joke despite the legitimately horrifying ramifications of it that the story implies. Nobody seems horribly concerned about what their place in the hierarchy means for their social status nor is there any questions asked about the actual ethics of Sintracorp even having this hierarchy to begin with. The side characters just tacitly accept everything and even in the ending when you end the curse none of these characters seem particularly phased or particularly care about it, which gives off the impression they never had much stakes in anything that happens in the plot. There are some potentially interesting plot beats such as [spoiler]Inay's relationship to the robot[/spoiler] or [spoiler]Chapman's relationship with his father[/spoiler] that could have played into larger aspects of the narrative's theming but they end up getting tossed aside and made mostly irrelevant.\n\nAnother issue I have with the plot is just how generally detached Brian is from it. He's portrayed as the straight man who's the only one aware of how crazy the setting actually is, but beyond the obvious love interest in Kate; which is obscenely trite and boring, he has no stakes in anything. The core of the story is moreso about the family dynamics of the companies founders and while I do think there's some spice in that it comes off as limp because Brian has nothing to do with any of it. We see this dynamic play out from Brian's perspective but he never feels obliged to invest himself in that drama or has anything to say about it. He's a white bread protagonist who acts on heroic impulses and that's about it. The most his investment matters is simply as a goal to end the curse and his relationship to the Sintra ai to a lesser degree, but the latter doesn't play off of the family dynamic in any way whatsoever despite later plot twists. There is solid hooks about the curse's origin, but the story is way too vague about the family's general goals or ethics to make any of that interesting within the grander scheme of the setting. We have no idea what sort of business Sintracorp even is or how its founder operated or what motivated the owner to [spoiler]adopt Domori specifically[/spoiler]. The most we get are vague clues about their household dynamic which only gets explored in the alternate route, but even in that case it's too underbaked to be satisfactory.\n\nThis review has been mostly negative but despite it being deeply flawed I do find it interesting enough conceptually that I don't flat out hate it.

[/h1]\n\nIn the quirky realm of corporate workplaces, Sintracorp stands as a beacon of eccentricity. Yuppie Psycho: Executive Edition, developed by Baroque Decay, invites you to step into this unusual world. As Brian Pasternack, a seemingly ordinary newcomer to Sintracorp, you'll quickly realize that normalcy is in short supply within these walls.\n\nFrom the moment you enter the high-rise headquarters, you'll encounter a cast of peculiar characters. There's Mr. Chapman, seemingly repulsed by your humble background, setting off waves of imposter syndrome. Then there's Mr. Hugo, whose passive-aggressive tendencies emerge during your onboarding. And let's not forget Ms. Sosa, an avid fan of video games and horror films, who's practically invisible to her coworkers. Strangest of all is the witch, wreaking havoc within Sintracorp, and your first task is to stop her, as though you were plugging a financial leak.\n\nYuppie Psycho is an adventure game that delves into this crisis through exploration. You'll navigate eleven floors of Sintracorp, occasionally dealing with some backtracking. However, the headquarters offers visual diversity, with areas like a garden, library, and cafeteria, occasionally enhanced by animated cinematics.\n\nEquipped with corporate camouflage, Brian wields his most valuable tool: a briefcase. It's essential for carrying the myriad of items you'll collect as you explore.\n\nUnraveling this corporate witch hunt isn't always straightforward. You'll rely on item usage, conversations, and Sintranet assistance from the company's AI. Thoroughness is key, as you explore every nook, interact with everyone, and scrutinize your surroundings.\n\nYuppie Psycho doesn't focus on direct combat; instead, it has Brian use pencils strategically to fend off fixed foes. With limited health and various hazardous objects, Brian becomes a resourceful chef, concocting restorative recipes. Occasional stealth elements also come into play, offering simplistic hide-and-seek encounters with threats.\n\nThe game excels when coworkers' behavior becomes increasingly bizarre, blurring the lines between witchcraft and corporate efficiency. It's a poignant reminder that corporate culture can be as perilous as sorcery, corrupting innocent individuals into power-hungry monsters. However, the unforgiving save system and occasional lack of direction can be as demotivating as a condescending reprimand from a snooty boss.\n\nIn \"Yuppie Psycho: Executive Edition,\" the blend of wackiness, mystery, and corporate satire creates a unique and captivating adventure.

You have the honor and the possibility to become a valuable employee of our company, having access to an unenviable salary and to a permanent social status improvement at the moment of signing your contract. The details of your work and a brief description of our facilities will be explained below, with a final personal opinion at the end of the review:\n\n[u]-Employee Brian Pasternak, your job in this company[/u] is rather simple: as a hunter, your objective is to kill the entity known as \"The Witch\", who has been living among these walls for years. Due to the confidenciality and the importance of this job, it is required that you keep it a secret. All the company will be at your disposal to investigate and to perform daily chores. Check the drawers, shelves, desks and any object or item that may be strange to you, as you never know where you will find batteries, pencils, or the valuable witch papers used for printing.\n\n[u]-Second, and continuing with the previous point,[/u] you will be able to move between the floors of the facilities to reach (almost) all the places: from taking a break eating in the cafeteria to replenish your health (which we hope it won't suffer too much throughout your day), visiting our offices zone known as The Hive (please be careful with movable desks), to taking a good break in our garden.\n\n[u]-At the moment, our facilities are suffering from a bad condition[/u], so you will need to use external tools, such as flashlights, glow sticks, etc, to explore the building. We recommend that you take special care with dangerous areas, such as the security room, the poisonous zones or the human resources office.\n\nPersonally, this game is wonderful: it has terror, a lot of comedy and very fun moments. Moreover, I love exploring all Sintracorp, you'll never know what you are going to find (or what kind of danger you'll face). The story of the game is very good, it keeps you in suspense for you to want to know mora and more. Overall, and therefore, [b] I recommend this very good game[/b] to those who like terror, humor and to explore creepy places, besides to discover a story as gloomy as it is cool.\n\n[ESP]\n\n[b]Me encanta mi trabajo[/b]\n\n\u00a1Bienvenido a Sintracorp, la empresa m\u00e1s conocida de todo el mundo! Tiene usted el honor y la posibilidad de convertirse en un valioso empleado de nuestra compa\u00f1\u00eda, teniendo acceso a un sueldo nada envidiable y a una mejora de estatus social en el momento que firme su contrato. A continuaci\u00f3n se le explicar\u00e1n los detalles de su trabajo, adem\u00e1s de realizar una breve descripci\u00f3n de nuestras \ninstalaciones:\n\n[u]-Empleado Brian Pasternak, su labor para con la empresa[/u] es muy sencilla: como cazador, su objetivo es matar a la entidad conocida como La Bruja, quien vive entre estas paredes desde hace a\u00f1os. Debido a la confidencialidad y la importancia de este trabajo, deber\u00e1 mantenerlo en absoluto secreto. Dispondr\u00e1 de toda la empresa para\ninvestigar y realizar sus labores diarias. Investigue los cajones, las estanter\u00edas, algunos escritorios y cualquier objeto que le resulte extra\u00f1o, nunca se sabe d\u00f3nde encontrar\u00e1 bater\u00edas, l\u00e1pices, o los valiosos papeles de bruja usados en las fotocopiadoras.\n\n[u]-Segundo, y continuando el anterior punto,[/u] podr\u00e1 desplazarse por los pisos de la empresa para realizar sus prop\u00f3sitos: desde tomarse un descanso con varios alimentos en la cafeter\u00eda para rellenar su salud (la cual esperemos que no sufra  muchas deca\u00eddas a lo largo de su jornada), visitar nuestra zona de oficinas conocida como La Colmena (tenga cuidado con los escritorios m\u00f3viles), hasta tomarse un merecido descanso en el octavo piso, el jard\u00edn.\n\n[u]-Actualmente, la empresa sufre de su estado actual[/u], por lo que deber\u00e1 emplear herramientas externas, tales como linternas o barritas luminosas, para explorar a conciencia las instalaciones. Le recomendamos que tenga especial cuidado con \u00e1reas peligrosas, tales como la sala de seguridad, las zonas emponzo\u00f1adas o el despacho de recursos humanos.\n\nPersonalmente, el juego me parece una maravilla: tiene toques de terror, mucha comedia y momentos muy divertidos. Adem\u00e1s, el ir explorando toda Sintracorp es espectacular, nunca sabes qu\u00e9 te vas a encontrar (o con qu\u00e9 tipo de peligro te vas a topar). La historia est\u00e1 bastante bien, te dan ganas de saber m\u00e1s sobre la empresa, esa misteriosa bruja o b\u00e1sicamente qu\u00e9 ha pasado para que Sintracorp acabe como est\u00e1 (adem\u00e1s de querer ir a un sitio espec\u00edfico al que a\u00fan no he podido acceder). Por tanto, [b]recomiendo este juego tan bueno[/b] a aquellos que les guste el terror, un poco de humor y explorar ambientes t\u00e9tricos, adem\u00e1s de aquellos a los que les guste ir desentra\u00f1ando una historia extra\u00f1a a la vez que chula.", "timestamp_created": 1686745451, "timestamp_updated": 1686832767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140025060": {"recommendationid": "140025060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198934156731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2163, "last_played": 1676956501}, "language": "english", "review": "i want him so bad.", "timestamp_created": 1686703848, "timestamp_updated": 1686703848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55746769905090332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139973068": {"recommendationid": "139973068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035632391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 2157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1703, "last_played": 1686967012}, "language": "english", "review": "So, this game was pretty crazy, but it was fun.  It's got its horror elements, but I wouldn't say that it's necessarily scary.  Creepy, for sure.  Some parts were pretty dang funny.\n\nThis is one of those games where if you put it down for a while and come back to it, there's a good chance you'll be lost, because the game only really gives you direction within the first half of it.  If you haven't been paying attention to what people are saying, it's difficult to figure out what to do next.\n\nThere is lots of stuff to find.  Your character has health and inventory.  There's not really any combat.  Mostly avoidance and hiding.  A great deal of gameplay focuses on finding paths and figuring stuff out.  So, I guess I'd call it a retro-horror-fantasy mystery game.\n\nThe story is pretty complex and there appears to be much symbolism, especially when it comes to making fun of corporate uselessness or stupidity, but also the paranormal parts of it are intricate.  It's easy to miss a lot of what's going on, especially if you try to rush through it.  That said, you'll likely find a lot of answers to your questions by reading fan speculation discussions online.\n\nThere are multiple outcomes within multiple outcomes.  So, the majority of the game's value is replay-based.\n\nA couple things I didn't like, or just didn't work for me:  There's no map.  I get lost and make wrong turns all the time, in games and in real-life.  I don't think a visual map would have been unreasonable to include, especially when it came to inaccessible areas.  Saving is limited by certain items in your inventory, which became frustrating because I would try to conserve saves and end up being killed by something stupid and lose a good half-hour of progress.  Also, while the majority of players are probably not misophonic like I am, the soft, wet mouth whispering that could be heard on certain occasions really pissed me off.  It's right in your freaking ear and I wanted to punch something.  I'm probably just crazy, so I dealt with it.\n\nUltimately, this game was a lot of fun.

The art, sounds, and soundtrack are great. I liked the characters. I ran into some trouble with one early puzzle. Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it.\n\nIt's charmingly silly. You have a coworker who dresses up in a cutesy cartoon frog mask when he goes out to help the local monsters kill people. Your company hires a motivational speaker dressed like a 19th century French cavalryman, complete with horse. You work in an office full of corpses and pools of blood which everyone just works around. It's ridiculous and fun throughout.\n\nAnd it's a ghost story. Over the course of the story you encounter horrible creatures and uncover loose clues, bits and pieces from different characters in the office. The key ghost, the Witch, has some known (\"known\"?) properties which you learn in due time. There's a history to this place behind the Witch and her connection to it. The reveals come slow and don't stop. Those ghost story reveals build up the tension in a way the art and music reinforce wonderfully. The game feels appropriately creepy, and also appropriately inappropriately silly, in the most wonderful way.\n\nI like the art. The pixel art suits the game well, and the animated pixel art cutscenes are beautiful. It's sometimes cheery and sometimes unsettling, gruesome, or both. The cutscenes, sprites, and character portraits show each character's personality in a wonderful way.\n\nI love how the sounds reinforce those feelings. The office sounds bring a mundane quality that is sometimes scary and sometimes funny, and the horror aspects sound appropriately squishy and gross.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, too, all over the place in the best way. It includes upbeat piano sounds like \"Meet and Greet\" as well as creepy piano (\"Something's Not Right\") and creepy I'm-not-sure-what-instrument ones like \"I Can See You.\" Many tracks fit right in with the setting (\"Meet and Greet\" with less energy could sound like hold or elevator music), match some sounds but not the tone (\"Not What they Seem\" and its creepy droning and beeping; \"It Hurts (Do You Look Like the Devil)\" sounds like a spooky arrangement of printer malfunctions), or clearly stick out as weird and unusual (\"Her Children\" sounds pounding and frantic). The music brings an appropriate feeling to every scene.\n\nI like the characters. Each coworker has their archetype, but their own personality within that expressed in the art and writing. They work well together by working poorly together. And there are so many nameless minor characters commenting on offices, work, careers, etc. in fun ways. Every character is slightly unsettling in some way that adds to the story's tension. I like them and I don't know who I can trust.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it's probably the puzzle of the second (?) big monster encounter. I had an idea how to solve [spoiler]the spider in the library[/spoiler] and I had the right general idea ([spoiler]to do something with the mines[/spoiler]) but couldn't figure out the specifics. ([spoiler]Since the mines reacted to the spider but as non-hostile, I thought I ruled that out, and didn't think to use the push-carts to trigger the mines since the pushcarts are apparently inanimate -- I assumed the mines only react to living things[/spoiler].) I got around this by looking at a walkthrough (which I did for most of the rest of the playthrough) and I don't regret it.\n\nIt's a fun game.

My perception of it going in was something pretty janky but fun and lighthearted, oh boy was I wrong. This is a masterclass in storytelling that had me completely immersed from the start. I'm an avid adventure game/pnc player, and the puzzles were at a great difficulty level, not too obtuse for you to connect the dots properly, but were also thought out enough to make you stop and think about what you are actually doing. More importantly everything makes sense within the world they made, and if you think you can do something, you can probably do it, which was very refreshing to see in an adventure game. More importantly, there's so much \"hidden\" fantastic content that was added to this game in a free DLC patch (I only played after it was added, but I know what was added) and it's honestly fantastic content, which is such a plus to the developer for giving us this for free. The content added with the DLC is some of the strongest parts of the game, just really out of the box puzzles and great alternative path stories and mystery. As a whole package Yuppie Psycho is excellent.\n\nI should add, I'm not much of a horror person, and there are definitely parts of this game that scared the crap out of me (if you know, you know), but for the most part its all very tasteful and manageable for someone like me who's not super into horror. The horror here is more psychological in nature, and does so much to build the story and atmosphere which rope you into a fantastic mystery adventure game. \n\nThere are some light \"survival\" elements in Yuppie Psycho I should mention. I never felt too strung out on resources, but at the same time the threat of dooming my play through from overusing resources was in the back of my mind the entire game, and added to the psychological horror and how attentive/stressed I was at times. I will say I don't think Yuppie Psycho having survival elements detracted in any way from the adventure/puzzle nature of the game, and actually added a good amount of weight and reward to exploration and unlocking new areas. I think the way limited resources were implemented worked about as well as I've see in an adventure game which leans more traditional and less action focused. If I had any gripes whatsoever, maybe they could give you 1 or 2 less health items over the course of the game, but that's really it.\n\nAll in all, Yuppie Psycho is one of the best adventure games I've played in a long time, if not ever. I really don't know what else to say.

A coiled serpent, perhaps? I had forgotten I had it but since I've been on a horror-dive lately, I decided I needed to hit that install button.\n\nI'm very glad I did.\n\nYuppie Psycho plays like a lofi Resident Evil minus the guns.  That isn't to say there aren't enemies, hazards, and boss fights.  You just deal with them by running, hiding, or other more unconventional means.  You primarily dash about the dark complex, solving puzzles, finding secrets (there are a lot), and gobbling up all the bizarre character moments you can get.  From the horror perspective, it's not really a jumpscare game.  It is an occult-infused mindworm that tries to get at you on a subconscious level, and that is far more appealing to me.\n\nAs much as it is a straightforward journey into horror, it is also equally part corporate satire, homages to horror/mystery greats, and short bursts of mostly lovably wackadoo characters. The presentation is a weird mess of chunky pixels, fluid anime cutscenes, \ud835\udda0 \ud835\udda4 \ud835\uddb2 \ud835\uddb3 \ud835\udda7 \ud835\udda4 \ud835\uddb3 \ud835\udda8 \ud835\udda2 \ud835\uddb2, and FMV goodies that all seem to blend together into a delicious, gory, smoothie.\n\nIt's also the kind of game where you can mess up your progress very easily, miss hidden items/secrets, and also has a few annoyingly tedious moments.  You can restore any and every save you make (just don't make too many, like oldskool Resident Evil, saves are limited), but I did at once need to backtrack about 4 hours of gameplay because of one, easily missed item.  These problems are not nearly enough to hold the game back for virtually any indie horror fan, however.\n\n\n[i]Sign the deal with the Devil if you...[/i]\n\n\u2705 Have a sweet tooth for the forbidden candy of occult horror\n\u2705 Love games that reward exploration\n\u2705 Are more than a touch mad and crave the surreal\n\n[i]Leave through the lobby if you...[/i]\n\n\u274c Prefer emotional writing/horror. It has its moments, but the characters mostly serve as zany archetypes.\n\u274c Need to solve your problems by 'sploding them away.\n\u274c Want difficult puzzles. Persistence is more important than ingenuity in Yuppie Psycho.\n\nThe game has received Overwhelmingly Positive reviews for good reason.  I think it stands on equal footing with the more well-known indie horror titles out there and I consider this a classic.  Though it isn't without problems, the love that was put into development is very apparent and it even carries on outside of the game.....

I was going around the offices on my floor just minding my own business until I noticed a neat, unattended cabinet. I obviously opened it to take a peek at its contents, as everyone would do in this situation. However, what I discovered instead shook me to my core... the cabinet was actually [b]empty[/b]. I kid you not, there was [b]nothing[/b] inside. No office supplies, no archived paperwork from the last decade, not even a single forgotten piece of clothing. Just a blank emptiness staring back at me. But wouldn't you believe it... every other cabinet I inspected afterwards [b]was empty too!![/b] And that's when I realized there was something really wrong going on with this company.\n\nSo yeah, I kept playing and apparently there was a witch or something? idk, I somehow managed to break the curse afflicting the company and beat the game.

[/b] nothing too major, but if you dont like hearing about gameplay elements and like to go into things as blind as possible, avoid reading ahead.\n\n[u] the good: [/u]\ni absolutely adore the visual style! i won't go into this too much considering the promo art and previews give a pretty good idea of what the final game has to offer, but the ambience around the cutscenes (and in general to be honest) always hits the mark for me. i've also always found the plot of yuppie psycho to be compelling and interesting, no matter which route i take (the game has two main branches with a few sub branches). \n\nto me, the various tasks that you need to carry out all slot together quite nicely and caused me to never feel as if what i was doing started to drag out albeit for one section of the game; while i enjoy the gameplay itself and the various mechanics, i have some gripes with them that i will be discussing in the next segment. though i've run into a bug or two during my many hours of gameplay, the dev team is active in their discord and is quick to respond to feedback regarding bugs and errors that players have run into. \n\n[u] the bad: [/u]\nbefore getting into some of the jankier aspects of the actual gameplay, one thing that's always bothered me personally about yuppie psycho is how some character dialogue ends up cutting off and oddly segmented over the course of two boxes. it's more of a quality of life issue than anything, but sometimes i felt my immersion in the narrative being ruined by a single word of a character's speech being cut off and continued in a seperate speech box when the game could've easily been put into a single box with a smaller font or seperated into one box per sentence (as an example).\n\nnow, onto the actual gameplay aspects. the way the save system works in yuppie psycho means that there are a limited number of saves. as much as i love this system, i have run into times where i wasn't able to get as much done in game as i would've liked to before saving. it also doesn't help that witch paper are also used as a currency in late game, which means if players haven't been saving sparingly then they may be unable to access certain items that aid with gameplay.\n\nthere are also a couple \"stealth\" portions of the game that rely on you waiting for something cyclical (such as enemy mob walking paths) that are fun and challenging when you first start doing them, but become frustrating and tedious when paired with the fact that aside from a key moment in the game, there are zero autosaves. this means that if the last time you saved was pretty recent but decently far away, you're going to have to walk all the way back to that portion of the game to initiate the sequence again.\n\n[b] CONCLUSION: [/b] the flaws of the game are incredibly worth pushing past due to how far outshone it is by the good. i'm currently working on my third replay and aiming to get all achievements, so i may update this review with more specific gripes / things that i enjoy at some point in the future!", "timestamp_created": 1679164165, "timestamp_updated": 1679164207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134861767": {"recommendationid": "134861767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377866010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1449, "last_played": 1685759553}, "language": "english", "review": "The Office Space has never been more Thrilling!!\n\n[b] holy sh!t a horse just took a sh!t in the meeting room and everyone cheered.

"review": "This is the strangest review for me to write, because I truly love this game,\n\nImmediately the first thing to address is why I would not recommend a game with an overwhelmingly positive reception. This article is not for attention and is simply my feelings on to me is a spoiled experience of what could've been one of the best indie games of the decade.\n\nThe plot is immediately captivating. The art is fantastic, with varying styles of pixel art and includes some awesome animated cutscenes. The music is sublime, reminding me of visual novels such as Phoenix Wright or Danganronpa. It's all got a great cohesiveness to it and is oozing charm. I can recognise a lot of the inspirations and the creators clearly have a love for games. The horror elements are done well. When the game is at it's best, it shares commonality with resident evil 8.  \n\nSo. Why am I giving this review a not recommended? \n\nI can't recommend this game because of the plethora of bugs and bad game design choices. These repeatedly broke my immersion.\n\nLet's elaborate on these experiences. Firstly, on three separate occasions, I received a gamebreaking softlock or unexpected quit, forcing me to play gameplay and watch cutscenes already pre-experienced. This combined with the fact the game encourages you NOT to save, by having a limited save system caused those backtracks to be significant time commitments. \n\nNext, some of the AI in the game is pretty shoddy. I've encountered an entire room of AI freeze up until i change areas. I've been detected unfairly and sometimes gotten away with behaviour that should have had me detected. This combined with a specific area of the game (the TV room) lead to an extremely unenjoyable experience that just made me wish I could press a button to get back to the plot. Furthermore, the boss fight at the end of this section punishes extremely hard for mistakes and again, the save is quite far away. \n\nThe balancing of where items were placed and how many of them seems very random and not player tested. I finished the game with a large number of unneeded items, while on the otherhand had to restart sections of the game deliberately because I had taken too much free damage. This sort of game design is severely immersion breaking because I turn my experience from in the mind of the character to remembering that it's just a game so I have to treat it like one. \n\nAs a developer myself, I recognise that these issues may not be the easiest to solve, but I think being released in 2019, it's fair to assume these issues could have been patched by now. \n\nThere are also some spoiler issues I won't get into in this review, but I will leave at: multiple endings should not exist just to exist. They should serve a greater purpose, either for comedy, world building, meaningful decision making and other such examples. Several endings felt like purposeless, often revealing little to no conclusion of the effects of the chosen ending. \n\nPeople that play games come under a huge umbrella of categories. Many people will prefer losing oneself in a narrative experience while others may prefer enjoying the gameplay systems. Personally, I don't think I enjoyed much of the gameplay systems when I was not immersed, as they felt archaic and often withheld the progression of the plot. \n\nTo conclude, it's a great game that's true potential is held back. The game simply suffers from it's success. It builds such wonderful character personality, captivating plot and charming music and art, that when immersion is broken from flawed game design and bugs, it hits far harder than the typical experience. This game so deserves to be a 10/10 masterpiece, but isn't, which is why I can't yet recommend it. You'll probably have a good time, but I believe every player deserves more. Horror as a genre for me only works with a maintained deep immersion. When it's going well, this game provides some of the deepest immersion I've had, yet means the breakouts hit so much harder. Regardless of this review, you should probably play it yourself if you like story heavy games, horror games, or the resident evil franchise. Perhaps just play it if you don't get lost in films, games or TV. But to those like me, I can't in good faith recommend Yuppie Psycho.", "timestamp_created": 1674605875, "timestamp_updated": 1674605875, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47775837779045105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131478406": {"recommendationid": "131478406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043615422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1674593586}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game to a T really excellent stroy and My boy Brian needs to run for his life towards a coffee machine or a snack machine to stay alive poor fella", "timestamp_created": 1674586030, "timestamp_updated": 1674586030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131392302": {"recommendationid": "131392302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128146079", "num_games_owned": 1118, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1674400020}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una joya que no se puede perder, una comedia terror\u00edfica en la que la historia te mantendr\u00e1 en vilo. Acompa\u00f1a a Brian en su primer d\u00eda de trabajo. Dentro rese\u00f1a!\n\nPrimer juego pasado en steam deck y ha sido una gozada. Nos encontramos ante un indie que mezcla varios elementos. La historia nos presenta a Brian Pasternack, en su primer d\u00eda de trabajo en Sintracorp, una de las mejores empresas de su mundo. Al parecer dicho mundo se diferencia en clases sociales seg\u00fan una letra del alfabeto. Al llegar, pondr\u00e1n a Brian en una de las 10 plantas que tiene la empresa (donde se desarrolla el juego) y con un mensaje de \"mata a la bruja\", comenzar\u00e1 un primer \"trabajo\".\n\nContar m\u00e1s de la historia es hacer spoiler pero en base, a m\u00e1s descubre m\u00e1s quieres saber, de todos los personajes, con su personalidad propia les coges cari\u00f1o (a algunos m\u00e1s que otros). Una historia bastante adulta, a mi parecer. Con elementos de terror, los gr\u00e1ficos pixel no dan para mucho. Pero la atm\u00f3sfera y cada escenario est\u00e1 puesto a prop\u00f3sito y no te sientes seguro en ning\u00fan lado. Gameplay sencillo, guardados a lo \"cintas de resident evil\", inventario para usar objetos, metroidvania en ciertas partes, un bot\u00f3n de correr y objetos r\u00e1pidos (linternas). Hace uso de la luz muy pero que muy bueno. Todo el gameplay, escenarios y terror es la propia parte de \"miedo\". Pero encontramos por otra parte una s\u00e1tira, un puteo de personajes,  una sociedad dividida por cu\u00e1nto asciendes, por qui\u00e9n es el jefe, todo enfocado a la realidad en la que vivimos (de manera exagerada) en la que en muchos di\u00e1logos puedes sentirte identificado incluso. Y esa es la parte de comedia (que no se desv\u00eda del terror).\n\nY nos queda una joya de juego que ya sea por la historia aunque no te llame el gameplay como es mi caso, deber\u00edais jugar. El juego dura alrededor de 5-6 horas, con un mont\u00f3n de cinem\u00e1ticas y finales (estoy contento con el m\u00edo).\n\nAunque he jugado en steam deck offline y por eso el tan poco recuento de horas. No puedo m\u00e1s que recomendarlo pues el gui\u00f3n es una maravilla, los personajes, los di\u00e1logos, la atm\u00f3sfera, son tan buenos que da igual que el juego se vea \"pixelado\". Sobre todo las cintas donde se ven v\u00eddeos grabados realmente con personas (bastante turbios) le han dado un puntazo.

I would give this game a 8/10, only because of 2 things. \n\n1. THE SAVING SYSTEM IS VERY FRUSTRATING. I get that it works with the story and makes the game more immersive, but it really does make the game very frustrating at times and even can make it not fun anymore when you have to watch cut scenes back after back just because you haven't been able to find any witch paper and you didn't realize you could be killed easily in the next area you go to. \n\n2. I won't say any spoilers, but I am just going to say the ending that I got wasn't what I was hoping for. The story had very good pacing and kept me hooked and interested pretty much the whole game. But the ending kinda seemed rushed and not as thought out as the story for the majority of the game. But I know there are multiple endings, maybe the one I got just isn't as exciting as the others. But hey that's just me. \n\nBesides those 2 things, this was an amazing experience and I look forward to seeing what this game studio makes in the future.

The story and animation are definitely the selling points of the game for me; this is no walking sim though, I found the gameplay pretty fun and challenging, particularly managing money, items, saves (which are limited to an item) while not really knowing what might come next. On the negative side a few particular encounters will will require a couple of deaths and some memorization to get through, and there seems to be a few times where passing through an area just means you'll take unavoidable damage.\nItem management is important but not difficult, barring one issue - in the endgame, there was one particular regular item needed for one part of the ending that I couldn't get after the endgame started.

however working smartly is the goal of the game, and i feel the system is not only lore-compliant, but also an intriguing mechanic added to keep the stakes high. dying will reset you back to your last save, which can be frustrating if you haven\u2019t saved in a while\u2026 but the game gives you plenty of opportunity to save before major encounters. the game-saving material is also scattered throughout the game, like a reward for exploring the levels of the building. \n\nthe main crux of gameplay is problem solving, puzzles, and self-guided exploration. sprinkled every now and then with a tense moment of fear, the gameplay has a good ebb and flow which i enjoyed immensely. while i'm the kind of guy to look up a walkthrough and follow that most of the way through to get enjoyment, there were moments where I slowly pieced things together myself, and those were unfathomably fulfilling. of course, there were even puzzles that walkthroughs couldn\u2019t help me with \u2013 the difficulty of the game is present in its puzzles and exploration, and figuring things out for yourself is what really shines about this game. this goes for both puzzles and lore. \n\nthere are many side-quests and bosses in the game as well, and without spoiling anything, i will say it\u2019s highly encouraged to give them a look. if you get a second to rest between the high-stakes action and boss fights, definitely go get to know your coworkers, as quirky and off as they may be. \n\nthe game does well to establish its horror setting, and the minimalist pixel graphics do well to add to the obscurity of the horror. everything in the game has room for your mind to interpret and make it more terrifying than the graphics could ever do - and that\u2019s a firm strength for the game. that unknown nature, the minimalism, it\u2019s all there to let your mind run rampant with the horror. it worms its way into you. it really hooks you, and makes you feel as if you\u2019re really there. \n\nin terms of the lore, there\u2019s plenty there if you choose to look. even if it\u2019s obscure, it\u2019s present - and like the horror, it\u2019s up to you to figure it out on your own. plenty of collectables litter the game for you to collect. the atmosphere also tells a story, which give insight to how things were and how they continue to be. each ending of the game gives you more and more than you could have ever imagined, which is why i encourage you to find them all for yourself. the endings will get you emotional, as they are fulfilling extensions of the story you have experienced up until that point. \n\nYuppie Psycho pulls you into a world of fear and intrigue as you fight your way through a twisted and distorted building built specifically to give you chills. even for a horror baby such as myself, the horror was built in a way that terrifies you, yet keeps you coming back for more. the characters are well-established, the lore is rich, and the gameplay establishes itself in a powerful yet understandable way. Yuppie Psycho is an experience well worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1670511271, "timestamp_updated": 1670511271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693645775318145752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128122211": {"recommendationid": "128122211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118382706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1670791960}, "language": "english", "review": "This game takes me back to the days of Corpse Party and other horror RPGs.

Brian gets an invite to work for an incredibly high profile company despite having no qualifications. Hesitant Brian accepts his contract and finds himself in a dangerous situation that has him checking over his shoulder all the time. His assignment, Kill the Witch. Brian can not disclose his role in the company as a hunter, and must keep a low profile while completing the tasks given to him through his work computer. Take control of Brian's fate through a series of branching options that could end with him leaving or becoming top dog of the company. \n \nThe Narrative of the game was intriguing and held my attention even after multiple playthroughs. The branching choices are also fairly easy to identify and tell what would make for an ending split. There's a slight amount of backtracking but not enough to the point it became annoying. Instead I found myself fascinated with the large amount of ending possibilities and minimal repeated actions I had to take for some of them, it was for this reason that I ended up playing the game from start to finish 3 times total. Using items you pick up while exploring, Brian can make healing items, gain upgrades for more light, find tapes/VHS clips, and a plethora of other goodies to help him on his adventure. Everything being held in his suitcase and categorized to easily be found. \n\nThe art of the game is absolutely gorgeous. As a lover of pixel art, the inclusion of some many animated sequences blew me away. Props to the artist for making the animated sequences flow naturally into the game environments. While it may not be something everyone would notice, as someone in the art field it was fantastic to see. Even though the in game art sprites may not appear to be anything special, the environments, splash screens, and animated sequences were an absolute treat. \n\nThe game features it's own 40+ soundtrack that I never once found to be too repetitious or annoying. Each track fit the environment it played in and helped to increase the immersion of the environment. There were locations were I was on the edge of my seat due to the ambiance mixed with the environmental layout. The price for the game is also fair at full value and would buy it at such for the amount of content you are getting. \n\nThe achievements for the game can be a bit mixed as completionists may find some of the achievements tedious to get as there are a few that are dependent upon where you are in the story to get. In addition there is also a no save run achievement, this is generally why someone would have to play the game 2-3 times from the beginning. One ending requires you to restart from the beginning only because you refuse the position from the beginning. The others you can create a save right before the branching about 2/3 of the way through the game. Despite this, I did 100% the game and didn't find any achievements absurdly difficult to achieve. For a no save run the game gives you plenty of health items strewn about the levels, so long as players are searching for items on the levels. I finished the game with over 10+ different healing items and took multiple hits from things during my playthrough. It was also this playthrough I did the control achievement as well. \n\nThere are few complaints I really have about this game, if anything I think the birthday party boss battle could have been a bit easier as that battle ended up using half of the healing items I had made at the party, and I didn't really understand how I was being attacked. All the other boss battles were fairly easy however and I had little problem with them. \nIn the second route set I would say dealing with the \"enemy\" in the residences ended up being more tedious than anything else as it seemed to be more based on chance if I would be able to get away unharmed. In the hallways I didn't have any light around me when hiding so it was hard to determine where the enemy was for this. The one saving grace for this part was that the enemy at least didn't hit very hard so the damage was easy to heal. \n\nOverall, this was a game I really enjoyed, and slightly regret not playing sooner. The art was fantastic, the music was great, and it provided a pretty interesting story. If you have it, play it. If it sounds interesting get it, and if you're on the fence wait for a sale. This is a game I think all fans of Indie games, and/or survival horror should play.

The gameplay is limited but works well in context so it never feels like it's dragging the rest of the experience down. \n\n\nMy gripes are mostly with the story. It starts with a mysterious letter from a prestigious company and a baffling task on your first day of work \"KILL THE WTICH\" as you explore the company you realize it has become an absolute a hellscape filled with monsters and the abused workers seem not to realized the dire situation they're in.\n\nThe story is very basic. In the sense that it feels like it's the last part the developers thought about. It starts strong with an interesting mystery but fails to deliver in the promise made by the set up. [spoiler] During a lot of the story the witch is set  up as a big menace and that anyone in the company could be her. But the end[/spoiler]   [spoiler]it was all a fakeout. The \"witch\" wasn't even involved with everything that was happening directly and it was all basically a convoluted mistake.[/spoiler] \n\n\nAlso I was expecting the title to be more relevant to the game's story and gameplay. The protagonist being this meek unexperienced person maybe could be transformed by the violence of this company into the violent witch hunter he was hired to be, depending on your choices. But the MC never really has an arc either way. Which in my opinion is the biggest fault of th game's story.\n\nThe game has multiple endings and some do branch out quite a lot so replayability is pretty good, but I still feel there was a lack of emphasis on characters.\n\nAll that being said the worldbuilding itself is great. You get to familiarize yourself with the different floors of the company building and as you uncover the mysteries the world opens up. This is one of the strenght of the game design in general\n\n\nIn general I think the game is a good concept and has a unique juxtaposition of artstyles which works great in my opinion. If you  don't mind a bit of an unambitious story it's a great experience. \n\nI hope the developers get to explore this concept again with a more ambitious game in the future.

So having passed the IT department, which became available thanks to the update of the game (and the addition of content from the free add-on) - the player can immediately delete a crowd of opponents from the game who could be dangerous closer to the final.\nHowever, one bug spoiled my mood - when the character was shopping in the vending machine and was attacked by the enemy: after that, the game stopped responding to button presses, and the character continued to stand and do nothing.

Overall, fun plotting and an evocative art style are held back by a shoddy gameplay experience.\n\nYuppie Psycho builds atmosphere and story effectively, but controls awkwardly. This is very noticeable in fights and escape sequences. The vast majority of my deaths have been from weird pixeljank where my character is one pixel over too far and is stuck on the world, or the enemy is one pixel too far out of a weapon's radius. Attacks and other damaging world events are poorly choreographed, often requiring you to die in order to learn how they work.\n\nThe limited save system does nothing for gameplay, and in my opinion single-handedly moves the needle to a Not Recommended.

Let's see what this game can offer you.\nYuppie Psycho: Executive Edition review on your screens friends, let's go!\n\nNot in a fairy tale\nI won't say much about the plot.\nThe action of the game begins with the fact that Brian Pasternak (Our main character) receives an invitation to work in the largest company, Sintracorp. Upon arriving at the aforementioned company, Brian learns that he was not hired as an office clerk, but as a real Witch Hunter. From that moment on, Brian will have to figure out all the supernatural nonsense that is happening in the company, meet new characters, kill the witch. And the primary task: to survive until the end of his first working day.\nThe plot in the game is really great, it will constantly keep you in suspense, force the player to build their guesses and much more. The story keeps the game going.\nI believe that this is the primary purpose of the story in games, it should encourage the player to play the game, and not just be in the game for show.\n\nAdventures of the Young Witch Hunter\nLocation from the DLC, if during the passage you do not see this place, it's okay.\nI can tell a lot more about the gameplay. The game is partly a quest with finding objects, solving simple puzzles and so on, but it is also Survival Horror. But let's go in order.\nDialogues with characters play an important role in the game. Like it or not, you will talk to the characters quite often, while the dialogues themselves are pop-up windows with text. Sometimes we will even be given the right to choose.\nThe dialogues are very interesting and reveal the characters. True, there is a flaw associated with the localization of the game in Russian, but this is not critical.\nNow let's talk directly about the gameplay. As I said earlier, the game is partly a Quest.\nWe will periodically have to think about what to do with this or that object, solve puzzles, interact with characters - which will often let us know what to do with this or that object, and, among other things, will tell quite a few interesting facts about the history of the company.\nIt is worth saying that the puzzles are very simple, but they do not become less interesting from this.\nIn addition to being a quest, the game is also not a bad Survival Horror. We have a battery flashlight, which tends to run out, we can only save with the help of a photocopier for a special resource that we will find in the process of passing. There are only 2 auto saves for the whole game. In the future, in order to save, be kind enough to fork out for a special piece of paper, and sometimes even for a cartridge, if suddenly the copier standing next to it turned out to be empty.\nAs you may have guessed, Brian's fighter is useless, so the only way to survive an encounter with an enemy is to hide from him. This mechanic is fully revealed in the DLC, but we'll talk about it a little later.\nI also want to talk about boss fights.\nEach battle with them is unique and requires an individual approach, but alas, there are only 3 of them in the game, one of which is not a mandatory and hidden boss at all.\nThe gameplay turned out to be very interesting and does not let the player get bored, he periodically dilutes hide and seek, running errands back and forth, solving puzzles, etc. The location, it would seem, is not large, the action of the game will take place exclusively within the framework of one 10-story building, but this playing field turned out to be quite interesting and even diverse.\nI liked the gameplay, despite the fact that I do not like this genre of games. And this, in turn, says a lot.\n\nHidden Content\nTo my surprise, not a small fraction of the content in the game is hidden. Starting from video cassettes that contain mini horror films (and they also act as a kind of collectible items that are hidden on the floors). Many notes that will tell us a little about Lor, as well as new dialogues with characters that did not exist before. The developers were not too lazy to add even a hidden boss. By the way, DLC can also be attributed to hidden content, and that\u2019s all, because in order to activate the add-on, you need to perform certain manipulations, and a person who simply follows the plot rails will not even get to the location where this action needs to be performed. Therefore, a person who loves: to climb everywhere, to touch everything, learns much more, compared to a player who simply follows the rails of the plot.\nImportant!!!\nWhat I didn't say is that if you just follow the storyline, the player will be left with no content, or will be left with a ton of questions (To be fair, some of the answers are still hidden). Just by going through the game, most things will be clear to you, because they are directly told to you, but there is also a large share of hidden content that is very interesting to delve into.\n\nAddition\nIt's time to talk about the free add-on. As I said above, not everyone can activate this DLC, activate it:\n1. Curious\n2. The player watching the guide.\nThe add-on itself does not bring anything in terms of gameplay. It is simply intended to expand the plot by showing some moments from the other side. It added a boss (This is the one that is hidden), and added 2 new endings. The endings themselves are mutually exclusive, if you have not activated the add-on, then the endings will only be from the list that is in the main game, and if you did activate it, then you can forget about the endings of their original game, only those that are in the add-on.\nApart from the ending, the addition does not change anything, if you do not take into account the fact that one section from the DLC strains and scares 2 times more than the entire original game.\n\nMusical Accompaniment\nHow to put it this way... the music in the game is simple, but it affects your immersion, it just fits perfectly into the gameplay. For all its simplicity, the musical accompaniment is recognizable, if even six months later they turn on ost from this game, I will recognize it.\n\nVisual Style\nAnd again my favorite Pixel Art.\nIf I may say so, the visual style of the game is not detailed pixel art, the cutscenes themselves are drawn in Anime style, but also decorated in pixel style. The windows with the images of the characters themselves are detailed, but in the game itself there are large coarse pixels, but this is by no means a bad thing. The developer managed to perfectly convey the spirit and atmosphere of the game, and this is the main thing.\n\nOutcome\nYuppie Psycho - A great example of how to create a great game, it's not the budget and PR that matters, but the fact that the developer is sincerely interested in creating a good product.\nIs the game worth the attention?\n\u2014 Yes, if suddenly the price tag of 300 rubles bothers you, in such cases, having seen the game on discounts, it\u2019s still worth thinking about buying.\nLet's talk about the pros and cons.\nPROS**\n1. Good plot,\n2. Nice soundtrack,\n3. Not annoying and interesting gameplay,\n4. Free DLC,\nMINUSES**\n1. Crooked Russian localization\n2.

A game where everything fits together. The graphics, the art style, the audio and sound effects, the atmosphere, the depth, the story and the horror elements. Everything merged into an almost perfect experience. I just like Yuppie Psycho a little more than The Count Lucanor. But just because of the setting. So these are purely personal reasons.\n\nMaybe not everyones cup of tea, but I love the idea of \u200b\u200blimited safe opportunities and consumables. It's not like you're going to run out or anything, unless you're completely brain dead and feel the need to save every few seconds like some modern gamers do. It's a game where you have to think for yourself, where you have to figure things out and plan a little in advance. Not much, but a welcome sight when you think of most modern games, where everything is dealt to you on a silver tablet and you have to use as little brain power as possible. Baroque Decay games pay homage to the purest idea of \u200b\u200bvideo games. A game that you actually play and feel like you've accomplished something while playing. And not like watching a video, where you can interact from time to time.\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\n\nIf you like horror, mystery, adventure, fantastic stories and lore, exploration, great characters, twist and turns, multiple endings and wonderful world building, don't think twice and just give them your money. And while you're at it, also buy The Count Lucanor. It's a bit shorter, but still worth every penny. Yuppie Psycho offers around 10-15 hours and the former around 5-10 hours of quality gameplay.

I probably would have never tried this game either if I didn't get it through Humble Bundle.\n\nI am a person that on one hand loves horror games but on the other hand just can't play them by myself, especially not during nighttime or in a dark room. It perfectly captures the horror of how working in a big company might look like inside our heads without relying on jumpscares and the likes of cheap horror. There's a lot to explore and I felt like exploration was always rewarded - either with useful materials or a secret. The characters are all great, especially Brian, who actually feels like a relatable main character on his first day at Sintracorp. \n\nOne thing I enjoyed about the game is that it doesn't guide you as much as other games and that you're basically able to explore most of the company from the moment you enter it. It also got the perfect length with roughly 8 hours for my first playthrough. It got multiple endings and an alternative route as far as i know so there's some replayability through that.

It was also very nice to see characters point out obvious story details that seem obvious such as two people looking similar. It was quite refreshing to see and I didn't realize how prevalent the \"characters are oblivious for plot\" issue was until this game gave a break from it.\n\nThere is a restricted save system that requires the use of items to save your game. In my opinion this can be a good or bad thing but for purely gameplay intents and purposes I think it's done well enough that I find myself generally happy to engage with it despite being the type that doesn't like limited saving. However the program itself is somewhat susceptible to crashing when alt tabbing. This unfortunate event occurred with my game after an extended period of not saving due to limited resources. It's worth mentioning that as of editing this review there is apparently an engine update coming soon that will likely fix some issues including the alt tab crashing. \n\nI'd recommend the game regardless, just be aware that if you play it before the engine update you may want to be either more efficient with your save resources than I am or be aware of the risk taken when alt tabbing, or play it windowed (I dont remember if there was a windowed option). It has an intriguing and well written story and as far as i can tell there's a good amount too. The design in horror elements can be genuinely tense and eerie and overall it's a well crafted cohesive experience. While I'm at it save for the crashing I didn't experience any gameplay bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1655898020, "timestamp_updated": 1656020044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552916944026947021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1655986172, "developer_response": "Sorry to read about the crash.\n\nA engine update is coming in the few next weeks, solving this issue and imrpoving the user experience."}, "117386753": {"recommendationid": "117386753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155467352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1505, "last_played": 1626576826}, "language": "english", "review": "Legitimately one of my favorite games, not too easy and not too challenging to the point of frustration.

You will frequently be unable to tell what damages you until you interact with it and lose a bunch of health, for example there are static or non-engaging NPCs which will hurt you if you try talking to them.\nThere's a particularly annoying example of that on the 2nd floor where you're put into a series of minigames and the first one involves inreracting with boxheaded people in a dark room with a solitary spotlight. They constantly walk around the area and most will damage you on contact. The only way to tell which one is safe to interact with is by looking at the back of their head, which means you have to wait until they are walking in the right direction AND while they're in the small circle of light, otherwise it's too dark to tell. To top it all off, you're not given any instruction or hint for what you're actually supposed to do.\n\n3) There's a lot of missable items, interactions and sidequests which you're cut off from by progressing through the main story without any warning. If you wanted to get the most out of the game without resorting to a walkthrough, you would have to comb through every floor of the building for changes each time you complete any task.\n\n4) The fact that the plot is kinda stupid and doesn't make much sense doesn't help much either.", "timestamp_created": 1653990702, "timestamp_updated": 1653990702, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543793857097625732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116261937": {"recommendationid": "116261937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202534425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1654041656}, "language": "english", "review": "Really, really fun game which can be quite tricky at some points and a great story!", "timestamp_created": 1653948502, "timestamp_updated": 1653948502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116221605": {"recommendationid": "116221605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099322682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1657935319}, "language": "english", "review": "this is like my favorite game is very cool\n", "timestamp_created": 1653873728, "timestamp_updated": 1653873728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116220874": {"recommendationid": "116220874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216572305", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1653871233}, "language": "english", "review": "i really want to like this game. it is charming, has an interesting story, and gameplay that keeps the player just enough on edge to offer a sense of accomplishment as the game progresses. but the file saving system is just flat-out not fun, and ruins the whole experience for me. when you tie something as critical as saving a game to a limited resource, all that amounts for the player is anxiety and disappointment at progress loss. it is not and has never been an intriguing gameplay element in any game that uses it; it only serves to be a surface level mechanic that goes unnoticed at best and is a lame pain in the ass at worst. which is an absolute shame because i really want to play through this otherwise amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1653872274, "timestamp_updated": 1653872274, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510573983192443848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116202057": {"recommendationid": "116202057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042836412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1653875288}, "language": "english", "review": "Horror done right", "timestamp_created": 1653842589, "timestamp_updated": 1653842589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116185493": {"recommendationid": "116185493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264851045", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1655561481}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1653819809, "timestamp_updated": 1653819809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116157648": {"recommendationid": "116157648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321518120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1866, "last_played": 1627858083}, "language": "english", "review": "Twisted and nostalgic.

In the beginning of the game, you receive a mysterious letter with a job-offer you simply \u201ccannot\u201d turn down.\nUpon taking the job-offer to work at the large company known as Sintracorp, you bind a contract hidden under a certain spell. From here on out you are given tasks unraveling the mysteries of Sintracorp\u2013it\u2019s a gorey and engaging story that will leave you wanting to know more. At times it had me a bit shaken and thrilled since the OST can be very eerie, giving uncertainty of what will happen next. In essense it leaves you feeling on edge as you unknowingly go through the more humorous and cheerful segments of the story and learn that the worst things have yet to come.\n[u]I discovered that there were numerous routes you could take throughout the game that changed your apprehension of the lore completely.[/u] [u] [b]\nI strongly advise you to save regularly and play through ALL the routes to discover the actual truth behind all the mysteries as well as finding alternative ones![/b] [/u]\nI have played games with similar game mechanics in the past but this one hits different.

From there you must solve the mystery behind the haunting, and who you can and cannot trust. The game is full of well made puzzles that will test your timing and planning. Beware there is a decent amount of miss-able stuff so you may want to save often in case you need to go back later(or use a walkthrough.)

Cada planta de ese edificio Sintra es una aventura surrealista imposible de predecir, los enemigos casi siempre estar\u00e1n al acecho y en algunos momentos los recursos escasear\u00e1n hasta tal punto que no solo nos preocuparemos por los alimentos curativos, sino tambi\u00e9n por si podremos guardar la partida en las impresoras que vayamos localizando, ya sea con los t\u00f3ner o con los papeles recogidos en el inventario. Con esto no quiero echar a nadie para atr\u00e1s, pero hay que dejar claro que el juego no regala las cosas ni lo pone f\u00e1cil, es decir, cumple con lo que se espera de un juego de supervivencia. Cuantas m\u00e1s zonas desbloqueemos m\u00e1s se notar\u00e1 el da\u00f1o de los enemigos, pero a su vez ya nos habremos familiarizado con los atajos y con los trucos para evitar ser detectados o ser da\u00f1ados; las mesas, armarios o conductos de ventilaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1n el pan de cada d\u00eda. \n\nEs dif\u00edcil comparar este juego con otros t\u00edtulos, porque a mi parecer no tiene sentido el ponerle al lado de un [i]Resident Evil[/i], sin embargo, el ambiente que mezcla la rutina de un horario laboral con un mundo paralelo, m\u00e1gico u on\u00edrico (de pesadilla m\u00e1s bien) me ha recordado mucho a la saga [i]Persona[/i] y a esos chavales uniformados que ten\u00edan que ir al colegio de d\u00eda y enfrentarse a monstruos y amenazas sobrenaturales en mazmorras, torres o dimensiones chungas por la noche. En [i]Yuppie Psycho[/i] los currantes que te encuentras han normalizado lo irracional y apenas se inmutan. Por ejemplo, [spoiler] si aparece un soldado napole\u00f3nico a caballo en el despacho, si un gas venenoso se esparce por una sala o si unos labios gigantes salen de una pared dispuestos a devorar al que pase[/spoiler]continuar\u00e1n con sus quehaceres y hasta celebrar\u00e1n fiestas de cumplea\u00f1os. \n\nEste comportamiento tan raro es el que nos sacar\u00e1 alguna carcajada en alg\u00fan momento de relax entre tarea y tarea.

A partir de ah\u00ed con este videojuego uno se terminar\u00e1 preguntando asimismo \u00bfqu\u00e9 es peor, una burocracia jer\u00e1rquica y explotadora o una maldici\u00f3n de ultratumba? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es el aut\u00e9ntico infierno?

I really really REALLY like horror and got into the RPG Maker/bit graphics games a year or so ago. Horror and non horror alike, this is the best game in that category/genre I have played so far. I for sure thought I was not going to find this as fun and as intriguing as I did and I can't wait to 100% it achievement-wise. Some parts are a bit hard, but the good kind of hard that makes you want to keep going forward and figuring out what the heck is going on in the story. It def is not rage-quit hard by any means. I actually *wanted* to investigate and get the things I needed to progress. Finished in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this as its one of those games I occasionally think about randomly on how good it was, and wish I could play it the first time again. Without spoiling too much, just get it. Going in as blind as possible is actually the best way to play this. The only gripe I can see people having is the save system which is similar to RE1 with the ink roll and typewriter. You need \"spirit paper\" and you must save at a copy machine and have spirit paper on hand to save. I found this not as hard as it seemed, and felt like there was more on the line if I went out exploring which amped up the horror aspect. But there is nothing stopping you from saving \"safely\" in between hard parts. There were 1 or 2 times I was a bit aggravated in the game, it was a time where I did die, and another I couldn't figure out where to go, but its so few and far between its nothing to complain about. I got this game on a 2 for 1 sale in the Fall with Count Lucanor, and although I got Yuppie at a discount, knowing how good it is, I would absolutely buy it full price. I thought Mad Father was going to be my favorite in this genre, but Yuppie blows it out of the water. And its a long game! Much longer than most RPG Maker/Bit type games. If you take your time and don't look up anything, and just explore the world, I say its at least 8 to 10 hours, which is wild for a game like this!! If you like horror and the 64-bit games and mystery, you're going to love this! Just get it.

All the cutscenes, all the sprites, the animations, everything looked fantastic. I absolutely loved it. The audio too was great, all the music and sounds especially when you don't expect certain sounds, like the random ASMR sounds and such, all of them were great.\n\nThe story was quite good; it had a lot of funny moments, a lot of scary, opressive moments, and it was a lot of fun.\n\nOne part I quite enjoyed a lot is the little things. The random events that can happen and the side objectives, like the Videoclub side area, with all their random weird ARG creepy videos, I loved it. It added a little something to look out for, something to wonder about as well, besides the story. I liked it. That and also, towards the end of the game, the ASMR sounds being used to instill tingles and chills, it was great.\n\n\nAs for the bad parts, I did find it quite tough to get all the endings on the original route as I had to replay through a lot of content to get them compared to the second new route, which is a lot easier. I also found the rare typo here and there like with the forest goblin, I know some of his text is bad on purpose but I think I remember seeing a typo that didn't appear to be on purpose. I managed to also find a crash when inside R. Corvos's office when interacting with the left cabinet, the text box appeared and the initial text too, but then everything froze. I have no idea what happened.\n\nAlso in the beginning, when you start the game, setting the gamma is quite annoying as one tiny click would send the gamma flying in one direction sometimes, which made it quite hard to get the gamma right. Maybe it's easier in the options menu but not at the actual start of the game. Also, it seems that unless you follow multiple guides closely, you'll likely miss a lot of stuff, which I don't really like. Heck, even I, who thought I checked thoroughly, happened to miss quite a bit.\n\nLastly, there was one instance when I played a certain cassette tape where I could actually walk, which made it, I think, the only one that was like that. I didn't realize it until a bit towards the end of the cassette that I could walk to discover an interesting scene. I didn't like that it was the only one that was like that and had basically no indication that I could walk except for a little flicker of the character, which at least that is a little something but not enough, a minor thing but felt like mentioning it.\n\n\nOverall, it's a great game with a good art style and audio.

The atmosphere perfectly accompanies the adventure and as soon as you enter a little full it makes you want to explore the company as much as possible and discover its secrets.\n\nThe story is immersive and engaging, along with the recently added free DLC that expands and ends the story makes for a complex and complete adventure.\n\nThe duration is relatively short, a shot made the game should not last more than 4-6 hours but you will leave a lot in the pipeline. The approximate duration taking out all the endings plus the DLC should be approximately 16-20 hours.\n\nBaroque Decay Games, homeland developer, gives us an impressive and essential story for those who like mystery with a touch of horror.

It's REALLY BAD when it tries to add other gameplay elements. \n\nEnemy AI is frustrating and makes some entire floors a pain to visit since you spend so much time hiding. Boss fights / minigames don't explain what you're meant to do, and what you're meant to do often turns out to be finicky to pull off consistently. Player movement is fine for exploring but feels clunky once you need to move a certain way at a certain time. And some enemies are basically designed to kill you on your first encounter (or at least seriously wound you), so you reload and approach it differently.\n\nAll of this would be less of a problem if the game didn't have an ink-ribbon style limited save system. I understand this is meant to make you more cautious and care if you die, but this isn't a survival game like Resident Evil, it's a story game. The fear of dying comes from knowing you'll have to read through all the same dialogue again, or worse, you'll have to complete a really annoying boss or minigame again.\n\nThis game has a lot of good stuff going on, which plenty of other reviews already praise it for. But the \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews gave me the impression this game is highly polished. I'm leaving a review to point out this problem that affected my enjoyment, so that others get a more full idea of this game's pros and cons.", "timestamp_created": 1631749568, "timestamp_updated": 1631749568, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635183990001678467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99403350": {"recommendationid": "99403350", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980337110", "num_games_owned": 1274, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 675, "last_played": 1631721615}, "language": "english", "review": "None of it made any sense.\n\nIt's not bad, it's just not good.\n\nGraphically, we all know good pixel art and this one is not. The animations also aren't worth mentioning. Pretty much all the game is made of the same assets but they are more of less hidden by pitch black darkness or fog, or colored lighting. The character design is horrible. They're not much but they are enough to be repulsive. They're also as deep as two portraits above ten lines of dialogue.\n\nStorywise, it's a mess. It is half horror, half goofy, but 100% complete nonsense. There is a non-subtle satire of corporate society, but because it is pushed to the absurd and because it has no link to the story, it remains meaningless. Almost none of the characters have any role to play in the unfolding events, and definitely none of the enemies have any relation with you. They have no will, they just hurt you because you happen to be there. Often, some plot elements are introduced, only to be completely forgotten afterwards. It's worse than the typical mcguffins because they have no incidence at all on the plot.\n[spoiler]Get the book -> \"The book is useless, and I already had thousands of copies anyway\"\nGet the videoclub membership -> Does nothing\nGet the familiars -> Does nothing either\nGet the dagger -> \"I won't let you use it. In fact I'll destroy it.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThe puzzles also are a mess. Although most of them are straightforward like activating switches, using the right item at the right place, and so on, the most important ones which will affect the plot are on drugs.\nOne example :\n[spoiler]When you beat a giant humanoid mechanical spider, an owl escapes. You find the owl in some other place, and you need to put sleeping pills in a fountain for it to be groggy so you can snatch its jeweled eye so you can enter a crypt, and if you found and lit all the altars around the building you will then meet Jesus which will tell you a story about what's going on, only to find out that this story is not true.[/spoiler]\nYou don't really have any choices either. There are lots of different endings and some parts of the game can change entirely according to what you did or what item you possess, but nothing warns you that it may be the case. You can be roaming around looking for things to do and suddenly you've triggered an event that will force you into the next stage of the game. So you never know what you should do first. You spend most of your time not knowing what you are doing or why.\nAnd the protagnist is so stupid he has to be taught he can hide under the desks or inside closets. There are monsters everywhere killing everyone but he only accepts to grab slices of cheese and sodas. Can't even just say he needs to takes a piss to ditch a dire unfolding event. It's pathetic more than anything.\n\nBut the atmosphere, the ambiance, is well delivered. It still is the cheap distorded sounds in a pitch black room with enemies lurking, but it does the job. Although there is magic involved and nothing is explained or thought through, even if it is one those stories where no matter the clues you have you just know the writers can pull anything out of their asses whenever they want, you still want to know what's going on and it keeps you in.\nSadly, the only scary thing is the save mechanism. You're not scared of what the silly grotesque slowpoke enemies might do to you, you're scared that you'll have to do the last 30 minutes all over again if you fail. You cannot risk trying things out when you most need to try things out or you will have to do it all again.

The atmosphere is stellar --it really nailed the sense of black comedy while still being creepy as hell. Bright colors, great visuals that do a lot with simple pixels, and a level of surreal weirdness that forces you to just take whatever fucked up shit is happening at face value gives the whole game a sort of nightmarish quality that I really liked. The sound design is also killer (on top of the great soundtrack). \n\nSurvival encounters were tense without veering into frustrating; I did find a few of the puzzles kind of obtuse, but I'm not so good at puzzles, so I'm maybe a bad judge here. The writing was genuinely funny and heartfelt, too, as well as offering a fresh take on the well-traveled ground of \"work sucks and corporations are incomprehensible soul-sucking entities\". \n\nThe limited availability of items to save your game was an interesting idea, but I'm not sure it really impacted my play experience either positively or negatively. I didn't save constantly like I might have in another game, but I also never felt in much danger of running out, and honestly I'm not sure running out of it would have enhanced the feeling of survival or resource management that much if I had. I also sort of felt underwhelmed by the endings: [spoiler]I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop with Brian, for something big to be revealed about him and especially for the Yuppie Devil suit to become a super significant element, given its prominence in the official art and also how striking an image it makes, but aside from an implied connection to Rei's father it's sort of an afterthought. I don't MIND the protagonist being just a well-meaning Everyman, exactly, but it felt like ultimately he ended up lacking a bit of depth compared to the Sintra family drama[/spoiler].\n\nAs a bonus, the collectible VHS tapes and plot relevant art gallery showcase some really fantastic horror art in and of themselves.", "timestamp_created": 1631235818, "timestamp_updated": 1631235818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99071026": {"recommendationid": "99071026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870751316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 661, "last_played": 1631663445}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is already excellent on its own merits such as the puzzles, collectibles and story, but seeing Guru's art in this game made me love it.", "timestamp_created": 1631226638, "timestamp_updated": 1631226638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98997466": {"recommendationid": "98997466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026774037", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1628242277}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Don't sleep on this game.

People define themselves with what they are doing and who pays them for their work. Yuppie Psycho more or less directly captures the player with its atmosphere and the MC becomes an extension of reflection. Brian, the MC, is thrown into a situation of absurdity, yet it remains somewhat understandable. Everything is surreal, but it makes sense in a twisted kind of way. Everyone has gone insane to a certain degree, but a job can be worth your sanity. \nAt least it is more than nothing. At least you are more than nothing.\n\n[h1]Working All Day[/h1]\nThe gameplay of Yuppie Psycho is somewhat tedious, because it has been inspired by nothing else than \u201cThe Witch\u2019s House\u201d. Brian mainly just runs around and uses items from his inventory to collect other items. Often puzzles are involved which are not to difficult, yet they remain extremely entertaining.\nOften Survival Horror Games are extremely hard to make them challenging and the riddles become too abstract, just to mess with the player. \nWhile there is a charm to it, Yuppie Psycho is a lot more casual and becomes playable for someone who does not want to repeat the same sequence often. \nYuppie Psycho is a lot closer to the first Resident Evil in terms of design philosophy. Only the ability to fight back is something that Yuppie Psycho does not offer. While boss fights exist (and they are often really atmospheric and pretty good for such a game albeit the limits show), they are the exception. Frontal Engages are just not an option, because the player lacks the means to fight back. You are not a trained killer, you are just a random guy that wants to survive. \nPersonally I think that the gameplay is the weakest part of the game. It is not fun, but it carries the momentum of the atmosphere and is vital for the experience. Changing something would ruin the intended immersion. \n\n[h1]A Good Worker Is Always Vigilant[/h1]\nRessources are limited and can not be farmed. Everything has value and can be used one way or another. This means that searching through everything is a virtue that has to become a quality of the player. Loot everything, nothing is holy. Yuppie Psycho stacks the odds against the player. No specials power, even saving the game is a limited resource.\nYuppie Psycho asks you to stay tuned and never let your guard down. Luck favors the prepared. Always stay prepared and you will master your job.\n\n[h1]Dark Elements[/h1]\nThis game is scary. No cheap jumpscares, but psychological horror that combines with the stress to survive. While no real punishments exist, the imagery and themes are scary enough to confuse the watcher. A lack of light and a good knowledge of color palettes formed a visually interesting spectacle that sometimes transcends pixel art. The music is good, but somewhat forgettable. It firmly lands in the \u201cgood ambient music\u201d category.\nTo get the greater picture, the player has to remain interested and focused. Witch means that you have to pay attention to any detail that crosses your way. There are always two layers to anything that you see and that is not good for your understanding, but it will pay off, if you keep asking the right questions.\nA\u0309\u035e\u0325\u032e\u0333\u033cl\u0300\u0312\u0314\u0338\u0323\u035a\u0317\u032a\u0345\u0330\u0329\u0349w\u0302\u0489\u032a\u031f\u033b\u0329a\u0314\u0369\u035d\u0330\u032f\u0355y\u036f\u0305\u0305\u0364\u0334\u0349\u034e\u031d\u032e\u032ds\u0363\u035f\u032e\u031c\u0319\u0355 \u033f\u030f\u0308\u035c\u031e\u0359\u033c\u0332\u0355\u0339\u0326\u031cf\u034a\u0336\u033b\u032b\u0316\u0333\u031e\u032f\u0345e\u036f\u0305\u034b\u035c\u031f\u033a\u0356\u031c\u032ca\u0307\u0343\u035f\u0359\u033b\u0325r\u0304\u0352\u036d\u035f\u0356\u032e\u0326\u0324\u0347\u0319\u034e \u0304\u033d\u035c\u0345\u0332\u033a\u031e\u0319d\u036c\u0361\u032c\u0354\u034d\u0356\u0326\u034d\u031du\u0310\u0301\u0321\u0332\u0331\u0359\u0347\u0325a\u0344\u0306\u0350\u0362\u0323\u0333\u0347\u0325\u0317\u032cl\u033e\u030a\u035d\u033b\u0317i\u034b\u0364\u0342\u0362\u032d\u0330\u034dt\u0351\u0346\u0304\u0303\u0334\u0330\u032ay\u0342\u0302\u031a\u0338\u0347\u0347\u031f\u0316\u0324\n\n[h1]Parody Elements[/h1]\nYuppie Psycho is extremely entertaining in terms of social critique. Useless unions, extreme motivation boni, indifference to your colleagues and a lot more. If you have ever worked in a big company:\nYuppie Psycho will feel right at home. I can not stress how funny this game becomes, if you get the references. I imagine that someone in the staff was like: What if we took every stereotype of the modern big company workforce and turned it up to eleven. And then they just rolled with it.\nAbsolutely hilarious.\n\n[h1]Problems[/h1]\nPlaying through Yuppie Psycho is a slog at times. The gameplay just is not enjoyable, because it is supposed to be trial and error at times. While Yuppie Psycho is not too difficult, dying is extremely scary just because of the thought of repeating actions. \nLimited saving like in Resident Evil has become an outdated concept. There are clear problems with it: It demotivates the player and encourages to spoil oneself to make sure when to save. Making an interesting game that is too tedious to play through always steps closer to the Pathologic line: \nGreat to watch and discuss, but terrible to actually play. \nChecking everything is also tedious and has to be repeated, if the loot tour ends with the death of the player. \nThe biggest problem I have with Yuppie Psycho is that many aspects feel relatively isolated and do not connect with the greater themes of the game. At least they are not obvious enough for an untrained eye such as mine and many things stays shrouded in mystery. While the approach absolutely has some strong points and adds to the surreal flare, it makes some aspects dubious and good and informative discussions can lead to nothing. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nYuppie Psycho absolutely nails its intentions and atmosphere. The individual scenarios and the dialogue as well as the visual design carry the game and this makes Yuppie Psycho extremely entertaining, but it slightly overstays its welcome and the gameplay can be off-putting. \n\n[quote=author]\nTo be a little more direct: As of now meme curators dominate Steam.

The art style really stands out at times, but the pixel art most of the game takes place in does it somewhat of an injustice. The level design is usually good, and I enjoyed the vast majority of the puzzles you're presented with. It also has some great characters in it and a fun sense of humor. Boss fights are unique yet kinda boring when you understand what to do. However, there are cool little interlude/miniboss things that add fun variety. That said, gameplay tends to center around avoiding enemies - which also gets boring. Overall the story was interesting and I wanted to find out more and complete the game. \n\nAfter I completed it I realized I missed a lot and felt like I didn't get the full story. This was actually a little discouraging as I wasn't sure I wanted to re-play it because of the aforementioned boring parts. I may go for a completionist run, and it will go much faster in theory, but completing a game and feeling like you missed or actually missed major/revealing story elements isn't my cup of tea for this type of quasi point-and-click action-adventure game.\n\nStill, this is a recommend because it's a unique game and weaves an interesting story.

Yuppie Psycho is the single most complex RPGMaker game I've ever seen and played. Remember all those compelling horror RPGMaker titles we used to play and love 10 years ago for free (majority of which are here on Steam now by the way)? Well, this game is exactly that, but on steroids.\n\nYuppie Psycho makes excellent use of scripts, sound and video effects to convey exactly what it wants to and does so in the best way possible. The sound design is really good, the pixelated artstyle does fit the overall theme (and budget I'd assume) and, coupled with some good quality anime cutscenes and fantastic sprites, it truly manages to create a great atmosphere.\nBut not only that, the storyline while a little short, is really well crafted, with multiple threads parallel to one another and multiple endings with the same level of mystery, bittersweet resolution and complexity that a Silent Hill from the days of old could provide. I dont compare just any title to sacred milestones of the past such as the SH series; it is my firm belief that this small gem, if polished a little further, could reach its full potential very soon. For now it has all the qualities of an indie classic and it absolutely deserves to be played.\n\nThe player takes the role of Brian Pasternack, a nobody with no qualifications out in the boonies that is suddenly summoned for immediate employment in a megacorporation in the big city called Sintracorp. Upon arriving with his new suit just freshly ironed by his mother, Brian will discover that the work environment is not only toxic, brutal, dark and gloomy, but also... deadly.\nShortly after becoming acquainted with some of his new colleagues, he will receive his first task: Kill the Witch.\nDespite the silly premise at first, coupled with small genuine moments of laughter where comedic reliefs come in to help ease the tension of the adventure, the game holds no punches: there are some pretty brutal scenes, ranging from simple murder to people bathing in blood and more psychological horror such as being bullied by colleagues, crunch, and all the typical terrible working conditions that a megacorporation with little scruples provides: The little everyday horrors that human beings in such environments have to face. Those are then intertwined with the more fantastical takes that often spin those concepts up to 9000.\nTo face all this, Brian will have to use a full invntory system with classical point-and-click elements in full ADV fashon, with the added benefit of being able to craft healing items. He can also hide under desks and inside closets, move objects out of the way, use flashlights and glowsticks to keep track of where he is (there are lots of pitch black areas) and occasionally make use of the dialogue system with multiple choices to trick people - ahtough this one is more of an addition  for flavor at the end of the day.\nThe overall tone of the adventure is very gloomy as you'd expect, with very brief moments of positivity [spoiler]being mercilessly shattered[/spoiler] sprinkled throughout.\nI admire the bold choices made to highlight the state the player is in after each ending, which provides an additional extra scene detailing some of the things Brian has missed for a future playthrough, or simply adding more lore to some of the characters. This is one of those games that wont spell out anything for the player: lore bits and pieces are scattered in each ending and to complete the big picture for a satisfactory conclusion you \"have\" to play every path.\nThis is also rather important because at the end of the day one has to be prepared for a continuous string of misfortunes, secret plots, and twists that will spiral Brian towards an even gloomier series of events. \nMake no mistake, there is no joyful ending at the end of the tunnel. The player can only choose how deeply [spoiler]it will sink into depresssion and bitterness[/spoiler] and every second of it is well thought out.\n\nIt is rare for me to care about a bunch of 8 pixel frames but Yuppie Psycho definitely managed to make me do so. This is a pretty big accomplishment by itself. I have no doubt that in time, this title may become a classic in its own right.", "timestamp_created": 1625917396, "timestamp_updated": 1625917570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

As many have wished before, I wish there was a neutral option for reviews, but considering how frustrated I am at the moment, I let my feelings take the reins and decided to go with not recommended. For all intensive purposes though, this is actually \"neutral\". This will also be spoiler free.\n\nIs this a good game?\n\nYes\n\nBut also no.\n\nYuppie Psychos greatest strength is how well it drives you to want to know what in the world is happening. Things become more and more bizzare as the game goes on and it's pretty much impossible to predict what's going to happen next, which means it's really easy for the game to intrigue and surprise you. The story in general is done really well, and I appreciate the fact that there is multiple endings. This alone was enough to make me want to push through for a very long time because I was invested.\n\nThe other thing that the game does well (most of the time) is push you towards your objective. At the beginning especially they walk the fine line between too hard and too easy very consistently, and simply paying attention pays off a lot. The game often gives you fairly direct clues, but it's delivered organically so it's not overbearing and you can miss it if your rushing or distracted.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the end of good things I have to say about the game, and from here on we will be talking about the issues, and I'm going to make clear some red flags so that you can decide if this game is worth it for you. Honestly, I'm surprised this game has an overwhelmingly positive rating despite these issues, but I'm willing to admit that some of these might just be the game clashing with how I play. When all is said and done, I'm just trying to provide helpful information.\n\n1. Long periods of waiting. \n\nThis game is definitely not the first, and surely not the last, to struggle with this issue. Yuppie psycho is half adventure game and half survival horror game, and as such, there are many many segments where you need to avoid enemies that are patrolling areas. There are a ridiculous number of times where your sitting and waiting way longer then necessary because the enemies take 42 years to start the patrol cycle over or turn around. I'm not even an impatient person, but eventually it got to me because it happened so many times. Several \"bosses\" are major offenders here, and one in particular is absolutely ridiculous, which is a shame because thematically it was my favorite. Dying and having to reload seriously compounds this issue and propels it to maddening heights however, because you very well might have to redo these segments multiple times, meaning you wait over... and over... and over... and over again.\n\n2. The executive edition. \n\nYuppie Psycho released additional content after it was released that added a bunch of stuff, which is good right?\n\nWell, sorta. \n\nThe problem is they took this as an opportunity to change a bunch of things and move a bunch of shit around. You might read this and be like: \"So? why does it matter if I haven't played the game yet?\" Well dear reader, that's because it fucks up half the guides and walkthroughs. Trying to find help on what to do in this game is a nightmare. If you don't ever use guides or walkthroughs then this point is, of course, completely moot. For me though, as a working adult that likes to optimize my free time, once I spend a certain amount of my limited existence trying to figure out an objective it's walkthrough time, because I want to like, experience the whole game. So, If your like me and you've left the shame of \"cheating\" by the wayside in favor of not spending 3 hours walking in circles trying to find what you missed, be aware that finding the answers to your pleas for help can be a frustrating experience of it's own because the developers pulled a DS2:SOTFS.\n\n3. Limited resources. \n\nNo, for the love of god, don't take this as me saying that limited resources are bad. Horror games use limited resources to build tension, and it's incredibly effective. Dead space 3 is a fantastic example of how much you can hurt your game by removing this barrier. However, the necessity of limited resources in Yuppie Psycho is highly debatable, and to be clear I'm talking more about the saves then I am the health items. You need to use an item to save, which would be fine, except it makes problem #1 even worse. I wanted to save infrequently because I didn't know how many save items they would give, and because of this there were many times I had to restart areas (that take a long time). The fact that they give you a good amount is irrelevant, because many games often give you a surplus early and then as time progresses you get less and less. You have no way of knowing if this is the case on your first playthrough.\n\nAs for health items, I thought for the most part it was balanced well. Personally though, I restarted many areas so I could take less damage and conserve healing, so while technically self inflicted, this also increased tedium as a result of the games mechanics.\n\n4. The dreaded point of no return. \n\nIt boggles my mind how this is still an issue after video games have been around this long. I understand the point of no return, and I understand why it's completely necessary in a game with multiple routes. What is unforgivable though, is having no clear indication that you've reached it. There is nothing I'm more thankful for then when a game is like, \"yo, be careful because you wont be able to go back here anymore.\" Not a single time has this ever ruined my immersion, much less the experience.\n\nYou know what DOES ruin the experience though? Finding our you just ruined your entire save file (ruined meaning certain things you would have wanted to do or get are locked, not that the file is literally broken) because you passed a point of no return way back. This is much less of an issue if your already planning on replaying the game or if the game is short, but the thought of having to go through all those long sections full of waiting that Yuppie Psycho is stuffed with is soul crushing when your already frustrated. \n\nSo, I'm going to do my best to warn you when you've gone too far without spoiling anything so that you can avoid this. As far as I know you should still be able to access anything before this point, so simple adhere to this warning: DO NOT GO TO THE PARTY. IF YOUR AT THE PARTY AND YOU HAVEN'T COLLECTED EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO COLLECT, RELOAD.\n\nIn summery, I believe Yuppie Psycho is an engaging adventure game with a fantastic horror narrative that's unfortunately bogged down by it's incredibly weak and tedious survival horror mechanics. I think the game would have benefited much by committing to the adventure game side of the experience and leaving most of the exhausting survival horror mechanics at the wayside. Now that I've already committed so much time to playing already I'll of course finish, and because of my OCD brain I may even force myself to go through again to get all the achievements, but the truth is this was easily an experience I could have skipped in favor of watching a well done playthrough so I could see the story.\n\nIf you don't have a problem with/can suffer through the negatives that I listed, then you should get it, because it really is a unique and engaging story experience.\n\nBut if any of those things I listed dredge up PTSD memories of past experiences that have subjected you to the same infuriating or exhausting problems, you should probably give this a skip.\n\nAs an adventure game / narrative experience it's an astounding 9/10 or 10/10\n\nAs a survival horror game it's an abysmal 2/10\n\nFeel free to comment and tell me what an idiot I am for not being able to appreciate everything this game does, and have a wonderful day.", "timestamp_created": 1623863591, "timestamp_updated": 1623867783, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70176851749420166", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93834655": {"recommendationid": "93834655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200160975", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1696913893}, "language": "english", "review": "aesthetically pleasing and very funny, also very spooky. love it, play it.", "timestamp_created": 1623816194, "timestamp_updated": 1623816194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564220190048217773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93823703": {"recommendationid": "93823703", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122321710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 484, "last_played": 1623865902}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a little frustrating at times and playing it for long periods of time makes it lag or glitch, but other than that it's super good!", "timestamp_created": 1623794574, "timestamp_updated": 1623794574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93748153": {"recommendationid": "93748153", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096200951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1942, "last_played": 1619505525}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game!

Top down 2-D survival horror is not my wheel house, but a friend basically threw this at me and said \"PLAY IT\" and I was all \"Okay\", so I did, and I actually had pretty good time. Without going into spoiler territory you play as a regular dude who got a job offer out of nowhere to work at whats essentially the world's biggest mega-corporation. Taking the opportunity, when you get there nothing seems right from the get go and things only get weirder from there.\n\nGameplay is fairly straightforward, WSAD to move, E to use or examine, ect. The real meat of the gameplay is puzzles, searching the environment for stuff, and hiding from things that want to kill you. The game seems to be a decent length considering its a survival horror with multiple endings from a indie developer and not a AAA studio, my playthrough ended up at 12 hours, and that was with a friends help and finding most (but not all) of the optional side stuff. The game feels like its the right amount of stingy when it comes to resources. I never really ran completely dry but I came really close at points. For big \"boss\" encounters they felt appropriately hard but not frustrating, with some brain power you can figure out what to do, then you just need to do it (which is where the hard part kicks in). In my playthrough I encounter no real game braking jank, Yuppie Psycho was basically glitch free.\n\nMusic wise the game is fantastic, they got the same guy who did the VA-11 HALL-A soundtrack in to do this. The menu music, tracks for when things get creepy, the songs when the plot kicks it, they're all pretty great. Personally I see the art as a mixed bag, the standard zoomed out sprites for regular people end up looking like they have noodle limbs and matchstick arms, along with no real expression you can see, the dialog sprites for characters however are much better and expressive. The animated cutscenes go even further, and are a genuine treat when they pop up.\n\nThe spook factor is pretty good, the devs made good use of sound and other things besides \"haha I made the loud noise :)\" to make parts of the game decently unnerving. They got me pretty good a couple of times, though the game introduces more comedic elements near the mid point of the game that kind of take the edge off, which I think they could do without. Despite that the game did a really good job making me feel \"Wow I wish I wasn't here right now\"\n\nPROS: Spooky, good music, lots of secret stuff, great finale\n\nCONS: noodle arm sprites, is funny when maybe it shouldn't be\n\nI say Yuppie Psycho is an 8/10 video game, would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1620425366, "timestamp_updated": 1620443847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91605384": {"recommendationid": "91605384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202038644", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1334, "last_played": 1620766414}, "language": "english", "review": "One \"HELL\" of a job...!", "timestamp_created": 1620417496, "timestamp_updated": 1620417496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91508296": {"recommendationid": "91508296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260475755", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1570, "last_played": 1620261895}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game for almost 30 hours and got every 48 achievements I have to say that I loved it.\n\nGood:\n\n-Excellent music and sounds: this is what I liked most about this game, the music blends with the environment perfectly, giving chills when is necessary and relaxing moments when is necessary. Using my headset, the sounds of every step or monster noises are so distinguishable that makes possible for the player know where exactly are the other characters (and enemies). The sounds feel real, like if I was really interacting with the item.\n-Characters: The characters in the game are well written and really consistent, this is something I value heavily for story rich games. Also[spoiler], the main villain depends on what route/ending you are approaching. Despite they are villains and made atrocious stuff, I felt that I could understand them and their motives [/spoiler].\n-Puzzles: Not very easy and not very hard too, I prefer horror games that I have got no weapons, just my brain. [spoiler]I consider the pencils more as keys that a weapon.[/spoiler]\n\nBad:\n\n-Bugs: I completed the game 48/48 achievement, including the one \"Unique Soul\", and during this run [spoiler]after Doshi upgraded my flashlight with the red piece I wasn't able to use it anymore, which was terrible because I couldn't to illuminate my way, only with the light sticks, making it somewhat stressful but at the end I just considered it a new challenge. But I was scared when at the end of the birthday party Doshi asks Brian to illuminate the elevator and I thought that I was going to get stuck there forever, luckily I had the lantern, but not everyone is going to find it[/spoiler]. Also there is another bug that sometimes when I pick a light stick in the ground, the spot still has light, which is beneficial to the player, but in the end it's still a bug.\n\nNot bad but not good either:\n\n-Some parts are still unfinished and many questions remains unsolved.

That isn't going to be easy because Witch is constantly hunting you and she's trying to block your progress. There are no auto saves.

I think the game isn't too challenging, there aren't any cheap deaths or enemies that instakill you.

Interesting characters, well written story, and a unique setting. I heard office adventure/survival horror and was curious, well they definitely pulled it off. I typically don't play adventure games like this. Usually I take a long time to work my way through them, this however was very fun from start to finish. Nothing in the concept or story dragged to where I felt the need to put it down. Quite the opposite I wanted to continue playing all the way till the end.\n\nAnd you know what, I'm still playing it! I did finish the game and get one of the endings. But there are multiple and there are some rooms and events I didn't trigger my first play through. Now I'm hunting down all I missed. The game play is a standard adventure style. You have an inventory system and must use it to progress through areas and trigger story events to move on. There are boss battles and how you tackle those are unique. (One of my absolute favorites was TV Head Man). The puzzles are not overly complex and that I praise the game for. I'm not one for puzzles. It had just enough to make me think about my surroundings, but not overly complex where I was putting the game down to try again later. Game play and puzzles 10/10 (for me)\n\nThe music is downright amazing too! I caught myself staying in certain areas just jamming out to it. 10/10\n\nThe story is very unique. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. These games can always be a hit or a miss. The characters are well written and there's enough crazy things going on to want to know more about these characters and what the overall plot turns out to be. I won't spoil anything at all, but I wasn't prepared for some of the crazy shit that happens in this game. Story/Characters 10/10 (All hail Sosa, I want to be in her goth club)\n\nGraphics are in that nostalgic 8bit/16bit whatever you wanna call it bit style. I love it. The cut scenes are awesome looking as well. 10/10\n\nLength of the game is fairly short. As you can see I beat it in about 15/16hrs. I wish it was longer! However I do state I missed some areas and events that I'm replaying to figure out how to unlock. So there is probably more content here that I did miss. For a game that's only 16 bucks, get it. If you read this and saw the trailers above and it seems like a game that'd be up your alley. Buy this. I want this dev to make more games, because this one knocked it out of the park for me. I'll also be buying their first game as well The Count Lucanor and I'll leave a review of that as well when I finish that too.\n\nI can't hype this game up enough.

Me avisaron de Yuppie Psycho porque saben que adoro este tipo de juegos.\n\nPara hacerlo m\u00e1s simple, Yuppie Psycho es un juego pixelado de Puzles, de miedo, pero de miedo de admitir que he soltado alg\u00fan gritito y de tener que sobrevivir a este primer d\u00eda de trabajo.\n\nDurante toda la historia seremos Brian Pasternack, un joven que ha sido seleccionado para trabajar en Sintracorp, la empresa m\u00e1s grande del mundo y, realmente, nos tienen un trabajo un tanto inusual.\n\nAhora bien, profundizando un poco m\u00e1s sobre el juego, la historia me ha gustado bastante. Me ha tomado por sorpresa la personalidad de muchos de los compa\u00f1eros y los giros que dan algunas de las conversaciones ya que, sin lugar a dudas, te hace muchas veces entrar en tensi\u00f3n, te toma por sorpresa o realmente te hace pensar qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 pasando por aqu\u00ed.\n\nCada personaje es muy bueno e incluso acabas tom\u00e1ndole cari\u00f1o a alguno que otro y ganas de estrangular a otros tantos, haciendo incluso creer que todo lo que pasa es a causa de ellos, hasta que aparece otro y, nuevamente, logra confundirte. Por lo que, realmente, acabas encontr\u00e1ndote con personajes distintos, bien definidos y que, desde luego, te har\u00e1 cambiar de opini\u00f3n muchas veces sobre qui\u00e9n est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s de todo lo que ocurre.\n\nAunque el tema de la historia para m\u00ed no es algo tan original, s\u00ed es cierto que la manera en la que est\u00e1 desarrollada es muy buena, en el sentido de, aunque la frustraci\u00f3n se presente en alg\u00fan puzle o en alg\u00fan nivel, las ganas de ver qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1 despu\u00e9s de hacer eso est\u00e1n ah\u00ed.\n\n\nSin embargo, el peso que ten\u00eda para m\u00ed la historia y el llegar al fondo del asunto era muy importante y era la principal motivaci\u00f3n para continuar avanzando y repetir fases de ser necesario. Sent\u00ed que, tanto al llegar a la parte importante como al final de la historia, pas\u00f3 demasiado r\u00e1pido en comparaci\u00f3n al nudo de toda la historia. Quiz\u00e1s de la manera en la que se plante\u00f3 era suficiente, pero realmente hubiese estado genial alargar un poco m\u00e1s la historia y que no fuese algo que finalizara tan pronto.\n\n\n\n\nAlgo peculiar con lo que me encontr\u00e9 en el juego es que no tendremos la libertad de guardar la partida siempre que queramos ya que, para ello, tendremos un papel especial, el \"Papel de Bruja\" el cual es el que nos permitir\u00e1 fotocopiar (en una fotocopiadora, por supuesto) nuestra alma y estar a salvo por si llegamos a morir en alg\u00fan punto (recuerda siempre mirar estas fotocopias, es bastante interesante lo que te puedes llegar a encontrar).\n\nEste aspecto es algo que me tom\u00f3 por sorpresa ya que anteriormente no hab\u00eda jugado a alg\u00fan t\u00edtulo que realmente me hiciera pensar cu\u00e1ndo era el momento adecuado para guardar. Cu\u00e1ndo cre\u00eda yo que era necesario gastar este valioso papel para seguir avanzando o cu\u00e1ndo ya hab\u00eda avanzado lo suficiente y no quer\u00eda volverlo a repetir.\n\nSin lugar a dudas el miedo lo ten\u00eda siempre en el cuerpo. Aunque tenemos de sobra, s\u00ed hay veces que por miedo llegas a guardar cada medio segundo y, otras veces, te toma por sorpresa algunas situaciones dentro de la historia que te har\u00e1n repetir un buen trozo del juego y realmente replantearte tu existencia.\n\n\n\n\nLos puzles realmente no son complicados, ni tampoco aburridos. Son algunos frustrantes y me parece sublime la manera que han tenido de combinar junto con los puzles, las im\u00e1genes y un sonido ambiental que te hace estar en tensi\u00f3n y he de admitir que alguna que otra vez he gritado. Por lo que, creo que en este aspecto han hecho un trabajo m\u00e1s que incre\u00edble.\n\nLa jugabilidad tampoco es algo del otro mundo ni es nada dif\u00edcil de aprender, y tampoco es que deber\u00eda ser complicado para este tipo de juegos. Tendremos algunas habilidades como escondernos y podremos hacer uso de alg\u00fan que otro objeto de manera puntual, pero nada m\u00e1s.\n\nSi necesit\u00e1is un resumen r\u00e1pido sobre el juego y si realmente es rentable hacerte con \u00e9l, la respuesta es: S\u00cd. Aunque hayan aspectos negativos, estos no superan a todos los aspectos positivos que tiene y lo mucho que se disfruta a la hora de jugarlo.\n\nSi tuviese que destacar algo, para m\u00ed ser\u00eda el hecho de que, sin ser un juego hiperrealista han conseguido tenerte en tensi\u00f3n y pasar miedo en muchas de las situaciones, forz\u00e1ndote a poner todos tus sentidos aunque realmente no lo necesites porque, la adrenalina y ese sentido de supervivencia est\u00e1n ah\u00ed.\n\nPod\u00e9is leer la rese\u00f1a en nuestra web: https://www.indiefaktory.com/2019/05/review-yuppie-psycho.html\n\nO en nuestro grupo de Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/IndieFaktory", "timestamp_created": 1618702563, "timestamp_updated": 1618702563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90397183": {"recommendationid": "90397183", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992056750", "num_games_owned": 1469, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1290, "last_played": 1618483045}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely solid survival horror in the vein of classic Resident Evil, with a fun new \"corporate satire\" flavour.

The music is surprisingly good, too. Each song felt like it fit what I was feeling at the time, and the absence of music is used well. The story was interesting enough for me to want to see what happened next, and I ended up liking most of the characters. Most importantly, the gameplay was fun. There was a good variety of puzzles, and none of them made me feel too stupid or bored. Enemy encounters usually resulted in running away from them and hiding under tables or in closets, but there were \"bossfights\" that change up what you have to do, and the game usually gives advice on how to approach them in subtle but not too subtle ways.  Lastly, there were plenty of times where the game did spook me, but it didn't rely too much jumpscares, so I liked it. Having to traverse through dark corridors with somewhat limited light sources was fun despite having to navigate around roaming enemies at times. \n\nOverall, I liked it a lot.

Ambientado en unas oficinas de los a\u00f1os 90, con mucho humor, personajes muy locos y que no se cortan en soltarte lo que piensan de ti, horror psic\u00f3tico y con muchos easter eggs, pero infinitos: desde la b\u00fasqueda incansable por todo el edificio de VHS de pel\u00edculas caseras a puertas y habitaciones ocultas.\nNo os esper\u00e9is \u201cpor su apariencia\u201d un juego cuco o sencillo. Las muertes est\u00e1n a la vuelta de cada esquina y los sustos asegurados, con esos agentes de vigilancia en persecuci\u00f3n por zonas muy oscuras, y Brian con unas lastimosas barritas de luz y un simple caf\u00e9 para curarse un poquito.\nConsejo, id varias veces a la cocina y BUSCAR bien en cada lugar y caj\u00f3n ingredientes y alimentos para curar a nuestro amigo Brian. Lo vais a necesitar.\n\nGran parte de Yuppie Psycho usa cinem\u00e1ticas propias de un juego de terror, pero lo absurdo de la ambientaci\u00f3n y c\u00f3mico de sus di\u00e1logos, rompen la tensi\u00f3n y esa atm\u00f3sfera de horror y agobio de sus escenarios, para darnos a los jugadores un respirito, y que pensemos: bueno, no ha sido para tanto.\nEl juego juega con el jugador con ese horror Psic\u00f3tico de matar por matar. De descabezar y acuchillar a tus compa\u00f1eros de curro por estr\u00e9s y el agobio que produce estar sentado 12h en un cub\u00edculo a media luz d\u00e1ndole a las teclas sin descanso alguno. El horror estilo american Psycho, de ese sobresalir por encima de todos sin importar el precio ni lo que nos cueste, mezclado con las historias de terror japonesas, dan el toque perfecto a este juego, y lo hacen, dir\u00eda yo, \u00fanico en su genero.\nJugablemente, Yuppie Psycho navega entre una aventura gr\u00e1fica y un survival horror. Se controla maravillosamente bien con mando o con teclado. Por un lado tendremos esa b\u00fasqueda infinita de objetos, y puzles sencillitos por todo el edificio y por el otro, los monstruos y ambiente infernal que quiere matarnos. Y no solo eso, si no que el toque de supervivencia viene dado tambi\u00e9n por la escasez de objetos de salud y puntos de guardado, los cuales necesitan de objetos para ser activados, algo as\u00ed como las cintas del primer Resident Evil, pero aqu\u00ed con tinta y folios. Os aseguro que encontrar uno os har\u00e1 dar palmas con las orejas. Aunque esto anima a jugar sin guardar durante largos per\u00edodos de tiempo, para ahorrar papel, pero tambi\u00e9n es peligroso por las muertes\u2026\n\nEl edificio es enorme y tiene una cantidad proporcional de secretos, rutas alternativas y zonas opcionales. Eso tambi\u00e9n da lugar a un par de momentos del juego en el que la forma de progresar en la historia varia, dando lugar a varios finales. El DLC gratuito y a\u00f1adido en esta edici\u00f3n, a\u00f1ade nuevas salas y nuevas formas de ejecutar y finalizar nuestro trabajo en la empresa.\nEl apartado visual es magnifico, tanto en las zonas de juego como en las cinem\u00e1ticas, el equipo espa\u00f1ol de Baroque Decay ha realizado un trabajo muy cuidado y precioso, incluso con las escenas de actores reales de los VHS de cine amateur de terror. De 10.\nLa Banda sonora viene a cargo de Michael \u201cGaroad\u201d Kelly y crea una atm\u00f3sfera escalofriante cuando tiene que ser escalofriante y tranquila o de reposo en las zonas de dialogo.\n\nYuppie Psycho es para m\u00ed una verdadera joya. Intenso y escalofriante a ratos, y c\u00f3mico y alocado en general. Con unas 22-23h de juego para ver todos los caminos y finales. Un gran descubrimiento que me ha encantado jugar a solas, sin directos, disfrut\u00e1ndolo poco a poco. Leyendo cada dialogo y comprendiendo la historia. Una historia de empresas, ejecutivos, familia, brujas y \u00bfsapos?\nSin duda alguna, muy recomendable. \nRese\u00f1a completa en mi blog: [url=https://lamazmorritacasioscura.wordpress.com/2021/03/24/jugando-a-yuppie-psycho/] [b]Jugando a: Yuppie Psycho[/b][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1616588100, "timestamp_updated": 1616588100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626064062118530273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88921229": {"recommendationid": "88921229", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991332154", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1616379686}, "language": "english", "review": "It's real good", "timestamp_created": 1616467645, "timestamp_updated": 1616467645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88915934": {"recommendationid": "88915934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015381217", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1616457802}, "language": "english", "review": "A surreal and extremely creative take on what a horror game should be, and a shining example of how indie games can be works of art.

This game was an absolute blast to play. Fun office environment to explore, great ambiance characters and dialogue throughout. \n\nThe music is composed by none other than Garoad of Va11-hall-a fame and this is in no small measure responsible for elevating the games overall atmosphere during both calm and intense moments. This is actually what led me to this game in the first place mostly, but I'm glad to say that the game itself has much more merits than just that of the excellent music.\n\nThe gameplay is very resident evil inspired in that you have limited saves that are tied to a usable item, as well as general resource management playing a big part in the gameplay experience. You'll of course find some puzzles and there are plenty of hidden items and content scattered throughout for you to explore and discover. There's not really combat, and most encounters involve you running/hiding or puzzling a way out of the situation.\n\nThe graphics while rather minimalist (outside of the cutscenes and portraits) are extremely effective and get the job done quite well. I won't lie that I often have a stigma towards pixel art games that are minimal to this level but this game really proved me wrong and served as a healthy reminder that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

The story is really interesting, the art style is well done, and the game play is a good mix of old school console action with puzzles.\n\nHowever, there are many bugs in the game engine. The sound randomly drops. The game will randomly crash, just dumping you back to desktop. Scenes will suddenly stop progressing and you have to alt-tab out and kill the game from task manager. This is couppled with a limited save mechanic. Normally having a limited number of saves would instill a sense of caution and suspense, but when the game crashes regularly and you lose 30 to 60 minutes of game play, the save mechanic just becomes irritating.\n\nI've seen discussions where people have posted this and the developer response has been lackluster at best.\n\nDo not buy this game if you don't have the patience to repeat lost game play due to crashes.\n\nI hope to see patches in the future that fix this.

The contemporary/futuristic/alternative-history setting where an Apple/Microsoft type company started by a lone genius and then him and his family ran into some... bad luck, is alone, an interesting idea, of course, but;\nthe idea of an office building haunted by a witch so they have to keep hiring witch hunters and giving them medieval material to use for a modern setting, the cubicles being a literal maze, employees crawl around on their knees and eat wires and act like goats, the lead of HR is a giant pair of lips that wants to taste you to determine your worth, a man wearing a soldiers uniform who is literally on his literal high horse to tell you that you're garbage unless you work at this company (it's bull-shit, btw), a man who dresses/looks like/maybe just is the devil who appears from time to time to make you question if you're actually just the milquetoast you seem to be, the fact that nobody seems to do any actual work, paper you photocopy YOUR VERY OWN SOUL ONTO, all culminates into a captivating, thrilling, surreal story.\nThis is literally one of the best horror games I have ever played.\nI usually don't go for surreal... anything, really, not that I dislike the idea, but because I like things to make sense. I find the only time surreal forms of media are ever any good is that whatever is going on, be it the story, the visuals, the characters, or just the way everything combined is portrayed, is so completely fascinating in and of itself that the very odd surrealism of the media itself doesn't hit you as 'weird! WTF is going on?!\". You don't even think to ask why something surreal happens when it happens, or if they occur to you, you gloss over them because they don't feel important. The only other surreal thing I've ever felt this strongly about is the movie Mandy, the revenge movie where a man's wife is kidnapped by a cult. There were so many things in that movie that logically didn't make any sense, but I never asked why there was a big ass wasp the cultists had in jar or ignored the fact that 'how can those bikers know whenever that... ocarina... horn... thing is being blow' because 1) everything is so interesting that I don't care, and 2) I don't feel like I need to know or that it's not important.\nAlso, the idea of using an office building as a horror setting is brilliant. I know it was done in a couple movies like Mayhem or whatever, and I never saw those so I can't comment, but I love the unique use of a brightly lit, completely calm area like this a setting. I think most people are sick of asylums, hospitals, even prisons, but the reason why a lot of those are used are because people don't typically go there everyday, they have a stigma around them, they can make people feel uncomfortable for a variety of reasons, unsafe, even. But you go to work almost every day, and you probably feel relatively safe in said work space. Brightly lit, professional, you probably have coworkers you're close with, there's an intense feel of organization and cleanliness are things I think of when I think about working in a cubicle (although the organization and cleanliness is probably all surface, since a lot of companies are either totally chaotic in terms of internal issues or do sleazy things underneath the table or both). I know I have only mentioned movies but I'm sorry, this game is too weird and unique to compare to most other games I know, but the type of setting reminds me of the Stepford Wives, which took place in a bright, beautiful suburban neighborhood, where all the creepy things were hidden in plain sight, often as the most pleasant things in the neighborhood.\nI wish more games came out like this.", "timestamp_created": 1611979701, "timestamp_updated": 1611979701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85595348": {"recommendationid": "85595348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253706069", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 7515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7514, "last_played": 1622839166}, "language": "english", "review": "This game fr rocks, highly recommend if you like good stories, good characters, fun puzzles that aren't terribly challenging but is still tons of fun, and its got some good spooks n secrets", "timestamp_created": 1611972269, "timestamp_updated": 1611972269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85593224": {"recommendationid": "85593224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026388110", "num_games_owned": 680, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1278, "last_played": 1611967915}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best 2D horror games i have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1611969063, "timestamp_updated": 1611969063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85463902": {"recommendationid": "85463902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829522068", "num_games_owned": 1394, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 996, "last_played": 1612045703}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1611783606, "timestamp_updated": 1611783606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473684221506118774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85459672": {"recommendationid": "85459672", "author": {"steamid": "76561199041381719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1611775825}, "language": "english", "review": "Well written, good characterisation, and an enthralling plot.

There are some good things about the game, but overall, it's a real mixed bag. The story, like the cast, is quite plain, middle-of-the-road, and just... there. I kind of get a self-insert vibe as well, but regardless of that... \n\nThe narrative never takes a strong direction into any potential opportunities it has, and the result is a tonally weak experience with some unexplained plot threads, a confused setting, and [i]real[/i] missed potential. Characters are very surface-level and the writing never uses comedy in service of this fact, but in hand with it, and it's just very off to see a horror game with such an absolutely middling level of self-awareness. There are even moments where it's hard to tell what kind of tone the game is taking, and it sucks, because the concept is there, but the story never leans into any real themes or meaning, and it's baffling to see it miss so hard with all of the pieces generally being in place here. \n\nI'm not personally a fan of the in-game visuals, and certain aspects of the environment are going to leave you confused as to what's interactive and what's not. You'll be checking everything only to get repeated instances of the same \"it doesn't work\" message. A single time would have been enough. Otherwise, it's a basic 2-D horror puzzle game with items to find and use in specific locations, etc. There's nothing really special about the game-play, which is why the rest of the experience is so crucial, and when it fails to impress, you're left with a very lukewarm experience.\n\nThere's also nothing scary here that goes above surprise jumps and loud sounds, and as stated before, no narrative thread to tie any of it together. There's no particular symbolism or meaning behind the imagery. It's just spooky imagery for spooky's sake, which only causes more vague confusion about the horror elements in the game when they do take place in relation to the world of this game. I've seen everything in this game and am left wondering about the nature of a lot of things in it, and not in the good, intrigued way. Feels more like I'm being cheated because they wanted bloody imagery.\n\nBasically, it feels like someone's naive, first attempt at a horror story in the form of a game. The writing and art assets strikes me as beginner, like a young artist who is still finding their footing. It's serviceable and functional, but it just fails to focus and bring it's pieces together to form anything special, and I think it fails to realize what setups and pieces are necessary to make a unique or fun, or even scary experience, in a game or otherwise.\n\nI can't recommend the game.

The atmosphere is great, and the developers definitely set the mood right. Game play is also quite good, and innovative under a certain angle. \n\nBUT!\n\nHaving said that, I feel part of the plot falls a bit flat (mild spoilers ahead). This game has two endings. One is the classic one and a second one that was introduced recently with a free DLC. Nothing to say on the one in the DLC, it actually achieves the right pace and delivers a pleasant story (even though presents more questions than answers). \n\nThe classic one (the one pre DLC) feels incredibly rushed and flat. The ending doesn't make much sense and a lot of events are just thrown in your face without much explanation. If you take this ending alone (as it was up till a bunch of weeks ago before the DLC was release) the whole story would feel flat unfortunately. It feels like there was this huge setup for something glorious that's not delivered in the end (or rather, that was rushed in the presentation). I don't know... maybe I'm growing too old for these kind of games, but I definitely hoped for something more in terms of story.\n\nLess the plot and the not great ending, this is still a good game that has its charm.

While it's not total freedom of exploration by any means, the ability to feel like I can explore parts of the building that I'm not supposed to be in yet helps a lot with my immersion.\n\nIf you even think this might be for you, I'd suggest picking it up. The writing is good, the jokes are good, the art is great, the story is interesting.

De por s\u00ed es una experiencia estresante, nunca sabes lo que te vas a encontrar. Si tu primer d\u00eda de trabajo adem\u00e1s incluye ser testigo de varios cad\u00e1veres esparcidos por aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1 entre los cub\u00edculos, monstruos variados escondidos por los departamentos, y unos compa\u00f1eros que parecen totalmente ajenos a lo que est\u00e1 pasando, la cosa se agrava bastante.\n\n\"Yuppie Psycho\" viene a ser esto, un juego que coge todos los componentes del trabajo en una oficina, con cosas como los compa\u00f1eros, el ambiente t\u00f3xico, la absurdez de muchos procedimientos corporativos, el miedo al desempleo... Y les da un giro, transform\u00e1ndolos en una experiencia de survival horror muy satisfactoria para cualquiera que haya experimentado c\u00f3mo es este tipo de trabajo, y que funciona muy muy bien y resulta muy fresca como videojuego.\n\nLa estructura del juego es la de un survival horror en que estamos pr\u00e1cticamente inofensivos. Tendremos que avanzar por el juego sin armas, ocult\u00e1ndonos de los horrores que pueblan la oficina mientras intentamos cumplir con nuestros objetivos por los distintos pisos de la empresa, y vamos recopilando objetos para solucionar los diversos puzles que se nos presentan.\n\nLas posibilidades son variad\u00edsimas, contando el juego con varias rutas muy diferenciadas en funci\u00f3n de nuestras acciones, y con m\u00faltiples finales, de nuevo muy diferentes, lo cual contribuye mucho a la rejugabilidad.\n\nEl aspecto gr\u00e1fico consiste en un pixel art de estilo retro, acompa\u00f1ado de unas intros animadas de vez en cuando muy bien realizadas. La banda sonora tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 muy currada, siendo muy pegadiza y con varios temas de mucha calidad, y para terminar con el apartado audiovisual tambi\u00e9n hay que comentar ciertas escenas de imagen real que podemos ver en el juego... Muy curiosas.\n\nComo \u00fanico punto negativo (para m\u00ed) mencionar\u00eda la forma de guardado. Es un m\u00e9todo de guardado basado en el consumo de recursos, y la verdad es que es algo que nunca ha ido conmigo. Comprendo el prop\u00f3sito de esta forma de guardado, generar m\u00e1s tensi\u00f3n en el jugador, incluir el dilema de si guardar ahora consumiendo un objeto o arriesgarse a seguir un poco m\u00e1s con el miedo de tener que repetir todo lo hecho desde el guardado anterior... Pero siento que no es un m\u00e9todo de guardado que se ajuste mucho a un estilo de juego en que a veces no tienes demasiado tiempo para sesiones de juego largas, y en que exponerse a repetir partes puede suponer perder mucho tiempo de la sesi\u00f3n de juego.\n\nEn general \"Yuppie Psycho\" me ha encantado. Me ha parecido una aut\u00e9ntica joya, con una gran historia y ambientaci\u00f3n, que se ajustar\u00eda incre\u00edblemente bien a un manga o una serie, y que me ha dejado con muchas ganas de m\u00e1s.\n\nNo puedo m\u00e1s que recomendarlo.

Soundtrack is decent and the characters are alright, if not a bit one dimensional at times. Hugo reminds me of Norton Mapes from F.E.A.R and the main character Brian looks like if Midoriya from My Hero Academia had an older brother, idk.\n\nThe overall layout design is excellent and the main character actually isn't the focal point or the cause of the whole plot for once, so stuff felt like it happened more organically, without the main character's involvement. \n\nBut I found the game's world building to be far too inconsistent, sporadic and nonexistent to be immersive and worth investing in; the game's world design is just a bunch of concepts/ideas thrown in and mashed together with no explanation and it wants you to roll with it unconditionally - Are we supposed to be in some Cyberpunk dystopia, or in conventional Japan? And why are there rebels and why do they show up only once? That scene felt incredibly out of place, even for a game like this. \n\nThe Synthwave/Vaporwave gimmick has gotten very tired at this point but thankfully here it was used sparingly. The game is a bit short if you know what to do, but it can get unbearably long if you're trying to 100% it. \n\nStill an excellent work of art to try out and is one of the most underrated indie titles I've seen released on Steam for quite a while.", "timestamp_created": 1609794764, "timestamp_updated": 1640313945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84009219": {"recommendationid": "84009219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071826058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1609785212}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent humor with just enough malice.", "timestamp_created": 1609785362, "timestamp_updated": 1609785362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83950455": {"recommendationid": "83950455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252643674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1609694990}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juega perros", "timestamp_created": 1609720657, "timestamp_updated": 1609720657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83910019": {"recommendationid": "83910019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099650601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1609409196}, "language": "english", "review": "It is longer than their last game (The Count Luranor) but I find it less satisfying.

It's incredible.\n\nLet me start by saying I'm a little squeamish when it comes to horror, I don't handle jumscares very well among other things - yet I always am drawn to the mystery and psychedelic aspects of it. And this game delivers so, so well.\n\nI am a \"Yuppie\" myself, who's been working at different corporate environments. And this game somehow manages to grasp that uncanny feeling that comes with working for a soulless corporation and twists it into a unique, often humorous terror. \n\nIf you think 'humorous' and 'terror' don't go well in one sentence, let me quote a conversation with a friend I had the other day: \"I JUST GOT BEAT UP BY ELDRITCH TV-HEADED PEOPLE AND HEALED MYSELF WITH INSTANT NOODLES STOLEN FROM THE FRIDGE IN THE CAFETERIA\". If this doesn't speak to you, then perhaps this game is not for you, and that's ok.\n\nThe atmosphere, the setting, the writing and art are so good, it's easy to forget another thing: Gameplay! And this game delivers so, so well. No cheap deaths, there are plenty of interesting ways to avoid/fight the monsters (usually the former, it wouldn't be horror otherwise), and most importantly, the progression in the game really makes you feel smart. Get this, do that, talk to this person. It's like a point-and-click game except things actually make sense. And every step you make grants great satisfaction.\n\nFor the record, I've been playing the DLC version, which has some additional content as well as an alternative endgame sequence. I've been playing for 16 hours and I saw pretty much all the content I cared to (which is almost everything!). I didn't have to consult a guide for my first ending at all. And later, when I did, it was merely to show me that I misread a part which got me stuck, the rest I got on my own.\n\nIf there's one thing I'd like to complain about is that every time I launched the game I had to re-configure my controller.

What's great is that even if the game's inspirations are pretty clear Yuppie Psycho still manages to make the best out of them and forge its own psychedelic identity.\n\nGameplay mostly consists of finding the right items, using them in the right places and solving puzzles, often times all at once. I did get stuck or lost a couple of times, but I found that to be part of the fun in finding the solutions, being stuck never got to the point of frustrating for me.\n\nStory-wise the game is interesting enough but its the characters that really make this side of the game special. Music is really good too, VA-11 Hall-A's composer Michael Garoad's style is unmistakable and his tracks fit the various situations perfectly, which contributes in making Yuppie Psycho stand out in its genre.\n\nIf you're looking to scratch that RPG-Maker horror game itch or just experience a unique and bizzare spooky game then Yuppie Psycho definitely makes the cut.", "timestamp_created": 1609178198, "timestamp_updated": 1690738500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542865574359893799", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83402849": {"recommendationid": "83402849", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014389634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1679, "last_played": 1673805734}, "language": "english", "review": "love", "timestamp_created": 1609174354, "timestamp_updated": 1610257048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83374347": {"recommendationid": "83374347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131417208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 670, "last_played": 1652227747}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate puzzle games, but this has to be my favorite game of the year.", "timestamp_created": 1609147893, "timestamp_updated": 1609147893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83353310": {"recommendationid": "83353310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000792591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1609807063}, "language": "english", "review": "Yuppie Psycho is a quirky top-down adventure-horror game that puts you into the shoes of the perpetually confused Brian, a young man who's just finished basic studies and received an unsolicited job offer from one of the largest and wealthiest corporations in the world - SintraCorp.\n\nUnsure of how he could qualify to work for such a prestigious company with no resume to speak of, Brian quickly learns that this \"dream job\" is anything but: he must find and exterminate a witch that has laid a deadly curse on the building and its employees.\n\nYuppie Psycho is drawn in a style that fuses both 8-bit and 16-bit pixel art to illustrate a beautiful (and at times unnerving) gameworld. The gameplay is largely exploring the SintraCorp HQ in a semi-linear fashion, performing mundane work tasks, solving puzzles, and trying to find clues to unravel the dark past of the Sintra family and their ties to the aforementioned witch.\n\nThe game waffles between macabre and Dilbert-esque humor (and sometimes combining the two) in its storytelling and cast of characters to really play on terms like 'toxic workplace' or 'hostile work environment', and it's super memorable. While tone of the game is overall serious, there are small bits of humor thrown in to lighten the mood. I wish I could elaborate more here, but the story is the main draw of the game so I don't want to spoil anything!\n\nThere is a health bar and limited healing items that Brian can collect, but he cannot fight enemies. He must run, hide, or sometimes solve puzzles to best his foes. The addition of the run button is especially welcome if you've played Baroque Decay's other game, The Count Lucanor, which this game shares many similarities with.\n\nThe music is another high point of Yuppie Psycho, ranging from both plucky chiptunes to foreboding and atmospheric ambiance.\n\nIf you enjoy adventure games I think this is a no-brainer, just be warned that the exploration and story are the main draws of the game. If you don't keep a keen eye out for clues and listen to the dialogue, you will likely end up stuck revisiting areas several times over, which can be very frustrating.\n\nIt is also worth nothing there is a decent amount of replayability here too, as the free Executive Edition DLC added in an entirely new story section that can act as an alternative to the second half of the original game. After you beat it once or twice on your own (I apparently played through the DLC half/endings on my first playthrough), it might be worth looking at a walkthrough to make sure you've experienced all of the branching paths the game has to offer, as all of the endings are worth seeing.", "timestamp_created": 1609124136, "timestamp_updated": 1609262093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83351742": {"recommendationid": "83351742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079149197", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 796, "last_played": 1609119244}, "language": "english", "review": "cool", "timestamp_created": 1609122543, "timestamp_updated": 1609122543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83333426": {"recommendationid": "83333426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290656306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1609636603}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes hi, I absolutely LOVE this game.

Two critically acclaimed titles under their belt; first was [b]The Count Lucanor[/b] (it's next on my list) and recently [b]Yuppie Psycho (YP)[/b] which metamorphosed into its GOTY / Executive Edition- with whole new areas, bosses and additional hours~ congratulations!! \n\nFull disclaimer, I just recently finished my first playthrough and have yet to start on the extra content!! Besides, the OG experience was already so impressionable that if anything, it should make me long for the expanded YP even more!!\n\n\n[h1]\"First Day Is Hell...\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nIt's Brian Pasternack's first day. Belonging to the much detested and marginalized 'Class G', he has had to work extra hard to pursue an education that will one day raise his standing within the stratified society. Unqualified, self-doubting- he obtains a job offer from the gigantic, mega-famed Sintracorp that is basically everyone's and their mother's dream job... Was his luck beginning to change? Or did the dream turn into a nightmare??  \n\n[spoiler] ! I'm the lowest of the low. I'm garbage[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) The Initiation[/b]\nAn office survival horror where the goal is to find out what the heck is your responsibility? On that note, you must explore the entire building in search of clues, establish new friendships and not get killed by workplace hazards!! To help you, vendors will gradually be made available; specializing from office supplies, technology and...witch paper supply? If that's not overwhelming enough- running away and hiding from some disgruntled co-workers is also a viable choice. \n\nDon't forget to take intermittent breaks because you'll soon find that stuffing your face with sandwiches, pizzas, noodles or watercooler loitering make all the difference from life and death!! Of course, if you get bored- you can get acquainted with memos, hidden VHS tapes (painful to watch) to pass the time! What monsters wouldn't let you unwind~If they don't, that's what the \"Boss\" boss fights are for~~\n\n[b](b) Dress for The Par- Division You Want!![/b]\nSetting aside the eye-popping pixel art that alternates between fully animated cutscenes and 3D static environments- the effective presentation has to do with the 10 storeys. Which not only serve different functions, their dissimilarities get further emphasized by unique, red flagged designs and atmosphere. I loved to wade through the darkness with just a glowstick and see the many colors meekly light up my path. My favorite would be the fifth floor because that's where Brian's desk is~ Hard to pick a favorite because they all stand out... and I'm not talking about aesthetics anymore O_X \n\nThankfully some characters are still sane, albeit with their own vices. There's the class-conscious Mr. Chapman, who lashes out at suburb trash, the socially awkward Miss Sosa who's seen some things and of course newbie Kate who's from a higher class but kind, fresh-faced to everything like you. The soundtrack is also equally foreboding, with what I can only describe as eighties-like and a mix of East-Asian influences. Every track has that lingering quality of etching itself into your brain and is generally pretty manic. I definitely recommend listening to it again on the in-game player.\n\n[b](c) The Higher You Climb...[/b]\nNow the story- utterly weird but feels very real as well. Minus the fictional portions, the idea of [spoiler]greed [/spoiler]bearing consequences isn't revolutionary per se but rather how it was worked in; the inclusion of a whole workplace, the stressing on class (so very Marxist)... Now I haven't worked very much myself but there's a little bit of everything in the core morals for people to take away. \n\nYou could be someone about to enter the workforce, who's very experienced or maybe even almost retiring- there are teachable moments or even ones you've faced yourself! Your first day, some backstabbing co-workers, conflict with upper management, a birthday party gone awry and other livid self-depreciating times that you've braved through!!\n\n[b](d) Not in The Job Description[/b] \nYP is absolutely scary and that's before the deeper minutiae of analyzing the horror beneath. \n1st) The title taught me a new word, YUP that's right! So it means a crazy, well-dressed and established professional. That's kinda contradictory when you think about it but I'll just leave it at that. \n\n2nd) Next, YP takes place across a single day- which says a lot because as they say first impression is what counts! But it's a time of pure confusion; how would you be treated, what exactly are your duties.. Will you fit in? Won't someone show you the ropes??! And all that is tackled in YP, with more questions than answers. The entire [spoiler]\"kill the witch\"[/spoiler] directive is basically an illustration of being handed a task that's so baffling, you don't know where to even begin. Lo and behold that's what happened...\n\n3rd) It only grows worse when you factor in the state of workers who have endured the treacherous work conditions longer than you and some barely living (if you can call it that) and hanging in there. Level four was filled with poisonous gas and what better way to show a toxic environment that that!!? \n\n4th) Throughout your time with the company, you will be subjected to the same demanding, unfathomable happenings. But why has no one spoke out against all these? Fear?? Conditioned to look the other way??? Workplace politics is just not that simple. You hear of some legends who almost toppled the twisted status quo and returned the company into its glory days. But alas, they are but myths...right? Finally, there's no telling what will happen at the end of the day- some may not even last that far and that's where YP' many endings (now seven) prevail.\n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) Slacker!![/b] \nYS has a difficulty curve or it's just a hiccup in the programming. Sometimes in certain boss fights or general evading of pursuers, the alerted enemies take their sweet time to go back to patrolling. Again could be deliberate, but I had to wait for a minute at most for them to go away; the stark offender is a certain instant-catch situations. I guess it's also strange as to why hiding under desks (legs visible), in metal cabinets would even work with them hot on your briefs. It can get pretty awkward as you watch them pretend not to see you. \n\n[b](ii) Work, W. O. R. K... wOrK?[/b]\nEssentially real-life story projected through a pixelated overlay. But the fictitious elements that exist can be very jarring (not a bad thing). Seeing as I was already moved, enveloped by the overarching statement YP told on the workplace and the amoral nature in treatment of staffs. I do feel the impact was lost, just a smidge though... It works since incorporating fantasy has been known to be their signature!\n\n\n[h1]\"-But It's Not The End\"[/h1]\n\nIn closing, YP effortlessly bakes in sardonic humor with real-life concerns over the workplace by placing a hyper-paranoid filter and under-your-skin imagery to get the urgency across. Though the strange, highly unsettling plot can get incomprehensible, the overall message is clearly delivered, punctuated by a anxiety raising score and wonderfully written characters. Don't be naive however, it will eat you alive with its at times unfair game design and in fact, its greatest moments are easily missed because of the semi-open corporation building but only if you let it~ \n\n[h1]9.5/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Replaying soon for them extra hours of content![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1606008629, "timestamp_updated": 1623438377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711965024471282959", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79561877": {"recommendationid": "79561877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034782524", "num_games_owned": 1272, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 876, "last_played": 1606024491}, "language": "english", "review": "English and Spanish (Despues del apartado en ingles):\n\nDon't let the weird title deter you, this is a great survival horror.\n\nThe game is a great representation of a toxic work place, everyone who has worked in a toxic workplace will understand all the references, the game has multiple endings and there is no combat, your only weapons are your wits and stealth.\n\nThe good:\n-Pixel art is superb: Almost everything in the game is pixel art (the only exception are some videos you find along the game, very creepy real footage), all cut scenes are beautifully done in pixel art, as an hobbyist pixel artist I personally appreciate all the effort and love put into this game.\n- No jump scares: All horror in the game is subtle or creepy situations, nothing jumps at the screen, mind you, some times you jump because a sound, but that is part of the creepy atmosphere.\n- The story and mystery are pretty good, you keep guessing who is the witch and the clues are clever, you draw a lot of conclusions which keeps you from figuring out the truth early (thing that happens to me a lot since I'm a horror fan since a very young age) \n- The sounds effects and music are great, play it with headphones for full immersion.\n\nThe bad:\n- If you are looking for great cutting edge realistic graphics, this is not a game for you.\n- The game does not hold your hand, and as a working adult I was forced to look for a guide since sometimes life kept me from playing for 1 or 2 weeks and I forgot what I was doing.,\n- If you are looking for combat, this is not a game for you.\n- The main character is kind of a wimp, I tend to hate those kinds of MCs, but in this case I was able to like the guy but I understand if some people can't bring themselves to like him.\n\nFinal conclusion: I personally put this game as one of my favorite horror games in 2020, the story does not drag, it has a great pacing and it doesn't over stays its welcome, I got all the endings and loved every minute of the game.\n\n10/10 Must buy.\n\nEspa\u00f1ol:\n\nCreo que este es una joya que me hubiera perdido de no ser por que Steam me lo recomend\u00f3.\nLo primero que dir\u00e9 es que este es un juego survival horror, no hay combate, tus \u00fanicas armas son tu ingenio y habilidad para esconderte, algunos encuentros con jefes son acertijos o rompecabezas tipo Zelda.\n\nEl juego muestra de manera excelente un ambiente de trabajo toxico, si has trabajado en una empresa toxica podr\u00e1s entender las referencias, si no, pues por lo menos te prepara para conocer los signos.\nEl juego trata del primer d\u00eda de trabajo de Brian, una persona de \u201ccasta baja\u201d  en un mundo alternativo, que recibi\u00f3 una invitaci\u00f3n para trabajar en una empresa de clase mundial que no acepta a cualquiera en sus filas, pronto descubre que el trabajo que le ofrecieron no es nada normal al igual que el lugar de trabajo, lo peor de todo es que los dem\u00e1s empleados no lo notan.\n\nLo bueno:\n-\tEl juego est\u00e1 hecho completamente con pixel art (con la excepci\u00f3n de unos clips de video que encuentras en forma de VHS, esos son clips reales bastante escalofriantes y bizarros). Personalmente, como un artista pixel art de hobby, aprecio el esfuerzo y amor que le pusieron a este juego, se nota mucho.\n-\tNo \u201cjumpScares: Nada te salta a la pantalla, no hay sustos baratos, todo es la atmosfera del juego, usando elementos visuales y auditivos combinados en escalofriantes situaciones.\n-\tEl audio es perfecto, la m\u00fasica ayuda a construir esa sensaci\u00f3n de que algo esta mal, es muy recomendable jugar con aud\u00edfonos.\n-\tLa historia y el ritmo de la historia son geniales, el juego no es muy corto ni muy largo, dura lo que debe y no se alarga innecesariamente, si eres fan de los creepypastas este juego definitivamente te va a gustar.\n\nLo malo:\n-  Si buscas los mejores graficos, este no es un juego para ti.\n- El juego no te va a llevar de la mano, hay veces en que no pod\u00eda jugar por 1 o 2 semanas y al volver no tenia idea que estaba haciendo por lo que tenia que consultar gu\u00edas para ponerme al corriente.\n- Entiendo que hay personas que necesitan combate, este juego no lo tiene.\n- El personaje principal es un completo pelele, generalmente no me gustan nada ese tipo de personajes principales, en este caso, Brian, fue un personaje que termino por ganarse mi aprecio a lo largo del juego, pero puedo entender que haya gente que no logren tomarle aprecio.\n\nMi conclusion final: Si te gustan los survival horror con terror sutil y no combate este es un juego para ti, en lo personal creo que es una gema escondida del 2020. La historia dura lo que tiene que durar y tiene un ritmo incre\u00edble. Tiene finales multiples y una historia interesante y misteriosa. \n\n10/10 Compralo\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1605891067, "timestamp_updated": 1605891067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79551169": {"recommendationid": "79551169", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968000854", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2049, "last_played": 1605874612}, "language": "english", "review": "It's got spooks, it's got drama, it's got laughs, it's got intrigue, it's got style.

In fact, I think that Yuppie Psycho might be the first horror game that I've really gotten into, and that's good because it is a fantastic game! It drew me in through it's style and music (Which was done by Garoad, the guy who composed for Cyberpunk Bartender, and who knocked it out of the park on this one too!) and kept me around for its pacing and story. It's unique brand of \"office horror\" and overall tone has created a very memorable experience, and has been extremely enjoyable to play. There are some minor issues I have with the game, and some of it's subsequent DLC, but they're really minor gripes that don't take away from the overall experience. \n\nSo the game is a horror adventure game inside an office building with a fair amount of open exploration and secrets, and a lot of cool collectibles. Health items and other supplies are littered everywhere, so be sure to check everything you see. You're given loose instructions and are told where to go, but you're allowed to explore a lot more of the building beforehand/before specific events to get a feel on where you're going and what you're doing. The puzzles are pretty simple, but they're cool enough that I never felt bored or stuck doing them, and some managed to be very clever in execution. It's a very fair game, and if you die, it usually feels like your own fault as opposed to the game's. A minor gripe is that sometimes the collision can be a bit wonky on specific parts and feel weird, but it didn't happen often enough to warrant any concern beyond minor annoyance. It also uses a flashlight system where you can run out of batteries, but it's so generous that it's not obnoxious. Its chock to the brim with secrets and collectibles too, and each one adds to the experience beautifully to build and FLESH out the world. \n\nThe story is great, and I'm not going to talk about it in order to not spoil anything, but I would like to say that while I did enjoy the DLC's additions, I didn't like them as much as I thought I would. The DLC kind of loses focus on the setting and premise, and while the new sequences it brought were just as fun as the original, it felt like it didn't fit in as well as it should. I was really hoping for additional content that added to the original experience more than I did additional, ahem*, routes, but even so, it was still really fun, so I won't complain much.\n\nOverall, Yuppie Psycho is really good game.

The lore and references/hints scattered throughout the game are so interesting. The music is great. The art and animation is gorgeous.

I'd say if you enjoyed it this game will definitely be up your alley, in fact it's ten times more satisfying with how well rounded and polished the gameplay and setting is. I'm very intrigued with the story.\n\nI've actually unknowingly played this game before I found out the free DLC: Executive Edition would be released in a few days. I'm actually glad I did played before it gets released so I get to make a comparison with what they've improved on and changed. Before the DLC I'd say the one part of the game that I had a gripe with is how far-fetched and unclear one of the side quest's hints is that it frustrated me so much, it did not spark joy. I see that they've removed that part and changed it. Now no new players will understand my suffering lol.\n\nThe Executive Edition provides VERY very good additional content which completes the story as a whole and answers the few questions you've had prior the DLC. New endings are satisfying as well. [spoiler]Tiki Taka[/spoiler] is a good boi.

There is no much to add besides that it's a game that you should probably not think twice and just play it. :D I got it on sale but I wish I paid it full price because they really do deserve more support. Instead I went ahead and bought their other game that includes the OST and I bought Yuppie Psycho OST too (which is another amazing thing about this game...THE SOUNDTRACK!)\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1605280941, "timestamp_updated": 1605590402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79179523": {"recommendationid": "79179523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049849797", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1605237423}, "language": "english", "review": "This strange 8-bit horror game packs some tense and creepy moments.

What first drew me to this game was the fact that the main character looks a lot like Tohru Adachi from Persona 4. So, I put it on my wishlist and waited for the right time to buy it. Said \"right time\" ended up being a few days after I lost my own job and needed some retail therapy.\n\nI was completely blown away. From the moment Brian stepped into that building and started getting yelled at by a fellow new recruit just because he wasn't upper-class, I was hooked. And then the scares came. The game sometimes tosses in a jumpscare or two, but the insanely creepy vibe is more than enough to make the terror last.\n\nThis game is a goddamn acid trip. More than that, it's an allegory on toxic workplaces. It tells you a story about a guy who started working at a prestigious company, realized that it was actually a nightmare, tried to escape, but couldn't because he'd be branded a failure if he did. All of those motivational team meetings? They just remind you that you're trash whose only purpose is to give your life and blood to the company. All those incentives? Traps to keep the company's hold on you nice and tight. That friendly guy who first greeted you when you got to your office? Don't get on his bad side\u2014he's been here the longest, and he can ruin your life if you dare to challenge his position, intentionally or no.\n\nWriting reviews is difficult. I never really know what to say, beyond that I adore the game and think everyone under the sun should play it. That's how I feel about this game. I recommend this game to any and all horror junkies, people who hate their job, and people who just love Brian's little baby face and his stupid haircut and geeky glasses.", "timestamp_created": 1605155444, "timestamp_updated": 1605155444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79126645": {"recommendationid": "79126645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044136838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 729, "last_played": 1605140358}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it!

The game builds a strong interconnecting environment for players to run around in, full of items and collectibles. It introduces a decently interesting and well written cast of characters for players to meet, gradually developing a tangible relationship with them as the story progresses. The game especially does well to balance its horror elements with the absurd surrealist atmosphere it simultaneously creates, blending together into a really unique feel for the experience.\n\nThe gameplay mostly keeps a consistent level of effort and progress to the tasks players perform throughout, although the boss encounters are generally the worst part. Most of the significant encounters where players must accomplish something while under the threat of a unique foe are either too easy, too tedious or too obscure. This is made even worse by the game having a manual, location based save system; where anytime players die they must collect all the items, have all the conversations, and do everything else they did since last saving all over again. Even worse still is that players have to pay for each save with a limited consumable item. So players are further pressured into rationing their saves which further increases the likelihood of a death setting players back a significant amount.\n\nThis in all results in the game having very specific phases of frustration. The puzzles themselves are mostly intuitive, the main hangups on the flow of gameplay end up being the parts where players have to deal with an enemy whose gimmick is just not very clear. Which causes repetitious deaths and lots of wasted time redoing things because of the save system.\n\nAs good as the writing is the lack of cohesion to the overarching narrative is the biggest weakness of the game. The momentary encounters players have with the various characters and absurdities of the world are great. But the mystery that players are supposed to be uncovering through all this is barely telegraphed. The game occasionally presents inconsequential, random pieces of lore about the world that don't really contribute to understanding what's really happening. Meanwhile the pieces that seemingly are meant to be important are also so vague and random that it really doesn't contribute to any comprehension overarching story either.\n\nThe ending, the truth reveal, would potentially have the same impact on the player at the end of the game as it would if players witnessed it at the start. Because by the end of the game players really don't understand the actual world much better than they did after their surface level introduction to it. The truth itself is just not very satisfying, it barely makes much sense. So while the absurdity of the plot is generally its most distinct feature, that absurdity also seems to cost it a coherent lore. Because the lore is just about as spontaneous as everything else that happens, and while spontaneity is great for a journey it's not very great for an end.\n\n\nAlthough the specific instances of frustration due to tedious and or obscure enemy gimmicks are a detriment, it's the unsatisfying ending and lack of a consistent unravelling mystery or lore that really hurts the experience. But the experience itself is great. It really does build a unique, fun journey; it's just unfortunate that journey didn't have more tangible depth to it beyond the momentary fun encounters.\n\nIf you're interested in finding more games like this I've probably reviewed quite a few on my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38950844-Anoemalous/] here [/url].", "timestamp_created": 1605026933, "timestamp_updated": 1605029852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79051322": {"recommendationid": "79051322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138772715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1067, "last_played": 1605279125}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmosphere, good satire, decent puzzles, and an interesting plot. \n\nOverall the game is totally worth a look.

Through the adventure you encounter horrors, dark secrets, grotesque scenes. Oh, and friendship!\n\nVisual presentation can be a hit or miss being completely pixelated, aside from the text sprites and animated cutscenes. Personally, the artstyle completed the weird and freakish nature of the setting. \n\nAudio presentation is excellent. Soundtrack is by Garoad which did an amazing job with the VA-11 HALL-A OST.\nSound design and mixing is great (can still feel the keyboard clicking and clacking in my brain).\n\nGameplay consists of walking around, interacting with items and points of interest, avoiding enemies and solving puzzles. Nothing too groundbreaking, but it's simple and enjoyable enough. There will be points that don't make it clear where you need to go next, or what is needed to progress so don't be ashamed to use a walk-through for that extra helping hand. The game rewards you for paying attention to your surroundings (*cough* especially to co-workers during the party *cough*).\n\nStory and characters are good for the most part. The more you progress, the more you realize that things are terribly wrong with this company. Brian encounters co-workers whom he befriends to an extent, and they each have distinct personalities. However, other than key characters, much of the cast don't get much of a backstory or character progression, though the focus is just following Brian's wacky adventure.\n\n+ Soundtrack by Garoad which is excellent\n+ Good sound design and mixing\n+ Puzzles not too difficult yet satisfying to solve\n+ Neat, creepy, dark atmosphere and story\n+ Multiple endings encouraging more playthroughs (plus the DLC area)\n\n- Pixelated artstyle can be hit or miss\n- Little to no character backstory and development for some characters\n- Can get lost wondering where to go next\n- DLC slightly vague to access, but not too terrible\n\nOverall, 7 noodle boxes out of 10 - A nice and solid spooky adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1604810009, "timestamp_updated": 1604810009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78918090": {"recommendationid": "78918090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126851553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1111, "last_played": 1655578581}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with eye catching cut scenes.

I had so much fun playing this game.\n\nIn this game you are given a task and you have to explore the building, each floor has different obstacles and people and much like zelda, certain things are blocked off to you until you unlock the new ability or item. It's hard to describe because there is a lot of variety in game play, but mostly you'll be exploring, finding items, solving puzzles, defeating bosses and uncovering the mystery of the office and why its so gruesome. \n\n there are only a few points of the game that I found frustrating, obviously 1 being the old style way of saving ( much like resident evil) you get minimal saves and if you forget to save after a long period of time and then die, it really sucks. The end game also came without warning as well, I finished my task and was going to head to my office to save but I was interrupted on the elevator and in the end game, and because my last save was so far back, I continued on and beat the game, but I really missed some content because of that, and that kind of sucked. I understand the method and reasoning for that style of save system, but honestly I could have done without it, or at least some key autosave spots, that just save the player some time in the event they do forget.  Or get caught like I did.\n\nIf you like horror, you like mystery, you like puzzles buy it.

It wasn't frozen, but one of the final scenes wouldn't progress, no matter what. I watched a walkthrough, just to make sure, and nope, my game glitched. For those that have played it, its after one of the hardest parts in the game, which you can't save for about the last 30-60 minutes of progress you have to make.  There is nothing more frustrating than working your way through a game just to be robbed of the ending.  I'm not going back through this to find out if its a one-time bug, i'm done with this game.\n\nYuppie Psycho has been out in the wild for a year, seems like they would have plenty of opportunities to fix this kind of thing. Oh, and the controllers don't work - I saw the fix on the discussions, but this is bush league - every other game works with my xbox controller - seems like a great game that could've really benefited from some more QA.

Which is a rare thing.\nThe game gives off a cyberpunk/vaporwave aesthetic while also being a horror game all in one. \n\nI was pretty much going into this game because the musician Garoad was composing it. Which, for his work, it's the quality I wanted from the guy who made the entire banger of VA-11 HALL-A (a great game as well.)  While the game is good... it has flaws.\n\nUI is a bit confusing, even after 10 hours. Despite the use of several items that can and should be needed at a moments notice, you don't have any hotbar or even any equip button (Not even to 8-bit Zelda level of equipment). This brings in several problems: Example, you you have to disable mines in several parts of the game and need an item to do that. How you disable the mine is to approach near the mine, then open up the menu, select the item, and then use it. You have to do this several times in the game and some have it where you are on a rushing current, about to run into a mine and must be pin-point accurate to do so. It's doable, but messes with the  flow.\n\nAnother example is lights. As expected of a horror game, you have to manage a flashlight and batteries in order go through the hellscape of this corporate building. The problem, again, is that you can't dedicate WHICH light you want to use. You can get a flashlight, a lamp, and glow sticks. All of these have some pros and cons, but you can't just select one light and turn it on and off, you have to go through a selection every time to turn it on and off. I mentioned batteries, right? Well the problem is that if your light is on at ALL it will drain the battery, a limited resource. So you have to rotate through your lights to get the right one, sometimes while something very angry and large wants to kill you. This makes it frustrating to manage my resources and could be solved with just simply better UI and control.\n\nThe last bash on this is the inventory button. Yes, button. If using a controller, you won't notice this, but on keyboard and mouse, you will. The button for this is 'i', which is on the other side of the keyboard. The game requires both the mouse and the keyboard at all times. Remember the mines? Well imagine using WASD seeing mines, moving your right hand from the mouse to touch i key, then bounce back to the mouse to select the item to destroy the mine. That's what I did for a good hour until I learned I can redo the key to make it 'b' instead of 'i'. Why \nBaroque Decay thought that 'i' by default was a good idea, I would not know.\n\nBut beyond the horrible, and clunky UI, is it good?\n\nYes.\n\nThe games story, characters, atmosphere is perfect and I am only sad that there was not enough of it. I missed a ton of secrets and extras in this game, and want to get back and do more of it.... after I retook into better managing this UI.\n\nBuy it at full price with caution, but if this is on sale, get it.", "timestamp_created": 1601908128, "timestamp_updated": 1601908128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77062945": {"recommendationid": "77062945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103805202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1610159331}, "language": "spanish", "review": "wtf", "timestamp_created": 1601876772, "timestamp_updated": 1601876772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77050784": {"recommendationid": "77050784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177914755", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1601852592}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game with Humble Bundle.

Here are the main reasons why:\n\n+ DLC is free, about 3 more hours of content (thanks devs)\n+ One of the new endings/routes goes deeper into story and characters, darker even\n+ Not only did they add new content, they added bits n' bobs here and there to polish the game overall \n\nMy original problem with the vanilla Yuppie Psycho was that the Endings left a lot to be desired. Lots of issues, things and people were left without proper resolutions or explanations. Any ending you landed on felt like an incomplete story. That's where the new DLC comes in. \n\nThe Executive Edition glams up the current base game and adds extra bits to the original endings. I will say though, it didn't add much and I still felt unsatisfied. Then I played one of the new routes. The achievement is called \"Ending: Goodbye\" if you're curious. \n\nWithout giving away much, this route goes into a completely different direction from the original existing routes. There weren't really any guides at the time of writing this cause the update is still fresh so it felt really nice going in blind. If you want a spoiler free guide to it, here is the cliff notes version:\n\n[spoiler]\n\u2022 Help Chapman promote to 3rd floor\n\u2022 Do the new area, Surveillance Room. Very important item at the end\n\u2022 Check out Camera Hub 5, interesting scene \n\u2022 With said knowledge of interesting scene, go there and take it (it's for that floor)\n\u2022 Go to the Wash Closet on 5th floor, use Witch Paper on mirror (don't think you need to do this but there is an achievement for it) \n\u2022After all that, you're good to go, just keep going [/spoiler]\n\nAlso, make sure you do all that BEFORE entering the Cemetery otherwise you will be locked out. \n\nI think it's fair to say that in order to get the full experience of Yuppie Psycho: Executive Edition, you need to play the \"true\" original route first and then play the alternate route. I am very happy with this new DLC update simply because it covered a lot of things and gave a satisfying result with the alternate ending. There was a climax and you didn't really get that in the original endings, or at least, I felt that way. \n\nBut I digress. Yuppie Psycho is good and deserves the praise it gets. Devs did a good job pushing out this FREE update. Personally, I felt like Yuppie Psycho could have used a little more stronger narrative BUT. I think with this new update, instead of leaving things up on the table, it presents you with an open ended scenario(s). And if you spend a little more time digging around for all the endings and items you will find that this game is very satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1600489415, "timestamp_updated": 1604990755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1604285721, "developer_response": "DLC is out now for free!

And it's yet another one of those little gems I'm happy I tried!Although for the most part, the story is linear, there are many possible endings and the game rewards you for exploration and completion. My first playthrough took 13 hours because I did so, achieving 2 of the possible endings so far.The characters are bizarre yet funny, the artwork simple but perfect for the level of gore and weirdness. The cutscenes are beautiful too. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack and sound effects.The puzzles are not too difficult, although there was one particular part that I had to refer to a guide for because the solution, despite being 'in the bag' was not immediately apparent. There's no real combat as such, but you do heavily employ a lot of strategy and survival.If there's one tiny issue I have about the game is that there's one segment which entails a lot of reading/things to do/danger where you can't save for a long while. If you don't go prepared, there's a high probability that you may have to repeat this segment again. Luckily, due to my incessant scavenging, I got through it, but barely!

There are some that are almost impossible to complete without scouring through the offices, speaking to different and equally important characters. Although at the start i must have spent about... half an hour doing one puzzle, because i had missed an item that was in plain sight, i was finding the later (and more difficult) puzzles easier as i figured out what was being thrown at me.\n\nSimilarly, the bosses (and standard enemies) were delightfully interesting ( [spoiler] though i never expected i'd fight a printer with four hands [/spoiler] ), and it was refreshing to see every enemy have a unique method for dealing with (or escaping from) them. Navigating certain areas to complete a task while enemies search for you, and balancing hiding with running in each area certainly helped live up to the 'horror' tag this game holds, and more often than not i was reminded of classic rpgmaker horrors like Misao, The Witch's House and Mad Father, all games i fell in love with immediately, and Yuppie Psycho easily joined the ranks of them.\n\nThe characters were also amazing, with everyone (bar one, but disclosing who spoils things) making me laugh between the different nightmarish tasks. The game is deceptively long, and despite the short amount of tasks you're given in order to 'Kill the Witch', you'll find yourself interacting with your new work friends often in order to figure out the lore and understand where you need to go and what you need to do. Each character, good and bad has entertaining quirks, and by the time the game is over you'll have grown attached to them, leaving you searching for the best ending to help them all.\n\n[h1] What I Didn't Love [/h1]\n\nWhile, yes, i did adore Yuppie Psycho, there's always a couple criticisms you can give, and this is no different. \n\nThe endings feel.. rushed. Don't get me wrong, the endings themselves are interesting, and being able to get the ending you want is great, but they aren't [b] rewarding [/b]. As long as i'm counting right, there's four proper endings, but they're just... so easy to get. I saved just before the end of the game and managed to get all the endings in about 30 minutes because of it, and it makes me feel like as long as i rush through the first 80% of the game the only bit that matters is the last 20%. I personally think it would be far better to have us make choices to determine the ending throughout the entirety of the game, because while it'll take longer to implement different paths, you'll essentially be quadrupling (if they stick to four main endings) the time people spend to see all the content.\n\n[h1] Do I recommend this? [/h1]\n\nYes.

You can only save at certain parts of the map, which isn't an issue so far since it seems they put save points before a section where you are likely to die. But, you need a specific item to save the game, and when you run out, you'll just gonna have to believe... So you need to manage your save items too, which is an interesting mechanic, but annoying too. To ration the save item, the time between my saves is longer, which also means that the amount of progress lost when dying is greater too, and you'll need to redo whatever you just did before dying.

You'll enjoy this game if you're like me and enjoy horror games that don't require you to be able to shoot/kill monsters etc.  For the most part you're either sneaking or running, which really lends to the tension.  The tension is one of the game's strongest aspects, along with the sound design.  Definitely wear headphones while playing this.  Not only is the music great, but the sound effects are incredibly unsettling, and are sometimes played just for ambience but make you believe there's a monster around.  Despite how cute everyone is, the game's atmosphere is more disturbing than a lot of horror movies I've seen.  The difficulty is at a good level, there were only a few parts that felt a little tedious to have to replay, but for the most part the limited saving and occasionally brutal enemies make the game better and scarier.  Obviously as a weeb I really love the art style, it's very charming, and the character designs as well as their personalities are diverse and likable.  This game gets an A+ for the extremely cute protagonist.  The extra little details the developers put into the game's world make it so much more enjoyable, like the videoclub movies or the detailed paintings in the gallery, which you only see for a little bit.  This game is great at incentivizing you to do stuff, like by collecting different ingredients you can be promised better healing items, or by making sure to check everything you may find one more paper needed for a vital save.  This is unlike, say, Dark Souls, where I collect tons of items I never use.  Pretty much every item has a super valuable use.  The only thing I felt was missing was more answers, the game's story built up so many questions but didn't answer all of them by the end, but maybe that'll be in an ending I didn't get.  As for the story, it's really well written in terms of not seeming obnoxiously unsubtle, but still explores class and the dehumanization of workers in the name of a company's success.  I don't even work in an office and it was incredibly depressing for me.  Anyways, this game's really really good and Baroque Decay makes awesome games.\n\nEDIT 8/12/21\n\nI just finished the DLC (I\u2019m a fake fan for taking so long after it\u2019s release) and I just have to say it fixed any small problems I had with the game and made it so much more amazing.  This game truly is gunning for my favorite game of all time.  I also gotta say that whoever does the art direction is incredible.  Somehow, Baroque Decay is able to make the most graphic, disturbing sprites out of pixels and I love it.    Call me a coward or whatever but I\u2019m amazed that an cartoony indie game freaks me out more than most horror movies (and horror games) I\u2019ve ever seen.  BD I\u2019m begging you, make more games.  Every character in this game has so much personality and charm that I would love to see more content with them too.  I also feel that this game (along with Count Lucanor) really nail that \u201chorror/comedy\u201d vibe you get from stuff like EarthBound.  It\u2019s got so many twists and variables that it\u2019s honestly hard even after several playthroughs to tell when you\u2019ll get threatened/scared.  Often I was pleasantly surprised when, for example, I hide in a closet wondering if I\u2019ll get jumpscared when I turn my light on again, and then I do, but it\u2019s never predictable!  Overall, it's extremely rare for me to find a game that has a story that interests me, is scary, AND has fun gameplay, this is a great find and I really wish there were more horror games in this style.", "timestamp_created": 1597689187, "timestamp_updated": 1628807145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74446823": {"recommendationid": "74446823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068226788", "num_games_owned": 1028, "num_reviews": 403, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1597819055}, "language": "english", "review": "Super odd story, I love it!", "timestamp_created": 1597654555, "timestamp_updated": 1700726871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74441213": {"recommendationid": "74441213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118628084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 634, "last_played": 1597468153}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game.

The horror element ramped up well, and managed to be frequently creepy without resorting to cheap tricks. The story was interesting, and the setting (both the office and the hints about the world at large) were a great treat. The gameplay was enjoyable, though the resource management (batteries, health) felt too generous--I never ran out of anything.\n\nOverall, the game delivers a branching narrative that is fun to fully explore, and it did not overstay its welcome through multiple replays. I went in mostly blind (store blurb, genre, and trailer) and that definitely added to the experience.

Yuppie Psycho is very alluring. That said, it does have it's share of shortcomings.\n\nMany elements of the story feel glossed over. Many questions are left unanswered. Characters are left underdeveloped. Environments are hinted at but left unexplored. The conclusion to the mystery just drops into the players lap in the end, which is very unrewarding. And all of the endings are mostly the same, leaving the player to feel like they have no agency; admittedly, that may be intentional, as it fits thematically with the player being a powerless office worker.\n\nAnd yet despite all that, Yuppie Psycho is still a strong recommendation; I only make such criticisms because I loved the game, and because Id love to see more of it.

Nope, each attack it lands makes them stronger, so even at max health you can tank maybe 3.

Game quickly sucked me in with a very interesting story and secrets galore.\n\nThe story and \"lore\" is hands down one of the best parts of this game. I loved trying to piece together the history of this cursed Sintracorp and trying to make the conflicting information seemingly everyone is giving you make sense. The game gives you just enough hints that if you're paying attention to the small, seemingly random, details, you can figure out some twists in advance. Even at the end, however, it doesn't give you everything, and some questions are left unanswered or vague after the credits roll.  Horror is played very well here, with the terror derived from gore and nightmare rather than jumpscares. The characters are rather flat, sadly. They are extremely memorable, and you won't run into anyone and be like \"who are they again\" but they do not have a lot of depth, though that could be attributed to the place being cursed.\n\nThe combat and health system is simple. Some enemies, such as mines, can be disabled using tools, while all other enemies need to be avoided via running away or hiding in cabinets or under tables. The horror is somewhat offset, however, by the overabundance of healing items. If you are paying attention, you will be drowning in coffee and candy bars, meaning any hit can be quickly recovered. If you are looking for deep combat, probably not for you.\n\nThe puzzles jump between too easy and point-and-click obtuse. Don't feel too bad if you get completely stuck and need to look up a guide, I did for a couple parts. The bosses are also puzzle based, and they're pretty good, though I definitely going to remember one of the bosses more than the other.\n\n[strike] The alternate endings are mostly just bad ends, with the few that aren't just being minor variations or alternate ending cutscenes. Felt a bit lacking, as I was hoping for some more meaningful choices regarding the ending. [/strike]\n\nEdit: So, they released a new, free, content drop that adds an alternate route with multiple new endings with awesome new lore insights and a creepy new area. I rescind my complaints on lack of endings, exactly what I was looking for!\n\nTLDR: Super cool story, mostly interesting puzzles, [strike] lackluster ending/s [/strike] .

Immersion with headphones and few distractions really gets your blood flowing since the overall design keeps you on edge, and the progression was done well. The game gives you a limited number of resources that you need to manage as you go throughout it and, if you're someone like me, you'll probably end the game with way too many since you opt to almost never use them.\n\nOne of the mechanics is light management through use of batteries in a flashlight. I don't think I used more than maybe two batteries in my entire playthrough because of how extremely thrifty I was on its usage, but it also would be much more enjoyable probably to not be so extremely thrifty with the resources you're given. But that's what's great about it too in that you're aware that resources are limited and it really does feel like you need to manage your lifeline as you go through the game (Even if I went through extreme overkill on that front).\n\nThe ending felt a bit lackluster to me, but then again I feel like that's the case for most games like this. The build-up and experience add up to a lot more than the conclusion for me. I don't know how to explain it without spoiling anything, but I just feel like it's cut a bit short. None of that changed my overall positive outlook on the game and great experience I had, however.\n\nI will mention that I had to restart the game one time while doing my first regular playthrough due to some memory leak or something causing the game to start to lag, but it didn't negatively impact my experience at all. I also toward the end of achievement hunting discovered that the game is quite poorly coded and my mashing A seemed to have caused another memory leak that needed a restart to fix. Besides those two situations, however, everything worked pretty smoothly despite a couple pathing errors on AI.\n\nThe game was a wonderful binge and I highly recommend you play it in a well-lit room during the day if you're a wimp like me.", "timestamp_created": 1594980891, "timestamp_updated": 1594981447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472312718629837036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72828057": {"recommendationid": "72828057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025010964", "num_games_owned": 1730, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 647, "last_played": 1604809690}, "language": "english", "review": "An unexpectedly amazing pixel horror game that throws quite a few curve-balls.

(where the story takes place at) has. The outside world isn\u2019t talked about much, but the lore behind it when it is spoken about is super interesting. You take control of Brain, who has received a mysterious letter to come work at Sintracorp and improve his social status, make an absurd amount of money per day, and other unbelievable benefits. However, things quickly take a turn for the weird and it is up to you to uncover the secrets of Sintracorp. and make it out. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe story is a mixed bag for me as part of it is told and supported through the environments and gameplay. Initially, I was incredibly enthralled with the lore and story. The side characters are pretty normal yet really weird and the generic workers are these grey, lifeless husks shambling around and working. (The commentary on big corporations isn\u2019t terrible subtle here.) \n\nIn terms of gameplay as a support, you can initially explore every floor in a limited capacity and get used to the map and building layout. You can even get some important items early on if you\u2019re a hoarder or a compulsive clicker/ checker. \n\nGameplay also factors into this as the puzzles help reveal the workspace of Sintracorp. You have to explore the oppressive darkness of the corporate archives, solve the puzzles meant to deter truth seekers, and avoid the various mutated/ corrupted workers. The fate of the previous seekers is also awaiting you.\n\nThe basics of the story are that you arrive at your first day of work under mysterious circumstances and sign an obvious pact with the devil in exchange for your position at Sintracorp. Your job: kill the witch. While Brian has doubts about real witches, her vile magic is clearly evident within Sintracorp. You\u2019ll eventually meet your co-workers and explore the various floors of Sintracorp as you get closer to the truth while dodging the various horrors that lurk within. At the time of writing, I only have a few endings completed and will go back at a later date for the others as I feel burnt out on the game currently. From what I have seen, they are interesting, but I still had lingering questions about certain characters and their motivation/ history at the endings I DID get to. I won\u2019t go into detail as this is the main seeing point of the game, at least for me. Just know that while things are super vague during the main story, the endings don\u2019t really offer any detailed payoff/ elaboration. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nIn terms of gameplay, Yuppie Psycho is a 2.5-D adventure game. You mostly run around the building, talking to people, finding clues and solving puzzles. There is quite a bit of reading to be done so I don\u2019t recommend this game to anyone who was expecting a more action-oriented game although there are some quite tense chases/ encounters. Puzzles can range from \u201cuse item X on object Y to proceed\u201d to more involved ones such as directing a monster into a certain direction by using certain switches. I honestly feel that certain puzzles needed more feedback on whether or not the player is doing something right or progressing. I was stuck at a few because I knew I had the solution in my hands, but just didn\u2019t know how to use it due to the limited clues/ feedback. \n\nYuppie Psycho goes for a save system like early Resident Evil\u2019s- namely, you have limited save items. Personally, I don\u2019t like them as I felt inclined to save very regularly since save points are VERY spaced out. Although, in retrospect, certain segments are very easy/ short, when I first encountered them, I was super nervous about having to reload a save halfway across the map and having to redo all the item collecting, triggers, etc. Additionally, dying means you also have to listen to the same dialogue all over again. There isn\u2019t a skip function, so I ended up having to mash through dozens of text boxes just to get back to the puzzle/enemy that killed me. This eventually made the game less scary and more tedious/ annoying which ruined my immersion in the game\u2019s visual and audio storytelling.\n\nThere is also a health system where you can eat/ drink food items to recover health and craft better haling items by using the right ingredients OR buy items form vending machines. I liked it and it felt fitting. \n\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1]\nThe music and sound design are great. The parts that focus more on horror nail it with oppressive, spooky ambient noises and some unsettling whispering sometimes. I should mention that there are a few cheap jumpscares that made me flinch due to just being a loud noise with moderately or mildly creepy imagery on screen. The monsters sound appropriately unsettling. \n\nMusical tracks are pretty good, but I honestly can\u2019t remember any off the top of my head as I was preoccupied with the story/ atmosphere. \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\nThis game uses a pixelated art style to convey its story. I honestly think it looks great, although some designs get muddled due to the pixilation. For example, Brain wears glasses but his character sprite doesn\u2019t have any. The animated cutscenes, while elusive, were fantastic at showing emotion and movement. They were also rendered at a good/ consistent framerate to boot. I honestly wish there were more of them at key moments in the story.\n\n[h1] Miscellaneous [/h1]\nPerformance wise, I had no real issues to mention. Controls were okay as well since you can rebind the keys from the main menu. There is controller support, but I didn\u2019t touch it in my playthroughs.As a Horror game, I thought that the beginning and ending parts were great and I was on edge. The middle kinda dragged on in favor of plot/ exposition and I felt that it was \"spoopy\" at best.\n\n[h1] Closing [/h1]\nIf you like linear, story-focused, horror-based games, I\u2019d definitely recommend Yuppie Psycho. However, just be aware that there are some archaic gameplay systems at work and that while the story is interesting, it doesn\u2019t ever really directly explain or elaborate some of the bigger plot points. While puzzles are overall pretty simple, some solutions just aren't apparent on a first playthrough. \n\nOverall- 7.5/ 10\nWorth getting, but only on sale if you\u2019re wary.", "timestamp_created": 1594956073, "timestamp_updated": 1594956470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539735138416290283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72818677": {"recommendationid": "72818677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160140552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1594952029}, "language": "english", "review": "I thoroughly enjoyed this game.\n\nI loved the style, the setting, the characters.

Baroque Decay (what a fitting name) managed to strike the balance between horror and comedy perfectly by making them play off of each other like a couple of great actors. Which is an unexpected feat, usually people just ruin both. Despite all the webpunk\\vaporwave aesthetic and a protagonist called Pasternak, this game doesn't come off as pretentious. One has to be genuinely clever to be able to carry out all of the above with such pazzazz.\n\nTo me, the game seemed pretty basic at first sight, but soon turned out to be endlessly amusing, delivering a package full of savage satire, Lynchean surrealism, the occult, clever social commentary, and tense predicaments.

Respectively, I don't want to spoil it for anyone else, so all I can add is that it's challenging (at least it used to be, I'm not so sure about the new edition), the puzzles are great, and the pacing is on point for a horror adventure.

It's a great game with one huge caveat, at least on Mac. (I should try it on my Linux machine more.) The game has strong survival horror elements and uses them perfectly. Part of that is that saving is not trivial. There are limited opportunities to save, so that each time you CAN save, you ask yourself, \"Do I really want to save now or keep going and bank my saving ability for later?\" Again, this is great in terms of gameplay. It makes the stakes higher. The problem is that the game crashes quite a bit. Sometimes, after 20 or 30 minutes after a save point, the game just vanishes from my screen. That's a problem. If I could save all the time, I would, but then, it would not be the same game.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic. It's a survival horror satire that has an interface like Zelda: A Link to the Past but that plays more like a point and click adventure game. The player character, Brian, is never armed and mostly collects objects, figures out when to use them and interacts with NPCs. In a more action-oriented way, he does, however, need to avoid a lot of enemies who all want him dead for some reason and he needs to collect health boosters in order to survive. The game really is a witty comment on work-life balance, how large companies are structured, office politics, hypocrisy in the corporate world and many other similar themes without ever mentioning them directly and certainly without ever being preachy about it.\n\nIt works with a keyboard, but I'd strongly recommend using a controller for it, even on a computer. The writing and storytelling are extremely good. The plot manages to be surprising. The mystery is really tantalizing. Clues are dropped all the time, but you never know enough to really know what's going to happen, and the player character is not an idiot: when he's placed in a dangerous situation, he always decides to leave, but an external cause forces him to stay. He's not a gratuitous hero who wants to \"fight evil\" for whatever reason. On the contrary, he mostly wants to just get out of there, but it's tricky: working at that company is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him. He has a shaky sense of self-esteem at best and all of that makes him and his relation to other character feel relatable.\n\nIf the game just didn't crash, it would be almost perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1594160856, "timestamp_updated": 1594160856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72250048": {"recommendationid": "72250048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024961532", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1594427930}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic game with an amazing story, well thought out characters and a good mix of horror and mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1594149631, "timestamp_updated": 1594149631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72240600": {"recommendationid": "72240600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168820421", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1673439739}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game.

Except for Resident Evil, I don\u2019t even like scary games, so I don\u2019t like Yuppie Psycho, I might not be the right person to listen to on this one. \n\nYuppie Psycho tries entirely too hard to make you uneasy throughout the game and I think it works after a bit. The first ten minutes feels out of place, the writing is weak but gets far better after that strange opening. This is a creepy freaking game, and I thought about what I would show but\u2026 I kind of have to show the disturbing parts because that is a major part of this game. I\u2019d be lying otherwise. \n\nI do want to say the art though is solid, the game is good in every way it should be but it\u2019s just a genre and a style I have absolutely no interest in playing. I feel bad because I want to play more but I also don\u2019t.\n\nAs I said, this is a horror game, not survival horror, not action, but a horror RPG for the most part. I think you already know if you like this one but this is mostly going to appeal to the horror niche and anyone who doesn\u2019t like scary games, will want to skip this. \n\nQuick related question, how many dead bodies would you have to see on the first day of work to excuse yourself and leave immediately? I think my number would be one, and I might even leave if there\u2019s a serious injury. Maybe the main character is a psycho. \n\nRelated Video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57s8SdWDUJU&t=334s", "timestamp_created": 1594108360, "timestamp_updated": 1594108360, "voted_up": true,

There is no indication to do anything like this, but if you don't then you lock yourself out of one of the game's collectibles.\n\n2. Underwhelming ending. Thankfully, this one has some room to be improved with the upcoming DLC, but as it stands now the ending just didn't feel like it did enough to match all of the great build up that occurred over the course of the game.\n\nThese issues aside, this game was a fantastic and unique experience.

You'll almost certainly need a walkthrough, as some puzzles are hard or confusing. There are still points-of-no-return and it's incredibly easy to miss things. The story has now got even more loose ends, yet minimal character development. I did enjoy playing, but every time I had to look at a walkthrough or steam discussion it killed the tension. I still don't like the limited save system, but thanks to previous experience I was able to avoid losing significant progress this time.\n\n[b]Original review[/b]\nThe game is often enjoyable, but there are too many negatives. The characters and some parts of the game are quite good though.\n\n1: The saving mechanic made me lose a lot of progress several times. Some areas should have a save point or autosave that don't.\n2: Some areas of the game are incredibly frustrating, either because they are hard to navigate or have a frustrating puzzle. One puzzle has an item mysteriously appear in the inventory and gives no hint that it is there.\n3: There is a point-of-no-return without a warning. Because of it there are many missable items. This can also block the best ending.\n4: The story is full of plot holes and loose ends. It gives you scraps of information, but never explains anything.\n5: Some people claim they got stuck after running out of some items. Seems very likely, but never happened to me.\n\nI could probably recommend it on sale if the save mechanic didn't require items and there were a few extra save points or autosaves in certain areas.

I was waffling between recommend and not until I realized the list of bad is much longer than the good for Yuppie Psycho.\n\nI was enjoying the game without a guide until I ran into my first real situation where I just plain had no idea what I was supposed to do. I won't give spoilers, but I'll just say a lot of the things you'll need to do are not intuitive in the slightest, and you'll most likely resort to breaking your immersion and flow for the sake of not wandering in circles wasting precious resources trying to figure things out.\n\nA certain point of no return event in the game ups the ante on this requirement tenfold. You can absolutely reach a fail state, in which you have no light sources left and just plain can't progress, and would likely have to start over or at least many saves back to be more resourceful. I tend to like mechanics like this, since after all it is a survival horror game, but in the meta of 2020s gaming it's very rare for a non \"souls like\" game to stay true to this more punishing style of gameplay.\n\nI also want to say that the turning point in the story includes an incredibly frustrating mechanic that had me very close to putting the game down forever. You're punished many times throughout the game for just not knowing how to deal with new enemies, and it just wasn't so much scary as it was tedious to be punished by the game and not know why. I just realized I wasn't having fun, and I wasn't attached enough to the story to keep going. I came back a while later and decided to give it another shot, and wound up completing the game in that same session.\n\nOverall, I want to recommend the game because I'm a die hard survival horror fan and this one isn't \"bad\" but I just can't in good faith give it a thumbs up because it really isn't \"good\" either. If you're running out of survival horror games to play in this dying genre, then sure, pick this one up.

New dlc has been added this Halloween season: the \"Executive Edition\"! It's added some cool new stuff to the base game with some fresh enemies and 3 extra hours of content, but most importantly, a new ending. This ending is good, but it's more so an extra to the first few, with it heavily eluding to the other endings in a way that implies that this one should be completed post-original game ending. I really like it though, and it fits well with the rest of the game and the new additions.

The gameplay was strong; the characters were great and likable. But the last 10% was very weak. Unfortunately, it's a crucial 10% as it's the conclusion to what the game was building up towards. To summarize this without spoilers, I felt the game does not wrap itself up that nicely, in both gameplay and story.\n\nMaybe I missed something along the way, but here's some spoilers of what I felt was weak:\n[spoiler]\n1. I did not understand the significance of the art gallery. It felt like it was just there to shock the player, but had no real meaning.\n2. I couldn't find any in-game lore that provided some idea of the motivations, powers etc. of the Witch. This makes the Witch seem kind of hollow. It also leaves the last couple of cutscenes unexplained. (Ex. Body swapping?)\n3. I really think there should be an oxygen meter and a save point somewhere in the water level. The player is kind of thrown into the deep end quite quickly.\n4. Marshall's existence is puzzling. There doesn't seem to be any significance other than helping Brian out in 1 particular scene.\n5. There definitely seems to be more to Doshi than what's presented. He has quite the unexpected crucial role towards the end. But there doesn't seem to be any opportunity to find out more about him.[/spoiler]\n\nIn the end, I'd still give a recommendation for how well everything else was done.", "timestamp_created": 1588078447, "timestamp_updated": 1588078589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68161077": {"recommendationid": "68161077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843871934", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 1621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1618698908}, "language": "english", "review": "A Steam horror game that's actually scary AND has a Rolling Stones reference?

no. no it is not. it's not even boring -- it's just a waste of time.\n\nyuppie psycho starts out with the impression that this is going to be a sarcastic game parodying toxic corporation culture, and while the symbolism remains consistent throughout the whole game, it suddenly devolves into trying to actually *tell a grounded story, trying to explain all the supernatural things happening in the company*. \n\nthroughout the game, brian reacts to seeing dead bodies in a \"this is gross... but i wonder what's happening?\" sort of unrealistic way -- and it was great! i think this was most likely a reference to the fact that this game is dependent on a resource system, and they couldn't just have the main character rummage through corpse's pockets without some sort of reaction, so they make sure to let the audience know that he is definitely seeing the weird shit happening, but that he just doesn't really care (other than finding out the mystery of *what happened* in the first place). they play it straight throughout the whole game! there are literally dead corpses on the floor, poison gas permeating throughout one of the floors, horseshit simply being left in one of the meeting rooms, etc., and no one (other than brian) reacts. it's a sarcastic tone that wraps itself around one big joke -- if corporations could brainwash their employees to not notice such horrible conditions, they probably would. it was a great experience to see just how disgusting the working conditions were in one area before realizing that it just got worse off in the next.\n\nwhispers of the witch go around the work place. is she a friend of the employees, or a foe? is she on the top-dogs side, or are they afraid of her? whatever it is, get to work! the weirdness of the witch myth was a fantastic element of paranoia, because although no NPC could clearly tell you what her goal was other than 'taking over the company', the player themselves always felt scared of her presence.\n\nbut then... but...then...? \nthere's an...actual story?\nhuh? did i miss something?\n\nso this entire time you were doing a parody story which was working out great, being abstract...\nnow suddenly there's lore to the sintra family? there's *actual* magic bullshit? and by the way, none of this backstory has anything to do with the commentary on corporations, workplace culture, how employees react to oppression...nothing. just like the parody, *this* lore shit is *also* played straight -- WHY? what was the point? why did you suddenly ground me in reality? oh, and i should mention, none of the lore is at all interesting. tl;dr revenge shenanigans without any logic behind motivation.\n\nfinally, there's the controversial save function. first of all, limited saves aren't inherently an issue, as long as the game allows you to create an infinite copy of them. \n...wait, isn't that an oxymoron?\nno. let me explain.\n\nin yuppie psycho, saves are created by using photocopiers found throughout the company building. to save, you MUST have a copy of witch paper.  in this game, there are limited resources -- and that extends to cheese.\nwhy is cheese important? well, a character near the midpoint will exchange you one cheese for one piece of witch paper. this is the ONLY way to get witch paper other than progressing forward in the game.\nin a game with *only one kind of hazard you can remove* with all the others *eternally remaining where they are* because you can't attack, you are going to be taking a lot of damage. foodstuffs replenish your health.\nnow you must make a decision. save cheese for good health recipes, or use it to exchange witch paper?\nwell, of course, you should save it for witch paper, you say! ...but, oh no! i'm taking too much damage by trying to tank enemies in a certain portion! i ended up dying because i didn't want to waste my 2 witch papers! oh my god, i lost hours of gameplay!\n\nremember how earlier i said that boss fights were annoying because there was only *one* way to \"fight\" them (as in waiting for a gimmick that takes too long and feels like it's reliant on luck)? all the developers had to do was make respawning enemies on one floor --> brian can attack them --> they drop money --> now you can safely buy candy bars or cups of coffee from the vending machines. lower the health regen on candy bars and coffee so it *truly* feels like this is a last resort. punish the player *effectively*, not just for no reason. \"you weren't careful. i know you're saving the cheese to stock up on saves, but then you won't have any health regen items. you'll have to GRIND, and yes, as long as you can get enough money you'll always have health items, but *GRINDING* in itself in a game where you *want* to explore and see new areas / puzzles is an EXTREMELY effective punishment. \n\nwhy the hell are there so many vending machines anyways? you have to stock up on batteries for your flashlight, which is arguably the most important item in the game. the only way to get rid of one type of enemy, the floor bombs, is pencils, which you can also stock up on in the store. don't forget those cardboard boxes that are sold too. and those little shrines that cost money. in the end, you are probably going to purchase one coffee in the entirety of the game.\n\nyuppie psycho has a fantastic sense of style. if you just absolutely have to play pixel horror puzzle games, give it a shot. just don't expect to have any fun with it outside of being impressed with the aesthetics of it. a plot that makes you feel bad for getting hyped/invested in it, tedious bosses, horrible boss gimmicks, and a save system that goes against the player (that could've been creatively implemented!) all completely ruin the experience of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1586113536, "timestamp_updated": 1586113622, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5723724365234375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66687028": {"recommendationid": "66687028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981555929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1586364431}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm terrified.", "timestamp_created": 1586105494, "timestamp_updated": 1586105494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491266161203384399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66630922": {"recommendationid": "66630922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399656395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1586183630}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Maravilloso", "timestamp_created": 1586043909, "timestamp_updated": 1586043909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66574439": {"recommendationid": "66574439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145817842", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1137, "last_played": 1604284643}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmosphere , story and no annoying jumpscares, it leaves some things unanswered  and the final part feels a bit rushed but they might release a DlC to fill that gap, overall it's a great experience\n\nThe DLC is out, It is enjoyable, adds an alternative route and new areas, there still are more mysteries that could be explored in future content but the game doesn't feel like it is missing something", "timestamp_created": 1585992681, "timestamp_updated": 1605468816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671676516532897949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66566849": {"recommendationid": "66566849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084455947", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1676704515}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely great.

Would NOT recommend if you dislike gore or bodily fluids, even pixelized.\n\nThis game deserves better than a 7/10. But I personally experienced a number of crashes that made me drop it that extra point, as well as some deaths that I felt were truly unfair (as in, \"full health to dead in under 3 seconds, while stunlocked\" unfair). It's a damn good horror title, dripping with atmosphere and the experience of going from \"OHGODWHATWASTHAT\" to \"ordinary, flourescent lit office building\" again and again was a wonderful example of tonal whiplash working in favor of a game that left me on edge and disquieted for almost the entire run. It's not without it's flaws, however. The game is fond of smacking the player around with little or no warning- while most enemies will give some kind of warning before attacking, that warning can be easy to miss if you're, say, running for your life with the music up all the way. BAM, you lost some health. And health items, while not super hard to get, don't heal for much, and there's no way to get a free heal that i found. Also, I personally found myself dying several times by getting a HAIR too close to something. No warning, back to the last save. Hope it was pretty recent! It got very irritating. Also, like I mentioned at the top, I crashed 4, 5 times. Might just be my computer, but that too was very trying. AS far as the story goes, (and I'll do my best to avoid spoilers), I only have 3 little problems with it. 1) The witch's accomplice is obvious from almost the word go. 2) The start of the climax hinges on the main character drinking something that he DAMN well should have known not to, after all that he's seen by the time that scene happens. 3) The climax and the ending happen a little too quick, pacing wise. It felt like the game had another hour or so of content before it was ready for things to come to a head. One minute, you're dodging horrors and poison gas, the next, climax, then it's at the endgame, which is very much a \"one final mission\" kind of deal, with the only side mission involving finding 6 characters scattered around the (Much more dangerous) game. There was also a few times when I honestly had no idea what I needed to do, and jsut had to brute force a solution. Not that I wanted the answers laid out for me, but enough direction that I didn't have to randomly guess as to the solution would have been nice.\nLook at all the crap I'm giving this game, and I freakign really enjoyed it! Contructive criticism, I promise. This game is well worth it's asking price, It's got multiple endings, great pixel graphics, and the cutscenes are really well done. Buy it, enjoy it, share it with others cause it deserves it.

Try to talk to a guy working on a computer? He starts flailing his arms and you lose health. See fireflies and want to investigate? They attack you and you lose health. See a guy with a box on his head pace around and try to talk to him? Somehow you lose health for that too...\n\nThe availability of healing items is limited and their usefulness is limited as they allow you to recover small amounts of health. But there's more, to save the game you also need a special item with limited availability.
