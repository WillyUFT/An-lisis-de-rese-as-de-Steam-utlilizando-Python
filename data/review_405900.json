As someone that doesn't usually have the patience to play any older tactical games, the gameplay in Disgaea feels pretty fast. Building a team feels satisfying due to the many ways of increasing stats and how much unit customization there is (although not nearly as much as in the later NIS games). That's not to say the game is balanced, some classes are objectively inferior to others, and there is one post-game class that is simply better than every other in the game (including the main characters).\n\nThe story is better than I expected, it's fun and lighthearted, but has some very good and even emotional points. Part of that may be due to my expectations for it being relatively low, knowing it is a satirical game. I didn't expect actual character development and likeable characters among the humour and tropes.\n\nThere is some post-game content and very strong superbosses, but getting to them involves a lot of grinding, and figuring out faster ways to grind and power up your units. If you don't enjoy that, you might not engage with this part of the game. Either way, finishing the story can take about 40 hours, so there's still plenty of content in the main progression.\n\nFrom the few tactical NIS games I have played, they have a very distinct and pleasant feel to them that I can't really put into words, but for that reason, I do recommend giving them a try.", "timestamp_created": 1699811051, "timestamp_updated": 1699811051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149737103": {"recommendationid": "149737103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296098509", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 3689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3689, "last_played": 1699406126}, "language": "english", "review": "This game goes crazy, give this a shot even if you're not a big fan of strategy RPGs (I've dropped every other SRPG I've started up until this lol)", "timestamp_created": 1699408873, "timestamp_updated": 1699408873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149698092": {"recommendationid": "149698092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069032274", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3705, "playtime_at_review": 4941, "last_played": 1700763768}, "language": "english", "review": "Disgaeaeaeaeaea.\n\nPretty fun SRPG with goofy vibes and the freedom to command a small army of high quality girls (and laharl) to insane quad digit levels.

Its significantly more difficult than later entries in the series, and while I think the most recent instalment dumbs it down a little too much, 4 and 5 are much better entry points into the series. The stories are largely disconnected, with a couple references you'll inevitably miss, but with a series as mechanically rich as this one, especially if you're more casual oriented, I think you'll need some time before you're ready to dive into this one. That being said, as a standalone product from someone who loves this series, I really enjoy it, and if you can handle the slightly archaic design, there's a lot of fun to be had here. I love the series' style of writing, and the artstyle and setting have both been massive inspirations to me, and I imagine many more out there.

The characters are funny and love-able, and the story is also.  As far as the story is concerned, it is one of my favorite games.  Most of the dialogue and sub-pots have a tongue-in-cheek type of delivery.  My main problem with the game is the difficulty curve, and the convoluted leveling system and mechanics.\n\nMore:\n\nIf you've heard anything about Disgaea, you have probably heard that it's 'grindy'.  This is an understatement.  You may stumble upon some forum posts that suggest it's not 'really' grindy, and that you just have to know some 'tricks' to level up fast.  Don't believe them.  If a game requires a cheese strat or some sort of exploitation of the AI or the design to get around the intended grindy way to play... then it is grindy by definition.  This game is grindy... period.  Repeating a single level 100 times to level up easy does not suggest it's not grindy, it proves that it is.  \n\nI put about 55 hours into this game, and about half of that time was spent in the item world playing randomly generated levels repeatedly, and trying to get my characters to a high enough level to beat the story.  The item world is not fun.  Leveling up the way the game intends for you to level up is not fun.  It's mind-numbingly boring and repetitive.  It's a waste of time.  In general, I do not respect games that do not respect my time.  This game is the king of not respecting your time.  \n\nThe main problem in this game is the way that your characters level up.  The only way they gain a level is by actually killing enemies.  So... if you have a dedicated healer, and they only heal... they can't level up.  You have to actually use the healer to kill an enemy to level up.  This is stupid.  This is a dumb way to level up characters in an RPG.  You do not get experience for hitting the enemy, or clearing battles... you have to actually deal a killing blow to get experience.\n\nThe second problem with this game is the difficulty curve.  You do not naturally level up to keep pace with your enemies.  Every new chapter brick-walls you as soon as you enter it.  The enemies are much stronger than you are, and it seems like the designers actually want you to spend at least twice as long leveling between each chapter than the amount of time that the chapter takes to play.  It's impossible to do it any other way. There are not enough enemies in the main game to level up fast enough to avoid grinding outside of the story line.  \n\nThe reason this game is not a 1 out of 5 is because I love the characters and the story.  The music, the artwork, the dialogue, voice acting etc... are great.  I usually have a really fun time playing this game when I'm not grinding to become strong enough to beat the next level.  There are tons of fun mechanics in this game, that other RPGs don't usually have.  The way you level up items is awesome.  Geo Symbols are items that change the terrain of battle so that they give different buffs and de-buffs to enemies and your characters.  It's a very interesting mechanic.\n\nLike I've stated earlier.  I've put 55 hours into this game, and a large portion of it is grinding.  I believe that I am close to the end of the game now... but I have yet again been stopped dead in my tracks by an unreasonable increase in difficulty.  This was the straw that broke the camels back.  I don't feel like grinding anymore to get strong enough to finish the game.  I'm bored with it.  I would love to see how this game ends, but I really don't care enough to keep pushing buttons and killing the same enemies over and over.  If I get back to this game and actually finish it... that's fine.  If I never finish it... that's fine.  It's no longer fun, and I don't really care anymore.\n\nI do plan on playing the sequels some day.  However, if I get the slightest hint that they play the same way as this game, then I have already decided I'm cutting my losses and quitting before I even really get started.  I think this type of game-play is bad.  More game does not necessarily equal a better game.

Genuinely my favorite game of all time. I've played every version to come out since I got it on DS 15 years ago. I'll being grinding up to Etna mode Baal until I die. But sadly I just so happen to have a graphics card that is straight up unsupported by the game. Seemingly the developers are very quick to abandon their released titles (likely due to a lack of funding for upkeep of them to be honest)\nIf you have an AMD graphics card I sadly cannot reccomend this port of the game, please try the Complete edition on playstation or switch. I prefer the older art style of the origin als which is why I used to like this port the most but clearly the developers don't care about that. I really qish I could reccomend my favorite game looking the way that I prefer it but I can't. The second game has the same issues, which seem even more egregious since that is the latest port of that title. \nPlease please please try this game Im begging you. It's phenomenal and addicting. The amount of customization options for your team is exhilarating and the story still resonates with me to this day. It seems like generic anime slop but i truly believe that there is so much care and love put into this series by the developers. But definitely make sure that it works on your computer before purchasing this specific port. \nThe android/ iOS port is technically the most feature complete version. Adding in the Cheat shop from the later games as well as autobattling which makes the grind way easier for on the go play. However that version is expensive for a phone game and is also plagued with visual bugs (though nothing gamebreaking like this one). Hopefully the devs decide to change their mind about fixing his title because I know it can be done. I am able to (sometimes) get it to run with an unfinished mod of all things; so I know that it's possible. \nIn short, this game means EVERYTHING to me, and I hope that the series continues to thrive as it has.

I'll explain why the Switch version is much much better later, but first I'll finish up my recommendation here.\n---------------------------------------------------------\nMost of the Nippon Ichi SRPG's are probably worth a play if you like the genre. They almost all have several unique gameplay gimmicks, metagame elements, a class unlock system, various grindy optional dungeons or mechanics for powerleveling both characters and items (yes items have levels), post-game content and a ridiculously high level cap. Disgaea 1 codified a lot of these aspects.\n\nNone of the Disgaea games have what I call \"great\" stories, but Disgaea 1 had a very good character driven story focused mostly around the 3 main characters. Laharl and Etna are both bratty demons, and Flonne is a naive angel, leading to some hilarious character interactions as they play off each other. Disgaea 1 actually deserves a lot of credit for creating the setting for the series, as the setting is pretty interesting. Essentially demons, angels, and humans all live in different worlds and each have sort of their own unique culture and quirks. As Disgaea takes place mostly in the netherworld (where demons live), we get exposed to the idea of a race of people who to some degree have inverted morality, with bad behavior being to some degree celebrated. This is a game where you try to pass gameplay changing bills through a senate, and are allowed to simply beat up senators who don't vote for your bill without it being considered a bad thing, and it's entirely in character for the setting.\n\nBut enough about that, what about gameplay? Well, you have a base panel where you deploy and can return units, and can send up to 10 out to go fight in turn based combat. It's got the typical mechanics with special attacks, magic, stats that do what they are supposed to, etc. But there's also other unique mechanics like team attacks if your units are adjacent, or being able to lift and throw both allied and enemy units. However there are also some metagame elements here as the game is built to encourage powerleveling units to absurd degrees. For example in the hub, you can create a unit who will be a pupil to another unit. Anytime the pupil levels up, the mentor gets stat boosts. The mentor can also be taught the pupil's spells, which is important if you want to get the most out of Flonne. You can also reincarnate units to reduce their level to 1 while keeping a percentage of their stats and abilities based on how much mana you use to reincarnate them, which makes them easier to keep leveling.\n\nI could go into detail about dozens of more quirky mechanics, like passing bills to increase enemy levels. But the point is this game has way way more depth than it appears at first glance. Ignore my displayed hour count.  That's just for the PC version. I also own this game on PS2, DS, and Switch, and likely have a combined total of over 300 hours on it... And this is probably my least favorite Disgaea game in terms of game mechanics. In many ways it gets better from here. Still, while this is also probably the hardest Disgaea game, and most of the games have nothing to do with the other games, I still think this is the best one to start with even with it's flaws.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nNow for the caveat I gave at the beginning. The Switch version is almost certainly the best version. It has HD sprites, some gameplay conveniences such as letting healers get exp from healing, and letting you reassign characters commands if the enemy dies prior to them attacking. It also has more overall postgame content. Additionally, this game is just generally the type of game you want to play on a handheld if you can. \n\nThe PC version is indeed the second best version. But it still loses out heavily to the Switch version. \n\nAdditionally this game in any of it's versions has a lot of issues caused by \"first installment syndrome\". Monsters can not get weapons that boost their int or spell range, making magic monsters almost worthless. Monsters have an abysmally stupid class unlock system where you have to defeat a certain amount of a monsters of a specific type and tier in order to reduce the cost to make them, and there isn't enough to balance monsters in general with humanoid classes. The Dark Assembly feature has and lacks a number of mechanics that make it kind of a chore to use compared to future games. The Item World (random dungeons generated in items to level them up), lacks almost every mechanic associated with it throughout the series, making them often boring grindfests. Weapons are seriously unbalanced, with Swords, Staffs and Guns outperforming everything, while Bows are borderline worthless. Most classes lack special abilities, making some just outright upgrades of others. It's a good game despite all of these problems, but know that the general gameplay for this one is in a lot of ways worse than even just Disgaea 2, let alone everything that comes after.", "timestamp_created": 1686252565, "timestamp_updated": 1686252565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794957995414733887", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139644676": {"recommendationid": "139644676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983120155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1686023192}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Tactical combat is fast paced and diverse. Individual character abilities are narrow, but made up for by huge team flexibility. [i]Disgaea[/i] doesn\u2019t just lean into the clich\u00e9 and tropes\u2026it puts on full scuba gear and dives on in.  That said, it is still a 20-year old [i]JRPG,[/i] with several mechanics that would be \u201cgrindy\u201d or \u201ctimewasters\u201d today. They were easy to ignore, though, so I end up rating  [i]Disgaea[/i] pretty highly.\n[hr][/hr]\n[i]Disgaea[/i] clearly isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s a bit dated\u2026clich\u00e9\u2026tropey\u2026with a story that is low-mid grade at best. But it knows exactly what it is and doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything else. By knowing exactly what it wanted to be, it became one of the absolute best dated, clich\u00e9, tropey, mid-grade stories I probably ever will play. From the cackling evil overlord with a heart of gold\u2026to the innocent, schoolgirl angel that still believes evil can learn to love\u2026to the robot that literally starts every line by monotonically, and literally, saying BEEP BEEP BLIP BEEP. By the end, you don\u2019t cringe for the clich\u00e9s or tropes, you cheer. A HUGE part of this is the fantastic voice acting. Despite hamming it up big time, every actor knew exactly how to make each character be taken seriously.\n\nUnlike a lot of JRPGs, [i]Disgaea[/i] is a squad based tactical game. While not nearly on the same level as [i]Final Fantasy Tactics[/i], the tactical combat was enjoyable, and fast paced enough that it doesn\u2019t feel grindy. Each character starts with a few abilities based on their class, and different abilities from their weapon. You only level your character when you kill a baddie, and your abilities/skills/spells only improve when you cast them. If you cast all [b]Ice[/b] spells and no [b]Shield[/b] spells, you will be casting [b]Omgea Ice[/b] by level 40, but your [b]Shield[/b] will be useless. This gets troublesome when your healers, who have no good attacks, stop leveling\u2026sure their healing keeps getting better, but it\u2019s a problem when they only have, like, 5 HP. I don\u2019t want to turn into a guide\u2026so I\u2019ll just say that once you understand the class and character system, there are ways around this. But if you don\u2019t research that stuff before you play, you probably will have a healer with the endurance of a soap bubble.\n\nSince characters only start with skills based on their class and weapon, they don\u2019t have a lot of options. You are expected to bring up to 10 different characters into the battle. Instead of building a small number of superheroes, you need to build a wide range of characters you can call on for any particular battle. Fortunately, this is a [i]JRPG[/i] at heart, so character/skill/gear management is fairly straightforward. You actually get to play the game instead of spending a ton of time managing a large group of characters.\n\nAs a very traditional [i]JRPG[/i], it has a number of flaws, like poor pacing (you only get to do 3-5 story missions before the level of the mission is way too high for your characters, and your only options to level are to grind up a few items similar to wandering around looking for random encounters). Excessive minigames that you could literally sink hundreds of hours into. Death in a long dungeon might mean you have redo the whole thing.  And a party with huge level splits, thanks to XP only given when contributing to a kill (I had a level 35 healer with my level 62 main character).\n\nOne thing I will give [i]Disgaea[/i] is that it had at least one fun minigame, it let you level up fairly painlessly, and gave you something good for your effort.  Item World.  You can take any piece of gear and go into a tactical combat game with 10 back-to-back levels. Each one you win powers up your gear, along with XP and leveling up skills. Hit that level roadblock on the story? Go level up a few pieces of your favorite gear and get back to it. Way more fun, satisfying, and in-game rewarding than chocobo farming. \n\nThe \u201dSenate\u201d minigame, on the other hand, made zero sense to me. I spent maybe an hour on it and gave up. It just wasn\u2019t fun. Fortunately, I was able to essentially ignore it, and still fully play and enjoy all the other parts of [i]Disgaea.[/i]\n\nBoth the Senate and Item World minigames are deep\u2026way too deep to be rational.

THE ONLY THINGS THEY COULD HAVE DONE WAS: 1 YOU CAN SKIP THE INTRO AND STAGE START SCREENS IF YOU WANT, THOSE STORIES. 2 ACCELERATE THE BREAKING OF GEO SYMBOLS. 3 PLACE SPOKEN AUDIO IN ALL INTRODUCTIONS OF THE PHASES, EXAMPLE THE 2nd PHASE ENTER FLONNE IS WITHOUT SPOKEN AUDIO AND ALL OF THEM HAVE. 4 AND THE LAST, MOST FRUSTRATING FOR ME WAS NOT BEING ABLE TO UNLOCK THE COOLEST CHARACTER IN THE GAME, VYERS.

You join up with the demon Etna and the fallen angel Flonne to take back your spot on the throne. Overall, story is cheesy in a good way! Gameplay is addicting, especially if you like strategy games. One thing to note though is that this game is full of the stereotypical anime tropes. If you like anime then great, otherwise its not for you. They did a good job on the music, and the game is harder than later games in the franchise (I've played 1, 4, 5, and 6), but its not that hard.

Ratings at the end, skip to there if you can\u2019t tolerate words.\n\nThis is, after trying four versions of this game including this one - in my honest opinion - not the best edition of the game, but if you're looking to play the most \"original\" version, it'll do well. Check out the mobile version ((yes, I am serious)) or if you have a platform that can play Disgaea 1 Complete, I recommend that over this. Is Disgaea PC bad? Absolutely not. But you should be aware that other options exist.\n\nDisgaea was a series I was somewhat aware of as I grew up. Unfortunately, some rather overzealous fans of the series had kind of put me off wanting to do anything with it. I had never even been aware what kind of game it was until I saw it being played. After that, I decided to pick it up myself - I am a huge fan of Tac-RPG series such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem.\n\nI spent the vast majority of my 40+ hours in Disgaea PC on a single stayover at a friend's house - at the time I was playing Disgaea 1 on Switch. I had put some brief time into Disgaea PC, but it had been many years and I could barely remember there being any differences at all.\n\nI cannot begin to describe the differences, so I won't bother. Instead, I'll just say Disgaea PC \"won't hold your hand\" and is \"hard on purpose\". Disgaea 1 Complete on the other hand seems to have a more balanced play style that is more welcoming overall, instead of only to a niche demographic. Skill issues notwithstanding, it is possible to enjoy either version of this game.\n\nTime for me to rake in all the haters. All in all I didn't really feel any of the characters or the plot was very memorable in extreme ((I am one of the few here who will say as much - do note I really just mean the plot/chars were okay, but I didn't especially have many events or people I actually liked)). Look, it's not that I really hated or even disliked the characters - I felt each of them served their plot role pretty well - some maybe a little too well, even. The best way I can describe it is the game seemed overly, massively and especially focused on tropes over actual world-building. You'll get a lot of events and personal relationships happening on-screen, a lot of hilarious hi-jinks and posturing, but very little lore or history about the world within the game. \n\nHonestly, the troop creation menu does a better job explaining the culture of the Netherworld than the whole rest of the game seemed to - and this is something that really didn't sit well with me, as from what I could tell, the Netherworld itself sounded like a very interesting world to get into from a lore perspective. Not to say that world-building was completely left out - I just feel there wasn\u2019t anywhere near enough.\n\nThe thought put into the game's systems when we get to unit creation, however - those are done very, very well. For one, this game has the ability to create and upgrade units that goes above and beyond any tac-RPG I have played. As far as Reincarnating and even switching between unit types and carrying over Spells, the Mentor system to teach a unit Spells and powers from other units, it's absolutely spectacular. Honestly, if that was the entire game, hundreds of missions with zero actual plot and constantly leveling created units, I'd be sold on that alone. I've created many hierarchies and dynasties of units that I became heavily invested in - often to the point of finding the completely overpowered \"main characters\" to be just in the way of my own enjoyment. \n\nThere is also the Item World, something which the game briefly introduces to you early on and something I heavily recommend NOT skipping over until the end - do what you can as you can do it. It\u2019s a worthwhile investment that does much more for you as you play the game than it would at the very end of all the plot.\n\nThere's other unique features to the Disgaea tac-RPG and the series as a whole ((such as the Hospital rewards, Geo Symbols, throwing your units or combining enemy units)) but I won't go over in detail how all these mechanics work - this is a review, not a guide. All I will say is that if you're looking for a game that'll give you countless hours of enjoyment and some unpredictable hilarity, you would be hard pressed to find many that do it as well as Disgaea.\n\nDoes this game have unique, differentiated characters who are simple enough to understand yet complex enough to go through their own struggles and have their own motivations? Yes.\n\nBut I found myself much more drawn in by the complexity in the units themselves and how they operated and grew over time as I progressed through the game. \n\nIn a time in my life where I basically stopped playing almost every RPG around, Disgaea still managed to impress me, and I\u2019ll likely continue playing it, and the series, for a while after this.\n\n\n\n\nAll in all TL;DR Review\n\nGame: 9/10. Fantastically solid. You should play it through at least once.\nPlot: 4/10. Expected much, much more from the insane levels of hype.\nCharacters: 6/10. Not bad, but not especially memorable to me personally.\nMusic: 9/10. Exactly as zany as it needs to be, while staying expressive.\nCombat: 10/10. Always keeps me on my toes, gives me lots of options. \nRelevancy: 9/10. Disgaea manages to stick in my games even almost 8 years later.\n\nValue for your price - Well worth the purchase.\nAre other options besides this version available? Yes.\nBut if you're looking for a game on PC, I do recommend you play through Disgaea.", "timestamp_created": 1674532466, "timestamp_updated": 1674532466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655874848365783691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131403992": {"recommendationid": "131403992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030384775", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 5221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3657, "last_played": 1675555608}, "language": "english", "review": "It may not be the best port in the world, but its more than worth the cost if you are willing to play the game for all its worth.

Expansive post-game, forgiving difficulty, and an endearing story.[/h1]\n\nThis series' reputation of being a grindfest is overblown by people who avoid the Item World. There's a clear point of diminishing returns you'll hit if you're repeating story stages for experience points, and many people don't take the hint to move on.\n\nDon't let my playtime fool you; that's thanks to two \"from scratch\" save files, and collecting/maxing out every ultimate weapon for fun. If your only goal's completing all of the alternative endings, getting the best ultimate weapon [spoiler](Yoshitsuna)[/spoiler], and then killing [spoiler]Baal/Zetta[/spoiler], you're probably in for a good fifty hours altogether.\n\n[h1]Do yourself a favor and play using a speedhack. 3x speed is comfortable for doing Item World runs if your CPU has the overhead for it.[/h1]\n\nIf Disgaea suffers from one thing, it's that you're implicitly pressured to make one uber-powerful character. This throws the \"T\" out of \"TRPG\", as instead of your units each being like keys; useful in specific circumstances but useless in others; you have one 80ft skeleton key in the form of a battering ram. As if this wasn't busted enough, you can reach even more ludicrous heights, literally and figuratively, by exploiting its [b]\"lift and throw\"[/b] mechanics.\n\n[h1]Cheese! \ud83e\uddc0[/h1]\n\nFriendly units in this game can lift hostile units, as well as each other. This, when coupled with the ability to \"undo\" the movement action of a unit, allows them to politely hold doors open for each other (if the unit hasn't attacked/cast a spell/etc. during their turn). Chokepoint with a big bad got you down? Exit gate three squares away, but you can't reach it?\n\nNo problem. Just send Stinky Wizzleteats, your Level 1 Incompetent Rogue, to lift that level 5000 chimera, move your 'battering ram' unit [i]behind[/i] your enemy's carefully crafted line, and then cancel the lift.\n\nThis sends Stinky back to his starting position (even despawning him for later retrieval if his starting position was the Dimensional Gate), and your competent unit that's already passed through gets to keep his new position.\n\nIf this isn't playing dirty enough for you, you can also lift units lifting units. In the item world, this means you can typically clear each floor in a single round by creating stacks of six friendly units all throwing each other. Still not grimy enough? Take on a superboss, sucker punch it with your strongest unit, and then lift said strongest unit with another friendly one.\n\nThe superboss will Dr. Manhattan your sacrificial friendly, but no hostile NPCs will target the now-dropped friendly, and the round will end. [b][i]You can do this up to nine times per stage.[/i][/b]\n\n[i][b]I love this game.[/b][/i]\n\n\n[h1]Tips for Being Overlord:[/h1]\n\n\n[olist][*][b]Focus Development on Custom Characters[/b]\n\nYou won't always have access to Story characters. While they do retain their stats, levels, and equipment, on subsequent playthroughs you [b][i]will[/i][/b] need to re-acquire many of them.\n\n[*][b]Weapon Stats and Mastery v.s. Character Level[/b]\n\nDon't worry about cumulative character level through reincarnations as much as equipment level and weapon mastery. You'll see better returns this way. A total level of 9,000 is perfectly adequate to complete all the game's content.\n\n[*][b]Maxing Equipment Stat Growth[/b]\n\nWhen you have a weapon you want to maximize the potential of, enter its Item World and subdue its specialists immediately upon entering before using a 'Gency's Exit' to escape. If you don't find a specialist right away, reload a save.\n\nOnce you've subdued all specialists, move in [b][i]stat-boosting specialists, all complementing the attributes you care most about.[/i][/b] With this done, re-enter the Item World, and skip to the exit of nine of every ten levels. Every tenth level you'll encounter an 'Item General'. Kill [b][i]every unit on these floors.[/i][/b]\n\nEvery thirtieth, sixtieth, and ninetieth floor of items strong enough to have that many will award you with an additional slot for a specialist. After completing these stages, use a 'Gency's Exit' and fill the item to capacity. Then, re-enter.\n\nThis influences the stat growth of items enough to make a big difference over time.\n\n[*][b]Maxing Weapon Potential[/b]\n\nWhen you have a new custom unit you've created in the Dark Assembly, make them a Majin. Then, train them up with the weapon you plan to have them using as their final class using a level 300 Armsmaster in their equipment. This will boost the speed they improve their Weapon Mastery with that weapon type immensely, to a maximum value of 255.\n\n[b]Weapon Mastery increases the stats of a weapon, but no other piece of a unit's equipment, by 5% per level. [u]By level 255, this increases to 1275%.[/u][/b]\n\n[*][b]Bribing the Dark Assembly on a Budget[/b]\n\nOnce you've gotten the alternative ending for [spoiler]killing the Dark Assembly 100 times in a playthrough to force bills to pass[/spoiler], call the Assembly to raise the military budget and bribe senators with the cheapest trash you can buy. Only bother giving an item to a senator who \"Must Have!\", \"Strongly Interested\", or \"Interesting\". In that order.\n\nOnce a Senator's disposition has reached [b]'Love \u2665'[/b], don't give them anything else. They're maxed out.\n\n[*][b]Underworld Civics Class: How to Actually Pass a Bill[/b]\n\nBills proposed to the Dark Assembly will only pass if the sum of the character levels of those in favor is greater than those against by a margin equalling the Mana cost needed to propose the bill in the first place.\n\nRealistically, this means you'll likely be killing the Dark Assembly to unlock a handful of levels most playthroughs.\n\n[*][b]Don't Reincarnate Just to Learn the Skills of Another Class[/b]\n\nMentors can learn \"generic\" humanoid abilities from their Pupils if they stand on a tile bordering them. Once the ability has been used enough times to reach at least \"Level 1\", they can then use said ability without their Pupil present.\n\n[*][b]Mentor/Pupil Stat Gain and Matching Rarity Bonuses[/b]\n\nA Mentor's Pupil with the highest value for a given stat is referenced for a 10% bonus to their Mentor.\n\nA separate bonus altogether, matching the rarity value across all four equipment slots on a single character gives more significant returns. This said, it's worth chasing when reloading Item World Level 100 and [spoiler]Baal once per playthrough for a Super Robo Suit[/spoiler].\n\nIf you have two items with the same Rarity value, you gain a 10% bonus to all stats conferred by said items. You get 20% for 3 items, and 30% when all four equipment slots match.\n\nWhy I said \"wait for endgame\" comes down to number ranges. A Legendary-rarity item only has ten possible rarity values, so in addition to having the most room for stat growth thanks to a higher max item level, you also have a far greater chance of stealing a complement to your existing gear.\n\n[*][b]Only Level Weapons and [spoiler]Super Robo Suits[/spoiler][/b]\n\nNo matter how good the Armor, until [spoiler]Super Robo Suits[/spoiler], Accelerators and their Movement/Jump bonuses are some of the best equipment in the game for the number of options better positioning gives you.\n\n[*][b]The Only Armor Worth Equipping is Accelerators and Footwear Until Endgame[/b]\n\nMovement and Jump bonuses have a much greater return on investment, and are far more versatile (especially for support units).\n\nOrbs are sometimes worth it for increased SP capacity early-game.[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1670930070, "timestamp_updated": 1670937243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765395164489746094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128407802": {"recommendationid": "128407802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198939774909", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5854, "last_played": 1697178896}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like grindy games and hilarious situations, this is the game for you.\nAlso remember, as a wise man once said: don't every buy no weed from the gas station.", "timestamp_created": 1670821064, "timestamp_updated": 1670821064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128292562": {"recommendationid": "128292562", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062680135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1670860618}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1670679896, "timestamp_updated": 1670679896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471124589443206787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128219406": {"recommendationid": "128219406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056727661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 131867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131856, "last_played": 1685479212}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this with an AMD card and all the sprites will be black boxes.

Great humor, great sprites, tons of skills to unlock and max out.

However, the grinding aspect of the game is pretty clunky and it's actually pretty difficult to gain levels, at least for the main story. Now again this wouldn't really be a big deal but the game has some pretty sharp difficulty spikes in a game that is already pretty tough. The last couple chapters in particular are unreasonably harder. That being said, if you look up what to do then grinding levels to beat the main story wont take you too long. It took me about 30 hours to beat the main story and maybe about 7 of that was grinding. However, grinding itself just feels very tedious and unfun in this game, making it feel much longer than it actually is. In most games, especially in one with such a huge post-game, I don't think that grinding to beat the main story should really be required.\n\n2. The main story is very.... meh. While I think that the chararcters and the dialogue are good, the main story leaves a lot to be desired. It feels very messy with no focus, this mostly comes from there being no central story to follow and no main villain. There are a lot of chapters where the characters just do things or go to new places or meet new people, and its only in the last few chapters where there is actually any stakes and cohesive plot. This leaves the ending feeling very rushed with more than a few plot holes. And to top it all off there are multiple endings with the good/true ending being locked behind a fairly arbitrary requirement.\n\nIf you're quite into tactics games I would say it's at least worth checking out. If you're unsure than check out Disgaea 5, which is much better imo.", "timestamp_created": 1667266628, "timestamp_updated": 1667266729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124708529": {"recommendationid": "124708529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252371860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1688004129}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game at a fantastic price ^-^", "timestamp_created": 1667207144, "timestamp_updated": 1667207144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124666764": {"recommendationid": "124666764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012262764", "num_games_owned": 1162, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1688422894}, "language": "english", "review": "Dood", "timestamp_created": 1667145890, "timestamp_updated": 1667162253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124626815": {"recommendationid": "124626815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073666563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2025, "last_played": 1669526428}, "language": "english", "review": "Great throw-back turn based combat game.

Take anything I say with a grain of salt. This port has issues which, if you look, you can find copious documentation online.\n\nGeneral thoughts: \nI feel like Disgaea has aged well. The gameplay loop is comprised of three major parts - story chapters and stages, the item world, and post-game bosses. You can level your characters, their skills, their weapon mastery (which increases stat gain from the weapon as well as unlocks other bonuses like new weapon skills (or range and damage for staves), and even the items they have equipped by hopping into the Item World.\n\nStory:\nThe plot is very solid. With no spoilers for those who haven't played the game in it's 20 years of being out, it's a not-so-by-the-books Coming of Age story about a young demon named Laharl as he attempts to prove himself as the new Overlord of the Netherworld. The pacing is pretty quick. Each chapter is divided into about 4-5 stages that develops that section of story almost in a \"Saturday Morning Cartoon\" way. There's many references to older anime and shows. (Kurtis, a character introduced late into the story, is essentially a giant reference to Cyborg 009). The things in the game can be pretty silly, and writing doesn't hesitate to poke fun of itself, it's characters, or the world they're in.\n\nThe gameplay:\nAt it's core the gameplay is very easy for you to get \"lost\" in. There's so many numbers you can increase (that you don't have to) that you can essentially pick something and grind. There's a few obvious levels intended to make leveling easy, and others that you can easily level things such as weapon mastery in, so you should never be stuck. The item world is the most aged part of the series, however, with some floors in the randomly generated dungeon spawning a gate you can't reach, or enemies that are on an island you can't get to. Always take a \"Mr. Gency's Exit\" with you just you case. This problem has been fixed, from what I can tell, in the Disgaea 1 Complete port.\n\nAll of this being said...\n\nIf you have the option between this version or Disgaea 1 Complete on Switch/PS4 I'd recommend you get Disgaea 1 Complete. It increased the \"Statistician\" innocent cap from 300, to 900, giving you six times more experience gain. It fixed the item world randomization, and it fixed a few known crash issues. The only reason I'm playing this over the other version is for achievements and because I prefer the old sprites. D1C lazily reused D5 sprites of completely different classes instead of drawing new sprites for old monsters that haven't been seen in newer games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665766555, "timestamp_updated": 1665766555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123813577": {"recommendationid": "123813577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211662712", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1936, "last_played": 1666790353}, "language": "english", "review": "Although somewhat dated when compared to the modern entries, Disgaea PC still holds up as one of the most player-friendly SRPGs on the market.

[b]However,[/b] upon playing more and reading guides -and I really mean LOTS of guides-, the flow of the game became more stable.\n\nStarting with the plot, it features a simple yet attracting characters and dialogues. I only got up to chapter 10 at the time I'm writing this review, but so far I'm enjoying everything. Each of the main cast characters are unique, and most of the time the dialogues turns into comedy/slapstick situations, which I absolutely love. While this is a big positive point for me, what really hooked me into it was the next part: the gameplay.\n\nThe game rewards you for being patient. The game rewards you for leveling classes, even if they seem useless, and killing monsters -by reducing their mana cost at the Dark Assembly, place where you can create new characters. There are 2 main 'battle', if you can call it like that, scenes: gates, where you can either do main story or another unlockable, and the maps and enemies are pretty much the same, and Item World, a place where the maps and enemies changes constantly, but where you can upgrade your weapons/gear/items. Why did I said I liked the gameplay? Well, the Item World is just addicting. While you upgrade stuff, you also get more items in the way, level up your characters and even gather specialists, which basically are another upgrade to equipment -but that can be moved. It must be warned that Item World takes way too much time, and the grind scene in this game is real. However, the rewards are pretty satisfying, and you can also beat the main story without doing much grind, so it's pretty much balanced.\n\nThe only negative points I see with this game, along with the PC port:\n- Healers/Supports are useless, as they won't get EXP for healing (and, because of that, they can't upgrade staff mastery nor level up). Thank to one game mechanic, you can teach them spells such as fire, wind or ice, so they can deal some damage. However, as for someone who has 100% new, it took me a lot of time to see that.\n- Any I/O device being manipulated with the game open can cause it to crash. Lost Item World progress twice due to my controller being disconnected -thank you for nothing, Steam Big Picture.\n- There are some other bugs that may cause the game to crash, but haven't encountered any other so far. However, this, along with the fact that you can't save inside IW, makes it risky to play at times. \n- Dark Assembly. Not that I find it unfair, since there is probably a reason as to why some bills are mostly rejected. However, there's no in-game information about it. Like this, some other mechanics in the game are hidden unless you discover it or read it on a guide. The fact that I'm using DA as an example is mostly because there are no explainations as for bribings before voting, which is one of the most important aspects imo. \n- As I've mentioned above, almost everything is either you discover it or read it somewhere. As such, it might be difficult to properly enjoy the game itself.\n\nBought for 3.99\u20ac during Steam sale, worth the price but I'd suggest getting the handheld versions (PSP, DS or Switch) if you can't stand sitting in front of a screen to grind for lots of hours. It's also worth mentioning that there are different versions for this game, being them:\n[list]\n[*] Original (PS2)\n[*] PSP (some minor updates)\n[*] DS (QoL improvements, new unlockable characters)\n[*] PC (somewhat PSP and a little DS, but without the QoL improvements)\n[*] HD remake (Switch-PS4, some more QoL improvements)\n[/list]\nFor a 'classic' experience, PC (aka this one) seems the best so far. I'd recommend the HD remake elsewhere, and mostly if you have 0 knowledge about Disgaea at all. Keep in mind, though, that even with QoL improvements, the grind is still present. \n\n[b]So TL;DR:[/b] if you love to get the very best team, like no one ever was, then this is the perfect game. The grind is kinda entertaining and rewarding, + funny story dialogues and iconic trio main cast.", "timestamp_created": 1663587441, "timestamp_updated": 1663587441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122342713": {"recommendationid": "122342713", "author": {"steamid": "76561199367884586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1665033537}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're into Tactical RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, or other grid based RPG games you will love Disgaea.

The sprites are really nice, not as HD as the complete version but still really good. The art of the characters in the menus and cutscenes are amazing. I don't think this game aged badly at all visually.\n\n+From a soundtrack perspective, Disgaea is always top notch. The different jams in the OST is just godlike. Maybe not my favorite in terms of soundtrack (Disgaea 5 would be my favorite), still top tier regardless.\n\n+On the note of sound design, the voice acting of this game is just godlike. The voice acting of every Disgaea game is top tier but this one is by far the best. I would recommend playing this game in the English dub, which may seem sacrilegious to most but honestly the characters just hit harder. Specifically Etna in English is just... dam, for the lack of a better word. Laharl and Flonne comedy hit different as well in the dub. Overall very very good voice acting job.\n\n+From a gameplay perspective, this game is still the same old Disgaea. Grinding and getting overleveled is just the way of life. I think the map design among the main maps are really nice and unique. The geo puzzles really require a fair amount of thinking. I do think maybe this Disgaea might be in the more difficult side of the series but still very fun. It may lack some features in the later games but this comes from it being the first game.\n\n+On the note of gameplay, the loop is forever addictive. The hardwork truly pays off when you finally hit your first 100k damage and the like. I mean honestly for theres many ways to play this game. You can opt to capture tons of high level monsters and cheese the game with lifting big bosses at the end of every turn. Regardless of how you play the game, the grind is just very satisfying.\n\n+Now for the story... By far the best Disgaea story in the series (Only played 1-5 so far). The comedy is just top tier. The way the humans, angels and demons interact is top tier. The world itself is just really nice. The story is just driven really by the characters which are up there among the best characters in all the series. I find it strange some people would criticize the story for being too childish... Did they even play the game? This game is strangely mature and tackles childish topics in a different way.\n\n+On the note of characters, the characters and the dynamic of the characters is by far the best. The main trio is really funny and just bounce of each other really well. The defenders of Earth are a funny bunch that actually added to the story. Side characters like midboss and Seraph aren't bland and boring. Definitely up there among the best set of characters.\n\n+The dialogue is by far the best in the series so far. I think the comedy is really funny. Lots of humor for all audiences. When I played this game as a teenager and even now, I noticed lots of mature jokes that flew over my head as a kid. Etna with her next episode previews is so dam funny.\n\n+Etna\n\n-The item world is definitely a slug to go through in this game. No bonus stages. The map RNG might be the worst in the series where the maps can range from massive but empty or miniscule but filled. \n\n-Resetting the shop over and over for specific gear is annoying. Resetting the assembly over and over for specific influence is annoying.\n\n-Male over female thieves in this version...\n\n-No jumping in the main base. Can't believe this was only added in Disgaea 2. Doesn't really actually change anything but don't we all like jumping really high after grinding.\n\n-Lacking in side content and quality of life changes found in later games. This is just a problem coming from the fact that its the first game. Stuff like only having 3 or 4 bonus dimensions or diagonal throw being locked to timing or the fact that you have to cancel your move all the time. Might be jarring if you come from the later games but doesn't really bother me.\n\nOverall, my most played Disgaea game and I personally think it holds up. Maybe not the most refined in the series in terms of gameplay, the gameplay loop is still really addicting and the story and characters really bring it home.", "timestamp_created": 1659494632, "timestamp_updated": 1669302633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639595448970794678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119938659": {"recommendationid": "119938659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121733143", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 6335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6335, "last_played": 1553207582}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1659448379, "timestamp_updated": 1659448379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119620531": {"recommendationid": "119620531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168598107", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1438, "last_played": 1657169139}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry but had to give this game a negative review.

Not personally a fan of NISA's localization \"style\", but it's still a really nifty game despite that.\n\nI have to play it on my Steam Deck though (Using the in-game windowed mode to prevent stretching), because fullscreen on my main Windows PC is actually just borderless fullscreen that stretches the game window, and there' an endless D-Pad moving up issue, no matter what I do (Yes, I've disabled unused controller devices too). Hardcoding resolution options is going to cause problems no matter what.\n\nThe port also is stuck at 720p internally (So the game on a large display has problems, and with displays that don't evenly divide by the resolution, it will be overly blurry thanks in no part to the lack of integer scaling), and there's very noticeable flickering/strobing (Which may pose as an accessibility problem for some) with the in-game SSAO implementation. I'd suggest disabling it. Likewise, use a FreeSync monitor to play (or just play on a Steam Deck), because the game is going to have stuttering/frametime problems otherwise, since there's a framerate cap that is not user exposable. You will want to use the PrettyPrinny mod to play the game, but using the lite version in conjunction with recent versions of Special K (For the windowed mode latency optimizations). As far as I'm concerned, this release of the game also lacks the content from the mobile version (Which is usually cheaper than this version without discounts), or the Nintendo Switch releases. There is a mod to add some of the content from the PSP version, but it also seemingly breaks compatibility with PrettyPrinny.\n\nCan I recommend this game based off the time I've played? Probably, need more time to think about it, may change the yes/no recommendation once I play more. Probably with some massive asterisks especially in the UX department, because the PC port definitely has some problems that never got addressed officially, and spending hours in a debugger trying to get the game work is something that I personally would rather not do if possible.", "timestamp_created": 1656366979, "timestamp_updated": 1656366979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56537318229675293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117710264": {"recommendationid": "117710264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043225688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3219, "last_played": 1656583282}, "language": "english", "review": "favorite series all time", "timestamp_created": 1656318785, "timestamp_updated": 1656318785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117660229": {"recommendationid": "117660229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125928371", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 30475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30475, "last_played": 1673524728}, "language": "english", "review": "Disgaea PC is basically the definitive version on Disgaea 1.

I\u2019m only sad that I just recently found out that Disgaea games have found their way to Steam. Disgaea PC will take you anywhere from 20-40 hours to get through depending on your playstyle. If you plan on 100% the achievements, you\u2019re looking at roughly 80+ hours of play time. \n\nThe best part of this game is the grind as most of you already know. And even though this is a 20-year-old game, it\u2019s hard to find anything that can come close to challenging it. What surprised me the most was the updated visuals for this version of the game. It can compare to pretty much any recently released pixel game. With that said the best-looking version of this game is Disgaea 1 Complete which is on the Switch and PS4 (I think). That version has hi res textures and sprits. So, keep that in mind if purchasing. \n\nThe weakest element of this game is the story. It\u2019s a bunch of gibberish for the most part. It has a good amount of laugh out loud moments but overall, it\u2019s not very good. But you know the saying with Disgaea games: \u201cYou don\u2019t play Disgaea for the story\u201d. The only other thing that is a little annoying is that the game is biased towards sword users and mages. If you want to power level your characters you will have to be a sword user (or mage).  \n\nThis is an easy recommend from me and if you\u2019re new to the series this is probably the one to start with as it\u2019s considered to be one of the easiest Disgaea games.

I have never seen a game with similar gameplay like this before. However, since it's a unique game, it can be very different. In some mostly good ways, but a few bad ways, as well.\n\n[u]The good stuff:[/u] I love the amazing style of this game. Its artwork, its gameplay, its music, and especially its humor. I haven't laughed at any other game more than this one. From its sexual comments to its item descriptions, I find a lot of creative writing put into this game. The way that items work in this game is unique, too. You can tailor any item VERY in-depth. You can upgrade its stats, such as the statistician class which will give you experience, you can upgrade its strength, health, etc. You can hire a huge number of classes. Once you defeat an enemy in the game, you can \"tame\" it by spending mana on it, letting it become your sidekick. You can level it up from there.\n\n[u]The bad stuff:[/u] This game is grindy as fuck. 85% of the hours that I put into this game is grind. The game isn't very \"beginner-friendly\" if you're starting out the Disgaea series with this game first. That's what I read online, at least. The story doesn't progress your levels. You have to put in lots of effort in order to get better, which results in you using guides in order to find the best strategies to level you up. The game doesn't hold your hand, which is fine, but at times, the game can feel unfair at certain points. So much to the point where I almost quit the game at the final boss because I felt \"satisfied enough\" at the end of the game, and I didn't want to spend a dozen more hours just to get my characters to a better level. However, with some cheese and a decent strategy, I beat it in about 3-4 attempts.\n\n[u]Overall:[/u] I believe that the pros outweigh the cons slightly. I found plenty of joy in this game, but towards the end, it felt more like a chore. I wanted to finish the game so that I could move onto something else, but the game gets very repetitive at times.

Play the game normally by getting Laharl to a decent level by soloing the game with him (30-40) then have him specifically make a red mage and get that mage to level 12.\nStep 2. Capture a high level monster by stacking enemies onto each other and maxing Laharl's attack with Braveheart then having him go back into the base panel, then throw the enemy onto the panel. This is still random so it may fail, don't give up. (Only monster enemies, humanoids always break panel guaranteed)\nStep 3.

If you like the cute chibi style of animated sprites your in for a treat. Everything  is smooth and animated well. \nStory - A. Quirky, funny and keeps you involved till the end. \nMusic - A. Great soundtrack that fits the comedy/drama theme well.\nGame play  - A. Easy menu system and fun battle system. \nSo Is this the perfect game? Well yes and no... I loved it, but if there was one thing I didn't expect its the GRIND! yes you read that,...If you don't watch any tutorials on this game and go in blind expect to GRIND  HUNDREDS of hours away to get all the BEST weapons , CHARACTERS and even kill the real FINAL BOSS, It's like the programmers are a bunch of SADIST at Nippon Ichi.

Overall, the first game in the Disgaea series is the roughest of all of them, and is definitely skippable. Once you play any of the later ones, you will find yourself struggling to return to this one.\n\nFor what it is worth, this Disgaea does have the best story out of all of them. The characters aren't irredeemably trope-y and have actual growth (...just don't play Disgaea D2). It also has pretty much all of the core gameplay of the rest of the series... albeit lacking some polish that speeds up the later games. This game is absolutely worth it if you can handle the original style, but I recommend simply using the original PS2 or Switch if possible.\n\n[If you skip it, you can still get a fair amount of story through the anime.]", "timestamp_created": 1648178191, "timestamp_updated": 1648179417, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484649419784545898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112726310": {"recommendationid": "112726310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044628380", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 14376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13759, "last_played": 1648257932}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh I haven't rated this yet?\nIts an amazing game which set the standard for SRPG with humor.

The game is pretty well written, it's funny, and while the voice acting is well... not really the best honestly compared to modern standards, it's definitely good enough to enjoy the dialogue. The max level in this game is 9999, though with rebirth it's closer to 180000 something. I've not experienced a ton to get any kind of idea how fast that grind is, but they made sure grinding wasn't near the kind of slog it is in other games, such as Final Fantasy, and it kind of reminds me of Earthbound, except instead of auto winning, you just move your char into the middle of a group and watch them counter the lives away.\n\nThis isn't the HD Remake they did for Mobile and Switch, Disgaea 1 Complete, however it honestly doesn't need to be. They didn't add much but some nicer modern sprites. The pixel art is pretty well done, and most of the real dialogue has the characters up front and center anyway for their full art to shine.\n\nTLDR; Great RPG, built on grinding though grinding isn't as much of a slog as other games.

I somewhat enjoyed the Strategy/Tactical RPG genre before playing this game (played the Final Fantasy Tactics series, tried playing Ogre Battle, but just couldn't get into this one), but the combination of humor and over the top numbers/gameplay really hooked something into me and I became a fan  of the series. \n\nI don't believe the graphics for this version of the game have changed at all since the PS2/PSP remake days, and that can certainly throw some people off. I try not to let such things both me, but it does seem extremely dated and a bit ugly when compared to the updated HD character sprites in later games (especially 4 and 5). \n\nThe gameplay mechanics are Disgaea at it's core. Leveling characters up to 9999, then transmigrating them to level 1 with boosted stats, only to do it all over again, like 10+ more times is a series staple, and it started here. This version includes the updates from PSP, which includes a better level grinding spot for end game than the original PS2 version. Item World it at its very basic form, including creating levels where it may be impossible to get to enemies/geo crystals. I personally have never encountered an random item world level that didn't have the next level portal within reach of the starting portal space, but I could just be lucky. The game DOES warn you about this, though.\n\nThis version of the game does, unfortunately, lack quite a few QoL features that were introduced in other, later games. You can speed up battle animations, and skip them entirely, but can't speed up characters movement. Once you've moved a character (but haven't confirmed an action for them), you can't simply reposition then if you accidentally moved them to the wrong spot. If you cancel their move, it sends them all the way back to their original location, including back into the base panel, where you would have to completely re-select them and then move them again. This, combined with the slow character movement, can really slow down grinding/item world exploration. The views you are able to change to in battle are more limited, and there's really not a top-down view option (at least that I've found), which can make positioning and even finding characters/items (especially in item world) tricky. You can see which bonus bosses you've beaten, but can't see a list of which endings you've gotten. I would absolutely love if some of these QoL improvements were implemented in a patch, but I believe that will never happen at this point.  NIS, at least give us Disgaea 1 Complete, even if it is the crappy Switch/PS4 version, dood!\n\nSo, if you want to experience the original, non Complete remake version of Disgaea 1, this is the game for you. If you can deal with the issues mentioned (because you absolutely love the series, like me, and are willing to deal with the flaws in this version, or have just never played a Disgaea game, and are looking to get into it from where it started), then this game is for you.

Level up to 9999 twenty times over to get the maximum over-Level up.\n\nIt has nice and well-implemented systems for it main purpose and you can become obscenely powerful if yo put your mind to it and tackle on the grinding of the system wisely or if you simply invest more time. There are diminishing returns but if you are willing to grind to the maximum power possible there are even challenges that will make all those ridiculous numbers count for something and sometimes even not be enough. Well; one challenge. It's a penguin.\n\nI realize it sounds like I'm chewing on the game but it's not that at all. Sometimes you want to grind. Sometimes you want a light-hearted story with a bit of dark humor and Disgaea will do you just fine. I personally had a swell time Leveling up.\n\nOne warning: This does NOT have the graphic overhaul of Disgaea complete. You are going to be playing what is basically a re-purposed emulator for a portable console (pixels) on your computer screen and chances are you're either going to be focusing on a very small window or are going to see giant pixels.

One day, I had been browsing on steam and saw the Disgaea Dood Bundle on sale for an astounding price (around $20?). I saw that this game had the [i]Strategy RPG[/i] tag on it, but saw no review comparing this game to Fire Emblem. I decided to try the game out considering these factors.\nAt the moment, I have completed the Main Story of the game, but there are more features to it. As I read in a guide, the main story is about 5% of the game (grinding and achievements constitute the 95%).\nOh, and by the way, the maximum level threshold is Level [spoiler]9999[/spoiler]. My party, at the time of completing my main story, averaged around Level [spoiler]52[/spoiler]. The enemies in the final level averaged around Level [spoiler]80[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]Comparison to Fire Emblem[/h1]\nThis game is radically different than Fire Emblem, with the introduction of new mechanics such as:\n[spoiler]\n[olist]\n[*] Lifting and Throwing Allies\n[*] Moving after attacking (if you attacked and didn't move in that same turn)\n[*] Area of Effect Special Skills. \n[*] Geo Crystals (Provides bonuses for certain colored squares)\n[*] Replaying previous levels for Grinding\n[*] Team Attacks and Chain Attacks (different from Linked Attacks)\n[*] Upgrading items by going through the \"Item Dungeon\"\n[*] Senators (my least favorite mechanic) and bribing them\n[*] Capturing Enemies (throwing them into the base plate - capture them by successfully defending against the enemy.)\n[*] And more!\n[/olist]\n[/spoiler] \n(Don't worry, the spoilers show Disgaea's game mechanics over Fire Emblem.)\n\nIn Fire Emblem, you may think, [i]\"How can I defeat this enemy without endangering one of my units?\"[/i]\nIn Disgaea, you may think, [i]\"If this [spoiler]Geo Crystal[/spoiler] is here, then this will cause a chain reaction with this one and that one, etc.\"[/i]\n\nWhat really sets them both apart is the [b][u]Grind[/u][/b]. In Fire Emblem, you may reach the point where Experience is scarce, and you're at the point where you're \"benching\" certain units (I believe this means not including them in your battle party) in order to feed Experience to stronger units. In Disgaea, you grind all your units to your heart's content. For me, I got very tired of replaying levels over and over for the Grind. However, it exists for people who live for that experience.\n\nDue to this, strategy is necessary if you don't grind. The only times I seriously considered my strategy was in the first chapter and the final chapter. \n\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\nMost levels are designed well and allow for nice gameplay. However, there are a few \"vexing\" levels in some chapters that I genuinely found annoying and frustrating. \nMost of these vexing levels make it so enemies are impossible to kill without destroying the [spoiler]Geo Crystal[/spoiler] that provides the boost. By the way, these [spoiler]Geo Crystals[/spoiler] are at the opposite end of the map. It'll take you around 8 turns to get there - meanwhile you will be attacked by enemies with long-range capabilities.\nOtherwise, most maps are well suited for the chapter and allow for great gameplay or tactical advantage.\n\n[h1]Story (Be careful about your mouse pointer!)[/h1]\nI really enjoyed the story as I played through the game. The story is generated in a fantasy world, starring the [spoiler]Netherworld[/spoiler], [spoiler]Celestia[/spoiler], and oddly enough, [spoiler]Earth[/spoiler]. The game begins with a [spoiler]young prince (Laharl) seeking to become Overlord after learning about his father's death[/spoiler]. Early on, [spoiler]Laharl is evil, and attempts to become Overload through Physical force[/spoiler]. With the introduction of [spoiler]the other main character, Flonne, Laharl gradually learns to \"love\". In the game's context, \"love\" can be likened to \"Compassion\"[/spoiler]. \nThe conflict is [spoiler]the stereotype that Demons are Evil and are incapable of showing \"love\". Flonne, in her adventure to the netherworld, seeks to prove the stereotype wrong, and finds out that Demons (most notably, Laharl) [i]are[/i] capable of showing \"love\".[/spoiler]\n\nBecause the Good Ending is believed to be Canon, I strongly suggest getting this ending. On my play-through, I had gotten the Normal Ending, which I found to be the saddest one. \nTo achieve the Good Ending (a how-to; contains no story spoilers): [spoiler]Finish the game without killing any ally. Be careful, especially with special skills. The Normal Ending is achieved with 1 Ally Kill or more.[/spoiler]\n\nIn short, I enjoyed the story of the game. I enjoyed the main character's character development, and all the characters that helped him develop.\nWho's my favorite character, you ask? My favorite character in the entire game is [spoiler]Gordon, the Defender of Earth[/spoiler]. Why? Although he may be your stereotype comic book hero, his unwavering ego, pride, and sense of justice is what sets him apart. He is absolutely hilarious when other characters damage his ego. He may have been a comic relief character, but his introduction certainly caught my attention, and subsequent chapters have been more enjoyable with his presence.\n\n\n[h1]Strengths[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Character creation - Make as many party members as needed.\n[*] Lifting & Throwing - Allows for easier mobility and new strategies. \n[*] Basic Stats System - RPG fans will understand what each stat does quickly.\n[*] Strong Story - Game revolves around the character development of the main character.\n[*] Fantasy World - Game's setting introduces stereotypes and beliefs we hold in our culture.\n[*] Multiple Endings - Several endings. The \"Good\" Ending is considered Canon.\n[*] Character Development - Noticeable change in main character's personality throughout the story. \n[*] Long Game - Main Story can take around 50 hours to complete, based on how much you are grinding.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Weaknesses[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] \"Love\" [spoiler]isn't Love - hoped for courting with Laharl and Flonne due to strong emphasis on \"love\". Although the game suggests mutual feelings, it never happened[/spoiler].\n[*] Grinding -  [u]Excessive[/u] grinding is necessary in post-game, according to guides. \n[*] Status Effect Information - The game doesn't tell you what each Status Effect does.\n[*] Skill Base - The game doesn't tell you whether a character's skill uses your INT, ATK, or HIT stat.\n[*] Vexing Levels - Some levels will be straight up frustrating.\n[*] Senators. \n[*] No auto-saving - save manually.\n[/list]\n\nThank you for reading my review!

Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.[/quote]\n\n  [h1]Disgaea is the first part of a rather interesting series, but for some reason it did not become popular in the CIS countries and I only heard about it recently.  Therefore, the review won't be nostalgic.[/h1]  \n \n  [b]Let's start with what I liked about the game:[/b]  \n\n\u2800\u2022 Humor.  there is a lot of him here and he is fun.\n \n\u2800\u2022 The plot.  Although partially trite in that it tells how the overlord's son climbs the throne and destroys anyone who wants to harm him and his world, there are many twists and turns that will make you wonder.\n      \n\u2800\u2022 Mechanics.  This is perhaps the largest and most interesting part of the game. In the tutorial, you are taught the most minimal basics and casually say that there are many hidden mechanics, but which you need to figure out for yourself, of which there are a lot.  If you think a little, then almost everyone can think of most of them.  In short, a very interesting part.\n     \n\u2800\u2022 Characters.  All key characters are worked out with a bang and almost all have their own principles and motives. \n   \n  [b]Now to what I didn't like:[/b] \n\n\u2800\u2022 No auto save.  Constantly after each battle you need to manually save. \n\n\u2800\u2022 The set depends on the randomness.  To get exactly what you want, you have to take the time.  For example the Senate vote. \n \n\u2800\u2022 Grind.  He may seem cruel to someone here, but it was not difficult for me to play an extra 20 hours to try different mechanics and improve the character. \n\n\n [i]Generally speaking, the game is noteworthy with the proviso that it is not difficult for you to sit an extra hour in the game for the sake of grinding.  I do not regret wasting time and will definitely go through the subsequent parts.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1635494389, "timestamp_updated": 1637574167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

intelligence and stratagy but if your like me and you have both it will be a fun game. the story is really good and for the gameplay there is a lot of things you can do. you can level up really high and you can level up each item and each weapon. you don't need to be over level 100 to beat the game but you can level up way higher and make it so you can kill everything with one hit. \n\nthey also have a thing where you can keep skills from one class and move it to another but you start back to level one. you can get a magic user class to learn the most powerful ice wind and fire attacks that is what i did for two of them but there are a lot of classes and there is lots of ways to play the game which makes it even more fun. \n\ni rate this game a 10/10 and i think everyone should give it a

Go to a high end Item World, kill things with Demon, then kill the Geo-symbol with low level units to level them up. On the tenth level kill all but 1 mob, then kill all your chars but 1 and use up all your SP to level up your go to abilities, like hip-attack on Succubus(avoid extra level ups on mage skills once you can do decent panel spreads).

If you have played other games in the franchise, you probably have already picked a side of the fence and don't need my opinion.\n\nWhen compared to modern RPGs, the original Disgaea isn't going to hold up very well. A lot of the quality of life changes from later games in the series aren't there, making it feel like a bit of a grind. I think it probably would have benefited from including a fast-forward feature, which I think is critical to making old games feel a little more bearable.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong... there are old games out there that I would gladly suffer through their slow pace. However, Disgaea doesn't have a plot that's going to stick with you. The anti-hero gimmick starts out interesting, but the plot just doesn't bring anything to keep you going. Each chapter really only has a few plot points, and although there's not a ton of levels per chapter, you'll likely need to either replay levels or work your way through the item world in order to be strong enough to keep progressing. The grind is not as bad as I expected given the game's reputation, but still worse than I would prefer.\n\nThere are people out there that love this game, and I completely understand why. However, I would not recommend it to the majority of people.

So if you prefer something like Shadowrun: Dragonfall to something like X-COM based on the fact that the former has characters on your combat squad, while the latter simply has random combat units in your squad, then Disgaea might put you off as only a few characters in your group have individual personalities, and if you wish to rely solely on them without allies, more grinding will be required.\n\nIt's not an objectively bad game, and like I said, the people who like it don't really like it...they LOVE it.

Some can feel incredibly outdated like, for example, healers not getting xp from healing allies; and some feel like there's something missing, like throwing allies (you can only do it in a straight line).\n\n-Gameplay\nOnce you enter a level, you can deploy up to 10 units. Each unit has a set of attributes: abilities, elemental resistances, strong weapons and aptitude. Once you start the level you can first move your units in a square by square map, each unit moves a different amount of squares. When you finish your turn the enemy moves.\nOnce you finish a level you will have to heal your units, for that there's a healing spot in your base, and if a unit dies you will have to revive it. Every single heal and revive costs money, so managing your units is essential.\n\n}Abilites: special attacks. each unit has their own special abilites, some of them repeat between units and some are unique and cant be learned by other characters. Here comes a mechanic that is called \"Mentor/Pupil\". Lets say you create a character with Laharl (protagonist), the character that you create becomes your pupil, and if its close to Laharl, Laharl can use that characters abilities.\n}Elemental resistances: as it sounds, there's 3 elements, ice wind and fire\n}Strong weapons: there's 6 weapons and 1 for monster units, each non-monster unit can use one of those 6 weapons and each unit has a strong weapon that they can use.\n}Aptitude: how much a character benefits from certain stats, like HP for example.\n\n-Story\nDisgaea's story is quite good, it has both emotional and hilarious moments, and the game knows how to move between them. Most of the events/conversations the characters have are on the funny side, and because of this, when there's an emotional moment it can hit you hard sometimes. \nOnce you finish the story you can play \"Etna Mode\" where you play as Etna, a character from the main cast, in an alternative story. To unlock it you will have to input a code (I haven't played it so I don't have too much to say)\n\n>Pros\n-Good story\n-Alternative endings \n-Interesting and hilarious characters\n-Rewarding gameplay\n-Additional mode (Etna mode) that counts as an alternative story and can be as long as the main story\n\n>Cons\n-Healers don't get xp from healing\n-Some mechanics can feel outdated\n-There's no auto-save\n\n>Middle point (some people like some people dislike)\n-You might have to grind sometimes\n-When you create a character it starts at lvl 1\n-You can complete the game with only one character\n-Requirements for the endings can be a bit demanding\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1631729366, "timestamp_updated": 1631729366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791338741779327393", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99367038": {"recommendationid": "99367038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128505811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3840, "last_played": 1695357300}, "language": "english", "review": "I love numbers", "timestamp_created": 1631664235, "timestamp_updated": 1631664235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612258434295654297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99364182": {"recommendationid": "99364182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025285500", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2858, "last_played": 1632631244}, "language": "english", "review": "Tons of fun, and if it's on sale you really don't have reason to not pick it up. Disgaea is an RPG game that's not like the other RPGs, it's quirky. Turn based strategic tile combat is the core of the games gameplay, but I would describe the game as more of a turn based puzzle game rather than just an RPG. Every encounter is unique and challenging in it's own way, even the maps you are playing on are a big puzzle most the time, and your path to victory is always going to be a little different. \n\nThe writing is witty and funny, the characters are goofy and lovable, the art is stylish and cute, and the soundtrack just doesn't get old. I've put so much time in and still haven't finished, but honestly I've enjoyed every second even the grinding, though I don't feel it's grinding as most people would know it. \n\nAs mentioned above yes there is grinding in this game, but the game has a very clever way of making it challenging and engaging instead of just mashing A to win fights until your team is real strong. The grinding in this game mostly comes in the form of weapon/gear upgrades. Where in you go into the weapon you want to upgrade and fight through randomly generated dungeons, every floor cleared is a level for your weapon, and each floor provides unique challenges to overcome. I've found endless fun in challenging weapon dungeons that are above my level, and managing to crawl past the finish line. The best part is while you are working your way though the dungeons you get tons of levels for your characters AND more gear that will often be better than the gear you are currently trying to level. It's an ultimate roguelite experience in a game that came out before roguelites were super common (Maybe even before they were a thing, don't fact check me). I honestly could play the weapon upgrading portion of this game without ever touching the main story and still have an amazing time. \n\nMy only complaint about the game is that it is an older game, so yeah the graphics are a little blurry being blown up to this higher resolution, but that hasn't stopped me from playing it like crazy, and you can always play in a smaller window if it's getting on your nerves.", "timestamp_created": 1631659165, "timestamp_updated": 1631659165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99328171": {"recommendationid": "99328171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879522136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 793, "last_played": 1640839885}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta Etna <3", "timestamp_created": 1631605208, "timestamp_updated": 1631605208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99271973": {"recommendationid": "99271973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136182026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2105, "last_played": 1677456064}, "language": "english", "review": "dood", "timestamp_created": 1631509059, "timestamp_updated": 1631509059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643716275691986084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99201383": {"recommendationid": "99201383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043193811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2039, "last_played": 1680803956}, "language": "english", "review": "Fans of tactical RPGs like FF Tactics or maybe the old-school Mario RPG should really chance this one.

What followed was more than 2000 hours of gameplay of just Disgaea 1 on PSP. And that not including even more time in Disgaea 2 on PSP and Disgaea 3 on PS3. What can I say, it was a perfect marriage of a game and console, tactical RPGs work really well on handhold consoles. That said, while this game is great, I could never sit long enough in it on PC. \n\nFirstly, because of it is a really time consuming game. To get through the main story you'll need around 10-20 hours, more or less. It's not that long, especially if you know what you are doing (trust me - first time you play this game, you do not know what you are doing). But main story - that is just sraping the bottom of the endless well that is Disgaea 1. The REAL game begins after that... If you want to milk this game out of all of its content, be prepare to COMPLETLY reset your progress at least 2-3 times. And I'm not talking about reincarnations, oh no! I I'm talking about starting a completly new SAVE!\n\nSecondly, controls of all of the Nippon Ichi tactical jRPG (Disgaea, Phatom Brave, La Pucelle, Rapsody, etc.) are ment for the controller and NOT for mouse and keybord.

Ignoring the incoming price increase (why not just release the games at those prices in the first place then?), the PC version removed a lot of glitches from the PS2/PSP versions that made the grind less frustrating and it still plays about as slow as the old ones without many ways to help expedite the process. A lot of the in-game options to make the game run a little smoother/look a little nicer either don't seem to work on my PC or barely do a darn thing. Oh and it crashed on me for destroying one of the late game mid-boss enemies making me lose a bit of progress in my Prinny-Only run. the annoying port shenanigans aside, the gameplay being as slow as molasses and having bias towards one-two types of units being the only real usable ones (your character is more than likely garbage if they don't have a Sword, Bows are completely useless due to how stat scaling work with it, monsters are almost universally terrible save for Priere etc) and after playing the later games with even a little bit of the quality of life changes it makes it very difficult to recommend this version of Disgaea 1 over one of the later games. The only redeeming factor is that the humor is at the highest tier in the first Disgaea compared to the rest of the games but I'd attribute that to the original localization from ATLUS that is used in all versions of this game (PS2 one was localized by ATLUS and Nisa uses the original script for everything except Etna Mode which was not in the PS2 version.

[/h1]\n\nDisgaea is a turn-based JRPG/SRPG depending on how you define it, it also has visual novel elements for telling it's story. The narrative segments take place before starting a level & after. \n\nThis game has a unique cast that I found easy to get attached to, each having their own faults and reasons for what they do. If you have an easy time getting attached to characters, you'll most definitely find a cast member in this game you can get attached to (I myself, find it very hard to get attached to cast members, and I ended up getting emotionally attached to around half the cast in this game.). \n\nAlongside the cast, Disgaea 1 has some of the most memorable soundtracks I've listened to. Disgaea 1 does it's job very well with attaching personal meanings to these soundtracks, when you listen to some specific soundtracks you'll very well be reminded of specific characters or emotional moments in this game.\n\nTLDR: Turn based SRPG/JRPG with visual novel elements, memorable cast & soundtracks.\n\n[h1]What makes Disgaea so special?[/h1]\n\nDisgaea 1 has a level cap of 9,999, which is usually unheard off in video games. I've played games where the level cap is 70-100 then after that is a different type of levelling which has a large cap, but never has any impact on the character's stats. With Disgaea, each level up past 100 will still give you additional stats, there are actually post game bosses that are built to give you a tough time against lvl 9,999 characters. But with other games, I didn't really have any incentive to grind levels since at lvl 70-100 I can overpower everything. In this game, your stats can reach into the millions if you put in the effort. \n\nThis is what makes Disgaea so special to me, no other game has gone as crazy as Disgaea has with levelling and stat caps. Some Disgaea games have increased the stat caps:\n\nDisgaea 1: 20,000,000 max for each stat\nDisgaea 2: 40,000,000 max for each stat\nDisgaea 4: 99,999,999 max for each stat \n\nDisgaea 6 is going 10,000 steps further and increasing the level cap to 99,999,999 (99 million), while the stat cap is currently unknown to me. It has been confirmed you can deal over 10,000,000,000,000,000 (10 quintillion) damage!\n\nTLDR: Disgaea is special because of it's lvl 9,999 cap and 20,000,000 stat cap. Increased to 99,999,999 stat cap in further entires, alongside the lvl cap being increased to 99,999,999 in the upcoming Disgaea 6.\n\n[h1]How does the gameplay function in this game?[/h1]\n\nThe game itself as previously mentioned is turn based, you get to control up to 10 units on each level (You can make more units then this, but this is the maximum amount of units you're allowed to dispatch). Unit's are usually split up into 2 categories: \n\n* Story characters\n* Generic characters\n\nYou're only allowed 1 of each story character, as you've probably guessed. These characters are characters which have story significance, whether it be the main story or small optional side-stories. Sometimes story characters are instantly provided to you in other Disgaea games if you play the Complete variations of them since they're DLC. Same rules apply that you are only allowed 1 of these characters.  \n\nWith generic characters, you're allowed to create multiple of them. Each generic unit has their own class, most of these units have a specific purpose for being created (Example: You create a healer for the purpose of healing.). A couple of classes for example are: Healer, Mage, Warrior, Thief, Archer. These are self-explanatory for why you'd want to incorporate these classes into your team.... or don't, I managed to grind my levels up to 200-300 with Laharl (Main character) and blasted every unit that came at me through the story. \n\nAnother important thing in this game is equipment, you get 1 slot for weapons & 3 slots for accessories. You have the option to level these up in what I'd class as a mode called the item world, which to put it brief is a mode in which you go through randomly generated floors. Each time you clear a floor you add an additional level to your item, which in turns increases its overall stats. \n\nThere are features in this game that are based around levelling up, such as the reincarnation/transmigration system which puts you at lvl 1 but gives you an increase in stats. This is something you will most definitely have to do if you want to defeat the most powerful bosses in the game, you will have motive to always level up as you will always have that ultimate challenge boss to kill. \n\nLast thing I'll mention is something unique to this game called \"geo puzzles\", there are multiple color panels on the floor. When a geo block is placed on a specific coloured panel, all the panels on top of that geo block that has the same colour will have a unique effect applied to them. When a unit stands on these panels, that effect will be applied to them until they step off the panel. \n\nIt's stated what the geo block effect is while hovering over it (Some effect examples are: invincibility, warp, 3x enemy boost, 20% ally damage, 20% damage etc.). If you play your cards right with this mechanic, you can wipe out enemies that are way more powerful then you. You get a random combination of geo block & panels all the time in the item world.\n\nThere's plenty more to discover in Disgaea, I believe this has given you a rough enough idea of what the game entails. I encourage you to play this game yourself and learn the extent of how much you can break this game, 1 level at a time :b \n\nTLDR: Disgaea is a turn based game, there are plenty of units for you to create (Each with their own advantage and disadvantage), equipment is important in this game and can be levelled up, there's a mechanic in this game based around reaching high lvls then resetting at lvl 1 for an overall increase in your stats. There is an ultimate boss in this game that will require you to reach very high stats. This games unique mechanic, geo blocks can provide advantages/disadvantages to you or the enemy team.\n\nIf there's any questions you have regarding Disgaea 1, feel free to add me & DM me.

Decided to start from first game despite a lot of people saying some of the mechanics and what not aren't quite as user friendly as newer games in the series. I'm glad I did.

Still a good tactical JRPG with a lot of charme.\n\n[h1]What Is This \u201cThing\u201d?[/h1] \nI really like to play RPGs as they are relaxing, can tell great stories and have distinctive atmospheres that are not easily replicated. Yet Disgaea is a different breed of RPG that feels a lot more like it could be released nowadays.\nDisgaea is like a badly written fanfic in terms of themes: demons, angels, and superheroes are all existing and somewhat interacting with each other while still being bound by their respective tropes and some twists. This is unconventional by any means and extremely strange to see, even considering that modern anime and light novels really try to capture the same thing. Disgaea goes further though and has a \u201cheart\u201d behind it all. Normally this set pieces are doomed to fail, despite that I found the interactions entertaining and overused tropes charming as they are being played in a sincere way. \nTo sum it all up: Disgaea\u2019s design and story are wacky, but in the good kind of way.\n\n[h1]Tactical JRPG? Sounds Basic[/h1] \nThe gameplay of Disgaea is really simple, I want to remind you that the original game was released on the PS2 and even felt dated back then. Disgaea follows suit by giving you main characters and a lot of deep systems that you can either embrace or just ignore to fight through maps that always can be selected for grind. Disgaea is in terms of the actual gameplay stays exceedingly simple. \nAnd then you get to the systems behind the curtain of a simple tactical JRPG:\nItem World, specialists, affinity, classes, learning, jumping, throw chains, chain explosions, senate and the respective bill calculations\u2026 Yes, the demons have a senate that you can influence by increasing your demon rank in fighting exams to pass bills by abusing the corruption of senators by handing them wanted items. This is madness.\nWhile this sounds like too much, it is perfect. The main story of Disgaea is fun, but breaking the game is an equal part and has shaped the identity of the series for every later entry. By abusing these systems it is possible to reach extremely high numbers and near unlimited strength. \nBreaking the game, finding out what works and what doesn\u2019t, experimenting with the systems, this is just really enjoyable. Disgaea becomes a puzzle to be solved and every system is a variable for your curiosity. Otherwise the insane endgame that is around 100 times harder (this time not a hyperbole in any form) would be impossible.\nThis means that main campaign of like 20 hours is just the tip of the iceberg. The side content can easily make you clock in 200 hours and more (which is absolutely optional).\n\n[h1]Unimpressing Cover[/h1] \nThe presentation is absolutely minimalistic. While the sprites carry a lot of character, they are too pixelated. While the dialogue is good, the visual representation could be cardboard and nothing would change. Decent music, but overusing the same tracks.\nProduction values of any NIS game are always below average from what I could gather and it has become a distinctive style, a symbol of their brand. I get the idea and I would be lying that there is nothing to it. But it just does not do the trick for me.\n\n[h1]Aged Like Milk[/h1] \nSo where do I start?\nThe game is relatively fast, but fast forward would have been great. Having to wait just to see the movement animations of every character is terrible and boring. If you have to do something like clear 100 floors in a row (this is related to an item): The game becomes a slog.\nThe graphics are absolutely blown away by the Switch version which lazily swapped some sprites from newer games, but looks that a lot better in comparison. \nSkipping animations is included in the Switch and PS4 version and the ability to increase Exp gains more. The last one sounds like cheating, but to explain to you how grindy this game can be: \nI used a program to repeat inputs I, just to reach max level on characters. Still: reaching max level with it would take around 10 hours of just letting it run. Atrocious and just too much. Cutting that time to a third is absolutely right in this case as there are no meaningful inputs. \nTo make this paragraph short: Don\u2019t read the Switch and PS4 upgrades, they would just ruin your day. And stay away from the mobile version, it is even better.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1] \nDisgaea PC is and feels old, despite that I could enjoy the experience and time I spent with it. The main story is good, the endgame grind \u2026 is it\u2019s own thing which can be entertaining, if one wants to learn how to calculate optimal EXP gains depending on time and method (which I did).\nAt least play the main campaign, it isn't grindy and has a decent story.

Well I actually first heard about Disgaea Hour of Darkness in a gaming magazine back in 2003. The article was titled \"The Best RPG you've never heard of.\" As a huge Final Fantasy Tactics fan I had to check it out. I immediately fell in love. Started skipping school to play it in my closet. I moved my TV and PS2 into my walk in closet and my parents were none the wiser. I even laughed reading \"You know you've played too much Disgaea when...\" \n\nSo here's the deal. It's the same game I played 17 years ago. Normally that's a good thing. But not in this case it's a terrible thing. So many QoL improvements that have come in sequels is completely missing. Hell it's missing all the QoL from Disgaea 1 Complete. Sure it is a fraction of the cost, with 3x the grind necessary. I guess when I was 16 hundreds of hours on a game was amazing. So much bang for my buck. Now I am dad and work 40+ hours a week. It's much harder to sink that much time in as often. About 20 hours in I cashed in my Google Play Rewards and bought Disgaea 1 Complete for Android. What took me 71 hours only took me 19 on Disgaea 1 Complete. \n\nThings that are missing from the game.\nUpdated sprites and maps\nCHEAT SHOP\nStrongest Enemies Bill\nWeakest Enemies Bill\n\"Etna Mode is unlocked by default on the title screen, without the need for codes to be entered.\nFully touch based controls, similar to Disgaea DS. (MEH)\nAuto Battle, which allows you to select any number of characters who automatically deploy on the following level. (HELPS WITH THE GRIND)\nRepeat Battle, which allows the game to automatically restart playing a previously completed story level.\nA new speed option, from x1 to x8 speed, for stages. (AMAZING!)\nA quick menu for the hub area, unlocked by completing the first chapter of Story Mode or Etna Mode.\nYou are able to make a single cloud save, which can be recalled on any other device.\nCheat Shop is now available in the Dark Assembly allowing the player to modify multiple attributes of the game, such as EXP gain, enemy level, Item World stages and more.\"\n\nSo while I still love Disgaea, it is hard to recommend this version of the game.

I'll talk about this game both in terms of the main story and the post game.\n\nAs far as the main story goes, this is quite a challenging little game. You are encouraged to form your own diverse team and come up with their roles based on their strengths weaknesses and weapon proficiencies. You find yourself forming strategies with units throwing other units, disabling hazards for the team or barricading more vurnerable but powerful units. You can pass the game with little knowledge and even using exclusively main characters rather than created ones, it is all up to you. In addition to this you can even boost your equipment by entering them and playing through them as randomly generated dungeons, which is a fun feature. The characters are charmingly obnoxious and a good amount of the music is enjoyable. It doesn't take particularly long to beat the main story, but it is certainly a challenge the first time through. You may even need to grind a bit or you may simply feel the need to improve your team.\n\nOf course if you develop a taste for grinding and improving your team, you're gonna end up in the post game with the rest of us degenerates! Seriously though, it isn't a mandatory part of the experience, but it can be very satisfying. The main issue with it is that it is far from accessible unless you are prepared. Almost none of the absolutely critical post game grind is explained in the game. This is also where some of the strategy elements taper off. You find yourself spamming the most powerful moves with high coverage over and over. People say that it becomes a meta strategy thing where the goal is to identify the quickest ways to level and exploit the system to gain ultimate power in record time! Which is complete nonsense because 0.0% of the people who play the post game did it without using guides. It's a minefield of what you *must* do and *must not* do that keeps you from achieving powerful characters in any reasonable amount of time. You could very easily waste hundreds of hours of time doing your own thing when an alternate strategy is five times more effective in half the time. So if you choose to walk this path, read the levelling guides, get armsmasters, get statisticians, never have more than ten active members, always upgrade your weapons and don't use majins because thats cheating! \n\nSo basically if you want a solid SRPG for a little bit, you're good.

I'd start with this game though, it's absolutely playable and I enjoyed my time, with only some quality of life grievances. For example, you have to mentor generics (ie fighter, archer, etc) to give certain characters even usable skills, especially to give Flonne even basic combat spells to use because healing doesn't level you up in this game unlike later entries. Btw I heavily suggest you give all the characters you use heavily at least level 2 healing for end game.\n\nThere are a few difficulty spikes that will really take you into a back alley and kick your ass , requiring some focused grinding (remember that if you throw an opponent onto another opponent, they combine and their levels are added to each other, great for grinding if you don't make them too powerful).\n\nOverall charming characters, cool story that has a few emotional points (feels like a classic jrpg narratively, and not an anime), honestly some of the cooler tactics style games in the industry (a genre that is under-represented nowadays), and just worth playing if you like tactics, anime, jrpg, fantasy, or watching damage and health numbers go up in humongous ways.", "timestamp_created": 1605926089, "timestamp_updated": 1605926089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79582110": {"recommendationid": "79582110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182806678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 12040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1610729841}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny story\nFunny OST\nOK controls, mouse enabled but.. sometimes map layout wont let you pick your characters.\n\nGOOD CLASSIC OLDIE! :D", "timestamp_created": 1605923275, "timestamp_updated": 1605923275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79578087": {"recommendationid": "79578087", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094280304", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1808, "last_played": 1640145692}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is a certified hood classic the worst grinding i've ever fucking ddealt with", "timestamp_created": 1605915495, "timestamp_updated": 1605915495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79554609": {"recommendationid": "79554609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868065701", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4681, "last_played": 1689132807}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si te dedicas a sacar todo, puede que consuma mucho tiempo de tu vida el juego,  como consejo: investiga todo lo que necesites, y la asamblea oscura es tu mejor aliado para sacar todo el progreso\nPD: si no tienes paciencia para jugar, creo que a lo mejor buscas un juego distinto", "timestamp_created": 1605880665, "timestamp_updated": 1631971189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79534773": {"recommendationid": "79534773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111550393", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 9414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7842, "last_played": 1606294193}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the same good old Disgaea we all know and love.

This is a PC port of the PS2 port, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness. As far as I can tell, aside from the text, the only noticeable graphical improvements between this and previous ports are character artwork for dialogue/icons, and of course a solid chunk (but not all) text is rendered through system fonts.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. Complete is literally a port of this port, and even when it goes on sale it's quite a bit more expensive ($25 on Switch at the time of this writing, and that's literally them trying to get ppl into the series after the D6 reveal). the Pretty Prinny mod is a MUST with this (still unfinished, v0.5 at the time of this writing, but all the important stuff is done) but aside from that, only reason to take the steep price difference is if you plan on playing the Switch port on the go, or if you just REALLY dont find the charm in the original sprites (Pretty Prinny allows you to disable the sprite filtering like in the D2 PC port)\n\nDespite the people complaining about this not being Complete, aside from graphics, it's basically the same. As the first game in the series, it can be kinda rough coming back to this when you're more familiar with the smoother experiences (faster turns, smoother menuing, not risking coming into an unfinishable floor in Item World after hours of grinding, etc) of later games, but again, none of these things are present in Complete either. it's JUST a graphical update. If you've lost your original PS2/PSP version of the game and want to re-experience the best story in the series (or want to catch yourself up before playing DD2, D5 or the upcoming D6) and if you're okay with the drawbacks, $15 aint a bad price, because AGAIN, Complete isn't the overhaul you think it is. And if you're nervous, you can always just watch the cutscenes on YouTube or watch the anime. :3 (and if after all this updated sprites are really THAT big a deal to you, someone's working on a mod for that too)", "timestamp_created": 1601492288, "timestamp_updated": 1601492375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76414179801940918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76818883": {"recommendationid": "76818883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850303047", "num_games_owned": 810, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 20105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7853, "last_played": 1693776427}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5\n\nThe game is great in every aspect, port has some minor flaws though", "timestamp_created": 1601482799, "timestamp_updated": 1633459664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76794957": {"recommendationid": "76794957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029763703", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5113, "last_played": 1660334870}, "language": "english", "review": "Gotta love the grind.", "timestamp_created": 1601438402, "timestamp_updated": 1601438402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76740471": {"recommendationid": "76740471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312578138", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1687671854}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me estoy viciando con este juego ademas el estilo de dibujo y la musica esta bien genial xd", "timestamp_created": 1601342357, "timestamp_updated": 1601342357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76686393": {"recommendationid": "76686393", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086588165", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 258, "playtime_forever": 2622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2621, "last_played": 1605852905}, "language": "english", "review": "I would absolutely recommend this game.\n\nCons:\nControls are ackward at times\nCamera can be really bothersome\nF*** geo effects (especially during item world)\nThank God i'm THAT good at strategy RPGs, could have spent hundreds to thousands of hours to fully finish it...

Choose where to move, ready your attacks, and execute.\nRegardless, you'll need to think every move through, as you have to consider enemy placements for skills, team attacks, and Geographical buffs and debuffs as you fight your way through the 40-hour-on-average main story.\nThere are parts in the game where you'll hit a brick wall, and the one small flaw of this game peeks through.\nThis game is a grind. And you will be grinding a LOT. For players who are used to this, this is just another enjoyable aspect of the game, but for those who thought they could breeze through the game for the story, you're in for a rude awakening.\nYou'll play the first few stages of each chapter with relative ease, and then come to a surprising halt as they ramp up the difficulty for the boss stage.\nHowever, the gameplay and depth are still so enjoyable, I never found myself remiss of the grinding.\nWith options such as Item World, Dark Assembly, and being able to replay any stage you've unlocked so far, you'll find your favorite way of grinding relatively easily and you can get lost in these, not even realizing you've already grinded your way up 5 to 10 levels.\n\nIn summary, Disgaea won \"Best RPG No One Played\" in 2002 when it debuted, and now it's a mainstay series that any hardcore RPG fan would gush about.\nIf you're new to the series, this is a great jumping off point, as these characters also show up in almost every future Disgaea game, and you'll happily be recruiting them for many years to come.\nI'm glad they turned this Hour of Darkness, into Years of Darkness, and I'll see you in the Netherworld.", "timestamp_created": 1600713498, "timestamp_updated": 1600713498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51530611515045166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76324412": {"recommendationid": "76324412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028846980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 6141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 686, "last_played": 1652138869}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't play this game that much but I can say for sure I love it more and more and I will want to play all Disgaea games. \nI had no problems with the game. \nI played with a PS4 controller connected to the PC. \nI played with the keyboard. \nI played with Mouse. \nEverything worked without problems. \nThe game has a lot of stuff that you need to learn.

Environments have less detail and tiles don't mesh as well as the original style. Luckily you can switch to the original graphics in the options, I'd recommend doing so. Also Dark Assembly is garbage, but not too big of a deal. lastly, the game has some slowdown during some of the flashy special moves.\n\nThe game is pretty long and grindy, a little too grindy for me.

I really enjoyed the overall aesthetic of the game, as well as the gameplay mechanics and things itself, it was an old game, but somehow so unique and fresh in concepts. It combined a make your own party adventure along with a set cast for an enjoyable story and remarkable game experience. Needless to say after falling in love with that, I looked into more of the franchise, and saw that there were handful of games on steam, and as you'd expect, Disgaea, much like Makai Kingdom, did not fail me on any of those wistful notes of passion.\n\nThe game in and of itself is a fever dream of an experience, from outrageous anime antics, to memorable characters with funny stories, to just the insane numbers crunching that these games pull out of you if you go for the fabled 100% completion. With lots of tie ins from other games made by the developers, to fun character classes you discover and build up, or just the absolute insanity of trying to get some of the achievements, there is clearly a lot of passion this game had in it's creation. Not to mention passion from the community, as there are plenty of guides and walkthroughs on this game that boil everything down to the last detail to help you get to the grand conclusion. It is nothing short of crazy, just how deep the love goes for this series, and it makes me very excited to move forward in the series since my completion of this game was literally minutes ago.\n\nThat being said, while a fantastic experience, the game does have some flaws (for me), that definitely made me happier to be done sooner than later. The main story of the game can be blown through fairly easily, without too much grinding and what not, but if you really want to go for the big gold sticker of achievements, and don't know much about the series, just know it's gonna be a looooong road. Now while not completely a flaw in it's own right, it is obviously very much a tedious thing that is not going to be for everyone, and even for myself who really enjoys grinding in games (if it had a clear payoff, which this game does for sure), there are limits even to what I can absorb. The game is also quite old, with a lot of slow hud and directioning, even once you have it down, that adds a bit to the time frame of the game and can slowly drain your brain. I had to take a few breaks on the cleanup of this game, because as much as I enjoyed, it started to get real slow and I just couldn't take it without a little bit of a cool off. Especially when it came to item world grinds, as much as I enjoyed items and all those systems, if I have to see the item world ever again it'll be too soon, oh and passing bills in the assembly, that too was very draining. Map repeating could be faster as well, but still not the worst!\n\nAll and all, even with the slowness and super long attention span you have to have to complete a game like this, the payoff is fairly good. It's fun to go from a few numbers to being able to destroy everything with the press of a button. The mechanics are fun, the story is cute, and the characters and designs of everything are really a treat. The polish of the game is definitely exemplary, from music, to even the animations, and especially the art. The art of Disgaea is iconic, and probably what most people would identify it by, even with my few games experience, when I see this art I know where it's coming from. Needless to say, I had a blast and I definitely recommend this game to other people that enjoy building up your band of crazy demons as you blast through the madness that is the Disgaea universe.\n\nFinal Score: 8.5 Prinny Bombs / 10 Prinny Doods.\n\nThis seal of approval is endorsed by Prince Laharl, son of King Krichevskoy, Overlord of the Netherworld.", "timestamp_created": 1599576244, "timestamp_updated": 1599576625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557195544242858887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75598482": {"recommendationid": "75598482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069785586", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3009, "last_played": 1600825270}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good:\n- Great game play and story. \n- Lots of gameplay value: long story, grinding, many bonus levels, different leveling up processes, item world (procedurally generated maps) and story replayability.\n- Gameplay has so many different strategies, some mechanics are not even taught in the tutorial (ex: throw enemy in base to attempt capture, item stealing, stack-lifting chatacters to move larger distances, etc.)\n- Nostalgia is a big bonus. \n- Graphics are dated but have a charm, make sure you use the PRETTY PRINNY mod to get rid of graphical bugs.\n- Voice acting and music are pretty great, especially Caption Gordon.\n\nWhat could be improved: \n- If sprites remained in pixel-art style, but resolution increased slightly. \n- Pretty Prinny Mod should be released officially with the game.\n\nScore: 8.8 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1599489219, "timestamp_updated": 1599489219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532525837421417236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75572841": {"recommendationid": "75572841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072338927", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 15586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2178, "last_played": 1603037255}, "language": "english", "review": "nin nin nin", "timestamp_created": 1599442320, "timestamp_updated": 1599442320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482663542032241821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75512279": {"recommendationid": "75512279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360385074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1503, "last_played": 1599351336}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games on PS2.

The Disgaea 1 Complete has released on all systems except PC and it has HD textures for characters and maps making it much more enjoyable. There are also things like the cheat shop and fast forward. I just got it on my phone and while it is a pain in the butt to play on the phone due to poor controls it is still way better than this version. It was a very fun game though and its still worth a play if you have never played a Disgaea game before. There are so many quality of life improvements on the newer games you will not miss if you have never played a Disgaea game before. I am trying to go back to this game after Disgaea 5 and its just way to slow paced and clunky compared to that game. If I had the complete version I would probably spend a few hundred hours on it but for now I will stick to Disgaea 5 and maybe Disgaea 4 when it releases.\n\nThe story has that anime weirdness that some people seem to enjoy. I usually don't play it for the story though because the game play is super fun. There are thousands of different ways to play the game. You can go through it with nobody except Laharl Or you can make a badass team consisting of generics. The game does not force you to use your main character so you can pretty much play it any way you like. The main reason I like it is Characters can level to 9,999 but the strength doesn't stop there because you can keep boosting stats through reincarnation and gear. Every item levels up including that one piece of useless gum that you use to restore 10hp. If you wanted to you could level that thing up to restore 10,000hp but someone who does that is most likely a masochist. The main reason you level up items is for stuff like weapons and armor which can boost stats. There is practically endless content in this game even after the main story ends. You can go into the item world and just kill enemies in random maps for eternity or you can reset the story and go through it all again at a higher level with higher level enemies.\n\nDisgaea 1 is probably my favorite out of the 5 simply because of the unlock system. It feels like you are making progress in this game when you unlock something. The newer games usually have some easy and simple way to unlock new classes but Disgaea 1 made you work for it. For example if you want a star mage you have to level up each of the 3 elemental mages to either 5 or 10 idr. If you want to recruit a dragon you either have to collect an insane amount of mana or go kill a dragon over and over again and eventually the mana cost will practically disappear. Your skills in this version of the game level up automatically and in newer games you just spend mana to make them better. Early on this makes thing like mages terrible in newer games because the mana cost is so high it takes forever to level up that skill but on Disgaea 1 you usually end up having a spell like fire able to hit 6 enemies or so when you are level 30. In Disgaea 5 at level 30 I don't even use the regular fire spell anymore and my mega fire can still only hit 3 people at a time because it just costs too much mana to level it up. \n\nAnyways, if you have never played a Disgaea game before I highly recommend this version. If you have played a Disgaea game before I suggest playing Disgaea 5 or getting Disgaea 1 complete on a different system because it is way better in terms of quality of life. Disgaea 5 PC is also optimized for PC and you can plug in a PS4 controller without needing any drivers or 3rd party software and all the buttons match the menus.

That was my aim here, and I can say I really enjoyed this game. It eases you into the game mechanics, the world, and the characters very nicely and by the end you really care about their struggles. This game gives you all the tools you'll need to get through the story, and it's up to you to use them strategically to win the day. It throws a lot of bullcrap your way at times, with some of the later levels, but when you win, you know it's cause YOU won that battle. You made the right units, you used the right attacks, you used the terrain to your advantage, you grinded those levels you needed, and you got TACTICAL. \n\nAnd there's a lot to master here. There's some core gameplay mechanics the game won't explain well, so feel free to open up a few Gamefaqs guides if you're wondering exactly how something works. Once you master diagonal throwing, move cancelling, team attacks, pupil/mentor skill trading, item world leveling, and geopanel shenanigans, you'll be making some real galaxy-brain plays. \n\nAnd yes, there's technically a lot of content here, easily 200+ hours with all the post game stuff, but personally I was done when I beat the story. One major gripe I did have with the game is that healers don't gain EXP when healing. This was apparently fixed in the \"Disgaea 1 Complete\" releases on other platforms, but those changed other stuff like the character sprite work, which I prefer here. Other than that, decent game for tactics fans.

One of the quintessential SRPGs! The fact that this game has been ported to so many platforms after its original PS2 release (by my count, it's available on PS3, PS4, NDS, NS and PC) should be more than sufficient evidence that it's a game well-worth your time.\n\nThat said, there are caveats. While the story remains as engaging and amusing as it ever was (especially thanks to the extra optional content and alternate endings) the fundamental mechanics of play have not exactly aged well. Over the years, the Disgaea series has introduced numerous quality-of-life improvements and additions. This process occurred so slowly and subtly that if you were playing the games as they released, you might not even notice the differences. But comparing the first Disgaea game here to the most recent, Disgaea 5, its readily apparent that things have changed immensely.\n\nThe core problem, simply, is that relative to its successors, Disgaea is a bit clumsy and limiting. You have fewer options in combat, and must endure much more inventory management. Also, perhaps most damningly, there are fewer options to circumvent the standard grind. One of the more interesting elements of the Disgaea series as it stands today is the \"gaming\" of the level system. With a level cap of 9999, playing normally most players will likely die of,old age before getting close. Thus most games incorporate a number of different tactics and tricks to make leveling easy. If you know what you're doing in a modern Disgaea game, you can gain several hundred levels in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately this aspect of the series does not manifest as strongly in the first two games, so grinding to the appropriate levels for postgame content can be prohibitively tedious.\n\nEven so, Disgaea remains a classic for good reason. The characters and humor alone justify playing through the game at least once, while mechanically its a far cry from its successors, the SRPG genre itself is so stubbornly resistant to change that I doubt many genre fans will take issue. So think of these criticisms simply as forewarning to those unacquainted with the genre.\n\nAnd for the faithful, Disgaea PC incorporates all of the additional \"extra\" content from the handheld ports, making it the definitive version of,the game. I've heard that's there's also a mod that replaces the sprites with HD versions, spthough i haven't tried it myself, so there's little reason to play the more expensive (and, among fans, divisive) \"remastered\" version instead.\n\nNote: also played on Sony Playstation 2 and Sony Playstation Portable.", "timestamp_created": 1594597228, "timestamp_updated": 1594597235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797786116600036621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72584354": {"recommendationid": "72584354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082399309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5104, "last_played": 1626308669}, "language": "english", "review": "The voice acting and the story is great. \nThis also has an anime called Makai Senki Disgaea. \nThe world of Nippon Ichi for Disgaea goes through many other games and as such you get multiple cameos from other games and many references to real world stuff. \nVery good mix of seriousness and humor.\n\nTime to move into Disgaea 2 and 5 the only ones I have not finished.", "timestamp_created": 1594586329, "timestamp_updated": 1594586329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72573434": {"recommendationid": "72573434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015753790", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1469898232}, "language": "english", "review": "Not anime fan, buuttt...

It's all about raising numbers and it rarely has been so satisfying to do that. You can put countless hours into upgrading your weapons and armor, you can enchant them with the abilities and boosts you want and there's a ton more of optional or hidden content. Not all of it works flawless and sometimes it can be frustrating, for one reason or the other.\n\n1. [b][u]Story mode:[/u][/b] Fully linear, no choices. The different endings depend on easily to miss and hidden requirements like killing certain characters on a map/battle or losing to them. They also depend on whether or not you had friendly kills.\n2. [b][u]Grind mode:[/u][/b] The main way to improve your items is the Item World. A randomly generated world where you get bonus stats on your Item for each cleared floor. But the generator fails at times and puts enemies on spots you can't reach. Fortunatelly the exit to the next floor is always accessable, so you will just have to accept not clearing some levels from time to time and missing bonus stats as well as the rewards for clearing the floor (Exp, money or items).\n3. [b][u]Dark assembly and shops:[/u][/b] The next huge chapter where you can spend much time and money. In order to improve the selection and quality of the shop items you can buy, you will have to deal with the dark assembly. There you can raise your influence, unlock new options and bribe senators to be able to apply said options. But all the bribing is pretty pointless because the game just keeps introducing more and stronger senators. You can - in theory - also fight them to force a decision. But with some of the senators being over 100 levels stronger than your characters, that's... not something that is going to happen anytime soon.\n4. [b][u]Combat system:[/u][/b] Disgaea features the by far most advanced enemy AI I've ever experienced. Enemies will always try to get the best position and do the most damage. They will unleash skills in the most efficient way and aim for your vulnerable characters whenever possible.\nThe maps can be hard and often require planning ahead. Where are the main targets and goals? Which is the best way to get there and how many turns does it take? Do you need a stack of 3 or 4 characters to increase their reach? Miscalculations pay dearly, for they'll leave you open to attacks.\n5. [b][u]Leveling up characters:[/u][/b] At first and for some time it will take much effort and time to level up new characters, because they are so weak, you lack the equipment to change that and they need to land the killing blow to gain experience. Which is especially painful for healers. The best course of action is to ignore character creation until you got a hang of the basics and some decent stuff together. With the proper gear equipped, leveling up characters goes a lot smoother.\n6. [b][u]Play time/Replay value:[/u][/b] The story has a decent length, but 90% of the ~160 hours I spent on my first playthrough was grinding levels and gear. Once you have finished the game you get the option to save and start a new \"cycle\", which means that you can keep all characters, levels and gear. Of course you can always just skip it and start anew from scratch, if that's your thing. But I'm grateful for being able to go through the game at a much faster pace this time, for I doubt I'd be willing to put that much time and effort into Disgaea again, just to see the other endings.\n\nBut with things as they are, I look forward to see what more the game has to offer. Especially now that I figured many things that could have made my life a lot easier if I had known earlier. Like throwing senators or that the Dark Cannon has an autofire option if you just keep the button pressed. You don't have to mash it like crazy to fire. And it only took me 150 hours to realize that.

But at the end of the day, this is a mediocre version of a game, which fails to communicate and capitalize on its mechanics. [/b]\n\nI got into the series with Disgaea 4 on PS3, casually playing it for about 40 hours. I never beat it, but had a great time nonetheless. I never ran into most of the issues I have with Disgaea PC, at least to the same extent, and feel that 4 was a more forgiving and balanced game.\n\n\nI had heard great things about the original Disgaea and I assumed it was the simplest, most straightforward game in the series. It starts off as a fun yet complex SRPG, but eventually can devolve into madness, due to a lack of explanations and quality of life features. Played like a normal RPG Disgaea can be enjoyed for a good while, but eventually you will hit a wall and instead of coming up with a better approach or getting more skilled, you must grind, a lot. There is simply no other option to progress in the game besides grinding. The catch comes from finding how to grind most efficiently. Disgaea has very meta game design, which is awesome, but it is never really explained, and this ends up being the fatal weakness.\n\nRight off the bat the game is more or less lying by omission. I thought I understood the game. I\u2019d talked to the informational NPCs and even skimmed through a beginners guide here on Steam. However, I was unaware of the near mandatory nature of Statisticians when grinding, thus 40+ hours into the game I realized that I was playing it \u201cwrong\u201d and had wasted my time. I had also frequently used a Prinny, which despite being a character the game starts you with, becomes basically unusable as you progress. From that point on I decided to use Cheat Engine in hopes of rebalancing my playthrough. I typically avoid cheating in skill based games, unless I\u2019ve already beat them, but Disgaea is not exactly a skill based game. Disgaea is a skinner box game with exponentially growing requirements. Which probably sounds awful, but if you play correctly, using the meta mechanics to fight back and make the game work in your favor, the Disgaea formula can be one of the most strategic and rewarding in all video games. Played incorrectly... you will hit a breaking point and either have to stop or cheat.\n\nThe lack of information and quality of life features is present throughout most of the series, but this first one is especially bad. Plus the item world, starting roster, character creation, healing, etc. are all broken in some way.  \n\n\nGameplay aside, the goofy depiction of the netherworld was always fun! The visual design and music turn dark and grim clich\u00e9s on their heads, creating a memorable and unique aesthetic. The three main characters all range from great to annoying at times. They clash constantly which leads to some entertaining moments and a good joke every now and then, but they can also feel like hyper anime archetypes sometimes. As for the story, it starts off good with an equally goofy and compelling premise, but as it goes there are some poorly executed twists, melodrama, and bad pacing which really brings it down in the second half.  Surprisingly there are multiple endings too, but they are implemented so strangely that nobody would ever know what determines an ending, even after getting one.\n\nAt one point in the game there is a cut-scene where the main cast of characters do a team attack to break an \u201cinvincible\u201d barrier. I don't understand why the player could not have been in control during this sequence, it would have made for an awesome level. This was the moment I realized just how much missed potential was in Disgaea. And this missed potential is found in every facet of the game. If they would have made performing team attacks between the characters with opposing views, like Laharal and Flonne, integral to leveling up, or at least stronger than spamming special attacks, they could have delivered a more contextualized experience and added another layer of strategy. This also affects the level design, which is very underwhelming considering the potential all the mechanics allow for.\n\n\nI would not recommend Disgaea PC, however I would cautiously recommend the series as a whole. If you really want to get into the Disgaea games, do some research on the deeper mechanics and choose one of the newer games.", "timestamp_created": 1592151388, "timestamp_updated": 1655070947, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509490072727203369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70747238": {"recommendationid": "70747238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138854922", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2377, "last_played": 1548394559}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has aged poorly in terms of visual style, voice acting, comedy, and gameplay.

But let's examine it in order...[/i]\n\n[h1][b]PROs[/b][/h1]\n\n- [b]Addicting gameplay[/b]. It may be monotonous for some, but if you happen to like it, it will keep you glued to your screen: there aren't half measures, you either love it or hate it. \n\n- [b]The strategy factor is very simplistic[/b], almost non-existent, yet despite this the game still manages to be a blast to play. That of course is yet another strength point which can be a weakness depending on the player.\n\n- [b]Original mechanics[/b]. For example, there's a council where you can pass new laws which will benefit your team... However, corruption is a daily occurrence in the Netherworld, and some of those nasty demon politics will approve the stuff you propose them only if you manage to give them what they want; again, this is just an example: the game is filled with interesting features.\n\n- [b]Lots of replayability[/b] due to the fact that there's a good amount of dungeons and challenges, but mostly because there's lots of grinding. If you like this aspect of the game, you'll find bread for your teeth. If not, stay miles away.\n\n[h1][b]CONs[/b][/h1]\n\n- [b]Debatable plot[/b]. The premise of the story could be interesting, and it might work even if it's demential... The issue is that it's way too silly, at the point of becoming cringeworthy. Also, it's predictable, and filled to the brim with cliches and stereotyped characters; but you know... These kind of games are often like that, and who the hell plays Disgaea for the plot anyway.\n\n- [b]Lazy overall design[/b]. The world you play in is actually very immersive, my grudge would be in how repetitive it is. Usually, the dungeons aren't that inspiring (fire caves, ice caves, forests, that kind of stuff), and they're massively recycled too... Like, ad nauseam. And you must replay them a lot or else you won't be able to fight lots of damage sponges. This is also true regarding the enemies: often they're just palette swaps. But anyway, I guess I'm used to this kind of stuff, especially in JRPGs. I saw way worse [*points at Compile Heart*]\n\n-[b]Some skills break the game[/b]. I don't know if that's intended, but some of your characters have some spells which are way too strong in my opinion.\n\n- [b]The soundtrack[/b]. This is a nitpick more than anything, but still. Due to the grindy nature of the game, you'll soon find yourself disabling the music. It does fit the tone of the game, but it becomes rather repetitive sooner or later.\n\n\n[code][b]Did you find this review helpful?

Se nota que fue hecho para ser una entrega auto conclusiva. \n*El sistema de combate es claramente m\u00e1s restringido que sus secuelas, sin embargo gracias al port de PC la experiencia se vuelve m\u00e1s amena, ya que se pueden modificar, saltar, y ajustar muchas cosas que en las versiones de PS2 o PSP no era posible. \n*Sumado a lo anterior el port es un 10/10, cumple con estar bien optimizado, controles costumizables y diversas opciones de resoluci\u00f3n he interfaz. \n*Por \u00faltimo tiene el a\u00f1adido coqueto de tener los trofeos, que siempre vienen bien. \n\nLos elementos que considero que no estuvieron tan buenos son:\n*Nivel de grindeo a tope. Se nota que los desarrolladores cuando hicieron el juego quer\u00eda exprimirle la mayor cantidad de horas, porque vas a tener que machetear infinito, y si bien un poco de grindeo vienen bien, en Disgaea PC es duro y te va a costar varias horas.\n*El juego falla en explicar ciertas mec\u00e1nicas, siendo poco claro, por lo que recomiendo encarecidamente que se juegue con una gu\u00eda de los items y bonus que tiene cada arma, ya que de otra manera se pierde gran parte del encanto del juego. \n*Algunos niveles est\u00e1n particularmente rompe huevetes, en donde f\u00e1cilmente te toparas con una pared que te detendr\u00e1 algunas cuantas horas. \n\nYa por \u00faltimo, quiero recomendar nuevamente que por favor le den una oportunidad a Disagea PC, a m\u00ed me parece una experiencia estupenda, y considerando que es el \u00fanico Disgaea que tiene secuela a nivel narrativo (El Disgaea D2), es un obligatorio para cualquiera.

I've got 90 hours logged in this game, but actually I'm at the gates of Celestia, or in otherwords near the end of the main story but only at a toes depth into the real meat of the game, the end game content.\n\nDisgaea doesn't feel like a book, or like a movie, or like a pen and paper role playing game, or like anything other than a video game.  In terms of gameplay it also doesn't feel much like a turn based game either, even though it is. Disgaea amps up the pace of gameplay compared to other strategy RPGs, thanks to the way turn orders are handled in the most simple possible way and thanks to the especially tactile lifting system, which has nothing to do with muscles or with petty retail theft.\n\nAt the time Disgaea was released in the west very few strategy rpgs had ever been localized. Fire Emblem and Advance Wars from Nintendo had only recently made their localized debuts. To most fans of rpgs in the west, Final Fantasy Tactics on the PS1 was still considered the gold standard of the genre. Which is kind of ridiculous, because Final Fantasy Tactics though a charming game was also a game with permadeath and incredibly tedious grinding in which it was possible to get stuck in an unwinnable gamestate hours in and have to restart your file, if you didn't have a backup save. Or reload every death, but then why should the game even have permadeath. The English translation was also very bland and confusing.\n\nIn a lot of ways Disgaea is the polar opposite of Final Fantasy Tactics, the first 20 hours made up entirely of short cakewalk levels with amusing and funny designs and high novelty value. Grinding is also streamlined. Assuming you learn how to grind properly without looking it up, or look it up (the game winks and nudges you towards how you should grind efficiently but never outright spills it), the main storyline won't present much of a challenge until the last few chapters, making the novelty factor the main draw. The story also falls off pretty hard around the time most people who don't figure out how to grind would give up on the game. Lets just say the story doesn't go in a direction which is interesting if you like the main cast and setting of the game and since the main cast as setting of the game is very very strong most players will. Isn't this why Metal Gear Solid 2 wasn't popular?!\n\nPC port has some problems", "timestamp_created": 1584062939, "timestamp_updated": 1584062939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64937263": {"recommendationid": "64937263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282301091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1603568675}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey, don't mean to be that guy.\n\nBut maybe make sure the game actually launches when you sell it.", "timestamp_created": 1584059855, "timestamp_updated": 1584059855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44426494836807251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64729473": {"recommendationid": "64729473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045903239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2792, "last_played": 1647204105}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1583700763, "timestamp_updated": 1583700763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64603234": {"recommendationid": "64603234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020743534", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1685265618}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1583510564, "timestamp_updated": 1583510564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64507093": {"recommendationid": "64507093", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995660241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9992, "last_played": 1669606296}, "language": "english", "review": "one of my favorite games", "timestamp_created": 1583334921, "timestamp_updated": 1583334921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64472802": {"recommendationid": "64472802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101321139", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2018, "last_played": 1600136447}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked it, the mechanics are pretty fun and the story is pure gold (comedy)\nI'm happy i got to play the first game thanks to this port", "timestamp_created": 1583273103, "timestamp_updated": 1585588890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64317589": {"recommendationid": "64317589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034403686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1620814691}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, my personal favorite turn-based strategy game.", "timestamp_created": 1583007512, "timestamp_updated": 1583007512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64217440": {"recommendationid": "64217440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390164333", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 11371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11371, "last_played": 1582848786}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is f**king fantastic!!

While Disgaea 1 PC has rather rough gameplay compared to the super polished and refined combat found in Disgaea 5, it quickly didn't matter as I became sucked into the storyline and its colorful cast of characters. \n\nDisgaea PC follows Laharl, the demon prince of the Netherworld as he wakes up from a 2 year nap and learns that his father has passed away. With his vassal Etna, Laharl fights to claim the throne as Overlord. Things get complicated as angel trainee Flonne and a group of humans arrive in the Netherworld. Why was an angel sent to assassinate a demon? What are humans doing in the Netherworld? Why is there a robot? At some point you'll just begin accepting the bizarre things that are happening and fall in love with the story like I did.\n\nThere are also lots of job classes to experiment with: from cute witches to exploding penguins, there's a lot of possible teams to set up. Want a team of ninjas? Go for it! The apprentice system in particular is handy, as it lets you teach spells and skills to units that would normally not learn them, meaning that everyone could have healing spells if you wanted. There's just so much customization to suit your play style.\n\nHowever, as this is a Nippon Ichi Software game, I must warn you that this is a very grindy game. The level cap is Lv9999, but you'll really need to be around Lv70-100 to beat the main storyline (my team was around Lv80-89). The grinding isn't too bad, but if it's something you dislike in a RPG, this might not be the game for you.

In most cases, I'm not the biggest fan of grinding and any excessive grind requirement in a game is usually enough to turn me off from it unless it is particularly done well and supported by other mechanics. So why do I have well over 100 hours in this game and why am I excited to play the sequels? Ut seems that the answer to that is simply that the developers built the game from the ground up with the intention of making the grind fun.\n\nThere are a number of ways to grind in Disgaea and by combining them you can create an exceptionally powerful group of characters. The \"classic\" grind is the obvious one where you defeat enemies to level up your characters and unlock a plethora of new classes, some of which are new, others of which are upgrades of jobs you already have. This is a pretty standard RPG mechanic and is fun enough with abilities that are unlocked but then you start the realize where the game gets weird. You also unlock the ability to enter any piece of equipment that you get your hands on, whether it be a sword, a shield, or a piece of food, and battle through it like it were a dungeon. Each cleared floor along the way strengthens the item by increasing its stats and allowing you to transfer its stats to other items if you so wish. You wouldn't think that the combination of these mechanics would be as fun as they are but I've become a believer.\n\nThis all comes with a disclaimer from me, though; I am not a fan of a number of the design choices in the game but all of these are outside of the primary focus of Disgaea. The story and characters, on a narrative level, didn't appeal to me and neither did the art style of the game; it's very anime. Fortunately, you become numb to these aspects as you dive deeper into the progression of your characters and items and only vaguely remember that there was a campaign to begin with. \n\nI recommend this game to tactical RPG fans who enjoy leveling characters and upgrading equipment as well as those who enjoy managing a roster of characters. I suggest you stay away if grinding and progression doesn't appeal to you or if you are unable to get past the silly anime graphics and story.", "timestamp_created": 1562548682, "timestamp_updated": 1562548682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675153255462646484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53873841": {"recommendationid": "53873841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309631942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1562985616}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a traditional JRPG. it needs to play again and again to achieve a hidden factor. and it is a really cool graphic, but not the latest.", "timestamp_created": 1562473731, "timestamp_updated": 1562473731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53818757": {"recommendationid": "53818757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107473369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1984, "last_played": 1596409718}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, very engrossing.

After learning about, this he embarks on a quest to become the new overlord. Along the way he'll meet a very fun and quirky cast of characters that you'll have fun with the entire time. It's one of those stories that are ridiculous and comical in one chapter, then goes straight into serious and sad the next, but it all flows well and comes into one cohesive story. Oh, and if you like hidden endings, they have that too. Not much to say here without spoilers but suffice it to say, you'll enjoy the story.\n\n[Graphics]\nBeing that this is a game that was made back in 2004, then ported to the PSP and then finally here, the graphics are fine for what they are, but don't exactly expect HD sprites that look as good as something like Jotun for example. This isn't exactly a fair comparison, but the game is starting to show a bit of age. However, the old UI does give it a classic look that you may enjoy.\n\n[Performance]\nYou might be wondering how a game with a radeon hd 5750 as it's recommended GPU has performance issues, and you'd be right. It's not actually low framerates that are the issue, it's that for some reason in any cutscene where there is some audio playing in the background (such as an alarm) while the characters are talking, it causes the audio to skip like a scratched CD and the framerate tanks. To be fair it's a low framerate on still images and only happens like 4 times in the entire 24ish hour story, but the audio issues still exist and they crop up on new game+ to be experienced all over again.\n \n[Gameplay]\nHere we get to the meat of the game. There's just too much to describe here and I love it. Whether you're stacking up all the enemies in the level to fight an enemy hundreds of levels above you for massive XP, bribing and killing your senators to get your way, farming clones on an item world level in order to kill enough monsters to make your own in the dark assembly, or trying to get skills from your pupils there's so much to do. I can't say if the mechanics are amazing as this is my first strategy RPG but from what I can tell it is very good as there is so many ways you could go about playing so it never feels like it's repetitive, and it doesn't suffer from a lack of game modes and content.\n\nNow you might hear that this is a grind heavy game, and this is true. However, the grind in this game is different from every other game. On one hand, it isn't even necessary to complete the game. By default the game gives enough xp for you to beat it without ever needing to use anything other than the most basic of systems. However the end game content is what you'd grind to complete. For example, in a classic RPG, you would run around in a circle and one-shot mindless enemies for a couple hours until you could beat the boss. In this game, you'd \n\n1.spend a couple hours farming \"statisticians\" to earn 4x exp per kill \n2. try to bribe/kill your way into getting a triple XP bill passed so that you can kill one enemy for massive xp\n3. then you'd have to go into the map and stack the enemies up to get a high level enemy while carefully managing your characters so that nobody dies because you can only kill one enemy per triple xp bill bonus and that applies to the enemies too. You must also make sure that the character you're trying to level will be the one to do the final blow or they wont level.\n\nIt sounds tedious, but there is much more fun to be had exploring the randomly generated item world and trying to optimize so that it takes less time to gather all of the statisticians. And after you do all that, the payout is huge as you can easily jump 50+ levels in one battle. Takes time to set up but it provides a much more interesting gameplay loop. Im trying to keep this brief but grinding in this game is actually fun because it takes real thought and has variety instead of mindlessly using earthquake and going to the pokemon center 1000 times in a row.\n\nScore 9/10.

Aside from that, its art style, and that they're turn based tactics games, I didn't know much about the series. So, when the opportunity arose, I purchased it, eager to discover what this series was for myself. After putting a lot of time into the game, I figure \"I'll review it.\" So here it is.\n\nSo, the game begins with a short narration, describing the basic plot of the game. You play as the scrawny, arrogant demon Prince Laharl, heir to the throne of the Netherworld. He awoke from a 2-year sleep to find that his father has been dead, and the Netherworld has gone to chaos due to the king's death and his own hibernation. Dismayed and eager to show everyone who's in charge he sets out to prove his worth and claim the proper title of \"Overlord\". He's accompanied by a sarcastic and sinister vassal \"Etna\" and an angel with a hard on for love \"Flonne\". Together, along with a few other characters, they make the story of Disgaea. Now while it sounds like the potential for a serious story, for a lot of the game it's not. \n\nA lot of the dialogue, character interactions, and story beats are more comedic in nature. The story does have a semblance of character growth and development with the main cast and the stakes do get raised in the latter half of the game, but it still has a focus on the comedy. It does cause some tonal whiplash (especially in Chapter 9 which came after a somber character moment and before the game starts focusing on a more coherent and serious story in with greater stakes.) but for the most part I think it works well. I especially enjoy the comedy. What makes it even better for me are the transitions between chapters. They're called \"Episodes\" with a preview of what's to come with a short narration by Etna, often exaggerating things for the sake of humor, which to me feels like it belongs from an anime from the late 1990's. This in tandem with the other humor makes for a story I can get some laughs from.\n\nI've spent time talking on the story, but to be honest story (and story levels) only accounts for a small portion of the game. For context, the game is touted as one where you can reach level 9999, but in the story, you can be the beat the game with a well-balanced team at around lv 65. \n\nYou see, the real meat and potatoes of the game are in its post-game, a giant grind fest dedicated to improving levels and stats to tackle end-game challenges that at their lowest range from around levels 100-200, while the high end bosses are at levels that reach into the thousands. Now that sounds like the main campaign is dwarfed in scope and length compared to the extra content, and in a sense it is. I'd also point out though that the main story can take around 20-25 hours to beat, which for RPG length hits a length that isn't too long but isn't too short either though I'm sure opinions on length vary.\n\nBut what might those \"meat and potatoes\" of the gameplay be? Well, to simply put it, this is a turn-based tactics game. You select characters (up to 10 can be on the battlefield at once), move them around a tiled map, and kill everything you see. As you kill enemies, you gain 3 types of \"currency\". \"Experience\" which levels you up and increases your stats, \"Hell\" the equivalent of money which you use to buy items, and \"Mana\" which is used to perform actions in the Dark Assembly. The Dark Assembly being a place where you spend \"mana\" for things like creating new characters, unlocking new areas, adding and improving to the item shops, and more. Though a criticism I have for it is that it's up to rng whether those bills would pass. So, pray to the demons prepare for a lot of soft resting to pass them, which doesn't even work all the time because some bills are just about impossible to pass without pulling an Emperor Palpatine and just \"becoming the senate\".\n\nSwitching gears from discussing gameplay, I'd like to mention the graphics and sound. The interesting thing is that this was an enhanced version of a PSP game, so unfortunately HD sprites aren't available which is a disappointment since later games had high res sprites that looked amazing. Even as is though, the sprites are still well made with plenty of detail and expressiveness in their idle poses and attack animations. Laharl for example has his signature scarf flowing constantly which looks great. There are a couple of options for the sprites so if you want clearer sprites or fuzzier ones you can have them too. I felt a bit mixed about the sprites, but the artwork and portraits are more hit and miss to me. The series trademark art style wasn't in the first game, so you won't be seeing the usual style the series is known for. However, it does offer a style that I appreciate, being more rigid and grounded compared to the later games though it suffers from inconsistencies. (In game cuts during combo attacks are a good example)\n\nWhile the graphics were a positive mixed bag, the music is thankfully more consistently great. Its soundtrack is on the smaller side, but it has several battle music tracks which helps alleviate tedium when fighting and grinding. The best tracks for me are ones you get for going for each of the game's multiple endings (Though unlocking the tracks to listen to them as much as you want is very expensive). In addition, you can select a set track to play while you explore the Item World, randomly generated dungeon that you travel through when entering an item.\n\nOne aspect that I want to mention though is performance. I usually don't talk about performance in my reviews, since it's hard to tell how much of the issue is of the game itself or how much much is due to the machine you run it on. However, after playing the sequel which can run 60 fps at all times with improved visuals, it really does make the optimization of the game seem much worse in comparison and leaves me wondering what happened. There are fixes to the issues of performance and graphics, but it still is something I feel should be brought up because it was so noticeable.\n\nPutting aside technical issues, there are some other things I want to mention that the port has. Some of these include: New UI that can be swapped for the UI present in the original game, characters and maps that were present in the PSP version of the game, an extra mode Etna mode which is a short alternate story where you play as Etna (that has two different methods to unlock which changes the levels of the enemies you fight), and a few other odds and ends.\n\nI think for me, the main appeal of the game isn't the art style, the anime feels or even the comedy. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy those things. Quite a bit in fact. To me though, what makes the game appealing is understanding and exploiting the game mechanics through grind and strategy to make the game bend to my knees. \n\nIt does have issues. The story and characters can feel cliche, the presentation needed more cleaning up, and the performance was a problem that annoyed, but the rest of the experience was enjoyable enough to overcome those complaints and the story and characters were something I personally enjoyed and was invested in. If you're someone who enjoys the aesthetics and style of 90's anime I can easily recommend it to you. I'd also recommend it if you enjoy Turn Based Tactic games, or just miss the good ol days of PS2 era RPGs. I had a fantastic time playing it, and I think if you have any interest in this series this should be the game to start with.", "timestamp_created": 1556836742, "timestamp_updated": 1556838426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599829196929931641", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50411275": {"recommendationid": "50411275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385097639", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 272, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1652633480}, "language": "english", "review": "garbage", "timestamp_created": 1556663363, "timestamp_updated": 1556663363, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.134945690631866455", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50408236": {"recommendationid": "50408236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822113764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13500, "last_played": 1601696070}, "language": "spanish", "review": "luego de completar todos los logros puedo recomendar este juego como un 10/10\nrecomendable si estas listo para farmear como loco", "timestamp_created": 1556651718, "timestamp_updated": 1556651718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50257366": {"recommendationid": "50257366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073189942", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1904, "last_played": 1550322156}, "language": "english", "review": "Prinny dood", "timestamp_created": 1555878734, "timestamp_updated": 1555878734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399446725845336914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50143877": {"recommendationid": "50143877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081245539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1555328244}, "language": "english", "review": "The explanations are vague.

I also liked what they did in improving the graphics and adding extra options in the menus to change and adjust the graphics for PC. In addition to this, I still enjoyed the voice acting in the game which was funny at times, even though some may say it hasn't aged well and the soundtrack of the game is just as good as I remembered it to be.\n\nThis was the first disgaea I ever played, I also recommend you play Disgaea PC first before moving on to any of the other Disgaea games as this one serves as a good way to learn the unique RPG mechanics that are within this game. Speaking of which... you are most likely not used to the type of gameplay Disgaea PC offers, as its a mix of a turn based rpg and strategy rpg in one, with a battle/movement system kinda similar to Fire Emblem (Best I could come up with rn) if you know that game. Of course it is a grind heavy type rpg, but a fun one at that, with many different characters to unlock and level up, find new weapons armor and items, etc. In addition to the unique gameplay of Disgaea PC, the game features funny dialogue with a great story imo. There is even a secret game/alternate story you can play if you input a button combo on the title screen which I thought was really cool. \n\nSo I would like to recommend Disgaea PC if you are interested in the series, or just like rpgs and want to try something new, it may seem that it is hard and has a learning curve, and it may for some, but it is definitely fun.

It combines a wide range of classes and unit types typically found in the tactical final fantasy games, with insane character levels, a unique item and loot system, unit promotions, and constant humour to make playing thoroughly enjoyable. It also introduces the concept of smart grinding. Having played Phantom Brave (which has a unique game mechanic that I didn\u2019t like), I was apprehensive about playing this, but found the plot well structured and absurd, the voice work, music and character scripts humorous and fitting, while actually providing quite a challenge to play. That\u2019s pretty good for a game that was originally released in 2003 for the Playstation2 and re-released for steam in 2016.\n\nYou play as Laharl, the son of the now deceased daemon king. Having slept for 2 years after your father\u2019s death your absence has caused a power struggle amongst other daemon nobles. It\u2019s up to you and your semi-loyal retainer Etna to try and beat some sense into any daemons who don\u2019t bow down to your authority and deal with any other surprises on the way. And I can guarantee you won\u2019t guess the surprises - the game takes the plot in enough weird directions that you just start to go with it after a while. The game boasts a considerable amount of endings, which take into account certain actions you preformed during your game.\n\nGameplay is your typical grid based combat, with the idea being to generally kill all enemies on the map. Each class of character can move different amounts and have different stats when levelling up, and some can traverse higher terrain more easily. Each class has a few different variants, with the later variants having better stats. Newer, more powerful classes might require a combination of classes to reach a certain level, or a weapon type to get to a certain proficiency level before they become available. Each class has a different proficiency with weapons, which controls how quickly they can learn special skills. Each weapon type has different attack range and some use different stats for working out damage. Attacking from the sides or behind an enemy deals more damage. You can fill up a bonus gauge by chaining attacks from multiple characters (sometimes attacking together) for bonus damage and extra items and experience at the end of battle. Sometimes there are blocks on the maps that effect some or all of the grid squares, which can be either beneficial or challenging. Characters can be picked up and thrown to move them down the map faster (sometimes making a tower of characters if they need to get from one to the other quickly), and enemies can be thrown (usually to move them or combine them into a tougher variant).\n\nYou can simply brute force your way through about 75% of the main game with minimal grinding, however that stops becoming effective at the end. This is where the smart grinding comes into play. Each and every single item has 3 levels of rarity, which can be explored in the games item world. The item world serves two purposes, firstly to level up and grind, but the main draw card is to find and defeat the specialists that reside in each item. Each specialist provides a bonus (either to direct stats, xp, weapon status effect or resistances) and rarer items can house more specialists. After they are subdued, their effect is doubled. Since these stages are traversed by getting to the exit tile you can breeze through them until you find the specialist, beat them into submission, then rush to the next level. Specialists can be combined and moved between items, so they aren\u2019t lost when your equipment is upgraded. You also have the option of upgrading characters to other classes or a higher version of their current class. This reset them to lvl 1 and includes a % change of losing skills, but you can boost their stats when doing this, so they gain more stats every time they level up. If you repeat this then your characters can eventually reach stupid levels of hp and damage. You also have and mentor/student system, where they can learn each other techniques, which can provide many combat spells and techniques, which can make each character very versatile. All of this might seem like overkill, however it\u2019s required for the last chapter unless you want to manually grind 10 party members to lvl 100, and essential for the new game plus content, where bosses have lvls in the 1000\u2019s.\n\nThe characters have a fair bit of bickering and speech amongst themselves before/after each missions, which is usually very funny and sets each chapters arc. Fortunately you can skip these on stage select if your second time around, which is an excellent feature to include. Each of your castles minions are typically fairly dismissive of your chances (they are like lvl 300+) and keep in line with the tongue in cheek attitude this game has. Etna has a TV show like dialogue at the end of each chapter where she is playing out a fantasy, which is also quite funny to listen too. The soundtrack was good, suits this game very well. The voice work is well done, I didn\u2019t find any of the voice acting grating, through the characters when fighting do use the same lines constantly.\n\nBeing a port from 2003 the game doesn\u2019t scale as well as I hoped- it supports 1080p resolution but I had to run the game in a windowed mode to make it display correctly otherwise it looked all stretched and faded. The game seemed to develop a glitch where it would crash during special attack animation after chapter 10. The only fix I could find was to turn off the attack animation, which does have the added bonus of speeding the game up but it was disappointing to encounter. It seems that this wasn\u2019t a straight port, as some of the original character introductions are missing or have been changed from when they were meant to appear. I did find it interesting that named characters are still getting introduced right up to the last chapter, where it is hard to kind of justify using them unless you are running a massively under levelled team.\n\nThe DLC art book gives a brief design rational behind some of the characters and has Etna and Flonne arguing, its not bad if you like this sort of thing.\n\nIf you are chasing 100% achievements then be prepared to spend a lot of time grinding. If your not willing to sink a few 100 hours into grinding, doing runs through the item world and doing a few runs through the game then this isn\u2019t the game for you.\n\nFor more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/", "timestamp_created": 1545319324, "timestamp_updated": 1545394288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47519329": {"recommendationid": "47519329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121804633", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3147, "last_played": 1673840958}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic game that definitley holds to the test of time.

There is also a bit of a learning curve as well when it comes to the game as the tutorial really only covers the very basics. The wiki became my best friend when it came to figuring out how certain things work. \n\nAlot of people complain about the grindy nature of the game and I can understand that. However, the base story of the game can be completed with grinding limited to just leveling up some items in the item dimension. The story of the game is par for the course in this game. While the game appeals to strategy lovers like myself, it also tells the story of Larharl who is trying to gain the title as new overlord of the netherworld. The variety of characters and wacky shenanigans that ensue make the story alone worth playing the game for. I mean come on, there is a level where you fight the power rangers. The attacks for each character are very well animated and give good incentive to progress your characters.\n\nHighly recommend for those looking for good startegy, a good story, and a game to sink hours into.\nI definitley see myself playing through this game again in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1544778920, "timestamp_updated": 1544778920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47471049": {"recommendationid": "47471049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242734316", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 11558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11368, "last_played": 1590026067}, "language": "english", "review": "Disgaea. Otherwise known as Grinding: The Game!\n\nJokes aside, I ended up loving this game. As someone who watched a part of a Let's Player go through this game years ago, I was pretty stoked to try the game myself. This game was far more overwhelming than I anticipated but it was fun, nonetheless. \n\nThis game has one wacky story with a mix of hilarious and ridiculous moments. It doesn't take itself too seriously with some exceptions. Disgaea is also certainly not without its band of interesting characters with some of them being completely over the top. I admit that some people might not like certain characters, so it comes down to personal preference there. The soundtrack is overall nice to listen to with some really good ones in there. \n\nThere is also a lot involved with the battle mechanics and everything that goes into knowing all the features of the game. On a grand scale, one can feel overwhelmed by everything this game has to offer. If you intend to just tackle the main story of this game and casually play it, then you won't have to worry about it too much. Main storyline battles can be tough to different extents but there's many different ways you can try to succeed in each one. Like many SRPGs, there's no one way of beating the game. Just try anything and everything. As for the majority of the post-game content, I can tell you that you'll be in for a long ride if you also intend to complete everything. \n\nDespite my overall praise for the game, I won't say the game is flawless. For a lot of obvious reasons, this game won't be for everyone. For those who usually prefer a more serious story with strongly-developed characters, you may be disappointed if you expect that from Disgaea (although this game does have some character development). The heavy grinding in this game that's especially involved in the post-game can also be terrifying for new players who might be checking the game out. If you want to be able to beat the game's most difficult challenges and earn every achievement, then you'd better be prepared for hours upon hours of grinding. As someone who had the mindset of \"Oh how long could this possibly take\", I was in over my head when I began the long grind.\n\nNow that I've complete every last challenge/achievement in this game, I'm taking a very long break from Disgaea. I originally planned on playing Disgaea 2 as soon as I was done with this one, but I think I'll get around to that next year or so.

FIXED!  This game is finally Running smoothly and i couldn't be happier*\n\n16 years ago i bought this game on PS2, and wow, what a nightmare it was.  This game has LAYERS, and DEPTH unlike any other game i've played.  I played it on and off for years, every time learning a little more and progressing ever so slightly. I dont know how long i was stuck on the final chapter, unable to defeat the final boss.  It took me years to master this game, i thought i had a complete understanding of it when i was 18, i dumped hundreds of hours into this game as a kid.  Im 25 now and when i first booted this game up, I realized I still had a lot to learn.  I have a complete understanding of this game now and i am having a blast.  The grind is nearly never ending. The Main story itself is fun, and then there are more unlockable worlds on top of that to provide new challenges, not to mention you have the ability to create stronger enemies.  Then there is the Item World, the KEY to mastering this game.  There are a handful of great guides online, learning how this game works is half the fun. Something I didn't want to do as a kid was read and LEARN everything there was to learn about this game, i just wanted to kill demons with awesome super powerful characters.  This game will provide DAYS of entertainment if you're willing to put in the time. There is just something extremely satisfying about unlocking all the Secret UBER POWERFUL items in this game and creating the Ultimate Demon Warrior that deals MILLIONS of damage with a single swing of his sword.

Overall a fun game with some serious but derpy DERPY storyline that even I had a hard time keeping  a straight face.\n\nThis SRPG is pretty long and if you plan to do everything you're looking at over 200 hours.  \nPerhaps my biggest let down, that is a very grindy game and there are maps through the main storyline that are designed specifcially for grinding purposes.  Upgrading stuff through the item world to unlock \"residents\" which are bonus stats to that particular piece of equipment and being able to move them around to newer equipment is certainly new to me.  There's a lot of customization you can do in the game which makes it very VERY lengthy.  \n\nI only say it's a letdown because I didn't expect to grind so early onto the game.  The game is very linear but that alone is a decent journey.  There are many endings but it's very uncertain how to get each one.  This is a love or hate type of game.  You'll either like it or hate it.  I overall enjoyed it, but I for one, do not plan to do the extra content other than \"Etna Mode\" so I can give my friends my opinion on it.  \n\nEnemy AI is usually bias as they tend to go after the weakest characters and go Gun Ho on them leaving them totally open for an all out attack afterwards (similar to FFT final boss in a way imo).  The challenge aspect of the enemies and / or maps is dealing with Geo Panels which manipulate the field - usually not in your favor as the challenge is to either destory the Geo Panels or change them to your favor.  I kinda liked this and kinda didn't, because some of those maps were a pain in the butt.\n\nThe voice acting and graphics to the PC version were very well done.  Control is tight, music is pretty decent, although when it was time to grind, i muted the game to listen to music or tv shows because (unless you buy music to hear other musics) you'll hear the same music sound track for some maps a LOT.\n\nIf you like SRPG's, you'll like Disgaea.  The derpness was worth the grind overall and it was an enjoyable game.\n\nI hope the POWER OF LOVE finds you when reading this review.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1542089644, "timestamp_updated": 1542089644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740063846111297607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45787089": {"recommendationid": "45787089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033238453", "num_games_owned": 1723, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 2326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2326, "last_played": 1508264897}, "language": "english", "review": ":D", "timestamp_created": 1542062622, "timestamp_updated": 1542062622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.37381899356842041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45781100": {"recommendationid": "45781100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069814920", "num_games_owned": 773, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1652488184}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todo excelente... ya termin\u00e9 el 3 y el 4.", "timestamp_created": 1542036056, "timestamp_updated": 1542753458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45725365": {"recommendationid": "45725365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069063334", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1541785346}, "language": "english", "review": "To be perfectly honest the lack of any cutscene skip and having to go through the tutorial all over again after getting the mid boss ending by accident kinda bogged the game down and honestly i don't really don't want to play any further.\n", "timestamp_created": 1541785571, "timestamp_updated": 1541785571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430967807769775391", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45701510": {"recommendationid": "45701510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060470937", "num_games_owned": 736, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1531968355}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure if you could spend the rest of your life playing this game and not open all of the content, but you'll lose a few years.

I've played every Advance Wars title, numerous Fire Emblem games, Devil Survivor 1 and 2, and even Stella Glow. \n\nAnd this game--Disgaea--is by far the WORST turn-based strategy game I have EVER played. \n\nIt's the opposite or ergonomic, with menus that fumble and controls that simultaneously rigid and annoying. It's the inverse of intuitive, with mechanics that are both bizarre and poorly explained--a truly fun-killing combination.\n\nThe fact that you have to heal your characters in between EVERY. SINGLE. BATTLE. \nThe fact that in the shop you can view your stats with a prospective purchase equipped... but not WITHOUT it equipped (in other words, there is no frame of reference).\nThe fact that the up/down/left/right directions are inverted to what I'm used to, and I can find no way to change them.\nThe fact that experience is ONLY gained by dealing the killing blow... meaning healers and weaker support attackers (like spear users) are left out to dry, as far as I know. \n\nAbsolutely atrocious, and a complete headache all around. I may come back at some point and try to figure out a way to make this game fun, but the devs have done everything in their power to prevent this game from being an enjoyable strategic experience. Little is explained, and what IS explained is explained poorly... if that weren't bad enough, this happens to be one of THOSE games with unnecessarily complicated mechanics and ridiculous intricacies. \n\nOverall, I would NOT reccomend this to any fan of turn-based strategy.

Definately has its issues but the overall experience is just as genuine after fifteen plus years.\n\n\nPossibly the most comedic of all the games, at times its just back to back jokes or some form of humor in the dialogue. Has quite a couple twists, likely more then any of the other games. But at the same time, while the characters are very funny they really do not have much chemistry. They don't synergize well together from a theatrical standpoint, they're just kind of forced to be together by the plot. So only near the end does it really feel like they're a genuine social group of allied characters, up until that point there's zero sense of connectivity between them the entire time. And, while the plot has a lot of nice twists a massive amount of the story is meaningless. Most of the time, the characters are just doing relatively arbitrary things that the player will forget by the end of the game. Then only at the end do the characters end up having a distinguished consistent goal that they are working towards. \n\nThus, it really only is towards the end of the game that it starts to become what all the successive games are about from start to finish; teams of allies working towards a single goal. Which is unfortunate that it takes so long for the game to collect itself, as it really does get interesting by that time. The format before then of a ramshackle trio running around doing ramshackle things, just isn't engaging and it doesn't feel like the writers had a grasp of things. But these problems are well balanced out by the amount of great twists and comedy that the story has all throughout.\n\n\nThe thing that genuinely damages the experience is the forced grinding. Every other chapter or so the player starts becoming out level'd by the enemies and it gradually becomes a struggle to progress. If you mess with the game and really try, you can win anyways; which does make it the most strategic of all the games at times. But eventually, enemies will just become too powerful and you have to grind and maximize your characters to progress. So every other chapter or so, ten plus minutes of pointless grinding. Which is bad enough until it starts happening in the middle of key story developments, so instead of going with the flow of the story you have to stop and grind; then can resume the story. Which really, really ruins the immersion in the plot at times.\n\nAnd the item world is not much of an option, because often it will generate extremely tedious layouts that either can't be skipped or throw the player into really awkward situations. So becoming more powerful through upgrading items is not very effective during the story. The player also starts off being really underpowered, and only the characters with imperial seals equipped are able to survive during the first missions. And for some reason, the player starts off with Pleinair even though she has no business being on the team at that point and breaks the immersion of the player starting their journey just with the three protagonists. And she only has one special move, which is overly effective in general, and she starts off with an imperial seal. So the game is basically trying to trick the player into using her as a main fighter; even though she's really boring to use because of her single powerful move.\n\nFor some reason the game unlocks a lot of characters for the player, but the characters require way more mana to create then the player is ever going to have until later in the game. So a lot of the characters you will never get to use until later, at which point it's better off just sticking to the current ones instead of grinding to add a new one to the roster. Unless you're playing the game with the intent to grind past the story content.\n\n\n\nThus it has its ups and downs, although most of these problems do not recur in the other games so it's nice knowing that they have genuinely improved overtime beyond just getting new features. A very positive experience in the end though despite its issues, especially considering how old the game is.

I do have the occasional problem selecting characters and making them do what I want. For instance, I was just near the end of an item world run when a miss-click meant that I accidentally killed one of my own characters.

It could be very complicated to play, a total chaos, but it isn't\n- you can clear a stage just using brute force (having a hi level) or using your brain to choose wisely your actions\n- and I can't forget to mention Laharl has the most hilarious special I already saw in a RPG\n\n I think anyone who likes JRPG and/or animes can buy it without any concern, except that probably you will play it for hours.\n Play it and have fun!", "timestamp_created": 1537707500, "timestamp_updated": 1537707500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461309522390365601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44705588": {"recommendationid": "44705588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015840921", "num_games_owned": 794, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3218, "last_played": 1494742734}, "language": "english", "review": "Final Fantasy Tactics with more depth.

Sadly to say though, Etna isn't in this game; not the Etna I know and love at least. \nFrom a little bit of research, it seems when Disgaea was remade for the PSP, it got some additional content that mostly focused around Etna and because of so she needed a new voice actress. The only problem is, this new voice actress for Etna is so bad, I'd rather shove crochet needles in my ears then have to hear the massacre of a character I love.\nIf you have intentions on getting this game due to an excelled love for Etna, please acknowledge chances are you'll end up switching the voices over to Japanese just because Etna's new English voice is actually just that bad; it doesn't do the character any justice, lost half the personality, and base-line just can't even compete with the original.\nIt's unfortunate and overall off putting, but doesn't ruin the game. If you've never played Disgaea before and are looking for a rather interesting RPG with a unique battle system (for its day at least) then I would 100% recommend Disgaea.

There are flaws but they don't stop it being a good game.\n\n    So - the game.  You are a demon prince just awoken from a two year slumber to find your father dead and the kingdom, ahem, gone to hell.  Your job is to beat the tar out of everyone in the way of reclaiming your throne (that's how the game starts anyway - I haven't finished it yet).  So the game breaks down into three - narrative cut scenes talking comic book style (so they flick between still images),  turn based battles on a grid, and healing and item sorting between battles.\n\n   The story has it's tongue firmly implanted in the cheek - so there's a slight disconnect betweeen your murderous rampages and the narrative.  There's some suggestion that certainly major character just are beaten up rather than killed.\n\n   The sensibility is Japanse manga.  So if your blood vessels burst at characters that look twelve dressed in bondage gear, or little girl dresses, or maids' outfits walk away.  There seems to be nothing racier than the costumes so far and so far nothing approaching sex or nudity in the game.\n\n   The game follows the standard RPG mote -kill monsters, loot, get XP, level up, get better weapons and kit, kill more monsters etc etc.  However with up to ten characters in play and over a dozen classes the potential strategic complexity is huge.  You also can fight through a series of ten consecutive battles to improve your gear.  The game is played out on square grid maps.  The maps can have coloured squares which are influenced by coloured pyramids that give things like XP boosts, ability modifiers, ability blockers, hit point drain, and invulnerability.  It's a good idea to check out what the pyramids on each map are doing before you deploy.\n\n    Game levels tend to split into four types.  The first is where your squad clearly outmatches the enemy and you can have fun picking which character makes the kill to pick up the XP.  The second is a tough battle where frequently your super tough main character will be only character left standing.  The third is a tough set up that you'll need to try a couple of times to gain a victory. The fourth is the sort of nightmare that sends you to the walkthroughs or back to item  world to grind out some extra levels.  I've just had my morale broken by a map at the start of Chapter 7 where the map is filled with mid 20s enemies (only my main demon is tougher) but there are also inaccessible x3 enemy modifiers.\n\n    Things I wished I knew when I started (very minor spoilers but believe me you'll thank me)\n\n    1)  The store has TWO sides.  So one side sells accessories the other side sells kit.  I went through 24 hours of play before I found where they sold weapons and armour.\n    2)  Weapons ARE class specific but can be used by other classes at a penalty.  They should make this clear.  They don't.  Does this apply to other kit too ?  It's major because fighter can't use specials if they are wearing brawler gloves.  Check the character sheet for signifiers.\n    3) The final battle of part 1 is a total killer - by far the toughest battle in the game so far.  You can redo battles to build XP and you can go on item boosts.  BEWARE.  The item boosts need you to win ten consecutive fights.  I wouldn't consider it until you have to do it in game.  I'd definitely replay the first three levels repeatedly to boost stats and then buy some extra characters to boost your party.  If you take out the red pyramids and your main character is still intact you should win.\n   4) Go to the hospital and heal up and save after each battle.\n   5) Keep using your special powers to level them up.\n    6)  I used an X-Box for PC controller and had no control problems whatsoever.\n     7) Healers are badly disadvantaged.  You get XP by killing things so my healer who has got the party through dozens of levels is falling further and further behind on his stats.  Healers wear dresses, have feminine features, and male voices.\n     8) None of the weapons next to your spawn can be picked up.\n     9)  Spoiler alert significant - but you'll be very grateful.  After the game first starts click behind your throne and on the skull on the shop counter. Click yes to flick both switches.  Then click on the wall near the Prinny (penguin) complaining about a draft.  This unlocks a secret room.  Read Etna's journal there each level and after you finish the game Etna mode will be unlocked.\n    10) Spoiler alert major - but again you'll be grateful.  To get the \"good\" ending you need to win without killing any ally during battle.  This sounds like a no-brainer but on item world you can have clones and warp - also item world can be very uneven leaving character hard to see and possibly vulnerable to your area attack spells.  However if you mess up you can just replay the game - which means that 75% of the game is a walk in the park for your high level characters.\n\n  The game is very repetitive but so is chess.  And chess doesn't allow you to use the \"Big Bang\" as a special attack.  Or have warrior penguins.  When this game next goes on sale it's definitely time for you to \"Turn Japanese\".\n\nS.x.", "timestamp_created": 1533630283, "timestamp_updated": 1535301481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472549676895141602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43965674": {"recommendationid": "43965674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051644681", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1077, "last_played": 1538476224}, "language": "english", "review": "I just gonna play this for a little I got job to do...play game...finally look at the clock wtf!?

As a long-time Disgaea fan experiencing the original in all its glory was something I couldn't pass up. \n\nLevel your characters from 1-9999 to achieve ultimate demon status and help Laharl become the most powerful overlord in existence. A gripping story just full of character, humour and wonderment. Your party is your own completely as you can customise and edit it to your hearts content re-incarnating characters into stronger versions of themselves or in some cases just fully creating a different character type with the old skills and magic from previous forms. The later levels and the item world are the true meta as even the enemies can reach Level 9999 and the geoblock puzzles on the floor add a whole new dimension to turn based strategy. \n\nGraphically there isn't much to say. It still has its original charm that still holds up as it's all animated and colourful (Considering its set in a demon world). It is a console port however this one feels right and very smooth. If you are a lover of Anime stylings or Turn based strategy then this game would be perfect. The only drawback for me is the tutorial stages at the start which seem to drag on even if you are a complete beginner. \n\n8/10 Stars.\n\n+ Good Remaster\n+ Very good console port with extra graphical settings.\n+ Humorous story.\n+ Prinnys (^.^) Dood!\n+ The pre-purchase came with Prinny TF2 items.\n\n- Hand holding tutorial.\n- Laharl is probably the least liked Disgaea main character.\n- Prinnys ...", "timestamp_created": 1530440649, "timestamp_updated": 1530440869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602533698081970215", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43132419": {"recommendationid": "43132419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063251252", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 7581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3261, "last_played": 1531529615}, "language": "english", "review": "help me please i can't stop playing.", "timestamp_created": 1530201265, "timestamp_updated": 1530201265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497270911931991577", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43110731": {"recommendationid": "43110731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075610339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16358, "last_played": 1667625871}, "language": "english", "review": "yea its alright", "timestamp_created": 1530133739, "timestamp_updated": 1530133739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46526685357093811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43024499": {"recommendationid": "43024499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137544216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1530305759}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1529899189, "timestamp_updated": 1529899189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455208480358123779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43009067": {"recommendationid": "43009067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110430911", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1535343606}, "language": "english", "review": "Disgaea is the best JRPG hands down.

At first the game will seem slow, it's okay, there is a big learning curve but once you pass that you will see your life disappear. I loved the level of depth this game has. You level up your characters, which can transcend over and over, then the items, weapons, armour, all have their own leveling system. I'm surprised I haven't heard of this earlier when it came out on ps2 originally. Good thing I didn't because younger me would have passed on this quick. The story is really the beginning of the game, that's where the game opens up. Should take about 40 to 50 hours to finish the story. I think I bought this on special for like $5 to $10, it's a must buy, if your into turn-based stratergy with a shi....a lot of rpg elements. The guides that people have made on steam will help you out a lot and set you on the right path and realise you're playing the game right. As you can see I got 216hrs out of Disgaea, which included getting all the achievements for it. I didn't even come close to maxing out one character. I would imagine that if you did you could probably add another 10ohrs, and if you're going to max out all characters............well good luck. I will definitely be purchasing more games in the series. I see Disgaea 5 came out, which is a direct sequel (so I'm told), so that will be next for me in the series.\n\nTL;DR: Buy it if you like turn based startergy with a lot (I mean a lot), of rpg elements.

Thus, while effort is put toward the \"main game\", everyone knows the real strengths are after you've gotten your first story ending.\n\nI don't have hundreds of hours with this game, but I am very familiar with the series, enough that I feel I can give a somewhat-accurate assessment of the first game.\n\nThat said...\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]-wise, this is the game that sets the standard for Disgaea. Despite small changes and additions, every single main Disgaea game after this one follows the same rules that this game outlines: up to 10 units on the same map at one time, physical attacks use ATK or HIT against DEF while magic uses INT against RES, evasion and accuracy are determined by HIT and SPD, and other factors need to be considered, such as positioning, Counter-attacks, and map Height.\n\nNoted changes from later games that are necessary to note:\n[list]\n[*]All Monster characters have 100% Aptitudes in all fields, with the only exceptions being Galactic Demons (with 150% DEF/RES), so no specializing, but no mechanical weaknesses (in theory).\n[*]Monster characters can only use Red weapons. Blue weapons don't exist.\n[*]Related to the above point, INT-based Monster classes are pretty much screwed, since almost every unique Monster ability is based on ATK (with few exceptions).\n[*]Fists use ATK only (like all other non-ranged weapons), rather than ATK/SPD mix, so stocking Ninjas with pure SPD makes them hard to hit, but they'll strike like a wet blanket. Guns use HIT, rather than HIT/SPD mix; they also have the same unlimited direction as Bows.\n[*]If you're running a Healer at any point, realize that all Heal spells are based on INT, not RES. Yes, that means Skulls/Mages make for better Healers than the actual Healers.\n[*]Monster classes are unlocked by killing each tier of the class, unlike later games, where tiers are unlocked via level. Also, Mana costs for Monster creation are obnoxiously high unless you've killed multiple units of said tiers (~30 on average).\n[*]Thieves are both useless and useful. For regular battles, they have completely garbage stats and aptitudes. That being said, they can throw up to 6 spaces, steal stats (although [spoiler]Thursday[/spoiler] can too), and have a maximum steal chance of 99%, so you can get R40s a lot easier.\n[*]Majin are basically OP in this game. Once you've got them, they're all you need, since 110% Aptitudes minimum and S rank weapon mastery speak for themselves.[/list]\n\n[b]Graphically[/b], this game actually has much different lighting and color-design than later games. It gives it a bit of a darker feel, alongside the slightly-more warped character design, and I quite like it. Otherwise, sprite detail is fairly high-quality, as is map variety.\n\nThis port of the game runs pretty well, I've found. It remains [b]stable[/b], although that's not very hard considering it's presentation. Very few framedrops, and it's not too memory-intensive.\n\n[b]Music[/b] is a nice high point; there's a lot of instantly-memorable melodies and catchy songs, plus [spoiler]Kurtis'[/spoiler] theme is just legendary.\n\nDisgaea 1's [b]story[/b] is probably the most well-known of all the main games, although I think that has more to do with the fact that it had an anime adaptation. Still, the number of branching endings allows for quite a lot of varied approaches to your run, and the game even allows you to replay the main game over and over again, if you want new ways of playing through certain scenarios. Also, these games are well-known as JRPG parodies, and the writing is suitably funny and mocking of said tropes.\n\nQuick note: [spoiler]If you want the good ending, try not to kill a single ally. That's sounds easy, but you'd be surprised how much damage you start dealing past 50, in addition to how easy it is to forget that friendly fire exists and that sprites are actually fairly small.[/spoiler]\n\nThis port to the PC also comes with [b]additional content[/b] that was only available in the various ports of this game, such as certain additional scenarios in the post-game. Basically, this is the full package if you're looking for added content. The artbook is also kind of nice, if you're into that.\n\nAlso: I've heard, from multiple reviews, that there are some problems regarding the game's ported controls and other related things. I've had no problems with controls, but I will say that mouse control is weirdly floaty as hell, hence I played using just keyboard with some re-binded keys. That's something to keep in mind, also, since some keys don't bind freely.\n\nTL;DR: This port is a perfectly playable, fully complete package that, although kinda clunky mechanics-wise (in my opinion, as a dude who came into Disgaea via 4), is a perfect starting point for anyone wanting to get into the Disgaea universe.\n\n[b]Scores for people who don't like reading:\nGameplay: 8/10[/b] It's a Strategy JRPG, with customizable characters, long-as-hell post-game, and a system that is simple and intuitive enough, with some minor flaws. It's a cornerstone of SRPGs for a reason.\n[b]Sound/Music: 8/10[/b] Music fits the situation, there's nothing ear-grating, and everything is, at the very least, pleasant to listen to.\n[b]Story: 7/10[/b] English or Japanese, some of the writing is generic, but hey, it's hilarious all the same.\n[b]Difficulty: 6/10[/b] There is nothing that can't be solved with an assload of grinding. Being the first game, though, the grinding is pretty slow, so some things might remain difficult for a while. This is especially true as the story winds down, since enemies start scaling both level- and damage-wise at an exponential rate. It's called \"Grinding: the Game\" for a reason.\n[b]Accessability: 7/10[/b] This game is very hit-or-miss on explaining some mechanics in certain ways (diagonal throwing, fusion, capturing, mastery), but everything is intuitive in some way.\n\n[b]Average: 7.2/10[/b] Do yourself a favor and play this game.

I do really like the style that was used to portray all the special moves and such though, it looks great.\n[*]The music isn't amazing, but after grinding for a while you start to appreciate it.\n[*]The story starts off slow and it's completely weird. For example, [spoiler]there is an entire chapter dedicated to preventing someone from spreading an embarrassing picture of the main character[/spoiler]. I really enjoyed it as it was a breeze of fresh air having a different storyline for once.\n[*]There is a lot of endgame content available after the storyline.\n\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The game is really innovative in the sense that it introduces a lot of systems that you probably never heard of. For example, you can level up items by \"entering\" them, you can lift characters to make a huge tower of characters and some of your allies that you can \"throw\" will actually explode (and therefore die), essentially turning them into a grenade. \n[*]There is a lot of grinding involved. You don't see that anymore nowadays as there are often pay2win or otherwise easily accessible ways to skip grinding, but this one very much so has the typical grind in which you repeat a level over and over again to raise some numbers. I can imagine people aren't going to like this because of that\n[*]The game is so [i]out there[/i] and totally insane sometimes, that I can imagine it scares people off.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Extra info[/h1]\nThere are some things I like to know when it comes to tactical RPGs, which you might like to know before you start playing as well: \n\n[list]\n[*]There is no permadeath\n[*](This one's obvious) you can go back to grind finished maps\n[*]In regards to losing characters along the storyline that you've spent a lot of time on only for them to dissapear from the game all of the sudden: [spoiler]you don't permanently lose any characters[/spoiler]\n[*]If you follow the storyline you will be around level [spoiler]100 to 150[/spoiler] when you finish the main story.\n[/list]\n\nTo me, this is one of the big staple games for tactical RPG lovers, next to greats such as Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics and maybe the more modern XCOM series. But you really require an open mind for some of it's weird systems. Don't pick this game up if it's your first tactics RPG, but definitely get it if you appreciate the genre.  \n\n[i]Was this review useful to you?

And even more pleased that it was possible to thank (financially) exactly the company that created the original game, and not someone who had absorbed this company.\n\nAt the present time, it is quite rare to meet developers that do not consider the first priority to be a big financial profit, and are not focused on multiplayer, e-sports and in-game transactions. Often they sacrifice the quality of the game itself, trying to release it on time, and often the publisher is at fault. But even in these difficult times, those who with great respect and love regard their games remain afloat, and do not go against the crowd.\n\nNot so often breaks into such reasoning)), because in most cases such a reaction occurs when you are overwhelmed by emotions after some events. But the game created by talented people - this is an event, great, bright and memorable.\n\nI sincerely wish the developers of financial prosperity, creative successes, and many new (and old :D) interesting projects.\n\nP.S. NISA was one of the publishers of Stella Glow (one of my favorite games), and I'm grateful to them for this, despite how sad it all ended.\n\nP.P.S.

This is the first of the series so a lot of mechanics from later games are missing. However, this game has arguably the best plot and cast of characters, only being rivaled by Disgaea 4. This game is very grind focused but most of that is post game. You can get through the main story with doing little to no grinding. This is a Disgaea game that I would recommend only playing through the main story and then stopping since after that it gets very grind based. The main story is still very long and will keep you entertained for a good 40 hours or so, so don't be worried about the cost, it's worth every penny. Disgaea 2 is also on steam so if you want better gameplay and less grinding go play that one although the plot isn't as good. Or better yet, play both, they're both amazing games. This franchise is criminally underrated and even better than other turn based JRPGs such as Fire Emblem in my opinion. If you like Fire Emblem you will love this.\n\nPlease bring Disgaea 3 and 4 to PC. I don't own a PS3 nor do I plan on buying one anytime soon.\n\n[i]It also comes with a few tf2 cosmetics so if you like tf2 get this.[/i]\n\nMy final score on the game:\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 10/10\nCharacters: 10/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\nOverall: 90/100 - A Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1520201307, "timestamp_updated": 1531571612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66441643238067627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40525979": {"recommendationid": "40525979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042243404", "num_games_owned": 718, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1066, "last_played": 1486248213}, "language": "english", "review": "Grinding, Grinding, and more Grinding!

So if you want a journey back in time, and find out what it was like to fight the controls of a game, instead of actually having them not be in the way, this game is for you.\n\nFor everyone that thought the Developer would have actually bothered to update the control scheme for their 2016 PC release.. think again. As it stands, i can't recommend the game, because the game actively gets in the way of the game itself.", "timestamp_created": 1514912194, "timestamp_updated": 1514912194, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443483889102935791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38919681": {"recommendationid": "38919681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089748633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 8231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5357, "last_played": 1583530535}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy entretenido,  recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1514767514, "timestamp_updated": 1514767514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38885517": {"recommendationid": "38885517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137492406", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2657, "last_played": 1521022567}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 will grind till my death", "timestamp_created": 1514687969, "timestamp_updated": 1514687969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38788768": {"recommendationid": "38788768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073421518", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1511360561}, "language": "english", "review": "Will buy all Disgaea because of this", "timestamp_created": 1514483726, "timestamp_updated": 1514483726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38784220": {"recommendationid": "38784220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041786243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 9081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5114, "last_played": 1545523215}, "language": "english", "review": "How to make the grinding mechanic in the right way.", "timestamp_created": 1514475842, "timestamp_updated": 1514475842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468963146209716797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38768712": {"recommendationid": "38768712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106983667", "num_games_owned": 646, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 716, "last_played": 1522562791}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Disgaea.

Whether or not its the definitive version comes down to your preference. I know I dont have much time logged in this but that's because I am waiting to get my GPD WIN to play it portable which is what I prefer for Disgaea. I played much of it back in the day on the PSP already and wish to revisit it soon. I am obviously a veteran of the series and I'm here to tell you what I love about it and why its so popular!\n\nPROS\n-The one version with all the content, updated graphics, menu and layout\n-Finally Disgaea comes to PC! Its a great series and now more people can experience it.\n-Has achievements and trading cards\n-Overall a really solid strategy RPG with endless fun\n-Even though mods aren't as plentiful for this title they are still out there if you know where to look.\n-It has great action and animations that are fun to watch.\n-The ultimate power fantasy game as you can basically infinitely level your units to godlike power.\n-The characters are great. They are really funny and comedic and the original Disgaea team from the first game is classic.\n-It seems complicated if you watch someone who is well into it play the game but from the start everything is actually very very easy to grasp. Even though its easy enough to understand there is so much you can do!\n-You can make and customize your own units from different classes and types. Set their gender, specialties, stats and abilities. Just about everything you could want is here. Supports, ninjas, swordsmen, knights, succubi, gunners, mages, archers, thieves, monsters, demons, angels, and the list goes on and on.\n-The item world, a randomized map you play by going into an item.  Each floor you clear upgrades the weapon or item. Its a great system that came from Disgaea!\n-Plenty of content!\n\nCONS\n-Not portable, I plan on remedying this however when I eventually get a GPD WIN and this is the perfect game for it. I think this series feels best on portable systems for some reason.\n-It used to have minor issues at launch date I believe at this point they have updated and fixed just about everything.\n-Can get a bit grindy at times, mostly only if you plan on getting all the extra post game stuff.\n-This is one game most people will not 100%. Its a completionists nightmare and you will likely not experience everything in it unless you have no life honesty.\n-Alot of anime tropes. I presonally don't mind but for some this will be a love it or hate it kind of thing.\n\nOverall its a fantastic game! I still think the series is best on portable but the fact they brought this to PC (and now we have Disgaea 5 on Switch) makes me really really happy! It has its flaws don't expect a perfect game that is for everybody. But for many this is a lot of fun!

Why not try it on PC with the huge sale it got. Is it good, is it bad? As I usually do I'm gonna start with the negative stuff, then move up from there.\n\nFirst and foremost, the controls. Keyboard and mouse controls are suicide-inducing. It took me less than an hour to tell them to f#ck off and plug the XBOX 360 controller. Way better. I will also say that there's some sort of problem with the mouse controls, at it doesn't seem to respond to some of the clicks for some reason.\n\nSecond, parts of the gameplay. Now you gotta understand something, this was the first game of the series, and after having beaten 2, 3 and 4 it shows. Some special attacks are redundant, healers are stupidly useless and will hardly level up (as you need to kill to get experience and healers suck at hurting), monster-type characters are kinda useless compared to humanoids, that kinda stuff. The biggest issue is that the Dark Assembly, the game's government, is just... Harsh. From the start of the game it'll take a few tries to get anything passed on it. The game is build so you just kill the ones that don't agree with you or bribe them, however early on it's nearly impossible to be successful at either. Thankfully most (if not all) of these problems got fixed in future games.\n\nAlso, the story has a few stale parts. Scenes that go for too long, mainly. It's not until the mid-game when the story starts to get more interesting. I will also say, the tutorial at the start of the game is forced. Shouldn't you be able to skip it? Sure you can skip it at New Game+, but I mean on your first playthrough. Sure it has some humor on it, but if you already know how to play it then it's just you hitting the A button over and over for a few minutes.\n\nLastly, the last episodes have a weird raise on enemy levels compared with the others, on which they raised them slowly so your characters could keep up. However in the last chapter enemies start around 50 or so and to the final battle you're suddenly batting against a 90 lvl final boss with a bunch of similar leveled enemies with him. Sure, the game expects you to grind at some moment, after all that's what the franchise was build on, the post-game cool stuff... But it's a raise of levels a bit too sudden and rushed.\n\nThat being said, the game is quite fun to play and offers a f#ck-truck of content for a really fair asking price on a sale.\n\nThe story, ignoring those scenes that last longer than they should, it's entertaining. Not too many characters, and most of them are well developed (Sadly other characters such as [spoiler]bosses you recluited or Kartus at the end[/spoiler] don't get too much of it). And the humor is actually alright, with the game ocasionally becoming self-aware and laughing it up along with yourself.\n\nThe game also has plenty of references and shout-outs that are fun when you actually notice them. Now sure, sequels become an INSANE OVERDOSE of references, but in this game is more tame.\n\nThe post-game stuff is is also great. Not only the game has plenty of endings and an extra story that's not really canon but it's fun to play, but the game also has plenty of stages and secret bosses after you're done with the main game. Though expect the grind, as the main story will end with you around level 80 or so and some of the secret bosses are around 1000. There's plenty of spots where grinding can become a breeze (specially during the story, incase you're having issues with a boss in particular), so don't worry too much.\n\nI also find like this game had some of the best characters, no wonder most of them appear in later games over and over. Laharl, Flonne, Etna, Mid-boss, they have better character development than the characters on the third game (which might I add, the third game had a stupidly short story). Sure there's not many choices when it comes to making your own characters as in the future games, but the story ones the game has are quite interesting and fun to keep up with.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yeah! If you don't mind turn-based strategy rpg games, then jump right in. But remember this: Disgaea 2 is better, as the devs learned from the first game and fixed the problems the game had. This game is good, you'll probably enjoy it, but I suggest you at some moment move to the sequel. It's better in almost every way.\n\nTL;DR Edition: It's a fun PS2 game which has a f#ckload of content, though the keyboard and mouse controls feel as horrible as you would expect. The sequel might be better, but you're still getting your money back on a really long game with plenty of content (and out-of-context sexual comments made by Laharl).", "timestamp_created": 1511693223, "timestamp_updated": 1511693223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37546049": {"recommendationid": "37546049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234351964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1530813514}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is unapologetically humorous and somewhat difficult.

The voice acting is still cringe-worthy, but the writing is epic. So with the only real two issues out of the way, let's get into why Disgaea is amazing.\n\nFirst off, Disgaea understands its audience intimately. People who played FFT and similar games loved the in-depth story arcs, the incredible customization, the complex tactical combat and having so much extra stuff to do that playthroughs which take over one hundred hours still allow for immense replay value anyway. Disgaea takes all of these concepts and expands upon them to absurd levels.\n\nSo, story-wise, the story itself is absurd, yet amazing. The specific dialogue is exceptionally self-aware and knows just how silly it is - for example, at one point the \"protagonists\" (honestly, it's more like you're playing the antagonists), are attacked by obvious power ranger wannabes... and then during the ranger's attempted stereotypical transformation sequence, they just get shot. With a gun. And then throw a fit because you're not allowed to do that during a heroic transformation sequence. The end-of-chapter previews are... useless for knowing what will happen in the next chapter as they usually have little to no relation whatsoever, yet are amusing as hell, so yay anyway.\n\nThe gameplay's amazing, with puzzles to solve in-combat, particularly within the item world sections. Being able to throw characters and objects allows for some surprisingly complex tasks and unique level design, and your choice of abilities and characters allows for a lot of customization in how you play.\n\nDisgaea's greatest strength, though, is its replay factor. It's a grindy game. That's the point. If you like these types of games, you generally also enjoy maxing out characters in a wide variety of tasks and classes, teaching them to be amazing at everything they do. The level cap is 9999, and you can even specialize weapons and armour, or even health potions if you want, by going into the item itself and battling your way through such to increase the stats or to defeat special hidden characters in the items which give bonuses and can be transferred to other items, allowing for rather ridiculous levels of customization and augmentation. It's a game that's fun to play, and it goes out of its way to give you excuses to drag the game on longer, such as a wealth of hidden bosses and extra story arcs to be unlocked well after the base game is beaten. Given how surprisingly long the base game is, and that much extra content being available, it's easy to spend literally hundreds of hours playing Disgaea.\n\nBasically the story is ridiculous and epic, the characters are interesting and well-defined in personality, the gameplay's great and it goes out of its way to make sure you have every excuse to keep playing. It's basically the perfect tactical RPG custom tailored to be exactly what that player base enjoys.\n\nThat you get to play as the villains is really just a bonus. =P", "timestamp_created": 1511565294, "timestamp_updated": 1511565294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685895085334777832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37428890": {"recommendationid": "37428890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107507281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 5503, "last_played": 1700761617}, "language": "english", "review": "Things to look for in this game, not in any order: Cute anime art, tight turn-based tactical gameplay, +1000hrs grind, cheesy japanese humour.

It allows you to create many party members (with a maximum amount allowed out on a mission) of many different classes, ranging from various humanoid classes like mages and fighters, as well as monster classes that you unlock the moment you defeat an enemy of that class.

The music is energetic and gets more somber and serious when it needs to, the voice acting is nothing horrible, and the sound effects give everything the impact it needs to fit how crazy this game gets. Do you want to go from a sword slash that attacks a couple of enemies to launching an enemy to the sky and beating the daylights out of them? If you like those crazy shenanigans, then Disgaea has got a lot more of that.\n\n[h1] Story and Characters [/h1]\n\nBeing rather abruptly woken up, prince Laharl of the Netherworld finds himself in chaos since apparently he had been poisoned and was asleep for two years with his dad passing away via chocking on a pretzel. Of course, everyone is fighting for the throne and Laharl fades away from the public mind, absolutely pissing him off. From there, his quest to secure the throne as the rightful takes off and antics ensue.\nThe story of Disgaea is simple, predictable, and bounces around from having some amount of focus to seeming like fanfiction. Disgaea's big problem with its focus is that it also tries to slap in some humor, but that ends up hurting the game's plot. Granted, when Disgaea gets its shoes on right, the writing isn't half bad. It is nothing life changing, but characters do develop and grow which does give the game's story some charm. The characters are all bombastic and all stand out from the loud and bombastic Laharl to the devious Etna, the way-to-innocent Flonne, and group of earth-defenders from space acting like super heroes from old cartoons featuring a robot named Thursday. However, if you must play a game with a serious story or can't stand a story that focuses on being fun and crazy, then you will struggle to enjoy Disgaea unless you end up greatly enjoying Disgaea's gameplay.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThis is the reason why you consider playing this game. Disgaea offers you a playground of tools, classes, items, and god knows what to make your gameplay something incredible. Outside of combat you can call the senate to raise and lower the prices of items, min/max the hell out of characters you make and bring them to level 9999 and then shoot them down to level 1 with better base stats to make them even more comically strong. Don't want to level characters to crazy lengths? Then why not dive into an item and explore it to level the item itself up. you can have your characters get into a T formation and juggle the enemy around and deal crazy amounts of damage. If you want to get somewhere on map, then you can get your units into a tower and have them toss each other all over the place. The only problem is that Disgaea can be rather difficult to get into. Thankfully there isn't a whole lot in this game compared to others in the franchise and you can grind if you ever need to. Disgaea gives you the tools you need to play how you can imagine and if you do struggle, Disgaea makes it incredibly easy to power-level to your hearts content.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nDisgaea is a rather tough recommendation since you will either have a blast with this game or struggle to enjoy it. If you are in the mood for a crazy time or just love being surrounded by numbers for you to manipulate to your hearts content, give Disgaea a shot. But there is no shame in refunding this or not picking it up again for some time since this is not a game for everyone.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511411735, "timestamp_updated": 1511411735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36919664": {"recommendationid": "36919664", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993487026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1494289566}, "language": "english", "review": "a very good game.", "timestamp_created": 1511408730, "timestamp_updated": 1511408730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36919150": {"recommendationid": "36919150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043550726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1188, "last_played": 1644674960}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Desde la versi\u00f2n de PS2 siempre me encanto!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1511408596, "timestamp_updated": 1511408596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36888975": {"recommendationid": "36888975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076014329", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1751, "last_played": 1511401053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Grinding Time", "timestamp_created": 1511401087, "timestamp_updated": 1511401087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36875728": {"recommendationid": "36875728", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965415470", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1558878194}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game. \nI have it on other systems with LOTS of hourz on it but i hvent gatten them on this yet.\n\nIt is a old popular turn-based masterpiece... idk what else to say.", "timestamp_created": 1511397942, "timestamp_updated": 1511397942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36870821": {"recommendationid": "36870821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117157592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1512991143}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this title.

Also, if you are a friend of endlessly tweaking stats and levels (be they character or weapon or equipment stats and levels), or planning complicated master-pupil character creation chains for optimal end results, this is the game you are looking for. If that isn't your thing, well, you can pretty much ignore all the nittygritty fiddling with the stats and just concentrate on the story.\n\nThough I have to say, there is nothing quite as satisfying as having your fine-tuned mage throw a kick <3ss spell that nearly wipes out all resistance from the field.

It gives so much options to the players to pick, choose, and apply them to the players playstyle. Not only the usual walk and whack system, it allows you to lift units (yes including enemies), combine and capture enemy, stealing their items, utilize map elements (that capable of insta killing units), and many more.\n\nStory wise, compared to disgaea 2, it does a good job in balancing the serious and comedic moments.  I find that the angel and demon dynamic/chemistry were handled well; however, Laharl power level was not really defined; making the story attempt in creating stake and danger seems misdirected. While we are at it, the most questionable part of the game is when they introduce what seems like a throwaway silly characters [spoiler](Gordon and crew)[/spoiler] and let them stay for more than a chapter. They also have a dramatic chapter dedicated for them, which I cannot care/take seriously because of their nature. In addition, that chapter had a quite high difficulty spike; resulting a bad experiance, grinding just to proceed to a story that I couldn't care about. In conclusion, it has a passable story; the weak near end section can be covered by the fun first-half of the story\n\nNext, other reviews mention/complain about the grinding; however, in my opinion you should grind as little as you can afford to for two reasons. First, there will always be a better method/better place to grind that simply renders the 5-10 levels that you just gained by grinding for 1 hour useless, because you can fnish a map in 5 minutes and gain the same result, or even better later on. Secondly, as mentioned earlier in this review; there are just many options that you can do to alleviate the need of grinding:\n- Fight with small party (1-3 units) and let them get more levels\n- Use ranged spell attacks to kill strong enemy (even if you have to cast it 20 times)\n- Use ailment to weaken/kill enemy\n- Steal enemy's equipment so that they do less damage and take more damage\n- Use disposable units as a bait/healer\n- Lure enemy, separate them, and gang them near the base panel\n- Have 1 character tank the damage, while others can pop up from base, attack, and then retreat\n- Let enemy waste their MP by constantly taking hits and heal\n- Throw enemy/ally to a disjointed side of map\n- Arrange geo panels to kill enemy\nI am sure I miss other viable strategies, but the point is that I did not grind much for most part of the main story section. Admittedly, the last few chapters require you to grind. (which if you grind enough to pass that chapter, you are good until the end of the game)\n\nOne last thing, endgame content are also worth mentioning. This is a game that, if you feel like it, you can play endlessly. There are multiple endings to pursue, secret stages to complete, ultimate weapon to get, overpowered/sily party to build,  secret stats and tid bit that you can learn and exploit. Just don't be afraid to read FAQS and you are good to go (else you'll waste a lot of time doing stuff inefficiently).\n\n\nEdit: Honorary mention to the PC port for adding keyboard shortcuts, mouse support (even if I did not use it), resizable windows, and general graphic improvements.", "timestamp_created": 1509618960, "timestamp_updated": 1510288627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772208869457244873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36196358": {"recommendationid": "36196358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089400971", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 652, "last_played": 1677486224}, "language": "english", "review": "This games is really awesome and super funny and dumb the mechanics are easy and the subcontent of the game is like its completed for thi genre of the game kinda difficult to udersstand the whole system of the game but it has a good story and it gets kinda hard sometimes so you dont always going to rush to the enemie and kill it they put traps or buffs for the enemies and you have to destroy them also i really want Disgaea 2 but good god i dont have enough money and i really really want it its my favorite one so far", "timestamp_created": 1509554452, "timestamp_updated": 1509554452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.321129143238067627", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36087404": {"recommendationid": "36087404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069810597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5723, "last_played": 1502602872}, "language": "english", "review": "Very repetitive.

So you could realistically keep playing this game for years and keep progressing your characters.\n\nThe story is pretty funny but I somewhat wish that the voice acting was a little better but overall it was pretty decent.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself it starts off sluggish and slow but the more your progress the more avenues you have open to you. For example, it probably took me around 25-30 in-game hours to hit level 100 for the first time.  When I respeced my MC it only took me an hour to reach that point again and being even stronger than previusly and learned a new move when I hit level 100 as well. So you definitely have the option to keep leveling your characters and it should not take forever after you play through the story and unlock some of the better levels.\n\nThe assembly can be a pain as each character has seperate senators and it took a very long time just to get one of mine to have a good standing with all of them to pass the things that I wanted.\n\nAs for the cast there is a very diverse amount of characters that you can use and you can seriously vary your team compositions to your liking. Want to have a squad full of ninjas? Well go for it, nothing is stopping you other than having to fight the class once and unlocking it for creation. And if you save up enough mana to make the character a genius it'sthat much easier to level them and they are that much more powerful as well.\n\nThe concept of the item world was really interesting and very difficult. One thing that you will have to learn is how to use the difficulty setting and when to turn it up or down. Usually when you are doing the item world you want the lowest setting possible so you can get to the lowest floors. Some items are better than others because they have more floors so the more you level them the more powerful the item becomes. You can also move and combine specialists making items even stronger.\n\nThe visuals are nice for a handheld game (which is what you should expect since this is a port of a handheld game) and while they may eventually get boring you do have the option to turn them off and on to your leisure which is a major plus in cutting down grinding.\n\nOverall I'd give this game an 8/10 and if you are into turn based RPGs then this is one of the best ones out there so give it a shot and see if you like the game for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1503008695, "timestamp_updated": 1503008695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396541029214859009", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34130716": {"recommendationid": "34130716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121521491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 17433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14461, "last_played": 1683685342}, "language": "english", "review": "top 10 reasons why this game = good:\n1: story good, very nice\n2: etna is funny\n3: only disgaea with backstory in it's story which is just like, double story (so cool)\n4: flonne can learn magic and be magic monster (flonne moment)\n5: takes least time to complete, compact time!\n6: majins are strong, later games they are bad, how the mighty have fallen\n7: classic and cool classic sprites! not bad and stinky like d1 complete\n8: pleinair at the start of the game, huge rabbit power\n9: baal is so weak you can beat him with lv1 (omg!!!)\n10: i like item world i think its rng can bring me the most gamer moments in the disgaea games", "timestamp_created": 1502304175, "timestamp_updated": 1687131330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34073135": {"recommendationid": "34073135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010800610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1483, "last_played": 1678569241}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a great sense of humor and overall addicting play style. \n\nThe story is secondary to that of FF tactics but as it doesn't take itself as seriously it is more fun to play.

I find it pretty funny how a lot of people are getting upset about this when my review isn't even really negative. Steam reviews aren't \"reviews\". I'm not a reviewer, I'm a simple gamer with preferences. Steam asked me if I would \"recommend this game\" to people, and for me and others who share my opinion in how this game plays, I do not recommend it.\n\nThis negative review is to help others who find the EXP system just as much annoying as I do to the point that they cannot enjoy playing the game. I even make the point that if you don't mind that, then go ahead, and get the game.\n\nFrom what I remember playing, I did the first couple of story missions, and one of my characters were level 6 or something while the others were only 3 or 4, and we were up against level 6 and 7 enemies. This put me off the game due to the feeling of needing to go back and grind the last couple of missions and muck around making sure each person who needs to level gets the last hit to get the EXP. This in my opinion is tedious and boring, thus I am unable to recommend it. The story wasn't even THAT great, which didn't help give me the motivation to bother to continue to force myself to grind.\n\nI'm not sorry if that hurts your butt hearing this opinion. Now kindly stop commenting on this review. You do not need to defend this game to someone who does not like its core gameplay levelling system and finds it boring. In fact, don't you have something better to do than browse through the negative reviews of a game you clearly like? Like playing it perhaps? Or write a positive helpful review saying why you like it.\n\nYou make the fanbase look like jerks. -_-\n\nTL;DR:\nI do not like the levelling system because it requires you to mess around and cherry pick which character gets the last hit and gains EXP. Replaying the same stage several times for each character became very boring and tedious to me. If you think you would feel the same, do not buy it.\n\nIf you don't think you would mind that, buy it if you want a funny, whacky story.\n\n\nORIGINAL COMMENT:\nPersonally for me, I can't recommend this game because I didn't enjoy how the game is strongly built around grinding and RNG, which I find tedious and boring. I can handle some grinding, but not when you have to level each character individually and worry about who lands the last hit in order for them to get the EXP.\n\nI can however, understand how people who don't mind those things would enjoy this game, since it seems to have a funny and interesting story, and the game mechanics do go pretty deep.\n\nBut this is just not my type of game. Which I regret since I really was into the story, but I just couldn't bring myself to continue playing, which is definitely a shame.", "timestamp_created": 1495378000, "timestamp_updated": 1507421870, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417262852191925049", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31813570": {"recommendationid": "31813570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367296790", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 562, "last_played": 1586627520}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It's a JRPG and for most of the people, who have played JRPGs, the concept of this game is probably very obvious. For those who are here, because of the holy and sacred Anime Weekend (i love u steam); it's a turn-based, strategy game, where positioning is key. I really like these kind of games and I don't wanna go too much in to it, cause I would start fan boying really hard. Only one more thing about the gameplay: prepare to spend hours of grinding. In fact, the real game starts with the grinding, so if you have no patient your should consider another game, that's not Disgaea. Still it's very fun and for me at least it never got repetetive, though I can understand if that's the case for other people.\n\nI'll try and make this part quick, but It won't work.\nI absolutly adore the story and all of the characters you meet in the game. I don't wanna talk about depth or some BS like that, but they do got a story and you'll get to love at least one or two of them. To tease you a little, the protagonist trio consists of; Laharl, Prince of the Netherworld, a very strong demon, who's not unhappy about the recent death of his father. He hate's love and friendships and would like to rule over pretty much everything. Oh, and he's a bit of a complacent teenager. As number two we have his loyal servant; the all-mighty beauty queen Etna, who likes to do sexy poses without a body to back it up. I didn't steal that joke. So she's a demon, not much to say about that, because I don't wanna spoil anything. My favourite character, probably in video game history, is the third protagonist; Flonne. She's an angel trainee send to \"assassinate the Overlord\". Unfittingly, she apologizes as she punches Laharl into the face ( one of the two times she ever uses her fists in this story). Her heads full of flowers and you could confuse her with a Sailor Moon character.\n\nNow, that I didn't keep that part short, the game has multiple endings, so if you're into that, have fun. Also the game doesn't take itself too serious and you shouldn't confuse it with a child's game, because it rerally isn't.\n\nIf you made it through this review, I apologize if it wasn't as helpful as me or you would have liked it to be; again it's my first one. I'd be very happy for any tips or advices on my profile for future reviews, because I plan on doing some more.\nNow go buy the game and have a great time, dood!", "timestamp_created": 1491397223, "timestamp_updated": 1491397223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30956232": {"recommendationid": "30956232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057241071", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1270, "last_played": 1529590136}, "language": "english", "review": "dis dood is toots on the hottest of fires", "timestamp_created": 1491374966, "timestamp_updated": 1491374966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30933473": {"recommendationid": "30933473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134103865", "num_games_owned": 840, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1506209001}, "language": "english", "review": "The game dosent start when i try and play it. and it happened after the couple of hours i played so now i cant get a refund eather.", "timestamp_created": 1491266638, "timestamp_updated": 1491266638, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463414639234542847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30925947": {"recommendationid": "30925947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027405863", "num_games_owned": 807, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1645652150}, "language": "english", "review": "Now, there are, to date, four different versions of Disgaea, from the PS2 version, to the PSP version, to the Nintendo DS version, then we have the PC version.\nThe first difference happens in the first minute, where you're told a 'new ally' has joined you, and find Pleinair already in your party before you've even done a single fight, never mind how it was on DS, where she could be encouraged to join you by finding an option that is apparently blank.\nThe next difference is graphically, where you are able to use an interface similar to how the more modern games interpret the Disgaea 1 interface, plus a slightly enhanced set of sprites.\n\nNow, I won't say that the game is perfect, but it is the definitive version.

This game is grindy. This is the grindiest grindfest I have ever grinded and in this game grinding isn't a by-product of difficulty or a way to make money via exp boost micro-transactions no no, in this game grinding is  a mechanic in itself and that just annoys the hell out of me. If you want to get the most out of this game, prepare for a lot of grinding.\n\nWith that being said though the game is great. It's an old game so visually it's not going to be the best but that doesn't mean the visuals are off putting. I don't have a problem with them at all. \n\nDisgaea is a very unique feeling tactical RPG with many mechanics to learn. From team attacks to the grid-based geo panel effects there's a lot you need to learn in order to master the combat to not only come out on top, but end each fight earning the best loot you can. Speaking of loot, there is a lot of it.\n\nStory wise the game doesn't take itself too seriously. It's full of humour and the characters are just as ridiculous. I really love the writing here, no negatives from me in terms of the story and the humour.\n\nOne negative would be that fullscreen just doesn't work, like at all. Even with fullscreen set in the options I'm still forced to play in a bordered window. It's really annoying to a certain degree but as you go on you learn to look past it.\n\nThis is the sort of game that I recComend NOT playing constantly. A few hours each day maybe to keep it fresh otherwise you most certainly will get tired of it because the grinding is tedious. Still, even without grinding there is plenty to do so you'll likely get a lot of hours out of this title.

That probably had more to do with my age and environment than anything, but... actually, I should start from the beginning.\n\nDisgaea is a strategy-rpg from an era in which the market wasn't flooded with them. It was originally on the PS2 console, standing out among very few other titles of its time as a \"niche\" genre, and it came with a story that satirized anime and RPGs in general. You play as Prince Laharl, heir to the throne of The Netherworld who has just awakened from a two-year nap to find out that his father is dead and any of the vassals who aren't completely lazy have just up and split without a word. It is a story of betrayal, rampant theft of lesser demons' fortunes, mockery and defamation, and all the other fun stuff a childish cartoon character can get away with.\n\nIt is also a story partially told in an annoying high-pitched voice or three, which is one of the things that got me to never watch very much anime. I do love a good spoof movie though, and Disgaea fleshes out its characters a bit more than what I've come to expect from video games. But that might just be because video games since Disgaea's publishing just don't have a protagonist that isn't a blank slate very often.\n\nThere are countless ways to achieve an objective in a given battle. You might want to just murderize everything as quickly as possible, or chain up combos for bonus points, or destroy the coloured terrain for bonus points / damage potential, or just move on to the next floor without another thought. In Disgaea, you have *options.* Swords are the game-favoured option because this is an RPG, but axes get some much-needed love as well. But, with all the good things Disgaea has to offer, there are just as many things to make me hate it.\n\nThe repetition is painful. You're going to hear the same voice-clips every time a character attacks or uses a skill. When you use a skill, you're going to see the same lengthy animation that might cause slowdown depending on the particle effects. And then, just to make things as over-the-top and nonsensical as the story, the grind from one level to the next is obscene. \n\nAs a player, you are generally expected to be able to field ten units to a battle. But, you start under-equipped and the amount of kills needed to recruit units that aren't garbage-tier to fill party vacancies borders on ridiculous. And as your units get stronger, they unlock new character classes (which must also start at first level). And as you progress through the story, your party will need fresh (expensive) equipment upgrades. \n\nConstantly. \n\nAs entertaining as the story is (and it gets a few genuine chuckles here and there), the story grinds to a halt every now and then because your party needs to catch up to the new enemies in terms of power. \n\nAnd is it a decade after I first played this that I realize that this was the prototype model for \"casual gaming.\" Sure, you might think you're hardcore because you've sunk in enough time to defeat the secret bosses and collect all the achievements, but at its core Disgaea is a game meant to be played casually. Battles only take a few minutes to get through, and you can save and heal up after each one. The story ties everything together to legitimize the game itself, but progressing through the story requires time spent slogging through maps you've already cleared for EXP. It's unnecessarily padded out, and even then it's more than plausible to finish the game at lvl 100. The secret content requires characters with several thousand levels under their belt though.\n\nIn the Steam version, you get Pleinair as soon as you start the game. She comes with a decent accessory and a weapon that costs roughly 2,000 (currency), and has a boost to her HIT and SPD stats that will make people who play the game drool. Also, bunny-bombs. Neat little addition.\n\nAlso, Etna has a new voice! Just in case Flonne's squealing wasn't annoying enough, now you have a pre-teen trying to be an edgy demon-girl instead of an actor who understood subtlety... but maybe subtlety didn't fit the theme of Disgaea? Somehow the Japanese voice-acting is less screechy, but I've yet to reach The Humans on this version.  \n\nEtna's story mode is also interesting, but the grind is not only worse but punctuated by starting at first level with only a few prinnies as backup. The story is shorter but the level advancement covers a much broader gap. \n\nAnd then, just to screw with anyone who might want a go for nostalgia's sake, they took out that silly J-rock track that played in the original's fight with Maderas. I know it was a cheesy track, but it was good cheese. \n\nBut nostalgia's bad for you. Sometimes you gotta learn that lesson the hard way.\n\n<Vee's Rating> Kung Fu Foxy With Big Boobs solves all your problems in-game but reminds you of why you wear clothes that don't draw attention to your chest every time you go out in public!", "timestamp_created": 1483177406, "timestamp_updated": 1483177432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476182848215103149", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28844370": {"recommendationid": "28844370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051022013", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1518138865}, "language": "english", "review": "Same game I remember from childhood.

Your goal is to defeat every single enemy unit on it and win. Pretty straightforward, but also pretty damn fun! Moving through story you will unlock better equipment, and new character classes to join your party, both common and unique. It needs to be said that there is really ALOT of characters in this game, and to unlock some of them you'll really need to break some sweat.\n\nStory:\nThe game's story is self-aware, not too deep and not too serious, which is nice.\nThe premise is as follows: You are Laharl, the only son of ruler of the Netherworld. You've been asleep for two years, which sounds like a dream for some of us, but when you wake up first things you find out are:\n1. Your father has passed away some time ago\n2. His former vassals are now fighting over the throne\nSo your goal is to defeat everybody, reclaim the throne and become the next lord of  Netherworld.\n\nAs you probably know, Disgaea was originally developed for the consoles.

It has been ported a few times before to the ds and psp and i have played every version of this game that has come out. While initially this port needed a bit of work they got everything patched and i can say this is a very well done port it includes everything from previous ports and adds more. I wont spoil everything but there is more end game content and a bit early as well. The controls are ok for KBM but can all be changed to your liking. Control support is great as everything again can be remapped and ther game recognizes your controller and adds the actual button pictures in the game (ie. like at dialog instead of an arrow or a button 1 it has a picture of the A or X button) This port also allows you to choose the cursors and item portraits you want out of the game series as a whole which is very nice. \nPort 10/10\n\nDisgaea is your tile turn based rpg with plenty of levels and items. The story is much more humorous then serious in any way as you gather a rag tag team of many races and personalities on your way to become the overlord of the netherland. It is mildly difficulty  but that can be changed with how much you level grind. It is possible to play this game through with a horde of characters, a few select, or even just a single charcter you overlevel a bit making it possible to play to your preferance. Its a bit lacking in strategy in the main story play as the main strategic point in the game (geos) are quite one dimensional. They do make up for that a bit by having a randomly generated dungeon you can go into whenever that has plenty of depth of strategy whether you get to the end using a geo combo to kill everyone or just make it to the portal down (you can also just brute force kill everyone).  There is full voice acting in both english and japanese and its all well done and translated well. My main problems with this game are the lack of a large amount of strategic depth, the amount of level grinding, and the lack of much end game content.  Overall though the game is very fun and quite good 9/10\n\nThe end game content is different endings you can achieve a second story that plays the game in a different perspective and one specific ending is level grinding through the levels and unlockable maps which takes a long time.\n\nAvoid this game if you dislike level grinding, tile turn based rpgs (duh) or want a game that you can play for +100 hours as even though i enjoy this game a lot and have played all versions id say i have about 120 hours worth of play time over 10 years or so.", "timestamp_created": 1481653547, "timestamp_updated": 1481653547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514787435531616211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28336897": {"recommendationid": "28336897", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963357019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8690, "last_played": 1543004021}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, wish they would have added better camera angles porting it to PC.

Lift a character who is already holding another character!\n [*]Story balances humor with character development well, and has multiple endings.\n [*]Originally being a PS2 game, Gamepad support is on point. Have not personally tested, but have heard good things about mouse control as well.\n [*]Replayable levels allow you to grind your level if you are so inclined, but minimal grinding is necessary to simply complete the main story.\n [*]Skills are clearly labelled with effective height differences, so if you don't hit every enemy you expected, you have only yourself to blame.\n [*]Don't like how you positioned your character? Want to cheat to get extra Combo Attacks? If you haven't taken an Action, cancel your character's movement and go again.\n [*]Teach any character magic using the mentor system.\n[/list]  \n\nCons:[list]\n [*]Characters only gain xp from killing creatures, or from the bonus gauge, making levelling support characters, such as healers, difficult.\n [*]Skills can be vague about their stat dependency. You can't always tell whether a skill uses  ATK, INT, or even HIT.\n [*]There are exceedingly few monster weapons which increase INT, greatly decreasing the effectiveness of caster-type monsters.\n [*]Delivery of voice lines is often off, especially in the English dub.\n [*]Default graphic options may not be the best; tweak to your liking.\n[/list]\n\nOverall: Takes a place in my Favorite Games of All Time.

When I do - and I'm sure eventually I will as I do enjoy it - I'll probably redo this review. But for the time being it has left me with an impression.\n\n I won't spoil anything in detail.\n\n[h1]My look into Disgaea[/h1]\n\nYou basically take control of a trio of protagonists in this game. Laharl (prince of the underworld), Etna (one of the prince's demon vassals), and Flonne (an angel). The basic jist of the story is Laharl spends his time in the game exerting how awesome he is by winning fights - which is pretty accurate to how the player themself probably feels as well. The other two protagonists mostly spend their time trying to bring about a softer side to the prince. There are a ton of plot holes throughout the game's story but I don't feel they matter since the game never tries to take itself seriously. It's always cute, silly, or badass. Things as random as having to fight the Power Rangers takes place in this game after all. It's never really [i]serious[/i] - at least not as far as I've gotten.\n\nThe designs of the characters are adorable and cute. I absolutely love them! Not just the protagonists' designs - though those as well. Every class character in this game has a nice bit of style to them. They feel slightly demonic, a bit cute and/or sexy (the humanlike ones anyway), and they're all unique enough to see elsewhere and tell instantly [i]\"that's from Disgaea\"[/i]. I was even excited to see Prinny hats come out in TF2 (which incidently became my latest favorite hat in [i]that[/i] game).\n\nThe gameplay is good. Turn-based strategy is something I have a fondness for when I feel like a relaxing type of game. I found that having the ability to build a team adds a lot to how much I actually care about my team. Having so many ways to arm the team and work them up to little beefcakes. Then breaking them out for moments you were unable to best previously. It makes you think of various strategies while also just looking for ways to strengthen current ones with better gear.\n\nThe voice acting is hit and miss. I hardly ever feel any of the characters are talking like they'd talk in real life yet I also don't feel epic moments or sincere moments through the voice acting - like something you'd hear Ash Ketchum or Goku say. It just feels like acting. This could partially be due to the formula of the cutscenes though; characters react to each other much later than they would in a video or in real life due to having to wait on the text boxes to catch up before it goes to the next line. When a character is interrupted by another character it feels especially jarring since one character just cuts off in the middle of what they're saying and then the other character starts talking about 2 seconds later. At moments it has honestly made me cringe. I tend to turn my sound down or wear headphones when I get to a cutscene for the slight embarassment of others hearing this game's dialouge.\n\n[h1]Pet Peeves[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]This is just a pet peeve but theives in this game need to use an item to attempt to steal from enemies. This mechanic might be to keep you from stealing everything of value. But the theft chances are so low that the reality - at least for me - was never managing to obtain one-of-a-kind items. I'd make a go for the items bosses had but I'd never actually get anything since theives die easy and they only get as many chances as \"stealing hands\" (the item they use to steal) they bring. I don't really like this requirement.\n\n[*]The shops feel pointless. The consumable items as well as the equipable weapons and accessories are so worthlessly low grade even a fresh character wouldn't need to use them. You can raise a shop's usefulness by buying from it but when there's nothing to buy - nothing [i]worth[/i] buying rather - it leaves this feeling like grinding. Buying useless junk just so you can sell it back for crap price over, and over, and over.\n\n[*]The difficulty of this game dwells close to unfair at times. In some cases even literally impossible in the item world (protip: Never go into the item world unless you have a Gency's Exit. Otherwise you'll eventually be stuck. But if you [i]do[/i] have it then you can just exit and come back and get a new map). That's not to say I don't enjoy some challenge, but it's ridiculous sometimes - such as filling the [u]entire map[/u] with \"Enemy Boost x 3\" tiles - effectively making a pack of level 30 enemies for all intents and purposes level 90. A lot of the losses feel cheap and decided before the actual fight even begins based on the map tiles. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAs cheesy as the story is, as bad as the voice acting may be, and even as unfair as some of the situations in the game can be it's truely a charming game. I can totally understand why there's a following for this. If I'm honest the cheesiness of the story even appeals to me. I quite like my character being a badass badguy that's coming around to being a goodguy. \n\nI absorbed myself in the team building; attempting to make at least one of everything. Even now I'm longing for stronger monsters to beat a level I've been stuck on.\nThis game feels like a good staple for overhead strategy. It has things I like about it. It also has things I dislike about it. Most of the things I dislike are temporary though - such as a badly voiced line, or a cheap stage stacked against me. I thoroughly enjoy playing the game when I'm in the mood for a game that doesn't rush me.", "timestamp_created": 1478109146, "timestamp_updated": 1478109146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66336214542388916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26351442": {"recommendationid": "26351442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046708374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 28942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8576, "last_played": 1561754893}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a lot of fun, but don't forget to keep track of time. \"Just another 10 levels in item world\"...

That is not the point with this version. The first time I started it up it crashed to desktop instantly. I thought \"Well it happens sometimes, I will just restart it.\" So I did and it worked fine, I was able to set up the options I wanted in the options menu and away I went. The first chapter went by pretty fast, and the game with everything set to it's highest settings allowed ran like a dream. It was great! I decided that it was time to take a break for the night, I could return tomorrow. So the next day rolls around and I start the game up again, it immediately crashes. I restart it figuring it would be like the night before and the game just keeps crashing and crashing. I looked up many of the solutions and tried out all of them, and with the help of Pretty Prinny was finally able to get the game running again. Once again I am happy, and get to play through the second chapter of the game. I come up to the part where you need to get a level 10 item to advance. That means having to delve into the item world and subdue the masters and level up your items. About halfway through the first dungeon the game crashes once again. I am a bit annoyed, but decide it might have just been a one time thing. I go back to the game and proceed to do item world once again and this time not even into the second floor of the item the game crashes. At this point I am pretty frustrated. While crashes in the main storyline aren't too bad, in the item world it can be really bad considering you cannot save during the process. (There is an item you can get which lets you teleport out but I am sure it is limited and you have to purchase more from what I remember from the other versions.)\n\nSo here I find myself writing this review, at the current time this game is really not worth it at all conidering how many problems I have had with it. It maybe an isolated case, but upon reading other peoples reviews and forum posts this game does crash quite a bit.

Yep pretty absurd like that and it sums up the story pretty well! All the npc are likewise interesting and crazy!\n\n- Anyway, the game is about your team of 10 peeps at a time on a map defeating the enemy. You can have a lot more than 10 toons in your army, but only 10 can fight at the same time. You can switch to another toon if you want by switching out one of the active one on the map. The fight is all about positioning yourself at the right place and also protecting yourself from the enemy who will try to gang up on one of your toon if you let it.\n- You can raise your level to 9999+. Yeah thats a loooooot of lvl!\n- You can eventually do millions in damage. In fact, damage becomes rediculus pretty fast!\n- You can increase the level and stats of all items including weapons and accessories. Even one-use items that restore your skill points can be increased by doing the maps in the item world. Yes, there are random maps in each item with special npc that you can beat and then transfer to other items to improve their stats even more! This concept is pretty awesome!!!\n- You can decide to rebirth any of your character into another class! They start back at lvl 1 but keep a lot of their stats and all their skills from the original class. So you could have a mage that becomes a ninja or a fighter with lots of evade or hp. Imagine a lvl 1000 character that restart at lvl 1 with genius rebirth (keep 95% of his original stats). Then he can regain stats from his new class pretty fast! \n- You got a dark council of senators (much like USA congress) that you need to bribe and/or subdue so that they vote your way in many ordinances.

So when I first heard about this game a few years ago, I picked it up and played it on my (now destroyed \n[b]( \u0ca5_\u0ca5)[/b]) PSP. When I heard about this game coming to PC [b]dood[/b], I really wanted to play it (and finish it)\n\n\n[h1] What I like: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Character designs, they're memorable, unique and overall just plain awesome\n[*]Dialogue, funny and well-written, sometimes even breaking the 4th wall. Even NPCs have their own personallity, albeit [i] kinda generic [/i]\n[*]Voice acting, well done to both the Japanese [b]and[/b] English voice actors. I'm not much of an English dub guy [b]\u256e(. \u275b \u1d17 \u275b.)\u256d[/b] but even I think they did a great job making the characters feel natural, I'd say they're way better than most anime dubs. (Real talk tho, Nippon Ichi, we [b]NEED[/b] a full-fledged visual novel)\n[*]Soundtrack, fitting and memorable\n[*]Spritework, every weapon is different in battle, thats the amount of detail they put into sprites\n[*]Finally onto gameplay, it's a Tactical RPG. I don't wanna bore you by explaining every nook and cranny of the mechanics, so here's a quick rundown: \n*Takes a [b]DEEEEEP[/b] breath*\n[olist]\n[*]You take turns strategizing and executing attacks\n[*]Taking the high ground and attacking from the side/back deals way more damage\n[*]Placing characters next to each other allows for heavy-hitting combos\n[*]([i]Near[/i]) Limitless upgrading for weapons, characters and skills (Lv9999, seriously [b]\u2510(\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u2510) \u266a[/b])\n[*]Geo Symbols, [b]OMG[/b] these things are insane, they're basically stat altering objects on the map, destroying them changes the color of the tiles and if a Geo Symbol is on a color-changed tile, it gets destroyed and changes the color, causing a chain reac- wow that was way too long, \n[b]tl;dr[/b] they're a mini puzzle, if completely solved it gives off a [h1][b] GIANT, SATISFYING EXPLOSION [/b][/h1] (that deals damage)\n[*]Character aptitude, new cycles, transmigration, throwing, weapon masteries, blahblahblah~~~\n[/olist]\n*Faints from hyperventilation [b]( X ,x)[/b]*\n*10 mins later* Wait, we're not done yet? Crap\n[*]Decent story (shh, I'm only on chapter 7)\n[*]Dark Assembly (AKA character creation), they have a wide array of ([i]literally[/i]) colorful characters/classes for you to create and use (+You get to give em names [b](\uff65\u03c9<)\u2606[/b], I gave all of mine anime/video game character names)\n[*]Going to the hospital... isn't free, but they do give you prizes for visiting them often, and the items they give are gooood\n[*][b]dood[/b]\n[*]Lastly, with the new update, [b]Plenair[/b] (and more) is finally a usable character, I love her design and concept of being a mascot character (I heard she's also really good to get early game, so yeah) [b]o( >\u03c9<)o[/b]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What I dislike:[/h1] (Note: I'm still REALLY early into the game, don't take these [b]opinions[/b] too seriously. Also, don't judge me for being noob at RPGs [b](\u15d2\u15e3\u15d5)\u055e[/b])\n[list]\n[*][i]Grinding[/i], it's not that tedious honestly, I just suck at grinding.

[b]\u03a3(\uffe3A\uffe3 )[/b]\n...Call me bias, but... I can't really see any flaws with this game (I even went through other reviews of this game to see if people have any complaints, but they're all positive).

Disgaea is a short game in story but not post game with it's sequel coming out in december being the overall upgrade. A better main character a more developed story, way way way better music (Just look up Visual Sensation or white tiger), and FAR better mechanics and combat system. But overall disgaea 1 is once again Disgaea's Phantom blood a strong start that becomes better and better with every game.\n And the last thing to mention is a tip the character Plenair is super OP as a character who uses Guns easy to get even when you fight the boss known as \"Vyers\" or \"Mid boss\" lose to hit you start the game over but don't worry it's just the first 5 levels you get plenair by talking to her after restarting a new cycle or losing to Vyers in this case. talk to plennair and select the blank space and she joins your party. plenair can solo them plus shes easy to level up buying some health resoration items plenair can solo the Pormotion exam to a easy level 4 thus awarding your failure with a really too good key to sucess.

It has a simple Manga cut shots with some silly humor. You basically play out of a central hub, managing equipment, creating massive classes of parties from archers to ghosts in an isometric gameboard similar to Fantasy Tactics. Your players gain abilities as they move up. What is great about Disgaea unlike other games is its board puzzle solving geo symbols with added abilities, combination attacks and massive multiple player battles. As master of the underworld you will try to convince the Dark Assembly to help your cause and levels can go to massive heights. It has beautifully drawn re-occuring characters and prinnies. It first came out way back on the PS2 and has already 5 sequels\nPROS\nA: Solid Combat System\nB: Great Cross Job and equipment features and wonderful characters to make. Called all mine by superheroes-Hawkeye, Punisher haha\nC: Great Lovable characters for all ages but see the parental ratings\nD: You will stall in going straight thru the stories just to build up your characters forever.\nE: PSP and XBOX PC controller friendly.

I gave it a chance. But I can't recommend this.\n\nDisgaea 1 is an extremely grindy SRPG. Anytime you create a new character, he or she is level 1. You need to either grind levels you've already beaten or grind item world in order to make them stronger, or else they won't be fit for upcoming missions. Added to this, item world itself is both a requirement to continue the game at a certain point and also an unfair grindy mess in its own right. There comes a point in the game's story where you aren't allowed to continue unless you have a level 10 weapon. In order to level up weapons, you need to go through 10 floors of item world, which is a world inside any and all items in the game that has 10 floors of randomly generated maps of enemies to fight. You have to clear floors of these in order to level up your weapon. If things get too difficult, you can just move from one map to the next via a floor tile that's placed in a random spot on the map. The problem is is that each floor you go through has progressively harder enemies; even high leveled well equipped units can fall once you get to a certain point. The enemies increase in difficulty very quickly, and if your party starts wearing down, the only way to truly escape the dungeon is to use an item called \"Mr. Gency's Exit\", which frustratingly enough, can only be obtained after clearing 10 floors in item world. Add this to the annoying tedium that are geo crystals, random crystals found on maps that change the stats of units on certain tiles, and the whole thing becomes exceedingly annoying.\n\nOutside of this, the plot itself is silly and ridiculous, and as a result its difficult to find the characters in this game relatable. The game is full of slapstick humor and dark humor involving characters making fun of each other or torturing prinnies and so on. None of the characters act as you would expect a real person to. It detaches them from reality in a way. I realize most of the characters in this game are demons, so its not expected of them to act like normal humans, but it just makes it harder to think much of them. That said, I do think there's some appeal to the humor and a likable character or two. Etna in particular is what pushed me to continue playing this game really; she's a sexy self-serving demon that, while strong, lacks the attitude of her friend (and the main character), Laharl. But a character cannot save a game, and I just could not enjoy this game. It doesn't help that the graphics are a bit dated and the music is boring and repetitive.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun SRPG from NIS, I would suggest you look towards Phantom Brave PC rather than this. It has a better PC port anyways. Or perhaps wait for later Disgaea games to get ported, as I hear the series improved with later entries.

While I'm not that yet far here is how things went;\n\n-Oh look Disgaea, one of the most boring RPG for its grinding is on the PC.  I remember how boring it was and the amount of grinding I had to do. \n-Its on the Steam summer sale... Still not buying it.\n-Bored, give it a go, I'll just get a refund before thetime is up for it.\n-Oh nothings change, bored, dull... Grinding, gringing is boring.\n-Oh... Where did the time go.  Whoops.\n\nSo disgaea in one of the most OTT RPG and in-depth games ever made.  You can pretty much make godly characters.  There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to play, though of course you can game over by loosing battles.  Though promotional exams, for example, are hard every so often you get a fluke run that lets you beat one with sheer luck.  \n\nYou can make characters stronger... You can make spells stronger... You can make skills stronger... You can make items stronger... It basically amounts to this; the more you put into a character, the stronger they get and by the end of the game... Things are just crazy. \n\nThe game is still a grinding game, but you sometimes get so invested in it you loose track of the time. Even without the grinding, those with the brain to figure out stragies will like this game too.  JRPG games have a reputation for being utterly boring becaus they put storyline in and like the novelisation style of telling stories.  This one is decent and you can skip it anyway.  \n\nI'll update things if further into the game change.  Right now as of writing they added a few new characters and somehow broke the sound in the process.

NIS has been pretty good at taking feedback and continuing to support/update the game, though, and I can honestly say that it is now a pretty decent PC port. \n\nThere are still some issues with it, especially in the visual department. You have to understand that it is an older game (and it already \"looked old\" on its native PS2), but that's not where the visual mess comes in. They tried to add a bunch of fancy effects like shadows and edge blurring and such, but it just looks baaaad. Fortunately, you can turn most of these horrendous things off and everything is A-Okay. The biggest offender is the \"new textures\" applied to game maps. They look terrible. REALLY terrible. They just don't mesh with the surrounding art at all. Thankfully, again, you can turn them off and just use the classic map. (Whew.) The updated character portraits in the interface look fantastic, but the updated interface itself is sort of jarring. Unfortunately, if you turn off the updated interface you don't get the updated character portraits. You have to use both or neither. But you can get used to the interface so it's not TOO bad.\n\nMy biggest complaints when the port first came out were the control issues. I like playing Disgaea with a controller and you'd think that part would have ported over just fine, considering the game was ORIGINALLY for controllers. But the character movement at the hub had an insaaaane acceleration issue, the cursor controlled kinda wonky, and all of the button cues on the interface were just generic numbers instead of the actual buttons. Not to mention huge, inexplicable framerate drops that would happen from time to time. BUT ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN FIXED. Character movement is now fine, cursor is fine, button cues show the actual buttons (on my 360 style controller at least), and I'm no longer experiencing framerate issues.\n\nI would have been VERY hesitant to recommend this port when it first dropped on Steam, but I feel like it's now in a pretty good place.
