The developers have managed to create a visually stunning and immersive environment that feels like a dark and twisted dream. The attention to detail in the character and level design is unparalleled, creating a world that is both unsettling and enchanting at the same time.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a perfect balance of suspense and exploration. Navigating through the ominous surroundings, solving puzzles, and overcoming obstacles feels both challenging and rewarding. The sense of vulnerability adds an extra layer of intensity to the experience, making every encounter with the grotesque inhabitants of the game world a heart-pounding affair.\n\nLittle Nightmares also excels in storytelling without relying on traditional narrative methods. The game unfolds its enigmatic plot through environmental storytelling and subtle hints, allowing players to piece together the narrative themselves. This clever approach adds an extra layer of depth to the overall experience, encouraging players to engage their minds as well as their reflexes.\n\nThe sound design deserves special mention, as it complements the eerie atmosphere perfectly. The haunting melodies and ambient sounds enhance the feeling of suspense, making every creak and groan in the environment contribute to the overall sense of dread.\n\nIn summary, Little Nightmares is a masterclass in atmospheric gaming. It manages to create a captivating and memorable experience that will linger in your mind long after you've put the controller down. Whether you're a fan of puzzle-platformers or simply appreciate a game that can evoke a wide range of emotions, Little Nightmares is an absolute must-play.

From the first moments of the game, you are captivated by an atmosphere of mystery and suspense. The game not only evokes fear but also creates a unique world where every step is a new discovery.\n\nThe graphics impress with their detail, atmosphere, and uniqueness. Each character and level has its own character and contributes to the overall mood of the game. The variety of tasks and puzzles keeps you on edge, and the music and sound design create a unique soundtrack to your adventure.\n\nThe gameplay is a separate narrative. Agility and logical thinking are crucial, and each level requires new skills and strategies. It's not just a game; it's interactive art that captivates your imagination and leaves you with plenty of impressions.\n\nIn \"Little Nightmares,\" I found not just a game but an emotional and intellectual challenge. It's a work of art that will leave its mark in the memory of every player. And what particularly impresses me is the game's soundtrack, resembling a lullaby at night. The musical accompaniment in \"Little Nightmares\" seamlessly fits into the overall mood of the game and, like a lullaby, has the ability to immerse you in deep reflection, creating a sense of calm even amid horrors and mysteries.\n\nEach melodic touch, adapted to the atmosphere of a specific level or moment in the game, resonates in my inner world, adding even more emotional nuance to the events. This musical approach emphasizes not only the terrifying side of the story but also makes it more profound and emotionally rich.\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Little Nightmares\" gives the impression of being in a large, living dream, where melodies intertwine with the visual aesthetics of the game, creating an incredibly harmonious and effective interactive experience. This lullaby symphony becomes an integral part of the impressions from \"Little Nightmares\" and enhances the overall gaming experience, making it even more unforgettable.", "timestamp_created": 1700274834, "timestamp_updated": 1700630289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150325543": {"recommendationid": "150325543", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961493494", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1700269806}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely awful and unintuitive controls.

If it wasn't so damn clunky and frustrating in its controls and bugs, it would be one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nThe environments and art direction are absolutely stunning--it's an absolute delight to look at despite its grotesque themes. The character designs are simultaneously disturbing and oddly charming, in a sort of Studio Ghibli's \"Spirited Away\" sort of way. The animations are fantastic--from the twitches of limbs, to the swinging of loose doors you climb, to the way the fish's bodies reacts to your mass as you walk over them--every little detail really helps to make this world feel alive. Despite the incredible, dark atmosphere however, Little Nightmares never really felt like a horror game. I wouldn't go in expecting to be spooked.\n\nThe game is less than two hours in length, which wouldn't be a bad thing in itself, but the final chapter didn't feel like much of a climax. It was way too rushed. You're presented with a new monster (the least interesting of them all) who's been hinted at throughout the game, but you have one brief chase sequence with it before a very simple final fight.\n\nThe worst part of the game, unfortunately, is the flow. You will most likely die to something that felt out of your control, maybe multiple times in a row. Near the beginning for example, you're taught to keep quiet to avoid a monster. You transition to a new room while being silent. He follows you in and immediately chases you as if he heard you, despite there being no indication (not even tense music).\n\nThe hurtboxes feel inaccurate. I died way too many times to collisions with enemies when I was clearly out of their reach. I must've died to the dining table level at least seven times, which completely kills any sort of tension. I've run into multiple bugs where I got stuck on the environment or an item disappeared and I had to reload.\n\nSo basically I wholeheartedly recommend the game. I just wish it had been perfected. It's one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen, just incredibly frustrating.\n\n[h1]My Rating: 3/5[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1699485464, "timestamp_updated": 1699656285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149774727": {"recommendationid": "149774727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966396640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 146, "playtime_at_review": 1199, "last_played": 1699593544}, "language": "english", "review": "These games are evidence that I will happily ignore and forget any glitches with gameplay if you give me good music and spooky vibes.

Very atmospheric, got a very eerie feeling to it. I especially love the dream-like structures: objects that looks normal at a first glance, but on a closer look e.g the proportions make no sense. Really feels like a nightmare! That been said, this is no scary game. There are some unexpected events but they are not scary. That's cool for me, I usually can't handle that.\n\nNow there's one thing that's very bad designed in this game: the controller vibrations.

On the surface it's a puzzle game with a dollhouse perspective set in an abstract and messy environment but if you dig deeper you can find layers of perspective on the games world and the story it is trying to convey.\n\nTarsier Studios (the developers behind Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2) were inspired by many different medians when creating this game and a prime example is with the film `Spirited Away` by Studio Ghibli with how they leave everything up to the interpretation of the audience.\n\nThere is no dialogue in this game but rather the narrative is displayed through visual storytelling as the player progresses, there's hidden details found throughout the background to give the player a better understanding of the world they live in, etc.\n\nThe set pieces, environment and level-design were intentionally made as if you were looking through the perspective of a child which is so cool! Objects will appear warped and distorted as well as the many creatures and humanoids you'll encounter on your journey through The Maw.\n\nIt's worth noting that this isn't a horror game but rather it can be an intense hide-and-seek game with (at certain times) unsettling elements to display that your character (Six) does not belong there.\n\nThe only con I can say for the game is that the field of depth can throw the player off at certain points, an example is if you're trying to run and jump to grab a chain you could end up missing it because the worlds perspective can be a little tricky to adjust to.\n\nWhile a game like Little Nightmares may not be for everyone, this is an experience I often come back to replay and show my friends who love doing deep dives into theories with.

If you are interested in the game because of the vibe you get from screenshots or trailers then I can easily recommend it. If, however, you play games more for the mechanics and don't care as much about art, sound, or story, then you may want to read further.\n\nFirst, before I list my complaints, let me praise the game a bit more so that it's clear how much I liked it. It really is an incredible experience. The graphics are fantastic; it uses Unreal, but the art direction really sets it apart from other Unreal games. Everything has a very tactile feel, so that every creepy place you venture through feels like you are there. The sound effects amplify the already disturbing visuals, with the noises that the inhabitants make deserving special recognition. Playing Little Nightmares did make me feel both like there was some kind of dream/nightmare logic going on as well as like I was a little kid in a big world that I didn't understand. There are some scary moments (including a few really tense standout moments), but I think my main impression looking back was of being unsettled, uneasy, disturbed, and curious. There is no dialog and nothing is explained, so if you enjoy \"environmental storytelling\" where you have to try and piece together what is happening then this will be right up your alley.\n\nOk, now for the bad: I had _many_ frustrations playing this game. It felt like the game design was often at odds with the incredible experience I was having, ruining my immersion and making me frustrated and just wanting to get past something to see what happened next.\n\nThe camera perspective is such that the gameplay is primarily 2D, with just a little bit of depth. I think this was the perfect choice visually, but the result is that it can be really challenging to accurately judge where your character is in the depth plane. This wouldn't be a problem except that the game has several sequences where this is critical. The classic example of this for me is when I was walking along a pipe, with no enemies or time pressure, and I just steered the character off, falling to her death. This was a one-time event, but there were many (MANY!) times when I missed a jump or didn't avoid dangerous obstacles I had to thread my way through, not because I didn't know what I was supposed to do or mistimed something but because I couldn't tell where I was in relation to other things.\n\nIn addition to these (presumably) unintentional issues, there are also intentional issues that are core parts of the game design that lead to frustration. There are many (MANY!) sequences where the required timing is really tight, but also you are given very little time to anticipate or react. The result of this is that I often found myself redoing sections over and over. To be clear, Little Nightmares is not a difficult game, and the skill required to actually complete any of these sections isn't so bad. The problem, though, is that it feels like failure is anticipated or forced; you often can't really know what to do ahead of time until you've tried it and seen what happens or how you fail. Even this isn't inherently bad (if a bit old school), but it is bad in the context of what Little Nightmares is trying to do in terms of mood. It sets up these incredible situations and set pieces where I as a player was 100% engaged and was completely identifying with my character, but then when I failed in that context and had to redo things multiple times they lost all effectiveness. In a game like Ori I think this kind of game design can work, because the focus is on skill and platforming, but in a game like Little Nightmares where the focus is on the tension and atmosphere it felt very counterproductive to me.\n(Also, related side note: There is a section where the controls of the flashlight change suddenly and without warning (and with an onscreen hint if you die enough times that doesn't make it clear that the control scheme is actually different). If you decide to play and find yourself getting really frustrated at one point because of the flashlight, just remember that it may be behaving differently from how it has the entire game!)\n\nAgain, I loved this game! But it feels dishonest to recommend it without at least giving some disclaimers about how frustrated it made me at times. I can't say enough good things about the atmosphere and what an artistic achievement it is, and if you're willing to look past some gameplay flaws there is a remarkable and memorable experience to be had.", "timestamp_created": 1697997050, "timestamp_updated": 1697997050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148685822": {"recommendationid": "148685822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166357485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1698505602}, "language": "english", "review": "played hide n seek with a dude named roger but i cut off his arm. 10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1697995952, "timestamp_updated": 1697995952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148675086": {"recommendationid": "148675086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026504444", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1697983819}, "language": "english", "review": "Scary, funny and unique with a nice story!\nLove it :)", "timestamp_created": 1697985205, "timestamp_updated": 1697985205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148673740": {"recommendationid": "148673740", "author": {"steamid": "76561199127496732", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1697983792}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game", "timestamp_created": 1697983875, "timestamp_updated": 1697983875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148673160": {"recommendationid": "148673160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140417333", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 744, "last_played": 1696189458}, "language": "english", "review": "Creepy, dark and wonderful. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 4/5\n\nWhile the gameplay (mostly platforming) can be quite clunky at times, it does not take away from the amazing atmosphere and world that this game pulls you into.

It was mainly a game play and game design issue for me, everything else was spectacular. Tone, colors, grotesque and disturbing characters/plot, that's really what carried and sold the game for me.\n\nBut the game play and design...for goodness sake... a little bit of direction would have helped so as not to be lost all the time. I can not tell you how long it took me to realize I was supposed to climb up something, simply because the platform paths are not very \"readable\". On one hand, this is good for the immersion of the game - nothing really stands out all that much and it makes everything blend well together. On the other hand, you often find yourself trying again and again to figure out where you're supposed to go. \n\nI much prefer things like Mirror's edge's runner vision to show objects you can interact with or even GOW4's yellow painted cliffs/edges to show where to climb. I'm not saying make the paths you are supposed to platform super obvious like in GOW4 or in Mirror's Edge Runner vision, just that SOMETHING to indicate where to go or what to do would go a long way. It could even be something small like things falling to show there is more space above your area or to show a point of interest for the player. The strange depth perception, though unique and a positive trait of the game artistically, does add a layer of difficulty to platforming that can sometimes get frustrating. \n\nNow, there is also the evolution of the game play. Most games, they stay more or less the same throughout. Maybe you get new gear or learn a new move to keep things fresh as you progress, skill trees are examples of this since they add to the game without changing the overall game play. You'd still be punching, kicking, or casting spells... they just do different things now. But in this game, it kind of shifts into 4 genres and it does that pretty seamlessly. Each chapter is played differently from the next, the first is more like a stealth game, the second is more like a puzzle game, the third is a scrolling runner, and the last chapter is a boss battler. \n\nI personally had my gripes with this, though I do understand that it is a pretty cool concept to have your game change on you and then to suddenly adapt to the game's changes. (Inscryption is an example of this). The seamlessness of the genre transitions is what makes the game hard, even though it can be enjoyable. For example, after succeeding chapter 1, the stealth portion of the game, you move onto chapter 2 which deals more with puzzles and platforming. Because the way the game is played is now different in chapter 2, you realize that being really stealthy and playing things slow suddenly get you nowhere. In chapter 2, you are supposed to take big risks. This transition I actually did enjoy because both chapter 1 and chapter 2 felt like the same game. \n\nBut come to chapter 3 and it felt like I was playing something different, even though it looked the same. In chapter 3, it is more of a runner-platformer. With far less puzzles, and where stealth is ultimately useless. This kind of felt like everything that I learned and the skills/tactics i developed in chapter 1/2 were pointless and thrown out the window. And so for me escaping chapter 2 felt more like the true ending since it rewarded all the work I did in both chapters. I was scared, disturbed, had adrenaline pumping, and then I was relieved. \n\nThen chapter 3 happened and I was deeply confused. I had no idea what the purpose of the game was anymore, no idea where I was going, why I was doing the things I was doing, and i had to shift from stealthy platforming puzzle solving tactics to ...running... and I did not feel rewarded after completing the chapter, I just really wanted it to be over because I got pretty frustrated and disheartened when it felt like nothing i learned in the past 2 hours of playing the game was working. It really felt like chapter 3 was only there for a major plot reveal so as to better tie in the story concept - which is already super vague. You can only build inferences on the story with subtle visuals followed by the 4-5 grotesque actions that take place.\n\nI like when stories are like that, instead of huge lore dumps in a note or on the walls, you are allowed to fill in the spaces of the story yourself and it's pretty fun. Are they monsters? Aliens? what do they want with me? etc. If you are looking for something scary, this game is at most a 6/10 of being scary but a 11/10 at being disturbing.", "timestamp_created": 1697965370,

But when I succeeded to go across the adventure from start to finish, it gave me a unique and fascinating experience. What is the game about? About a sympathetic character clothed in a yellow raincoat named Six, whose tenacity is to escape from the ship called the Maw.\n\nI consider that has been reflected about the game and a variety of analyses have been written. I\u2019ll only limit myself to describing something about the game and my experience in it.\n\nThe game expresses a story and it does so through a non-verbal narrative. All this is realized through its scenography. The elements that comprise a particular scene attain to convey a feeling and communicate a fragment of the story. As the players proceed, they discover the fullness of the narrative plot.\n\nHow does it accomplish to perform such non-verbal narration? The game does this through three components that, when put together, create something integral. These are: the soundtrack, the non-verbal narrative and the art. They all depend on each other. If one is missing, the essence of its plot will not be understood. Or, to talk about non-verbal narrative, it rest on art and music, for example.\n\n[h1]The surrealism of flesh[/h1]\n\nThe game poses a developed problem, the meat-consuming society. The way the topic is approached is from the perspective of a tot. As the description of the game indicates: overcoming infanthood fears through a nightmarish journey in a world inhabited by corrupted souls. With this premise, the game forms its plot through psychological features where images, allegories, signs and symbols will preponderate. Everything it wants to tell is done in each scenario. The experience is visual, but also aural.\n\nAlthough the criticism is outstanding, its art also attracts an attention. It's inevitable not to notice the artistic inspirations but it bring about to obtain an original and unique art. Surrealism mainly be conspicuous, although it coalesces with other artistic inclinations and expressions to achieve a grotesque horror scenography in an eclectic way.\n\nIt\u2019s true that most of us have a prejudice about how we relate a scene to a work of art that we know. For me, for example, each scene forms a theatrical piece where the character Six is always in a performance. The progressive linear movement of each scene leads to a sequence like a piece of footage. The game is well composed that achieves to convey a message-feeling and, at the same time, an openness to personal understanding reflected in each immersive experience.\n\nThe enemies are symbolic and allegorical, deformed and grotesque creatures, causing an aesthetic experience and a unique sensation in the game. I\u2019m impressed by the details. In particular, a feeling of being someone small in a place subjugated by colossal items. The feeling of repugnance, starving, fragility, helplessness and defencelessness is revealed at all times. All of this gives the immersive, uninterrupted experience, in the gameplay that\u2019s seek and hide, as well as solving some small puzzles while dwelling inside the feeling of being caught, cornered or confined.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is basic, where sometimes the options of running or hiding turn out to be discernible at all times, keeps our breath, fear and suspense by having ominous enemies consigned in our path. SFX, or special sounds, accentuate the tension experienced during such a moment, such as sounds of heartbeats or moans. In this way, the non-verbal narrative of the game is realized together.\n\n[h1]The nightmare waltz[/h1]\n\nI\u2019ll say something briefly about the third component of the game's formula, its soundtrack. Tobias Lilja is its composer. Each piece of music expresses us about the happenings that the protagonist faces, mainly hunger, emptiness and the loss of her infantile.\n\nThe music performs the rhythm of the waltz, but takes it to dissimilar gradual tones, namely, light tones to dark tones. The drama of Six moving to the rhythm of the waves swinging the boat. Also it attempts to prove the ladder of Six's journey as presented in the start menu. It\u2019s the ambiguous journey of a shadowy character to the bright peak.\n\nThe musical elements are often heard as lullabies but are distorted or deformed. It\u2019s audible at all times and accentuates as a dramatic force in certain parts of the story. It\u2019s ambient, industrial, with electronic music structures, but always focusing on conveying an enveloping atmosphere to each situation as a soundscape for the scenography.\n\nIt also relates the plot and, at the same time, affords an intensity to tense the feelings. Sometimes it\u2019s luminous, but other times strident, screaming, strong, dark, funereal and hopeless. It has been realized well in the soundtrack, where it bares the distortion of the protagonist succumbing in a world where corrupted souls live. It\u2019s an excellent piece of music to emphasize the nightmare.\n\n[h1]Little Lost Things[/h1]\n\nAs a brief review I discern what I\u2019ve noticed, although many details are absconding. I liked the metaphor, symbolism and allegory of the game, especially the way it begins and closes its plot. It\u2019s beautiful with those opaque, murky and enigmatic tones in the style of surrealism and a drop of pictorial realism.\n\nThe game is a unique, original experience with a developed theme that is absorbing at all times. The game is short, but if you halt to contemplate every detail like me, you\u2019ll be in for an agitating surprise. That is, the surrealism felt in the Maw. A world full of paradoxes and contradictions.\n\nYou\u2019re unrestricted to imagine and understand what the game wants to say. There\u2019re no theories, but rather a diversity of interpretations, which the game accomplishes to bring about that plurality of understandings and feelings experienced in a grotesque, terrifying, cruel and, paradoxically, beautifully disturbing world.\n\nTo complete the adventure, the game contains DLC that intercepts Six's plot. I personally didn't play the mini-game, as I consider [i]Little Nightmares[/i] to be an integrated plot and a complete game. There is no need to add even more to something that\u2019s already well done. Recommended, it\u2019s often on sale.\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 9/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1697809403, "timestamp_updated": 1697809403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567529678344726563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148536265": {"recommendationid": "148536265", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096922697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1697950280}, "language": "english", "review": "thank u sir carl for making me play it", "timestamp_created": 1697803632, "timestamp_updated": 1697803632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148533204": {"recommendationid": "148533204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180909787", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 641, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1699888106}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a super intriguing horror adventure game. The game can feel really scary at some points, but not enough to make anyone too scared to play. There are a lot of sudden deaths which are shocking, and mostly it is just very suspenseful. It won't make anyone cry.\n\nAll three of the DLCs felt like a part of the game though, so I definitely recommend picking those up through buying the complete edition or getting the expansion pass if you are looking for more. The base game by itself is super short, especially if you aren't looking for all of the collectibles and the three DLCs manage to add up to more content than in the original game (atleast for me).\n\nThe puzzles aren't super frustrating. When you first start, there is no specific tutorial to tell you what to do, but it is very easy to pick up. Interaction with everything is super easy, which makes every puzzle fun because you won't be stuck there thinking that you just don't understand how the game works. Admittedly, there were some areas I spent way too long at but not because I didn't understand a mechanic like some puzzle games can do. I never had to look up how to do any part of the game, which I usually do find myself doing as well.\n\nIt is just one of those breath of fresh air games, you can sit down and play and not worry about any commitment. You can stop at any time and come back later. It is also very relaxing because despite its malevolent theme, the game is good at immersion and just letting your mind go forwards.\n\nAs far as the DLC's go, I think they are a bit more scary than the base game specifically because of the dramatically darker lighting. The lights are completely off in many parts of the DLCs and you really do have to let yourself be \"jumpscared\" sometimes to figure out how to navigate through the dark levels.\n\nOverall, I would give Little Nightmares a 9.5/10, this has been super enjoyable. The only thing preventing a 10/10 is the fact that I know Little Nightmares 2 is even better and I bet Little Nightmares 3 will be too, so I know this one isn't perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1697798849, "timestamp_updated": 1697798849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148527997": {"recommendationid": "148527997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801872875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1598, "last_played": 1698470305}, "language": "english", "review": "yeth", "timestamp_created": 1697788394, "timestamp_updated": 1697788394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148518089": {"recommendationid": "148518089", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036155942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1069, "last_played": 1697570618}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego si quieres pasar el rato c:", "timestamp_created": 1697767681, "timestamp_updated": 1697767681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148515479": {"recommendationid": "148515479", "author": {"steamid": "76561199476715463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 223, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1700701830}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and visually stimulating game, although a bit tricky playing with a keyboard (I recommend a game controller).

Usually this just consists of you hiding under tables and counters as you wait for the monsters to pass, and then sprinting to the door as they realize where you are and start to give chase.\n\nThe atmosphere is this game's strongest asset. The lighting is excellent and the art direction really helps sell the nightmare vibe. My only complaint is that the controls are imprecise sometimes, especially when you need to quickly and desperately grab or pull an object as a creature is chasing you.

It\u2019s a world that doesn\u2019t scare you but gently unnerves you at every dimly lit corner.\n\nSubtle Thematic Undertones: Whilst there are light sprinklings of themes that might bring to mind various vices or moral decay (yeah, a bit of that sin-like flavor, but not overly so), the game doesn\u2019t hinge on these. It\u2019s more of an underlying note, subtly layered beneath the immediate perils and darkly intriguing environments you traverse.\n\nFrom Prey to Predator:\n\nA Morally Ambiguous Path: The game crafts an unusual trajectory for the player - moving from mere survival in a grotesque world to, potentially, becoming a part of its darkness. It\u2019s an evolution that has you questioning morality and reveling, somewhat guiltily, in the darkening path your character treads.\n\nUnexpected Satisfaction: There's an odd contentment in navigating through the darkness, and perhaps becoming it. The game doesn\u2019t just make you a passive traveler but an active participant in its eerie world, and there's something darkly gratifying about that.\n\nEngaging, Fearful Elegance:\n\nA Different Shade of Horror: Shying away from standard horror tropes, Little Nightmares leans into a more nuanced, psychological fright. It\u2019s a game that stays with you, not through jolts of fear but through lingering, disconcerting thoughts.\n\nEffortless Controls & Haunting Melodies: Ensuring that your unsettling journey is smooth are the intuitive controls and a soundtrack that whispers chilling tunes into the immersive visuals, enhancing every shiver and moment of awe.\n\nLittle Nightmares isn\u2019t a sprint through a haunted house; it\u2019s more like a slow, contemplative walk through a beautifully grotesque landscape that stays with you, quietly lurking, long after the credits roll. It\u2019s an invitation not just for horror fans but for anyone who enjoys a dip into darker, more introspective gaming experiences.\n\nFrom one adventurer of dark tales to another, may your journey through this nightmarish world be as deeply engrossing as it is disturbingly delightful.", "timestamp_created": 1696941307, "timestamp_updated": 1696941307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147972583": {"recommendationid": "147972583", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233360997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1696952217}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun and hard at the same time. would recommend and will be playing again with friends.

Developed by Swedish studio Tarsier Studios, known for their work on the LittleBigPlanet series, it offers a distinctly unsettling experience wrapped in a whimsical package.\n\nIn this eerie puzzle-platformer, you play as a little girl named Six, navigating a nightmarish world with only a flickering lighter to guide you. The game's dreamlike logic constantly shifts your surroundings, leaving you feeling disoriented but captivated.\n\nThe unsettling atmosphere is where Little Nightmares excels. The grotesque yet strangely charming denizens of Six's world evoke the craftsmanship of Jim Henson, albeit with a nightmarish twist. While they repelled me, there was something tragically endearing about their misshapen forms, emphasizing Six's vulnerability.\n\nWhat sets Little Nightmares apart is its use of color. Unlike many horror games that rely on monochrome palettes, this game incorporates vivid hues, even in its darkest corners. The contrast adds depth to the unnerving atmosphere, casting shadows and highlights that serve as hiding spots or lures for danger.\n\nSound design is equally impressive. Playing with headphones enhances the experience, immersing you in a world of creaks and squelches. Yet, silence is just as vital, signaling impending doom.\n\nThe gameplay evolves continually. What starts as stealth and evasion shifts seamlessly into environmental puzzles, from tossing cans to operating meat grinders. Later stages emphasize speed over stealth, ensuring you're always on edge.\n\nPlatforming serves as the game's unifying thread, and while keyboard controls proved frustrating, a controller smoothed the experience. The relatively short playtime, around five to six hours, prevents repetition. Challenges are diverse, and you'll likely die many times, with occasionally frustrating checkpoints and load times. However, these difficulties add to the sense of triumph upon success.\n\nLittle Nightmares' creepiness lingers because it masterfully balances bright moments with the ever-present threat of darkness. It's a game where the fear of the unknown is as potent as its gruesome imagery.\n\nIn the end, Little Nightmares successfully blended whimsy with horror, leaving me with lasting chills and a newfound appreciation for the nightmares that lurk just beneath the surface of our dreams.", "timestamp_created": 1696783473, "timestamp_updated": 1696783473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678217828273773193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147875940": {"recommendationid": "147875940", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046894048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1696780810}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine killing a disabled person.

cinnamon\n6. 1 pinch salt\n7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced\n8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game immediately after release. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Especially in the last chapter did I take note of this for reasons that should be quite obvious when you get to that point yourself.\nTold only through visuals the story is easy to grasp in broad strokes though some details require you to go through the game paying detailed attention to the environmental storytelling.\nWhile short, clocking in at only a few hours for the base game, it is a good length for horror of this kind, keeping the tension high without becoming tiring.\nSometimes the controls felt a bit clunky, but this does help with immersion as Six is just a small individual in a large world. Additionally as becomes clear very quickly and is apparent through their stature they are not functioning at top capacity, so a little bit of clumsiness is to be expected.\nThe puzzles and platforming itself had a bit of challenge to them and required some trial and error once in a while, but were always doable within a few attempts.

that is loved this much i expected to be having a better time with it, but alas, little nightmares many strenghts get lost in frustration due to very poor controls, a lack of signposting/direction and unforgiving sections. It's a shame as the game looks and sounds amazing, the visuals and designs are all unique and memorable and the sound design is just right. Creaking doors and planks make way to terrifying screams belched out by horrendous abominations. The music is used sparringly but to great effect, especially in the rather memorable finale. Saddly the horrible controls leave much to be desired, such as getting stuck on little pieces of geometry at the worst possible time during a daring escape or failing countless jumps to the very poor depth perception. In fact depth perception or lack thereoff is a common occurance in this game, throwing an object at a button because you can't reach it is frustrating when it's this hard to get the direction right. All this things really add up to make the game feel clunky to play as a whole. It's also really unclear what to do or where to go at times. Since you can climb on some furniture but it isn't marked with a specific color or shine, so in a room with dozens of drawers you have to just guess which one you can climb. This is doubly annoying when you are running away from a monster, as these sequences are made to be very unforgiving, where even a moment's hesitation can get you killed. This took all the horror and terror out of these sequences and made them frustrating instead. I really hoped to like this game more, but in the end the audiovisual aspects aren't enough to alleviate the frustrations and the steep price that would make this game worth a purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1695333336, "timestamp_updated": 1695333336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146730960": {"recommendationid": "146730960", "author": {"steamid": "76561199305192828", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1695408263}, "language": "english", "review": "little", "timestamp_created": 1695324024, "timestamp_updated": 1695324024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146723887": {"recommendationid": "146723887", "author": {"steamid": "76561199211150066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1685877062}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like Little Nightmares and I would 100% recommend it.\nThe games atmosphere is one of my favorite things, and the soundtracks make it even better.\nThe story is also a very good part of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1695317125, "timestamp_updated": 1695317125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146715395": {"recommendationid": "146715395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845307266", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 454, "last_played": 1700069310}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1695309974, "timestamp_updated": 1695309974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146713090": {"recommendationid": "146713090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329127875", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1415, "last_played": 1695520314}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

I'm a huge pussy when it comes to horror games and Little nightmares doesn't give me that vibe but I get to see the bosses from a world perspective so it makes it less scary I guess... \n\nI highly recommend this indie-horror game to anyone.

Good luck, and this is very much so worth it! <3\n\nI did also get the game free when it was free for limited time, but it's 100% worth your money if you decide to buy something fun.", "timestamp_created": 1693997719, "timestamp_updated": 1693997719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145758351": {"recommendationid": "145758351", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058352884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1693976156}, "language": "english", "review": "G O A T", "timestamp_created": 1693974922, "timestamp_updated": 1693974922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145754695": {"recommendationid": "145754695", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125117064", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1693498240}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME GAME", "timestamp_created": 1693971277, "timestamp_updated": 1693971277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145747469": {"recommendationid": "145747469", "author": {"steamid": "76561199532241899", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1695026022}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game", "timestamp_created": 1693965088, "timestamp_updated": 1693965088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145746179": {"recommendationid": "145746179", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130082441", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 772, "last_played": 1692825114}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazooooo", "timestamp_created": 1693964167, "timestamp_updated": 1693964167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145742536": {"recommendationid": "145742536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351392492", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1693961532}, "language": "english", "review": "Scary-ish game, love it!", "timestamp_created": 1693961669, "timestamp_updated": 1693961669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145732936": {"recommendationid": "145732936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026565056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 583, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1693945366}, "language": "english", "review": " Little Nightmares is an atmospheric horror puzzle platformer.

Its all cleverly incorperated in a game to shine a light on whats going on. or I hope this is the reason. \nBut im probably just crazy.\n\nTo me this clearly shows the horrors these kids go through displaying the all seing eye (illuminati) and their perversions and take over, spying and copperation with the 'asian' aka 'the chinese' we see resembled in the game.\n\nOr its just a game and I could be wrong and the pletora of symbles and hidden meanings are completely made up and im imagining things because these things doesnt happen in real life, Oprah says so, so it must be true.\nThose select few who understand whats going on in our world can relate to the dark themes in the game and applaud the way it was turned into this game without being obvious, to shine a small light on all millions of poor children sacrificed, lost and abused every year and the horrors and nightmares they xperience, while inventing little fantasy playmates.\nThis is MY interpretation of what the game is about, it can be a pletora of things, but once u know ur symbolics and do ur research u will learn the truth.\n\nOnce uve played the Secrets of the Maw DLC even more are unveiled to reference real life nightmares, if u know it u know it.\nSPOILERS in the next few lines:\n\nSKIP\nOnce we finally see the mysterious woman and her reflection in the mirror, we see a very very old lady's face.

Many of the rich elites in their various occult  and satanic freemason, Skulls and other devil Orders are running our world, kidnapping and buying our children for, as mentioned above, organ harvesting, sex, and worse, as well as to harvest their andrenochrome. Andrenochrome is a psycoactive 'drug' that gives an adrenaline boost, as that organ is responsible for our 'fight or flight' response.

Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

The controller solution worked most of the time, but I still found it to be imprecise, especially during a part of the final dlc where the player needs to aim at moving targets. The controls in this game are rough, given that the game is a 3d sidescroller where you need to coordinate movement with depth perception. Not sure how they would fix that though :<\n\nI want to mention that the aesthetic and gameplay are inspired by two pieces of media in particular which I really love, the video game, Inside, and the film, Spirited Away. Little Nightmares is great in a lot of ways, traversing its interesting and well designed environments paired with awesome atmosphere and intimidating threats, you've got a very good game.

When it comes to more analytical judgment, a profound view at the craftmenship of making video games itself, perhaps even the world building and storytelling. This game would easily pass the few flaws it has and then going to be labled as horrofying yet thought provoking. But still there is another way of judgment. The way I felt when playing. A judgment based on my emotional response to everything. I\u00b4m not talking about the game looks gross therefor its bad. More the biggest emotion i associate with the game and how good are the pass onto me. Take it as the experience I had with the journey that the game offers me. When it comes to that, being honest, I only felt frustration. Pretty much from the start. \n\nFor the moment, after beating the final DLC, I am sitting in a mixture of frustration and misfortune. I want to like the game. I truly want. But i cant. But lets start simple.\n\nLittle Nightmare is a puzzle Platformer, the story ist told without a spoken or written word and only experienced for the mindful player. When it comes to enviromental storytelling this game does everything right. Our character, Six, is left imprisont in somewhere deep down in the dark and frighting unkown. From the very first minute its clear that we need to escape this place. So our journey starts with many question and the fear of the unkown. As we progress we the world offers answer to some question and eacht steps forward till realization made me us uncomfortable knowing that it will take a lot to wistand the knowledge given by the final answer. The transition from being afraid to disgust at the very moment of Enlightenment is the strongest part of this games journey. And being honest at this point of my thoughts and writing i could leave and give a thump up. Because it is a thought provoking journey i could recommend to experience. \n\nHowever I dont wanna leave out all the rest. Since this game is a platformer this game is about moving from one side of the screen to another side. You need to climb, jump and run arround finding your way over many obstacles the game throws at you. So it can be assumed that good controls are what makes a platformer work. Yeah not Little Nightmares not for me. \n\nMoving the character feels unintutive and unresponsive. There where many situation I ended up twitching and jerking arround. From moments where i cant grab the edge and pull me up to grabbing the edge and letting go for no reason. I cant tell you how many death i experienced just by fighting the controller or the camera. \n\nThe camera is kinda fix you look at a 3 dimensional world from the side scrolling perspective. While you can move away from the camera it makes jumps accros tiny beams and edges a torture. One moment you think you gonna make it only to end up missing by miles. Death is a common friend in this game.\n\nAnd death is equaily frustrating. The game has checkpoints and you cant save manually. So when you die you either have to do a portion of the level again or in some cases the game saved seconds before an enemy appears on the stage right besides where it appears on the stage. Making it annoying hard to run away. As much as I like the design of the cook and janitor they are faster than you. Ok we are a little child. Yet one mistake in a chase scene means death. Not to meantion that the game only vagualy tells you what to do. More on that later. \n\nThe AI of your hunters becomes aware of you in situation where it should be and i bugged it to the point it saw me thru walls always trying to grab me forcing me to restart the level. As said I admire there design, they dont speak but music gives them a voice. But chase music triggered and put on max while bugging out an AI breaks even me.\n\nAnother frustrating part are the puzzles. Its not that they are hard to solve its more that you sometime dont know what to do. Or in my case I did the right thing serveral times without resulting in what I wanted to happen. Leaving me searching for an answer online only to realize that i attempted to the right thing. Example would be the final fight against the janitor. Cornered evading to longs arm that want to pull you back into the darkness, I searched for the way forward. Two way presenting to survive this encounter. I either try to remove the obstacle blocking the door so it can fully close and trap the janitor outside or i can open a hatch that is a little elevated. I tried both for I dont know how many times. Nothing worked. I searched and tada I had to remove the obsticale. I felt betrayled and frustrated. Even with knowledge it didnt worked immediately. This problem repeats itself thru out the game and becomes a hinder in chases as you dont have time to check and try out everyting.\n\nFor all of that the game is short and the only length in playtime comes from moving back and forth in levels in order to solve a puzzle. Normally I would look over this and say its ok. But being fed up by frustration and a little anger every conspicuousness became a noticable problem that fed me more and more. No wonder that when i encountered a bug I kinda quitted the game for a moment. After being captured you end up locked in a cage. In a cutscene a person enters the room and pulls another cage away. The moment he grabbed the cage it collided with a third one flipping it over. I needed that cage to get out of my misery. Funny thing is when playing the DLC you end up in the same cutscene from a different perspective and it happend again. I am glad I only had to play the puzzle once and i needed to restart the level after the bug. \n\nShort word on the DLCs. They act as an addition to the story. You play a new character and experience his escape attempt which somtime crosses that of the main games character. The first of the three DLC puts you in a water based level with jumping and evading the granny. The granny is frighting but the jumping suffers the before mentioned camera and control problems. Failing means retaking a larger portion of the level. Overall its the introduction and the weakest of the three levels\n\nSecond DLC is the best for me. Not only you get the chance to interacted and utilize the cute looking nomes it had some cool puzzle sections with them. This little team up DLC is a good addition. Surprisingly i none of the mention bugs by some other players for that specific level. Still you technically have one room that you move across time and time again. For this DLC it works\n\nFor the third it didnt. The third DLC is placed again in one big room and you need to solve puzzles accross some side rooms. Its required to move some objects from one room to another. The book riddle ist the worst. If a friend that watch me playing didnt end my suffering I\u00b4d propably ask the internet for that. \n\nFor my conclusion I wanna go back to my intial dilemma. I like the game for what it represents and I feal happy for the positive reception it received thru the years. This is one of my reason for my misfortune. I pitty myself for not enjoying the game. Looking bad it started with some red flags. I finished the game in my third attempt of playing it and I took breaks every 20 Minutes for atleast 15 Minutes for the first 1.5h of playing. With that i feel like I missed something because i still have some questions left that will never be answered. When it comes to judging it for me it narrows down to decide to recommend or not based on logical arguments forged by craftsmenship and the analytical view or my emotional journey i went thru. I know i could mix both things up and decide based on both parts, but both weight equally. So I have to put my heart onto one side of the scale. \n\nWhich is going to be the emotional side.

Now, my only complaint about the game is the achievement you unlock for completing the entire game in under 1 hour without dying. It's unreasonable, and just not fun.

yet by myself.\n\nBUT...\n\nI've seen it played several times as I wanted to notice all the details, to try and understand what the meaning might be behind this masterpiece.\n\nSome might say it's a game, but I would rather call it an interactive novel, an interactive work of art\n\nOr better yet...\n\nA SHOCKING ALARM CLOCK!!!!\n\nI've read many theories about who Six is, what her past is, who are all these creatures that came on the ship called Maw.\n\nWhile I've found some of them to be fairly accurate, I'd like to offer my own opinion (without knowing what happens in the second part, as I haven't watched it nor played it yet).\n\nI think this work of art is an immersive experience, taking us for a ride into the modern world as we all know it today through the eyes of a little girl that might represent a whole generation, and attempts to address issues like education, child abuse, adults' greed and/or ignorance abou what happens around them, caring only about claiming more, trying to put their hands on the new generation without caring about it, except for the satisfy of their own NEEDS and HUNGER. \n\nOn the other hand, this 'whole generation' experiences all these, from the time that lands on the vessel which might represent this world, and tries to survive without being devoured by the monsterous adults (each of them might possibly represent a milestone in this 'generation's journey).\n\nThere's that blindfolded janitor buried in his books who might represent the educational authorities, responsible for the future generations' education.\nThere are also those cookers that we can't see their real faces as they remain hidden under their disgusting masks, who are responsible for 'cooking' the 'meals' made of rotten meat and being served to the adults, satisfying their hunger as i mentioned above.\nAnd then there's that geisha who can't stand looking her face in the mirror anymore, that might represent the previous generations who realized their mistakes and now they 're full of guilt for what they have caused.\n\nThe 'new generation' in the form of a little girl, survives from all of them and in the end steals the power for the 'previous generations' in the form of a guilty geisha\nand exits the vessel while it kills any corrupted/greedy/disgusting adult she meets on her way.\n\nI haven't digged deeply on deails yet such as what the gnomes might represent or why the little girl is named after Six, but that's my point of view on the bigger picture.\n\nAt some points, it reminds me the Plato's cave allegory for some reason.\n\nI might missing something else, but trying to give my point of view in a nutshell here.\n\nNow...\n\nAs a 3D artist myself, from an artistic point of view, the compositions, the environments, the dark and dissaturated color pallettes, the lighting, the animations, and the overall mood, makes it one of the best interactive piece of art i've ever seen.\n\nHighly recommended for any adult and teen and may it help us realize and try to correct things in the right way, not for us but for the future generations.\n\n\nLittle nightmares are often infused with little hopes... it just needs some filtering to keep the hope alive.\n\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1692258906, "timestamp_updated": 1692259820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

Its unique visual style and ambiguous storytelling contribute to its appeal. There are multiple levels that are put together as one seamless whole.\n\n~ GAMEPLAY ~\nThe gameplay primarily revolves around solving environmental puzzles while navigating through dangerous and disturbing scenarios. Players control a small character named Six, who must evade various enemies and obstacles to progress. The puzzles are cleverly designed, often requiring creative thinking to figure out how to proceed. The tension is heightened by the fact that Six is defenseless, making each encounter with enemies feel genuinely nerve-wracking. It also presents a cryptic and largely wordless narrative, leaving much of the story open to interpretation. The game doesn't provide explicit explanations, allowing you to piece together the events and themes.\n\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Not special\n\u2610 Good\n\u2705 Beautiful\n\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\nThe game excels in creating a hauntingly atmospheric world. The art style is distinctive, featuring a mix of dark and whimsical elements that contribute to a surreal and unsettling ambiance. The attention to detail in the environments and character design adds to the game's overall immersion. The lighting (and sound) design are also skillfully used to build tension and enhance the eerie atmosphere.\n\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Not special\n\u2610 Good\n\u2705 Beautiful\n\n\n~ AUDIO ~\nThe sound of the game excels in building up tension and creating a scary atmosphere.

However, the game's replayability comes from its hidden collectibles and secrets that encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of the world. The game also offers additional content through its downloadable expansions, which delve into the backstories of other characters.\n\n\u2610 No\n\u2705 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Yes", "timestamp_created": 1692018454, "timestamp_updated": 1692018493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144145672": {"recommendationid": "144145672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403172023", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1641501009}, "language": "english", "review": "gnomes taste good", "timestamp_created": 1691984957, "timestamp_updated": 1691984957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144134056": {"recommendationid": "144134056", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229192061", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1691971345}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1691970575, "timestamp_updated": 1691970575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144133270": {"recommendationid": "144133270", "author": {"steamid": "76561199386474944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1692531506}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Original, bien ambientado.

From its haunting visuals to its eerie sound design, this game succeeds in creating an unforgettable experience that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.\n\nThe game's unique art style is an immediate standout, blending Tim Burton-esque aesthetics with a macabre charm. Every environment, every character, and every detail is meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of unease, drawing players deeper into its nightmarish setting.\n\nAs a puzzle-platformer, Little Nightmares challenges players to navigate through treacherous environments using wit and stealth. The puzzles are cleverly designed, often requiring creative thinking and experimentation. The stealth mechanics add an element of tension, making every encounter with the grotesque inhabitants of this world a heart-pounding experience.\n\nOne of the game's strongest aspects is its ability to tell a story without the use of traditional dialogue. Instead, the narrative unfolds through environmental storytelling and visual cues, allowing players to piece together the mystery behind the protagonist's plight. This approach adds an extra layer of intrigue and engages players in a way that few games achieve.\n\nWhile the game's relatively short length might leave players craving more, its concise nature ensures that every moment is packed with significance. The pacing is expertly crafted, keeping players engaged from start to finish without ever feeling rushed.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some players might find the gameplay mechanics a tad clunky at times, leading to occasional frustrations in certain scenarios. Additionally, the intentionally vague narrative might not resonate with everyone, as some players prefer more explicit storytelling.\n\nIn conclusion, Little Nightmares is an indie gem that excels at creating an atmosphere of dread and wonder. With its exceptional art style, clever puzzles, and haunting narrative, it offers a captivating experience that's perfect for those who appreciate a dark and unsettling journey into the unknown.", "timestamp_created": 1691521552, "timestamp_updated": 1691521552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493403702974319458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143657705": {"recommendationid": "143657705", "author": {"steamid": "76561199447230095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1694013499}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1691506708, "timestamp_updated": 1691506708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143654592": {"recommendationid": "143654592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150349861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1513845241}, "language": "english", "review": "Spooky/creepy", "timestamp_created": 1691503232, "timestamp_updated": 1691503232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143652304": {"recommendationid": "143652304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170019541", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1695397606}, "language": "english", "review": "love it very good fun", "timestamp_created": 1691500616, "timestamp_updated": 1691500616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143651006": {"recommendationid": "143651006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033165301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1562712391}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Free Fire\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 All\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulty}---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2611 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2610 Endless\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 Cyberpunk 2077\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{90/100}---\n\nGrab this review template here!

It's beautifully creepy and positively dripping with atmosphere. \n And the music, while nothing special on its own, works wonderfully with the visuals to create an incredibly eerie and often tense sense of dread.  If this was a short film, I'd gush endlessly about how amazing it is and recommend it to everyone I know.  As a game, though, it's abysmal to play and too frequently more frustrating than fun.\n\nI can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but where I loved Limbo and Inside, I found this game's trial-and-error insta-death gameplay to be child-punchingly maddening.  I think part of it is the camera/perspective.  The 3D aspect is nice, in theory, and does work to the visual aesthetics, but it makes some of the platforming and jumping you need to perform a hellish nightmare all its own.  It would be fine if it weren't so easy to just walk off platforms or if it was easier to line up jumps that, should you miss or fail to grab onto a ledge, see you fall to your death.  Or, worse, you grab onto a ledge only to find that, in this particular instance, your character refuses to pull itself up, leaving you no choice but to let go and, once again, plummet to your death.  And the fact that the camera pulls way back in some of these scenarios, more concerned with giving you a cinematic visual than a view conducive to the task at had is unforgivable.  Then factor in the inconsistent checkpoints - sometimes they start you right before the thing that killed you, while other times you have to trudge through the same rooms/hallways or go through the same slow and tedious climbing sequences - and it's the perfect recipe for a gameplay experience that absolutely sucks.\n\nI'd also complain about the plodding character movement, but that seems like more an intentional choice rather than developer incompetence.  And, honestly, when everything lines up just right, when you don't get caught on a door frame or some little knobby bit of the level design, when you make that desperate last second jump and actually stick the landing, the character's sluggish movement makes for a genuinely tense horror movie moment of a narrow escape.  It's just a shame that the tension and scares too often come from the fear of potentially having to replay a garbage platforming/chase section for the fourth or fifth time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game.  I -should- like this game.  But I've just been struggling to find any amount of pleasure in the experience and don't even know if I'll finish it.  I may end up just watching a playthrough of the game because, again, the visuals are top notch and when I'm not fighting the camera perspective or the clunky controls, I'm actually able to appreciate what the developers were attempting to create.  So, that's my recommendation: skip the whole game/playing part and, instead, find a good no commentary playthrough on the internet so you can enjoy the best aspects of the game: the visuals and atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1691309466, "timestamp_updated": 1691309466, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487148851156234741", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143490439": {"recommendationid": "143490439", "author": {"steamid": "76561199353616287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1691283896}, "language": "english", "review": "w game tbh (made me want to actually take a toaster bath) not for the weak", "timestamp_created": 1691283960, "timestamp_updated": 1691283960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143487409": {"recommendationid": "143487409", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067533986", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1691263086}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10 un juegazo indie tiene un soundtrack buenisimo enemigos aterradores y una atmosfera tremenda de los mejores indies", "timestamp_created": 1691279382, "timestamp_updated": 1691279382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143485121": {"recommendationid": "143485121", "author": {"steamid": "76561199035715384", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1691351641}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

However, one of the key aspects of this genre - controls - was not executed well enough. It's precisely because of the character's unresponsiveness that some sections become painfully difficult to complete. Often, the character gets stuck or jerks when interacting with the environment, and he is unresponsive and incredibly slow.\n\n[*]In this game, deaths are probably one of the most unfair. In platforming sections or critical moments, the controls can be unreliable, and your character might not perform the necessary actions. Enemies aren't inherently dangerous, and they could be relatively easy to avoid, but sometimes it's really difficult to understand when they might notice you. Moreover, escaping from monsters is practically impossible, except when a hiding spot is immediately available, which isn't always the case. In such a case, it would be appropriate to have at least some way to escape, so that it wouldn't be a 100% death and level restart. For me, this just makes the stealth mechanics very annoying. Basically, it's not such a big problem, but it just adds extra inconvenience to an already too short game that's supposed to leave a positive impression.\n\n[*]The environments, no matter how beautiful they are, are difficult to navigate. Due to the odd 2D/3D perspective, it's challenging to orient yourself in relation to your character's plane. When jumping onto a platform, you might find yourself slightly to the left or right of it. Interactive objects blend seamlessly with the environment and are easy to miss. There are many situations where you think you can climb somewhere, but it's actually impossible. This is especially frustrating in chase scenes, where you need to make quick decisions.\n\n[*]At times, the static camera takes very inconvenient positions, making it impossible to understand your character's location. If something obstructs your view, you can't see your character, which is annoying. Strangely, the camera isn't tied to enemies, so there are instances where they can see you, but you can't. While you can move the camera using arrow keys (up-down-left-right), it's more of a crutch. Doing this consistently is difficult, primarily because of the control issues.\n\n[*]Due to the size of the locations, you often have to run from one end to the other for a significant amount of time (and frustratingly, most puzzles involve finding keys or similar items on the opposite end of the map). Here, the problem also lies in the fact that solving such puzzles can be quite lingering, as they are not always intuitively clear.\n[/list]\n\nI believe these are the main reasons I personally didn't enjoy the game.

I didn't enjoy playing it until the third chapter which was about 2 or 3ish hours in my first run. It's also worth mentioning that the game is short, about 4-5 hours, which isn't a bad thing personally for a $20 game but to some it may be a let down. After getting all achievements, I decided to write this review and now I'll get into the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n1. Cool environments and visuals \n2. Puzzles aren't too hard for the more casual gamers. I only needed to look up a guide once on how to progress because I didn't see a certain key hanging in chapter 3. \n3. Pretty chill overall and enjoyable\n4. Great DLC. Personally I thought the DLC was a huge step-up from the base game and I highly recommend getting all three bonus DLC chapters. I liked the puzzles a lot more and the story of the DLC more than the base game. \n\n\nNEUTRAL STUFF:\n1. Length of the game is definitely a point to make and could either be a plus or a minus to you.\n2. The bonus masks you can buy for the cosmetics I didn't use at all but you may or may not like them and or want to use them. \n3. Price. It's only $20 USD, and the DLC adds a little more to the overall cost, but I think it's a fair price. I definitely think a lower price would make the game even more worth buying if it was priced as $15 or even $10. At the time of this review the game is on sale for only $5 and I think that makes it a definite buy.\n4. The 4th and 5th chapters are really short compared to the first three chapters. They don't feel rushed, but kind of wished there could've been more.\n5. Try to stick with it like I did until the end because hopefully you also change your mind and start liking it too!\n6. Didn't feel scary at all to me but I'm also probably not the target audience. Could be a decent spook for the easily frightened or for younger audiences. A great horror game to me is like Outlast or Amnesia TDD (2 of my favorites) so the horror element wasn't really a thing that stuck out to me. \n7. There is a story. It is told through cutscenes and suggestive themes because there are no text or words to read or listen to. The story is more of a \"watch and learn\" type of thing than a \"read this\" type of story.\n\nCONS: \n1. The controls ABSOLUTELY SUCK. This is the huge major let down of the game. There is a lot of parkour and with bad controls this is a nightmare and the major reason why I almost stopped playing the game entirely. In the DLC the controls did feel better, but that might just be me.\n2. The camera. Doing puzzles, chases, and parkour with this camera is also a negative. Granted, it's not that bad all the time, but being precise trying to line up a jump or a slide in a chase sequence, the camera can easily get you killed. \n3. Glitchy Hitboxes. I'm not sure if these are bugs per say, but many times the hitboxes of enemies and objects feel horrible and unfair. Particularly with the Janitor (long arms guy) even outside of his long reaching arms, he can still grab you. The death animations also didn't line up a lot and I believe this has to do with the glitchy hitboxes because when the janitor would grab me sometimes I would float in mid air and not in his hands for the death animations and then be killed. Crawling through vents I got stuck on bolts which are for added detail but why do they have collision? Going upstairs I got stuck on walls right next to stairs at times as well. \n\nTips because I do recommend you buy it:\n1. Your character does have limited stamina. I didn't notice this until my Hard to the Core run, which was my last time playing the game, but after running for a long time your character does start to breathe harder and will bend overt to catch their breath. You do slow down in running speed and that can and will cause you to die in chases at times. \n2. You can sneak faster if you hold crouch and sprint at the same time as well as in vents when you are already crouched, you just have to hold sprint to move faster. You're welcome. \n3. It's hard to give a good answer on B-hopping but it does make you go faster from my experience. If you only bhop, you will get caught in chases and start to slow down. From what I've noticed, Sprinting at full speed (max stamina, no heavy breathing) and doing 2 bhops is best to escape chases and go faster in general but more than that and you'll slow down. I believe it's because when land from jumping, your character will stop for a split second which lets bosses catch you. \n\nOverall a decent to good experience and I'm no professional game critic, but I would rate it a low B tier game if I was to put it on a tier list. I think the 81 that Metacritic gave it is accurate in judging its quality in case you needed that number value/100. Personally the controls are the major flaw that hold this game back from being a solid B tier.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690253047, "timestamp_updated": 1690253625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142738039": {"recommendationid": "142738039", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112159526", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1690252938}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn!

I suppose the main reason why I went ahead and went to do something else is that I find one hit mechanics rather frustrating.

Kinda like a grim Tim Burton tale.

Hooray for short games!\n-The fat guys were pretty funny.\nokay that's about it\n\nThe yuckies:\n- The controls are actually embarrasingly bad and the only thing redeemable about them is that the game is really short so you just might be able to suffer through to the end of the game without giving up on it. Your character's animations are weirdly noticeably less smooth than the monsters which is pretty weird but I guess it's purely visual so it's whatever I guess. The bigger problem is that the 3D perspective is really bad and makes walking or jumping in straight lines really difficult. There were multiple instances where I had to re-do a chase sequence not because I didn't know where to run/jump (though there are some of those too), but because my character just decided to walk off from a straight pipe and die, or jumped diagonally instead of straight ahead.\n\n-Ledge grabbing is really inconsistent. The game lets you grab pretty much every ledge, but then it's really selective about where you can climb up from a ledge or even just move along it. It's really weird and makes the interactions with the world feel inconsistent sometimes.\n\n-The constantly in-motion camera makes the simplest movement feel imprecise and wonky, and it's only worse when you have to make a simple jump or walk in a straight line which is like 70% of the game (I get that the camera is supposed to sway like a boat and have a handheld feel, but it's a big part of the horrible gameplay feel so I don't think this stylistic choice was worth it)\n\n- The story is non-existent. It's not that it's confusing, there just an absence of narrative beats or elements for a story to happen. Throughout the whole story we learn about the main character that he's really hungry and then eats a superpower at the end because it was just laying there right when his lil' tummy was rumblin. And that's the end of the story. Gameplay is usually much more important for me in video games, but 1) I'm not ignoring stories either and 2) the gameplay is really bad, so I was searching for anything I could get. I'm sure there's a masterpiece of a story in all the DLC, but what I've experienced in the base game doesn't even motivate me to google if that's the case.\n\n-The sound design is weird sometimes. There was a level where it was really important that you walk on carpets to dampen your footsteps, which was cool, but I guess it mattered only in that one level because you can just walk around monsters in later levels and make a bunch of noise and they're not interested in you at all. That's more of a nit-pick, but it was weird to me that I can just run around huge monsters without a care in the world, becasue just 20 minutes ago I had to sneak around constantly. Also the music is bland. I guess the game doesn't emphesise music that much in favor of ambient sound design, which is a good idea overall, but when they hit you with da main song, it's jarring and it's not very good either.\n\n- The amount of times where I was escaping from a monster and my character suddenly snaps to it's hand was at least enough for me to notice that it's a trend, it made a lot of failures feel cheap.\n\nMaybe get it on a sale, at least it's short so you won't be wasting that much time.", "timestamp_created": 1689592539, "timestamp_updated": 1689597951, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561587870121002197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142250883": {"recommendationid": "142250883", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049415061", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1014, "last_played": 1689617213}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game very much!\nenjoyable:check\nfun:check\nmysterious:check\nthrill:check\nkind of horror :check", "timestamp_created": 1689576692, "timestamp_updated": 1689576692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142246156": {"recommendationid": "142246156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989294264", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1691466409}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy lindo y bastante divertido como misterioso, 10/10 y listo", "timestamp_created": 1689568203, "timestamp_updated": 1689568203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142240306": {"recommendationid": "142240306", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066763956", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1683475335}, "language": "spanish", "review": "littlenightmarestastico.", "timestamp_created": 1689558828, "timestamp_updated": 1691193548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142237328": {"recommendationid": "142237328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198914098693", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1627387605}, "language": "english", "review": "cresi", "timestamp_created": 1689554249, "timestamp_updated": 1689554249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142234974": {"recommendationid": "142234974", "author": {"steamid": "76561199220116415", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1689887746}, "language": "english", "review": "the mood and atmosphere of the game are so sick and crazy and i love that , they designed people so cool i've never seen anything like this before. but little nightmares has a problem the nightmares you see after playing it , they're not little", "timestamp_created": 1689550732, "timestamp_updated": 1689596984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142233676": {"recommendationid": "142233676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970686902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1689547499}, "language": "english", "review": "Clunky/awkward controls and checkpoint saves too far apart.

The attention to detail in the environment and character design is commendable, immersing players in a nightmarish journey through the Maw\u2014a surreal underwater vessel that serves as the game's setting.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are intuitive yet challenging, requiring you to solve intricate puzzles while navigating through treacherous environments. The game cleverly balances exploration, stealth, and platforming elements, keeping you on your toes as you encounter various grotesque and formidable enemies. The suspenseful gameplay combined with the game's ominous soundtrack creates a sense of constant tension, making each encounter a heart-pounding experience.\n\nMoreover, the narrative of Little Nightmares 1 is minimalistic yet intriguing. It relies on visual storytelling, leaving much to the player's interpretation. As you progress, you unravel the dark secrets of the Maw, slowly piecing together the unsettling history behind its inhabitants and the protagonist, Six.

Store page lists it as having \"Full Controller Support\" which is simply not true. I tried so many work-arounds with zero luck. Sure I could just use a kb&m but I shouldn't have too when you claim full controller support...\n\nI'm also tired of games that rely on auto-detecting what controller you have plugged in. It doesn't work half the time, if your game supports both Xbox and PlayStation controllers, then let me manually switch between which button prompts are shown in settings. Auto detection is only convenient when it actually works.\n\nEdit: Also even if a game doesn't support PlayStation controllers there's no reason not to have an option in settings to shows PS button prompts. That would allow people to emulate their PlayStation controllers as an Xbox controller and still have the correct button prompts in-game.

This hauntingly beautiful game takes you on a journey through the nightmares of a young child, blending elements of horror, suspense, and puzzle-solving to deliver an unforgettable experience.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the shoes of Six, a small and vulnerable protagonist, you're immersed in a nightmarish realm known as The Maw. The visual design of Little Nightmares is nothing short of breathtaking, with its handcrafted environments, detailed character designs, and atmospheric lighting creating a chilling atmosphere that evokes a sense of unease and wonder.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around exploration, puzzle-solving, and stealth. As you navigate the treacherous halls of The Maw, you'll encounter grotesque and menacing creatures, each with their own distinct design and behavior. The puzzles are cleverly designed, requiring keen observation and logical thinking to progress. The sense of vulnerability and tension is palpable, as you must carefully navigate your surroundings, avoiding detection and finding ways to overcome the challenges that lie in your path.\n\nOne of the game's strengths is its ability to convey a sense of dread and anticipation without relying on jump scares or excessive gore. Little Nightmares relies on subtle visual cues, haunting sound design, and ambient music to create an atmosphere that is both unsettling and captivating. Every creaking floorboard and eerie whisper adds to the immersive experience, immersing you in a world where the line between dreams and nightmares blurs.\n\nThe story of Little Nightmares is presented in a cryptic and enigmatic manner, allowing players to piece together the narrative through subtle environmental storytelling and symbolism. It's a tale that explores themes of innocence, fear, and the darkness that resides within us all. The game's brevity works in its favor, leaving room for interpretation and encouraging multiple playthroughs to uncover hidden secrets and additional layers of the story.\n\nVisually, Little Nightmares is a work of art. The handcrafted environments are meticulously detailed, from the grimy kitchens to the towering bedrooms. The character animations are fluid and expressive, capturing the essence of both the childlike wonder and the sinister nature of the world. The attention to detail in the art direction creates a visually striking experience that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nIn conclusion, Little Nightmares is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling and visual design. It presents a chilling and thought-provoking journey through the nightmares of childhood, filled with puzzles, suspense, and a pervasive sense of unease.
