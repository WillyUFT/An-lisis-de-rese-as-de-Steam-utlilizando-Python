Although the character portrait designs and color choices are nice, the pixel art of the environments and characters is sorta generic\n- The music is pretty decent. Again, sorta generic little chiptunes, but still nice\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- Given that it's a short game, the story is a quick run through. In a nutshell, your ship is shot down as you're pursuing the game's villain. After crash landing, you need to find a part to fix your ship as well as some (optional) upgrades to make it stronger\n- Not much going on vibe-wise. It's a relatively chill little puzzle platformer\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- The game largely plays as a puzzle platformer with a focus on exploration\n- You just run through the environments solving jumping puzzles. Paying close attention to the room layout and small details within each screen may yield additional upgrades for your ship, which make the final boss easier\n- I might be back in the future to replay and nab some more achievements. It's a fun, quick game\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- Being such an inexpensive game, it's really hard to get too upset about the slightly generic design and gameplay. It's well worth the price of admission\n- Ran perfectly fine on the Steam Deck after switching from Proton Experimental -> 8.02\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n- [b]6/10[/b]. It's a competently-made puzzle platformer at an extremely good value. If you're craving a platformer but don't have much time, this is an easy game to recommend\n", "timestamp_created": 1686318010, "timestamp_updated": 1686318010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139382942": {"recommendationid": "139382942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989090584", "num_games_owned": 1387, "num_reviews": 204, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1685642113}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1685642190, "timestamp_updated": 1685642190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139348406": {"recommendationid": "139348406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014226317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1686972509}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me a bit to finally give it a proper try - I was frustrated that i just couldn't get the jumping down - but once I figured it out, it was so much.

During its short play time, the game builds on its core mechanics enough to feel satisfying just before it wears out its welcome. This makes it worthwhile at its budget price-point as a fun proof-of-concept and makes it a fun \u201cMini-Puzzle Platformer\u201d as a diversion from more meaty games. However, the way the whole thing ends it\u2019s hard not to feel just a little short changed, not from the money spent, but from the potential of what could have been.\n\nThe game starts out with a Schmup section which, theoretically, you could win the game right during its intro if you\u2019re good enough. The more common outcome however is that you\u2019ll die, and you crash land onto an alien planet equipped only with a teleport gun. Firing your gun onto most surfaces causes you to instantly appear where the bullet landed, and this is basically the only mechanic in the game. Later you get a gun that breaks things, which you use to clear out debris that\u2019s in the way of your teleport gun, but that\u2019s about it. The level design then carries the rest of the experience, bending the rules what you thought were the limitations of your abilities as you seek out your quarry and try to repair your ship.\n\n\nOverall the game does a good job with its design. It never gets boring \u2013 and there\u2019s a really fun boss that utilizes the teleport gun mechanics \u2013 but it also feels sort of incomplete. It would be amazing if they added in a few more mechanics, and really emphasized the open world Metroidvania aspect a little more \u2013 something more akin to what Supraland accomplishes with its similar puzzle focus. As-is the parts of the game that earns its Metroidvania tag feels sort of tacked on, and you\u2019re often gated from back tracking to get missed collectables anyway. The reward for having a keen eye is that you can upgrade your ship for the inevitable retread of the Schmup section introduced at the beginning of the game. In my case I went straight through the experience with the intent to backtrack, only to be locked into the schmup fight unable to collect the power-ups the game teases. Left with the choice of starting over from the beginning (and retreading old puzzles) or \u201cgit gud\u201d, I went with the latter.\n\nI think that it\u2019s safe to conclude that if you\u2019re looking for a Metroidvania game, this one will likely not scratch that itch for most. If you\u2019re a fan of puzzle platforming in general though, then it\u2019s a pretty good choice. Similar to a \u201dMini-Metroidvania\u201d I\u2019d recommend this to people that are looking for a taste of a Puzzle Platformer experience, but also don\u2019t really want to commit to a longer game. At its price point \u201cjust good\u201d is perfectly fine.\n\nFinal Score\n3/5", "timestamp_created": 1668018222, "timestamp_updated": 1668018222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124691424": {"recommendationid": "124691424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067116327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 190, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1563147414}, "language": "english", "review": "Jerma985 is a Liar.", "timestamp_created": 1667174649, "timestamp_updated": 1667174649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563758373260498047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123965005": {"recommendationid": "123965005", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998595360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1665997558}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to give a negative review but I think it's still worth the price.

And it's got some pretty neat mechanics! I really like the teleport gun, as (in conjunction with the beams) it creates some really intricate platforming puzzles that require some pretty decent skill to pull off. It feels good when you pull them off!\n\nI don't like the checkpoint density, though. There are a handful of locations in the game where it is REALLY easy to die performing some really intricate maneuvers, and you'll be sent back a screen or two\u2014this is CRUSHING with how slow your walking speed is. There are even more locations where you'll have to just redo the entire screen because it won't entirely be clear if certain triggers remained activated when you died or not. You'll see what I mean if you play the game.\n\nThe combat is... eh. Not that interesting. The smaller enemies in the game would've worked better if you had to shoot them once, maybe twice, since that's how you're gonna be maneuvering around them, anyway. Not to mention, the bullets have a sort of awkward rhythm to when you can actually fire that's not really clear. Maybe a reload animation would help with this? That way timing could still be an element with some of the more interesting combat encounters, like against the big enemies that fire projectiles or against the final boss.\n\nThere's also some hidden collectibles, if that's your sorta thing. (Spoilers for the ending of the game) [spoiler]Supposedly they upgrade your ship in the final boss, which is a shoot-'em-up just like the opening sequence.

Beat it in 1 hour and 20 minutes using a game controller.  Difficulty is moderate-hard.  \n\n- Gameplay has two parts.  One is a top-down 2d spaceship shoot 'em up.  The other, which comprises most of the game, is a platformer puzzle game.  You use a teleporting gun to get yourself through many dungeon rooms to get to the badguy at the end.  The controls are smooth.  \n\n- The puzzles are tricky and some are harder than others.  I had to put the game down once because I was getting frustrated, til I realized the solution was right there.  So frustration in a good way.\n\n- The world is memorable. There isn't much diversity in the enemies, but the variety of obstacles more than makes up for it.  The final boss is great, as are the aliens.  \n\n- Non-linear.  While it seems like this is just another 'go from point A to B' platformer like the five million other dollar games out there, you will be pleasantly surprised.  There's no real sense of back tracking and you can get to the end boss in multiple ways.  Each replay can be different.  Don't feel like getting all the power cells this round or searching around for that one power up you're missing?  You don't have to.  \n\n- Achievements.  There are a number of achievements that make replaying completely worth it.  \n\n- Music.  The music draws you in with its midi vibes and will keep you shooting.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Out there Somewhere is a classic in the way CaveStory and VVVVVV are.  It's shorter in the way an arcade game is, and you'll die a ton.  This is the kind of game you can't hate, and will want to play multiple times.  Is it worth a dollar?  I think it's worth way more, and I hope to play anything else the developer does in the future.  You're not hitting the bottom of the barrel here.

While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.\n\nYou play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.\n\nThe game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn\u2019t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic \u2013 a teleportation gun.\n\nWhen Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.\n\nHe can also jump.\n\nThese two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun \u2013 including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.\n\nThe game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short \u2013 this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that\u2019s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).\n\nWas it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t entertained by it, but it wasn\u2019t high-quality entertainment \u2013 the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed by this game.", "timestamp_created": 1623581127, "timestamp_updated": 1623581127, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515394926071166992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93436609": {"recommendationid": "93436609", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976313504", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 253, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1452699322}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this ages ago and all I really remember about it is that I did not enjoy it.

You dig through Steam sales, sorting by new or lowest price, and through the piles of (well, not always) sub-par asset flips and other unfortunate materials, sometimes you find a diamond in the rough. Not to say that Out There Somewhere, a Metroidvania-like adventure game is anything akin to a masterpiece, but this charming little title is the perfect example of the gems you could find just by digging just beneath the surface.\n\nOut There Somewhere is an adventure title with very light Metroidvania elements - though more akin to the original Metroid then any of its acclaimed successors. You play as Yuri, a starship pilot protecting \u2018Mother Planet\u2019 from Grigori, a pirate warlord who wrecks her ship, causing it to crash land on an unknown planet. From there, Grigori journey\u2019s across the planet, using his \u2018telegun\u2019 to brave the deadly dangers, repair their ship, and defeat Grigori. It\u2019s a very basic premise, but it\u2019s serviceable enough to give context to Yuri\u2019s journey. Despite that, the story doesn\u2019t really progress beyond that - you get bibs and bobs from the dozen or so alien NPCs you run across, but outside of the fight with Grigori, the plot doesn\u2019t progress at all. But like I said, that isn\u2019t really a problem.\n\nThe main gameplay loop of Out There Somewhere is Grigori moving through screen after screen, with each screen having some specific puzzle or monster combination to deal with. For much of the game, Yuri\u2019s only \u2018weapon\u2019 is a teleport gun that\u2019ll warp him to wherever it ends up. A few elements in the game world mix up this basic gameplay loop - there are several kind of lasers involved in puzzles that interact differently with the telegun - red lasers will stop the shot, preventing Yuri from warping, blue will also stop them shot, but will cause Yuri to warp to them, and green lasers will cause the shot to move up the laser, depositing Yuri at the top of the laser. There are a few more minor mechanics then that, but for the most part that\u2019s the main puzzle loop of Out There Somewhere. The loop doesn\u2019t really evolve beyond that, though, and the game never really gets a chance to even attempt to evolve, as the experience is over in, probably on average, an hour and a half. Whilst it\u2019s a nice length, especially for an indie title like this, it does feel a bit too short and I would\u2019ve loved to see where else it could\u2019ve taken. There are a number of collectables across the game world, used to upgrade both your ship and your on-foot HP, but I only found a handful across my playthrough, and overall I felt they were a little out of the way to find - but I could totally imagine myself giving it another run-through to try and track them down.\n\nIn some ways, I\u2019d describe Out There Somewhere as a cousin of the original Portal. It\u2019s short, simple, and very to the point, based around a single major mechanic or two that\u2019ll pull you all through the game without boredom or frustration. Each of the puzzles in the game aren\u2019t complicated enough to take you too long - I think there were only one or two that took more than five minutes for me to solve, and that was more down to me making platforming mistakes. Though, later in the game Yuri obtains a gun, and whilst he does use this to take down a few monsters in the game, it feels a bit like a tacked on mechanic more than anything, and personally I\u2019d feel time would\u2019ve been better spent fleshing out another mechanic with the teleport.\nAdditionally, there are only two real \u2018fights\u2019 in the game, one on the ground with the telegun/gauss gun, and another in space, mirroring the start of the game. Both of these fights aren\u2019t terrible, but they don\u2019t feel particularly inspired, especially the on-foot fight. The game feels fantastic as a little puzzle, but using those mechanics for combat just don\u2019t feel nearly as good.\n\nAdding to it\u2019s simple gameplay loop is it\u2019s wonderfully cute and low-key graphics. Out There Somewhere isn\u2019t a particularly deep game in regards to it\u2019s graphics, but the simplified, pixel-style art direction perfectly depicts a starkly barren world, populated by cute little critters and the member\u2019s of Grigori\u2019s villainous crew. There\u2019s even a few genuine gorgeously, moody screens that gave me pause, forcing me to take a moment to appreciate the work the assumedly small team put into this charming little indie title.\nThe soundtrack is nothing to sneeze at, either, perfectly capturing Yuri\u2019s adventure across the unnamed planet. It\u2019s a wonderfully chill soundtrack, and with the night I played it being rather chilly, causing me to be wrapped in blankets, it was the perfect background to my evening playing Out There Somewhere. \nIt\u2019s chiptune based OST has a good number of head-swaying numbers, and whilst all of them fit their particular locale, I\u2019d say it has that sort of issue where a bunch of the songs sound more than a little similar, bit that\u2019s a rather nit-picky thing to say at the end of the day.\n\nOut There Somewhere is a charming little indie title that proves that digging into Steam\u2019s (or whichever provider you play through) listings beyond the front page can reward you with fantastic titles you\u2019d never find elsewhere. Out There Somewhere provides a comfy experience with a well thought out, yet basic concept and mechanic that perfectly pulls through it\u2019s well-paced journey. It\u2019s not the biggest, most complex, or well-crafted game I\u2019ve ever played - but I can see the love that went into Out There Somewhere, and the care so finely ingrained in every part of this game is enough to recommend to, well, pretty much anyone!\n", "timestamp_created": 1618117648, "timestamp_updated": 1618117648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558726012706756592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89864094": {"recommendationid": "89864094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984775828", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1617764774}, "language": "english", "review": "Out There Somewhere is a good indie platformer.

Out There Somewhere es un videojuego independiente de plataformas en dos dimensiones y puzzles en el cual, su principal atractivo es el poder teletransportarse con la pistola del protagonista. Esto puede parecer simple, pero la raz\u00f3n por la que este juego gan\u00f3 cierto renombre, desde mi punto de vista, es por lo bien que el desarrollador aprovech\u00f3 y explot\u00f3 esa mec\u00e1nica. Los puzzles en un principio son bastante complejos y va a ser necesario que el jugador se pare un momento (bastante rato en mi caso) a analizarlos. En mi caso particular, conforme entend\u00eda el uso de la teletransportaci\u00f3n en el juego, y como aprovecha la inercia, los puzzles se fueron aclarando. Esto se traduce en que tuve bastantes dificultades a la hora de avanzar en los primeros tramos del juego, y de la mitad para adelante se simplific\u00f3 mucho.\nMe gustar\u00eda aclarar que este juego me lo compr\u00e9 sin saber nada de \u00e9l previamente, por curiosidad. Cuando lo empec\u00e9 en realidad pens\u00e9 que se trataba de un metroidvania con toques de plataformeo, por que hab\u00eda zonas que realmente no pod\u00eda superar y me daba la sensaci\u00f3n de que era necesaria una mejora para seguir. Es por esta raz\u00f3n que un puzzle tuve que averiguarlo en internet, pensando que hab\u00eda llegado a esa zona con alg\u00fan recurso faltante, pero para mi sorpresa, es que estaba encar\u00e1ndolo mal.\nNo cuento esta triste historia respecto a mi manqueza por nada, sino para demostrar mi sorpresa de estar ante un producto de tanta calidad por un precio tan bajo. Realmente todos los puzzles pueden ser resueltos desde el principio. No es necesario mejoras, sino adquirir los conocimientos respecto a la teletransportaci\u00f3n. Si un puzzle es muy avanzado para vos en ese momento, muy probablemente te ense\u00f1en de una forma indirecta, una mec\u00e1nica o una forma particular de aprovechar el teletransporte m\u00e1s tarde.\nLa raz\u00f3n por la que el juego es tan barato, es debido a su corta duraci\u00f3n. El juego puede ser completado en cuesti\u00f3n de una a dos horas. Sin embargo, incita bastante a la rejugabilidad ya sea para obtener todos los coleccionables o completar los logros.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2178939709\nEl \u00faltimo apartado del juego que me gustar\u00eda resaltar, es su banda sonora.

It's clever, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it an \"[u]incredibly[/u] clever action-puzzle platformer,\" as the store page does. It's rewarding, and quite fun to play, but it's not remarkably challenging.\n\nMost players will probably beat it within an hour on the first go, and it's not a terrible grind to dip back in for the remaining achievements -- which will probably take another 2 playthroughs. One is a speedrun achievement for beating the game in <20m, and even this is not terribly challenging once you know your way around. \n\nThe platformer-puzzles involve: \n[list][*](1) Using your teleport gun to zip around the screen (when your shot hits a wall, you go there), \nand \n[*](2) Combining this with well-timed jumps. If you jump at just the right time, you'll still be moving up when you teleport to your new location, and that's basically how you move through complicated spots. Sometimes you'll need to chain this kind of move a few times in a row.\nIn addition:\n[*](3) Some levels have up to 3 different laser beams running vertically through them, and these add some complexity by interacting with your teleport gun: red lasers will nullify your shot and nothing happens when it hits them -- but this isn't meaningless, because red lasers can block off whole regions of the board and restrict movement; blue will act like any other surface, so you'll warp to the laser when/where your shot hits it -- but unlike a normal surface, you can walk through lasers; green will redirect your shot up to the top of the laser, and then you'll teleport there.\nTo top it off:\n[*](4) There are enemies and pitfalls that will kill you if you aren't careful. You gain a pea-shooter relatively early on, and will need to use it to get past enemies in a few places, and during the final boss battle. If you do die, you'll automatically restart at checkpoints that are pretty prevalent, and you don't lose anything.[/list]\n\nOnce you click \"Play\" in your Steam Library... and then click \"play\" again to get past an odd little launcher screen that offers you no options (?)... you can access the in-game settings to choose fullscreen or windowed. No more specific resolution options. There are 4 numbered volume settings for both music and FX (0=off, 4=max) which approximates a slider.

Check out our Forum here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nSome indie games just need a good idea to justify their reason for existing, and [i]Out There Somewhere\u2019s[/i] teleport gun serves that purpose. During its short play time, the game builds on its core mechanics enough to feel satisfying just before it wears out its welcome. This makes it worthwhile at its budget price-point as a fun proof-of-concept and makes it a fun \u201cMini-Puzzle Platformer\u201d as a diversion from more meaty games. However, the way the whole thing ends it\u2019s hard not to feel just a little short changed, not from the money spent, but from the potential of what could have been. \n\nThe game starts out with a Schmup section which, theoretically, you could win the game right during its intro if you\u2019re good enough. The more common outcome however is that you\u2019ll die, and you crash land onto an alien planet equipped only with a teleport gun. Firing your gun onto most surfaces causes you to instantly appear where the bullet landed, and this is basically the only mechanic in the game. Later you get a gun that breaks things, which you use to clear out debris that\u2019s in the way of your teleport gun, but that\u2019s about it. The level design then carries the rest of the experience, bending the rules what you thought were the limitations of your abilities as you seek out your quarry and try to repair your ship. \n\nOverall the game does a good job with its design. It never gets boring \u2013 and there\u2019s a really fun boss that utilizes the teleport gun mechanics \u2013 but it also feels sort of incomplete. It would be amazing if they added in a few more mechanics, and really emphasized the open world Metroidvania aspect a little more \u2013 something more akin to what [i]Supraland[/i] accomplishes with its similar puzzle focus. As-is the parts of the game that earns its Metroidvania tag feels sort of tacked on, and you\u2019re often gated from back tracking to get missed collectables anyway. The reward for having a keen eye is that you can upgrade your ship for the inevitable retread of the Schmup section introduced at the beginning of the game. In my case I went straight through the experience with the intent to backtrack, only to be locked into the schmup fight unable to collect the power-ups the game teases. Left with the choice of starting over from the beginning (and retreading old puzzles) or \u201cgit gud\u201d, I went with the latter. \n\nI think that it\u2019s safe to conclude that if you\u2019re looking for a Metroidvania game, this one will likely not scratch that itch for most. If you\u2019re a fan of puzzle platforming in general though, then it\u2019s a pretty good choice. Similar to a \u201dMini-Metroidvania\u201d I\u2019d recommend this to people that are looking for a taste of a Puzzle Platformer experience, but also don\u2019t really want to commit to a longer game. At its price point \u201cjust good\u201d is perfectly fine.  \n\n3 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1567435466, "timestamp_updated": 1577598334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546108484268188477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54883273": {"recommendationid": "54883273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054053187", "num_games_owned": 2089, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1675701481}, "language": "english", "review": "Good and simple.

You can beat it in about 2 hours as I did, or in as little as 20 minutes for an achievement. But it's not a simple left to right trip to the end.\n\nYou have almost everything you need to complete the game at the start. But in a clever trick, there's a couple of hidden items at the start of the game, which you can can only access with the use of your only real weapon, which you don't get until partway through. What's more, is that if you play normally and uitlize checkpoints, you can't actually get back to the start to access those items. So you end up in an interesting little game of dodging checkpoints to get it all.\n\nOutside of that, most of the items are straight forward, consisting of three health upgrades and some power cores which make your ship more powerful. Oh yeah, the game opens with a SCHMUP section and ends with one as well. So that's what you're leading up to. \n\nThe music is decent, as is the art style.

The puzzles themselves are never too difficult, but sometimes you are required to string together two or even three jumps in rapid succession to scale a difficult piece of platforming.  The game has a nice retro style and is very well done. The game is rather short as it takes only a little over an hour to complete a first run, but I didn\u2019t mind.

After that is when the game starts.\n\n[h1]What I like:[/h1]\n+ Fun and unique mechanic of the teleport gun which keeps your momentum for platforming challenges.\n+ Awesome music.\n+ Well-hidden collectibles which add power to your character.\n+ Interesting achievements which are not limited to simple game completion.\n\n[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]\n- The fake out start can be frustrating as the opening boss seems beatable even though it isn't and you are supposed to lose. When you refight the boss at the end, you don't seem any more powerful than before.\n- I wish the real final boss before going back to your ship was a longer fight or had a second form.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nThe game only takes about an hour to beat the story, but I had a lot of fun spending a total of 4 hours to get all the achievements.\n\n[h1]Want to see more about this game?

It looked like an interesting platformer, and the space theme made me curious how the game would play.\u00a0I played the game years ago on my laptop, using the keyboard to control it, and though I could beat the game, I knew I wasn't set up to earn all the achievements. Coming back to it again, this time with a controller, I got all of the achievements and cleaned up the game easily enough. It was fun to play on a better set-up for my preferences, and reminded me why I had put up with a less than ideal control scheme in the first place. \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nUpon crash-landing on an unfamiliar world, you'll seek to get a McGuffin, which will let you fix your ship and get back to familiar territory. You start the game with a teleport gun, which lets you shoot out glowing beacons that will transport you to whichever wall you hit. This will be necessary to get past different obstacles and make tricky jumps. \n\nAfter a while, you'll find the Gauss gun, which is just a basic firearm that lets you kill enemies. It takes 2-4 shots to destroy them, but doing so is quite satisfactory, as many platformers with mechanics like this would make you dart around them with no way to attack.\u00a0You actually will do so at the beginning, but it's not long before you're able to fight back. However, though there are enemies, the focus of the game is much more on finding secrets and clever platforming. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2138738192\n[h1] Controls [/h1] \nThere are only a few moves in OTS. Movement is controlled with the 'L joystick.' Firing the teleport gun is done by pressing 'X,' while shooting the Gauss gun is done by pressing 'B.' Jumping is controlled with 'A.' The controls are responsive and work well, though it sometimes feels clunky making the platforming work right, with most of the problem stemming from timing. For instance, when you shoot a wall, you can jump right as you teleport there, but the timing can feel a bit off. Also, in order to make a jump, you have to be standing on ground before you teleport, or else you'll only fall. It functions correctly and consistently, but as your jumps aren't that high and you'll have to fire across the entire screen sometimes, it can be tricky.\u00a0\n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nYou play as a space cop who is chasing after a nefarious outlaw named Grigori. Starting the game, you'll be in a shoot-out with them that leads to a mandatory loss, getting shot out of the sky, and crash into a nearby planet. You'll have to traverse the place on foot in hot pursuit, trying to make sure he doesn't slip away. There are some optional secret items and routes, and you'll converse with local denizens, but there's not much else to the story.\u00a0You don't get any background on the situation, any of the characters, or what justice would look like if you captured Grigori. \n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nThe game is made with pixel art, and uses square tiles to build the environment, with most of them being replicated heavily to create the setting. However, there's enough variety and little touches to change up the visuals and make it look more natural. Because of the suit, the protagonist winds up looking like an alien himself, and I don't know if that was a clever design choice (humans would be aliens on other worlds) or simply the effect of their design.\u00a0For a cheap game, the graphics look quite nice. \n\n\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nAs you progress through OTS, different songs will cue up and play. I believe they're related to certain locations, though I don't know how the developers broke different regions apart from each other. There's a decent variety in the tempo and style of the music, which is nice to see in both a short, space-themed game, but also a budget one. The sound effects that play from your two guns are distinct from one another, and make sense for the functions they serve. The default volume settings are loud, but are easy to adjust in the options. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2138739219\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f OTS blends platforming with a small amount of puzzle mechanics in a way that's not too challenging, but adds more than simply jumping around.\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf1f Enemies don't prove to be too annoying to deal with. That's been an irritation in other platformers I've played. \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\u274c When replaying the game, the captain's logs that pop up in several of the early areas is really frustrating with how intrusive they are. They do contain tutorial information and character development though. \n\u274c The game ends unsatisfactorily, with a tease that the game will continue in a sequel. However, there's been no sign of a sequel emerging, and it was released back in 2016. \n\u274c A few jumps prove to be frustrating to pull off consistently, though the game is mostly enjoyable. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d If you intend to earn all the achievements, unless you want to do so spoiler free, it's not worth collecting the optional items during a first or casual playthrough. You'd instead want to consult a guide, know how to acquire them all, and make an attempt where you get all in one run. Earning them all will also require multiple playthroughs.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udd0d Teleport jumping is something you'll want to get a handle on earlier than later, as it's mandatory to beat the game. \n\ud83d\udd0d There are some handy videos showing how to earn the achievements and find the hidden items. \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nOTS takes a while to beat the first couple of times you play it, depending on how much you explore and try to uncover secrets. However, there are alternative ways of traversing the early sections of the game, which uncover secret items and lead to a significant reduction in your time. These will be necessary to earn all the achievements, and is enjoyable to play through since you're oblivious to it the first time through. \n\nUnfortunately, as you replay OTS, it demonstrates how small and short the game really is, which I don't think is something you want to highlight in a cheaper game, as it disincentives people getting it. This winds up being a short-coming, but OTS is a good game otherwise. I'd recommend it, in spite of some quirks, just know it'll only give more playtime through repeated playthroughs, which would likely only matter for achievement hunters. \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/][quote]Visit Save or Quit for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1535377479, "timestamp_updated": 1608658061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739839255809783936", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44377866": {"recommendationid": "44377866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041699372", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1535244298}, "language": "english", "review": "This platformer is quick but very fun.

It takes way too many hits to kill enemies, and it shoots once per second (That's not an exaggeration, it's literally once per second.) so if you miss with these tiny-ass bullets it feels like it takes forever before you can shoot again.\n\nEnemies that, in any other game, would be satisfying to kill, are a frustrating distraction from the actual fun part of the game. I hated using the second gun so much that I tried to avoid killing things as much as possible because it was more fun that way, but that meant every room where you were required to kill anything became a CHORE. \n\nThen I got to a boss battle. I don't know if it's the only boss battle or if it's the end of the game or whatever, because I won't be playing past this boss. There is NO health bar, so in addition to using the awful un-fun gun that drains enjoyment from the game, you have to just GUESS how much longer the fight will take. Also, the boss itself is annoying to dodge. It's not HARD to dodge his attacks, it's just so painfully slow that I died from trying to dodge attacks before he shot them. It doesn't help that taking one hit kills you. (I had 2 hearts, but taking damage almost always knocks you into either lava or something else that kills you, so the second hit doesn't matter at all.)\n\nThis entire game would be 1000000x better if the gun shot 4 times as fast and bosses had healthbars.\n\nTL;DR: The platforming is excellent, fighting enemies is a painfully boring/frustrating distraction from the platforming.", "timestamp_created": 1531881933, "timestamp_updated": 1531881933, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43575679": {"recommendationid": "43575679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104652399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1531674121}, "language": "english", "review": "First impression seems decent.

The music was interesting to listen to (I only wish there had been more increments for volume adjustment other than just setting it as numbers one through three), the character and monster designs were cool, and I very much enjoyed the story, even if it was a simple one. \n\nThe mechanics of the puzzle-platforming was a bit difficult to get used to, but I did start to get more comfortable with it as time went on. There are quite a few secret areas and collectables that will improve both your health meter and your ship.\n\nThere were times when I would get frustrated with the game when I couldn't get to certain platforms, but that was more on me and my reflexes, rather than anything inherently wrong with the game. I never got stuck in a room for very long though (I know this because the achievement for being stuck in a room for eight minutes never triggered for me during my legitimate playthroughs - I had to force it by standing still for that amount of time).\n\nOverall, it was a short and sweet experience that was enjoyable and engaging.

If it cost more, the length would be an issue, but for this price? What do you have to lose? If you compare it to a movie ticket, this is a major steal, and I got as much fun out of it as a good movie, and about the same length.

The puzzle element comes from not fully understanding the portal mechanic in the beginning but learning it is so fun. Then the second play through doesn't lose its fun now that you've solved the puzzles. It's more about exploration as you apply the skills you've learned from the first playthrough. You realize there's this whole other game you didn't know was there until you had fully grasped the depth of the portal gun. Then the third+ play through becomes a satisfying test of your skills as you try to unlock the final achievement and beat the game in under 20 minutes. Really good use of achievements by the way.

That's exactly what it is, though I don't feel that's actually too big a detractor, as while it is very simple, it does it all fairly well. \n\nThe game's layout reminds me of 'Switchblade' for the Amiga. A fairly linear platformer, though there are a good amount of instances in which you can branch out and find upgrades. There are a fair few, though they're never far enough from the main path to feel like backtracking to get the main game is a chore. How much they're all worth getting is questionable, as for all the cores, you don't get much more than an upgrade to make an already fairly easy final boss easier and the upgrade to the gun feeling like it only exists to make the boss right before the final boss completely pointless. The health upgrades feel like they're the only ones worth it.\n\nThe mechanics are solid and fun, and for the most part, the level design compliments it. The main gimmick of the game is the teleport gun, which is sort of like a one-shot portal gun. You shoot it, and you teleport to where the shot lands. The reason I use Portal as the comparison specifically is that the game mimics its 'Momentum is kept' idea, where if you're jumping when the shot hits, you'll be jumping when you get to where it was, along with falling, etc. It's fun and interesting, and aside from a few screens, it all blends together superbly. There will be a couple instances where the puzzles might feel a little too dickish, but if you sit down and think about all possible options, you should be able to get through, it's not horribly brain taxing. \n\nThe music is certainly a high point of the game though, and I can certainly see why they chose to make it DLC to get a little more cash out of those who want to support the developers a bit. For those who don't, they can just listen to it on Bandcamp (Although for those who want to /buy/ it on Bandcamp, it's 5 dollars, which is a little perplexing). \n\nThe story is definitely the game's weakest point though, and there's really not much more to it than what's described on the store page. No plot twists or anything. I won't spoil it for those who do want to experience it, since even an incredibly simple story such as this can be enjoyable to some, and the game does manage to give you more of a goal than just escaping the planet, but it's really nothing award-winning. That said, this game was made (According to the developers) to be a 'fun game based on what we used to play in the 90\u2019s,' even following up by saying that It has a very simple story.\n\nAlso worth noting is the game's length. I don't believe in Steam's refund policy of a two hour time limit, as it kind of undermines a lot of fun games that are shorter than that. Most SHMUPs, some short story based games such as Grow Home (Haven't played the game myself, but has quite a following, and I hear the main story can be beaten in just shy of that time), hence why I'm not saying it's the weakest point for myself, though I know it can be for others. The game is fun enough to justify it in my eyes, but it only took 50 minutes for my first playthrough, and about thirty minutes for my second, which was an attempt at more of a speedrun.\n\nI did get it on sale a long while back, only playing it now that I'm going through my backlog and I recall it going frequently on sale for about 50 cents, and for that, it's worth it. I'd still argue that's it's worth for two dollars. If the length throws you off, I'd recommend it on sale, and if it doesn't bother you, it's a whole-hearted recommendation otherwise.

I don't know, I think this is a bad way to recreate '90s arcade games. Plus, there's no story and the game's quite short. Centered on three buttons, the most important being the teleport one; the other ones get you to shoot and to jump, nothing else. The teleport command will be of course fundamental in solving the small puzzles.\nI'm feeling quite lonely 'cos it seems that everyone loved this XD\nIt's also easy apart from being short anyways, and it can take maybe two hours only, more if you're hunting for achievements like I'm doing. \nApart from the very first part, in which you're teleported into an arcade horizontal shoot 'em up, the rest of the game is a normal platformer as you have seen thousands of them. And the shoot 'em up short sectiosn are really really bad.\nAs I said, there's no plot at all.. the enemies crashed your airship and you've got to obtain your revenge. \nAll of these things summed up don't make a bad game, but to me as an adult gamer seem overall a copy of a copy of games I was already playing in the '90s, nothing really new is added and even if the price is low, you can play lots of free platformers way better and longer than this, with better soundtracks too.\nIt seems that when you are getting used to the mechanisms (which are as I said the same as many other older games) the game's already finished.

MiniBoss has created a short, pixalated adventure/platformer game where you control Yuri, a well-known space police offcier that has to escape the planet he's on in order to save humanity.\n\nPros\n- Clever Level Design\nA good chunk of these levels can be solved in a multitude of ways. These ways will make you think outside of the box because if you don't, there is a good chance you might be stuck for a while. You can find ways to get through the levels quicker than before or find other ways to avoid doing the levels. You just have to find the secrets and tricks of each room, and like I said, they are very clever.\n\n- Challenging Levels\nAlongside clever level design, there are some that require a bit of patience and brainstorming before completing. The game has some rather difficult levels that stops you from speedrunning it through. Of course, if you beat it already it would be easier to do a second run, but the game offers both side of the spectrum in each of its levels, easy and hard.\n\n- Retro Soundtrack\nThe music actually goes well with the game. It has a pixelated feeling to it and it changes to match each level setting. Reminds me when I use to play the original Mario Bros, it bring great memories to me.\n\n- Smooth Controls\nTo me, I thought the controls were smooth and reactive, which save me a couple times during the game. It may take awhile to get use to, but you'll get use to it and continue forward. Your main concern will be getting used to the portal mechanics because there are some levels that you have to use the portal gun and it reacts differently to different objects in the game. In the end, the controls are crisp and quick.\n\nOther than those, this game does have its fair share of cons, but most of them can relate to each other.\n\nCons\n- Repetitive Gameplay\nThe first time through is fun, but going back and doing a second run may cause some problems. There is no extras things when beating the game, it takes you back through everything again with no change. It makes sense if your trying to get all the secrets hidden in each levels, but then after a while it becomes a chore going through each level again and again.\n\n- Short Game\nThe game can be completed in under an hour or even in twenty minutes (these are achievements by the way). It sucks that if your really good at platforming game, you can rush probably through this game and be done with it. Really, its a very short game, even when finding all of its secrets.\n\n- Minimal Content\nThere isn't to much to offer in the game, all you get is a few item that will help you get through the game and that' it. The game has some unique gamelevel mechanics, but other than that, there isn't much that will be remembered after you finished the game.\n\n- Other Minor Problems\nThere are some achievements that require you to go out of your way and spend quite a bit of time to complete them. I had to use a couple of walkthroughs to help me get them, which took me a while.\n\nMy Verdict Of The Game\n8/10\n\nIt may had been an Indie game, but there could have been more work put into it. However, it has unique elements to make stand out and be memorable to some people. The story was quite straigthforward, which I liked, but the gameplay was also quite straightforward as well. This made it nothing to special except for its portal mechanics, which I thought was pretty clever and it gave me a challenge to overcome. Other than the gameplay, the game wasn't anything too special, but it was solid and quite fun to play. To me, the soundtrack stands out the most to me since it fits the billet perfectly. It need a bit more work, but overall a memeorable game to me and to the people who supported this.", "timestamp_created": 1504541869, "timestamp_updated": 1504542029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34734644": {"recommendationid": "34734644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006478062", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 254, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1566546815}, "language": "english", "review": "Very decent, very polished platformer with gamepad support.

However, do not let this stop you from gettting this game, because at its core, [b] Out There Somewhere is a very solid puzzle platformer. [/b] The main drawing point of this game is the use of the Teleport Gun, which, as its name implies, teleports you wherever its bullet hits. There are many unique and clever puzzles throughout the game that utilize this gimmick to its fullest. On the other hand, combat is extremely basic and nothing to write home about. The game looks and sounds great thanks to its retro art style and soundtrack. Steam achievements do provide some replayability, which can be gotten within 4/5 playthroughs, and guides are available if you would like to obtain them faster. While there are many elements of Out There Somewhere that are mediocre at best, its puzzle platforming alone is worth it.\n\nTLDR - Very fun puzzle platformer utilizing teleportation, very cheap, but extremely short and very little replayability", "timestamp_created": 1499571895, "timestamp_updated": 1511403909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33389895": {"recommendationid": "33389895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174183035", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1589185654}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it but wayyy to short. beat it in just over an hour", "timestamp_created": 1499560102, "timestamp_updated": 1499560102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33382883": {"recommendationid": "33382883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103264863", "num_games_owned": 1214, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1499537525}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Teleport Fun![/h1]\n\nThis was an unexpected surprise. I went in expecting a cheap little platforming game and what I got was an adventure game that was short and very sweet.\n\nThe story is quite basic, but you start out in a scrolling shooting game and wind up stranded after the battle on a planet. From there you explore with the use of a teleport gun, all to find your nemesis and escape.\n\nThe teleoprt gun is pretty slick, and I honestly can't think of a lot of games off the top of my head that emulated this type of 'metroidvania' style game play using such an item. I'm sure they're [i]out there somewhere,[/i] but I haven\u2019t seen them. That said, it is a slick mechanic executed flawlessly in this game. The gun fires a beam that reacts differently depending on whether or not it hits a solid surface, crosses beams of different colors, or passes through bars. There's not a lot to explain here, it all becomes very evident as you play.\n\nMastering the use of the teleport gun and jumping becomes essential, and then second nature. The game trains the player through elegant and simple level design that will show newcomers a way through and experienced players a lot of previously missed shortcuts.\n\nThe games graphics are really excellent. [i]I myself experienced a bug that made it all look like a bad Atari Game, but there is a feature with [u]ATI/AMD[/u] video cards called [u]'Mipmap level detail'[/u]. The forum had some insight, but in my case, rather than going into Catalyst Control Center I had to right-click the tray icon and go through a few menu trees to find the option. [u]Setting it from 'High performance' to 'Performance'[/u] did the trick.[/i] Once I had the visuals working right I could make out all the little details that had before been a terrible blur.\n\nGraphically this is like a really well made Sega Master System game. I really enjoyed the style and felt just a little nostalgic for the old 8-bit era games. The game play falls into this category as well, being both clever and classic.\n\nSound effects and music are also well done, and in the same vein of those 8-bit era games.\n\nThe game is very short and can be completed in under 20 minutes (my record is 16 minutes), but has a good amount of replay value if you want to explore, discover a handful of hidden areas, and maybe see how fast you can complete the game itself. The game makes no mistakes, the player does. When I kept getting killed it was my fault for not paying attention to what was going on, or for goofing off. The game doesn't punish the player, but it totally rewards good skill and timing.\n\nI only used my controller to play this and found absolutely no problems.\n\nI've clocked over 8 hours and enjoyed every hour spent here. I would love to see more, even a sequel, but as it stands this is a solid platforming game worthy of your time.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Nice graphic style\n    [*]Good sound\n    [*]Challenging but not frustrating\n    [*]Tight controls\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Short\n    [*]Visual bugs for some\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict: 8/10[/b]\n\nShort but brilliant experience.

The controls even work on both keypad and Steam controller, so you're not forced to unplug the Steam controller then immediately write an angry review.   Excellent. \n\nWhat makes this game cool is that it has both a shmup mode and a platformer mode.  What makes this game uncool is that these are both retro pixel versions of those modes.

It feels like the dev wanted to make a metroidvania but quit halfway through because it was too much work. It is so short. One hour and I finished my playthrough. No real replayability either; I could probably squeeze another playthrough out of it to try and get to more \"secrets\" and upgrades, but the game isn't fun enough to make me want to sit through it again just for that. The metroidvania-style screen-to-screen progression is wasted when your game is this linear and small; it just comes off as a level design cop-out. The upgrades are uninspired and the one that actually affects gameplay, the gun, is implemented really awkwardly. It pretends to be a metroidvania, but doesn't actually succeed at anything a metroidvania does, and we're left with a platformer with clunky levels that just feels unfinished. It's like a kid stomping around in dad's big shoes, but with none of the charm. Meanwhile, it has two shmup sections, one at the beginning and one at the end. They're bland and rather slow-paced with wonky hitboxes, and they don't really tell you when you've gotten hurt. \nThe presentation of the game is mediocre across the board, neither offending nor dazzling. Mediocre \"retro-style\" pixel art and music only make the game seem even lazier. The levels look like they were made in a level editor for an actual complete game - outside of background setpieces, almost every single part of the environment is blocks with repeating textures. From a visual standpoint, this game is just bigger, uglier Terraria. The sound effects are unremarkable, and while the music isn't inherently bad, it's extremely loud even on the lowest setting and gets grating fast. \n\nI do have to give this game one thing: the platforming is fun. As a puzzle-platformer, this game shines. It's challenging, but not frustrating, and the wide variety of things you can do with the teleport gun really makes movement in the game feel free. The controls are tight and responsive (with the exception of firing your gun feeling a bit clunky at times), and I enjoyed the mix of puzzle solving and technical skill that the game encouraged. Unfortunately, this alone just can't support the weight of the game's flaws.\n\nOut There Somewhere is based on a good core concept with the teleport gun, but it doesn't go anywhere with it. If there was more content and the game encouraged exploration better, it could be a solid metroidvania. If it ditched the metroidvania level style and instead had actual levels more like your average puzzle platformer, it could be a solid platforming game. If this whole game was only the first world, and the game had more worlds like it with more and more challenges, upgrades, and progression broken up with shmup sections, the game could succeed as the weird mix that it is. But as it stands, Out There Somewhere is little more than a proof of concept.  As cheap as $2 is, there are better ways to spend your money.

Still the game gave me a lot of entertainment for its price.", "timestamp_created": 1489898885, "timestamp_updated": 1489898885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30600254": {"recommendationid": "30600254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158751197", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1552065700}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Puzzle Game with good soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1489868888, "timestamp_updated": 1489868888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4934043288230896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30582221": {"recommendationid": "30582221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271388790", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1495500351}, "language": "english", "review": "great game ,recommend for anyone", "timestamp_created": 1489806259, "timestamp_updated": 1489806259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45665016770362854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30577657": {"recommendationid": "30577657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029643508", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1489786558}, "language": "english", "review": "Was decent quick platformer. \n\n+was quick and didnt get boring\n+hidden maps were a good idea\n\nwas waiting for it to be a bit longer but it was a good game :)", "timestamp_created": 1489786926, "timestamp_updated": 1489786926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30568565": {"recommendationid": "30568565", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994987836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1449486836}, "language": "english", "review": "For such a cheap game it is realy fun.", "timestamp_created": 1489756507, "timestamp_updated": 1489756507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30566212": {"recommendationid": "30566212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102408722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1445097313}, "language": "english", "review": "Yep.", "timestamp_created": 1489745207, "timestamp_updated": 1489745207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47397768497467041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30563247": {"recommendationid": "30563247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021762271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1467710382}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an OK game.

The game has a really great soundtrack and overall a pretty interesting idea. It has a pretty boring story but that's ok in my opinion.\n\nThe big reason why I can't recommend this game is because of it's \"portal jumping\" mechanic, in the game you can't double jump so what you have to do is shoot your portal gun towards the wall and than jump in mid-air. It's very difficult to control and really hard to master. So a large part of this game is really just trying to get to a certain platform by portal jumping, with not much else going on.\n\nI got this game for about $0.51 when it was on sale so I can't really complain too much, but for me this game is definitely not worth the $2 price tag.

Aside from teleport gun puzzles and platforming navigation throughout the game, you have a story line that ends with a punch-line (a duh moment). The game is highly entertaining to play and I enjoyed playing it the first walkthrough blind. Now that I have completed the game once, the achievements keep the game with a tiny level of replay value. Some are definitely harder to complete because of how the game is designed (backtracking/forgetting something). However, you get to have 3 save-slots so you can take your time and have different slots saved to perform different acheivement as you complete one before the other. Or you can just use the guides present in the community if you aren't into hardcore solve everything by yourself :D.\n\nThe game design is mostly simplistic and the different mechanics makes the game enjoyable to master as you progress through the game. You will definitely see the game differently if you've played it once and play it again. The graphics aren't what you call the best, but this is a 2D game. For a 2D game with these graphics, it's definitely on the higher-end imo. The gauss gun is there as a way to kill your enemies, but I definitely enjoyed the game more via the teleport gun because of the puzzles.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this game to people that likes a puzzle-platform game that has a little more and can be played relatively quickly. I finished it in a little over 1 hr by playing leisurely. One of the achievement is to finish the game in 20 mins so this would definitely be a short game. 8.5/10!", "timestamp_created": 1487136385, "timestamp_updated": 1487136483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29931615": {"recommendationid": "29931615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135761353", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1487116883}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/263980/] UN BUEN JUEGO QUE DEBES TENER [/url]\n\n[i] Out There Somewhere [/i] como podemos ver, es un juego de plataformas que se enfoca en la teletransportacion, ofreciendo una serie de desafios bastante variados gracias a diferentes mecanicas que plantea, sobre todo los laseres de colores. En el juego si nos causan da\u00f1o nos eliminan automaticamente y regresaremos al ultimo checkpoint.\n\n[h1] Jugabilidad [/h1]\nEn mi caso lo jugue con un control de xbox y no puedo quejarme de nada, es excelente en ese sentido. No creo que usando el teclado haya diferencia. Asi que le doy un [u] 10 [/u] en ese aspecto\n\n[h1] Mecanica de juego [/h1]\nComo ya dije, se basa en la teletransportacion pero existen elementos en el escenario que complementan muy bien esto. Por ejemplo los lasers. El rojo no te permite teletransportarte, el azul si y el verte redirecciona tu rayo. Hay otras cosas pero eso mejor deberian experimentarlo personalmente ustedes. Asi que le doy un [u] 8 [/u] en este aspecto. Solo por el hecho de que es algo repetitivo y limitado.\n\n[h1] Enemigos [/h1]\nLos enemigos no son realmente tal cosa, desde mi punto de vista son mas otro elemento del escenario que si tocamos nos matan, algo asi como en los primeros mario bros. Lo mas cercano a un enemigo es una especia de murcielago que nos \"sigue\" pues casi siempre lo puedes esquivar facilmente. En este aspecto le doy un [u] 8 [/u]. Porque la IA no es un desafio pero cumple con su papel.\n\n[h1] Historia [/h1]\nLa historia es algo basica pero disfrutable, no es compleja ni nada por el estilo. La describiria como formulaica, pero aun asi no se puede pedir mas por el estilo de juego asi que le doy un [u] 9 [/u].\n\n[h1] Jefe Final [/h1]\n[b] SPOILER [/b]\n\n[spoiler] La batalla final es lo unico que no me gusto del juego, ya que de todas las mecanicas del juego, no utilizamos nada realmente. Es bastante pobre, lo unico que le agrega de novedad es cuando lo enfrentamos por segunda vez, y aun asi no presenta algo muy desafiante ademas de que es horriblemente corta. Aqui si le doy un [u] 5 [/u]. Porque no supieron sacar bien el potencial de todo lo que practicamos a lo largo del juego. para poder utilizarlo al final.

Cheap gold, at that.\n\nIt\u2019s a delightfully simple platformer that is much more of a \u201cpuzzle platformer,\u201d if such a thing exists. The game mechanics are very simple and the controls are nicely tight.\n\nThe game mechanics involve avoiding various obstacles (the usual, lava, monsters, projectiles, although there are very little and it\u2019s more trying to get around the level than dodge), and using your Teleport Gun which may or may not have been stolen directly out of Portal or something \u2013 I don\u2019t know, as I haven\u2019t played Portal. Whatever its origins, it\u2019s quite an interesting mechanic as it conserves speed, meaning that if you have enough space (and are required to do this twice) you can climb up an entire screen.\n\nThe game has nicely low quantities of threats, focusing far more on actually getting to the next stage \u2013 especially as you only get something that can actually kill mobs mid-game (and if you head back to that screen, they respawn) You can afford to misjudge a jump or a teleport and nothing bad will happen, really \u2013 there\u2019s checkpoints on most levels, and when there isn\u2019t it\u2019s usually because there was a checkpoint at the end of the previous one (\u201clevel\u201d is an odd word to use, \u201cscreens\u201d is much better).\n\nSurprisingly, the game does not through absurdly large quantities of obscure once-use-only bricks at you that you see in two levels and then never again. The only example is the \u201cMirror\u201d block, which reflects your teleport bullet horizontally; this appears in three levels and then is completely forgotten about; rather amusingly it\u2019s possible to complete those three levels without using the mirrors anyway.\n\nThere\u2019s two other unwritten rules of platformers this game breaks:\n- The final boss has only two, not three phases (three is a magical number in video games)\n- There is no screen whereby \u201cJump over the lava pits\u201d / \u201cJump repeatedly onto platforms\u201d\n\n\nSpeaking of bonus sections, despite being a rather memorable platformer whereby the main challenge is routing, meaning it\u2019s much easier the second time, the game has surprisingly large replay value (for a simple platformer). It took me an hour and a bit to beat the game the first time, but I continued to complete it about five more times (and a good deal of that was in Offline Mode, so that\u2019s why the playtime is so low). The game has this high replay value thanks to a large quantity of bonus sections (on your first playthrough you probably won\u2019t go through about 1/3 of all the screens), which are accessible from the get-go but you haven\u2019t learned the ins and outs of the teleport gun yet. And because the game knows that it\u2019s going to be easy and a bit of a slog, it makes the game easier for you \u2013 these bonus sections contain three types of useful stuff. It\u2019s also got interesting, not grinding, achievements which is always something worth noting \u2013 and also ones that you probably won\u2019t unlock by accident whilst merely idling through. Most achievements are either \u201cGrind grind grind\u201d (e.g. AOE2\u2019s \u201cWin as Civ X 1000 times for EVERY SINGLE CIVILIZATION (about twenty of them) or \u201cPlay the game\u201d (e.g. Terraria\u2019s \u201cChop a tree! Make an anvil! Find a chest!), and it\u2019s nice to see some achievements that you not so much have to actively think about getting \u2013 it\u2019s more they don\u2019t happen by accident. If you explore lots you\u2019re bound to get a good deal of them.\n\nThis is also the only game whereby I have been able to stunlock the boss thanks to some exploits in the boss AI, as well as fire more bullets than the final boss does \u2013 however, this requires intensive exploration. When you fight the first phase of the boss, despite only having one life his attacks are easy to dodge when you know how (although I spent a solid seven minutes dying repeatedly until learning how to dodge) \u2013 when you have four and a machine gun it does become a bit of a joke. Still, it is a lighthearted final boss in line with the light difficulty of the rest of the platformer. It\u2019s more puzzle than run \u2018n\u2019 gun, although not much \u201crunning\u201d happens anyway.\n\nThe difficulty curve is very nice, probably slightly too slow \u2013 but the game is very lighthearted and not meant to be insanely difficult. The game gives you a decently large quantity of hints in the game on tips of your teleport gun, but not enough to be an insta-win and also low enough to keep me occupied on a single screen for about ten minutes before finally working out what to do.\n\n\nProgression is extremely linear with the exception of about three cases, which is a bit odd as this game would have lent itself to a multi-route system extremely well. \n\n\nThe soundtrack is merely \u201cgood.\u201d What stops it from being \u201cexcellent\u201d is the fact that the composer had so many nice melodies, nicely hummable in their own right, and just lumped them all on top of one another in certain sections. To call those parts of the music \u201cbusy\u201d is an understatement, but one track \u2013 Surface \u2013 doesn\u2019t do that nearly as much and is much nicer to listen to. If the soundtrack was a little more\u2026 heh, a little more \u2018empty\u2019 in places (only in places) it would be \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nOh, and the game has precious little plot, enough to give you information on what\u2019s going on but nothing particularly huge \u2013 but unlike some platformers, it doesn\u2019t throw you into wacko things that should never have existed (why are there so many homing rockets and landmines in some icy mountains? Who put these all there and why is there a convenient route through them instead of an impassable barrier \u2013 that\u2019s Airscape for you).

There were so many times where I thought, \"Oh, this trick move won't work\", and then it did! So then what if I jump off here and then shoot my beam there, but before I land, I jump and then...oh, that worked too! The game is just full of surprises like that and all these puzzles that test your creativity, logic, and ability to exploit the mechanics. I also really like the pixel graphics - the art style is charming and memorable. I don't actually have any real critiques here! It's a short game, but it never outstays its welcome. There are even a decent amount of secrets and it'll take you a while to really collect everything. On top of all of these strengths, Out There Somewhere is really cheap - it even often goes on sale for something like 25 cents. You can't beat that!

Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.\n\nThe visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!\n\nThe game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. \nDespite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be \"surprising\", in some way, reaching escape velocity from \"generic platformer\".\n\nThe level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.\n\nThe one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. \nYou cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.\n\nSince the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.\n\n\nAnyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!", "timestamp_created": 1482317363, "timestamp_updated": 1482317363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565813899040222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28503054": {"recommendationid": "28503054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058391079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1482192202}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me about 70 Minutes to 'finish' the whole game.\nNever used my brain for that period of time - surprisingly very enjoyable and well designed game.\nWorth the money!", "timestamp_created": 1482308758, "timestamp_updated": 1482308758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500108182430267334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28495249": {"recommendationid": "28495249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027362212", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1499706547}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente me ha encantado desde el principio:\n\nBuena m\u00fasica, buenas mec\u00e1nicas, buen dise\u00f1o de pixel art y buenos rompecabezas.\nLa \u00fanica pega es que es corto, pero por 1\u20ac no pagas todo lo que vale este juegazo ^^", "timestamp_created": 1482273186, "timestamp_updated": 1482273186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28482994": {"recommendationid": "28482994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088025010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1465619149}, "language": "english", "review": "Aweful", "timestamp_created": 1482226030, "timestamp_updated": 1482226030, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.28603595495223999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28461762": {"recommendationid": "28461762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087239262", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1527192715}, "language": "english", "review": "Alot better than polarity that's for sure.\nNeat little puzzle game.\nworth playing with a controller.", "timestamp_created": 1482124348, "timestamp_updated": 1482124348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513651907444000244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28457135": {"recommendationid": "28457135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107463724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1481588080}, "language": "english", "review": "It's about time I gave this a review, considering how strongly I feel abou it. Just finished another playthrough of it, and I have to say that this game had me on a leash for my entire playtime. It could practically toy with my emotions at will, and has. And ninety percent of that comes from the writing, which is humorous, but still touching. \nWhile I can't give too much away (you might be tired of hearing that, sorry), I can say the characters are memorable and well-rounded, the world building is fantastic, and the twists always had me. That's probably the number one thing that will stand out about this game; the major twists (which you certainly won't find within one playthrough).\nThere are flaws, and I should be outright about them. While the character design is, as I said, memorable, and the color scheme really pops, the pixel art itself is not the best. It's not always easy to interpret what you are looking at. And while the writing is still great, sometimes it gets into weirder territory, which annoyed me a little. It also does go a little too far with what it's trying to do sometimes.\nThe gameplay also has a unique twist on the RPG formula as well. Rather than leaving things to chance, Undertale judges your hits on a simple quick time event, and allows you to simply avoid enemy attacks. On top of that, you also have the option to spare an enemy, if you can figure out how to calm them down. This means that every enemy encounter is a moral choice, and while that's usually a bad thing, here it completely works, due to, again, the writing. I found myself not wanting to kill these monsters after a short while, even though it raises your LV thus giving you more health. Still, sparing monsters becomes more and more difficult as time goes on, as does avoiding taking damage. It does get tiring sometimes, but the formula is shaken up from time to time.\nOverall, it had me absorbed from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it for the story alone, on top of the gameplay that manages to mesh with the plot so well.", "timestamp_created": 1482100419, "timestamp_updated": 1482100419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28445152": {"recommendationid": "28445152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191132985", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1606445963}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing. \ni love it.\n\naddicting and interesting\n\nadding a instructions section would be great!\nDevs listen to adive such as adding custom controls (Was super happy about this)\n\nBy far, one of my most highly enjoyed  and one of my favourite steam games.\n[b]BUY IT![/b]\ngreat story and great soundtrack (doesnt get stuck in your head which is a +)\n\nP.S GOOD LUCK WITH THE LAST LEVEL\n\n9.5/10\n-.5 goes to the last level D:", "timestamp_created": 1482060373, "timestamp_updated": 1503315285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554559707641601563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28408484": {"recommendationid": "28408484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344541359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1481908288}, "language": "spanish", "review": "para lo que cuesta y por la poquita gente que lo hizo es como un regalo, aunque sea un poco corto, out there of somewhere es una joya de juegos de plataformas y puzzles, y la musica MAEMIA, bellisima, vale la pena comprarlo con el soundtrack.\naunque algunos niveles esten medio mal hechos, el resto son muy intuitivos y de seguro te quedas atascado en mas de uno.\nun pixel art muy cuidado y niveles espaciales meh", "timestamp_created": 1481908429, "timestamp_updated": 1481908429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542483627796173096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28382838": {"recommendationid": "28382838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090427808", "num_games_owned": 1287, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1558722011}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun 2 play, ez 2 hunt achievements\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1481783535, "timestamp_updated": 1481783535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457413256168365479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28380201": {"recommendationid": "28380201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285764326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1480443982}, "language": "english", "review": "A hard as hell platformer, slightly a bit of a puzzle at times, but it's cute.", "timestamp_created": 1481766460, "timestamp_updated": 1481766460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28352355": {"recommendationid": "28352355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260219704", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1481713481}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1481674673, "timestamp_updated": 1481674673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470383286476135254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28337567": {"recommendationid": "28337567", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970291186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1481525479}, "language": "english", "review": "Just under an hour for a full playthrough, but a good amount of replayability for the achievement hunters out there.

Short and sweet, but doesn't fail to dissapoint you in the aspects of the game. \n\nThe game itself is a fun game to play. The story isn't anything to rave about, but it really isn't meant to be a story driven game. After completion of the game, you won't really feel like you have been cheated out of a story because the value lies in the gameplay.\n\nThe formula of the gameplay is well done. Combine the likes of Portal and Cave Story into a unique game, and you have yourself a couple hours of shooting portals trying to go from Point A to Point B while trying to reach the goal. \n\nThe enemies themselves aren't really challenge, and felt more like something to be aware of than enemies that you need to mindlessly kill. Killing an enemy was essentially removing the obstacle needed to advance because in all cases where the enemy wasn't blocking the way, the enemies could simply be portalled past. The bats got a tad annoying at times, liking to slowly home in on your character, but were a mere annoyance more than an actual threat due to you not being able to tank any hits.\n\nThe game was happy to provide you with lots of save points, mostly at the start of a room so that you didn't have to redo a previously completed puzzle in the case of death. On top of that, the save points themselves act as a respawn point, and with infinite lives, you were free to try to work out a solution for the puzzle without fear of getting a game over screen.\n\nThe beginning and end of the game consisted of pilotting your ship through space. I didn't truly enjoy it that much, as it's been done a million times over in countless games, but at least the beginning of the game immediately sent you to the platforming phase when you died. The end of the game had the final boss in two phases, one of which was in space. Neither of them were that hard, but the space phase, whilst a mere annoyance of having to reenter space after the fun platforming, felt needed due to the fact that the entire game revolves around you trying to fix your ship.\n\nOverall though, the game is short, perhaps a little too short. As soon as the game really started going, and you were doing some intricate puzzles, the game immediately has you enter the final bosses tower and the game simply ends there. In my own personal opinion, the game ended almost a little bit too soon after reaching it's potential. \n\n\nVerdict:\n\nPro's:\n+ Fun gameplay with a good scaling difficulty\n+ Good fitting soundtrack to accompany the game\n+ Puzzles that were fun, and with the nonexistant penalty of death, you felt no pressure to rush yourself.\n+ Graphics are nice for a game that uses pixel sprites.\n\nCon's:\n- Game is a little short, and feels like the game could have gone on a little bit longer once it has shown you its full potential.\n- Slightly tedious and annoying space sequences at the beginning and end of the game.\n\nOverall:\nHighly reccomended. The downsides are easily overweighed by the upsides when also taking into account the price of admission. Would easily buy a fleshed out sequel, possibly even shell out more than the nickles and dimes spent on this one if it was longer and improved upon the successful formula of the first.", "timestamp_created": 1478977944, "timestamp_updated": 1478977944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26558078": {"recommendationid": "26558078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258766093", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1478956461}, "language": "english", "review": "Best few cent that i've spent", "timestamp_created": 1478956646, "timestamp_updated": 1478956646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503305792808532715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26543147": {"recommendationid": "26543147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150897042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1493573290}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a pretty simple, yet fun game.

Goldfish bowl head starts out by flying a ship trying to shoot down space-captain-who's-his-face. [i](Can you tell none of the names stuck with me?)[/i] While the story and plot are pretty forgettable the game controls aren't in the slightest.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769464616\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The basic controls are straight forward, you move right and left, jump and fire a portal gun, later you unlock a regular gun you can use to kill the various hostile NPC's. The controls work, I have been guilty of mixing up my two fire keybindings, which has resulted in death-by-NPC-face-hugging, or teleportation-into-pits-of-death [i](For clearification sake, your teleportation gun fires THROUGH NPC's hostile and friendly.)[/i], the controls weren't so bad for me, but the game really seems like it was designed more so with a controller in mind.\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself, you start with just a Teleportation Gun, you fire a shot and when it connects with the wall, you teleport to the location of the laser/bullet. You actually have a few tricks you can pull off with the Teleportation gun early on, but don't learn about later in the game, so there is some skill that is developed with the Teleportation gun, rather then fire and teleport.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769463749\nSo once you finish playing the game, and if you start a new game you realize there are many hidden spots in the game that you originally had no idea where there. So that hints at the amount of time it takes to finish the game: it's a pretty short game, think an hour or two on average [i](Naturally the time to beat the game after your first, will rapidly decrease unless you're trying to find new locations and secrets)[/i].\n\nWhile I personally didn't find any of the puzzles too overwhelming, there's definitely plenty of difficulty to keep you mumbling obscenities under your breath as you get murdered again and again. While there's definitely more to the game, and plenty of content to keep you coming back, that's about all there is to say for the gameplay.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] As a whole, I enjoyed playing this game. This was one of the games I downloaded and played on my laptop while I was on a short little vacation away from my normal habitat. For using on lower powered computers I highly recommend this game, but when it comes to powered up computers that are normally playing MMORPG's or triple A titles... Out There Somewhere is still a pretty good diversion of a game. Pick it up on sale, play for a couple hours, go back to playing something else.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769464966\n", "timestamp_created": 1475189157, "timestamp_updated": 1475189157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623927950859069824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25717283": {"recommendationid": "25717283", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961098988", "num_games_owned": 896, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1474929681}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute little platformer that reminds me of a 2D Portal.

While it is short in stature, it makes up for it with the quality put into the the low price, sprite-work, and the gameplay.  \n\nThe game itself costs two dollars on Steam, so it is very unlikely you will regret your purchase with all of the fibers of your wallet if you dislike it, unless of course those two dollars were needed to save you from dying of hunger. Of course, there is a chance one might receive a coupon for it upon crafting a badge or something, further decreasing the affordable price.  \n\nThe sprites give off a very solid Metroid reminiscence, which is fair because the game was reportedly inspired by Super Metroid.  Each of the environments are tailored almost exclusively with each screen that your character passes through.  They may have an underlying theme to it all, be it uncharted wasteland to menacing metal, but they all have something unique in level design incorporated within the game.  \n\nThe game is built around a teleportation mechanic.   A specially designed gun fires a blue bullet that, upon impact with any solid platform, teleports you to that specific location.  The gameplay revolves around you, and how you determine when to fire, not to mention time how long the bullet takes to reach your designated location.  \n\nOf course, with all of those pluses, the game itself is rather short.  If you do not go out of your way to find any collectables, (and even if you do) the game boils down to a solid hour or two of total playtime.  Which is a shame, because the teleport gun mechanic is rather fun to play around with.  Another issue I have with the game is the way the levels are organized.  I feel as though game is very linear, each level designed to be a simple obstacle that prevents you from proceeding, so any unique level concepts are used once and left behind.  If one wanted to find the collectables aforementioned, they would have to backtrack through each of the levels that appeared to be designed in mind for separate challenges meant simply for providing something to hop through once and be done with, compared to games like the original Metroid or its remake, Zero Mission where there are several tunnels connected in a sense where you can be familiar with the layout and return without it feeling like you have to return through a single linear stretch.  \n\nHowever, the game is a solid buy through and through.

It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.\n\nStory - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn\u2019t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.\n\nGameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.\n\nSoundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the \"Classic Pixel Style\" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.\n\nOverall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short.\n", "timestamp_created": 1471263736, "timestamp_updated": 1471263736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24931169": {"recommendationid": "24931169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036633433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1481192642}, "language": "english", "review": "It was the best game for 0,1$", "timestamp_created": 1471256587, "timestamp_updated": 1471256587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24929781": {"recommendationid": "24929781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239023666", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1471206231}, "language": "english", "review": "Meme", "timestamp_created": 1471250768, "timestamp_updated": 1471250768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493704825639724731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24928418": {"recommendationid": "24928418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114505229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1463526149}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a very short game, but it is very cheap and the puzzles are lots of fun", "timestamp_created": 1471244194, "timestamp_updated": 1471244194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24923324": {"recommendationid": "24923324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087365166", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1472608530}, "language": "english", "review": "An unknown Brazilian gem that combines Metroid, Portal and a bit of Megaman together into a short, yet very fun platformer with Puzzle elements.

When investigated further, it is revealed that the game is a bit above the rest.\n\n\tThe main story of the game, is very simple, and is only there because it has to be in order for the game to make sense.\n\n\tCaptain Yuri and crew fight off the evil alien, Grigori, and Yuri goes in alone to stop him, gets shot down, and lands on an alien planet. From there he must repair his ship, and find Grigori to defeat him.\n\n\tBland and stereotypical as the story may be, the music is anything but, and ranges from chiptunes to electronic to orchestral. From the moment you launch the game, you are greeted by a dark track that gets you in the mood to play. While it may not be as memorable as Level one of Mario, or the Legend of Zelda theme, the music is still catchy, and because the soundtrack is $0.99 DLC, I listen to it in my spare time, in fact while writing this review I have actually been listening to the music to get in the spirit.\n\n\tThe actual meat of this game centers around teleportation and momentum to solve puzzles. There are two side-scrolling shooter portions, but I\u2019ll get to those later. You are given two guns at the start of the game, the teleportation gun, and the regular gun, with one heart, and one direction to go, right.  The main focus is of course the teleportation gun, which has momentum mechanics, basically, if you jump right before your shot hits a wall, you jump when you teleport there. There are also three beams and various blocks/mirrors that affect how your shot will land. Overall, the puzzle section is definitely solid. There are various power-ups, ship upgrades, and heart/health containers that you can find in capsules by exploring, but they are not necessary to beat the game.\n\n\tThe first time I played through, it took me 2 \u00bd hours, without picking up any capsules. The game contains plenty for a short amount of time though; there are two ship battles with Grigori, where the parts you collected come into play, and one boss fight that uses the mechanics you\u2019ve learned throughout the game, to go along with the puzzles and side-scrolling.\n\n\tFor the price I bought it, I believe that the game is very good, with a few flaws here and there, and deserves a solid:\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1470768949, "timestamp_updated": 1477273823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24788818": {"recommendationid": "24788818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088164161", "num_games_owned": 1053, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1440186126}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like a downgraded version of cavestory that also cost money", "timestamp_created": 1470724216, "timestamp_updated": 1470724216, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460431665182113647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24786179": {"recommendationid": "24786179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015874462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1468319369}, "language": "spanish", "review": "speedruns way", "timestamp_created": 1470705396, "timestamp_updated": 1470705396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24775127": {"recommendationid": "24775127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029186365", "num_games_owned": 1128, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1470503969}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth checking out if you like the metroidvania style.

The existance of relatively numerous NPCs suggest that there was going to be more of a purpose for them. Maybe for lore/world-building purposes? There also is really weird pacing in the game... though it is difficult to describe with the game being so short. I suspect (though I should note I have no idea if this is true) that this was planned to be a longer game. It certainly feels like there should be more (again, the price is very fair for what you get), and like many others seem to be saying, this entire game feels like it should be the tutorial/intro level of a larger game... and I think that was probably the plan initially...\nEverything points to that theory:\n[list]\n[*]An abundance of NPCs most likely for world-building\n[*]Stylized artwork for textbox profiles and the rare cutscene\n[*]Progressive upgrade system for ship, which could have been spread out over the course of the game, as it felt completely unneccesary for the boss.\n[*]Short to the point of it being unbelievable that the end falls where it does\n[*]See final item on Cons.\n[/list]\n\nI do recommend this game because it's a great concept. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't explored further than it was. Don't get me wrong, I understand the limitations that a small team of developers can bring...

But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.\n\nI still recommend it glowingly.\n\nA quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.\n\nIt is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles.

Crashing on the planet and needing to find ship parts (conveniently the same model as the shmup upgrades) reminded me of Knytt (in a good way), and so did the slower pace and early lack of combat. Puzzle progress felt steady and fun, though the \"double shot\" puzzle I managed to solve without learning the proper trick, stunting my progress in the next few rooms. I really enjoyed having a \"teleport\" gun instead of a \"portal\" gun, which felt very fresh as a mechanic. Combat was passable, with notable frustration trying to hit the flying bats, and not knowing how long the boss would take to defeat. The biggest issue I had was with NPC conversations, ending the conversation would not close the text box right away and another press would start it again; extremely frustrating.\n\nGoing back to shmup at the end was unexpected and exciting, and I didn't die to the laser!

At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!\n\nTeleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.\n\nNormal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.\n\nThis is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)\nI love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606\n\n[h1] Graphics: [/h1]\nThe graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2606\n\n[h1] Story: [/h1]\nThe Story is also well made. \"Brevity is the soul of wit!\" this is something fitting to its story.

(I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)\nThe normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. \u2191 up there \u2191\nI don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605\n\n[h1] Music: [/h1]\nMy favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks.

The game is most definitely worth that price, but I cannot say it is worth the full 2 dollars.  \n\nThe Good:\n\n1. I always have a soft spot for the pixelated, nostaligic graphics and sounds. \n2. The sound track is amazing and does tend to be stuck in ones head after you sit down the controller. \n3. The physics and animations were well done, basically perfect. \n4. I did like the merger of the side scrollinger shooter and the planetary exploration/platforming. I found them to be very   complimentary to one another in this game.\n5.  Personally, I liked having to avoid the enemies, relying heavily on the telportation gun. I liked the puzzle aspect oft his game, though it was a bit easy. \n\nThe bad:\n\n1. The game was too short. My first play through, and not in any particular rush to beat the game, took 40 minutes.  this is taking into consideration the time I spent trying to get some of the extra items. \n2. The developers said this game was directly inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but I fail to see much of those characteristics in this game. It is possible that I am not looking or thinking hard enough. I expected more weopons, different abilities that would allow you to progress, etc.  This game did not feel as atmospheric or epic as metroid and was not long enough to qualify for any kind of story, like Cave Story. \n3. The puzzle aspect of this game, while I love it, is wayyyyy too simple. Once you get the hang of the fact that the teleporation gun conserves momentum, you have beaten the game.  \n4. Not a whole lot of variety. I disagree with the main character when he says that 3 types of beam obstacles are too many. They are not enough. \n5. One could argue that this is trying to turn the game into something its not, but: I wanted to see more than one planet. I wanted more intermmediate shooter levels and more planets to explore. I'm not suggesting a re-write, but the simple addition of more content that is already within the bounds of the game engine.  \"I'm sorry, but Grigori is on another planet\" would have been an accpetable transition between levels. \n\nOverall:\n\nThe game felt less than half completed, like a teaser trailer of itself. Imagine the first mario brothers game, on the NES, if the princess was really in the first castle. That is this game. \n\nI think this game could be great if it just expanded on the content a bit. I am not suggesting anything revolutionary. A few more obstacles and perhaps some variety to the planet (or add more than one planet).  Achievements do not do it for me and did not add to the game.  \n\n\n\nFor < 1 dollar, this game can be recommended.

The game overall is pretty fun once you get a hang of the mechanics and such. The maps and graphics are designed well and the soundtrack is very nice.

The game is pretty short, about 2-3 hours depending on how good you are at thhe game and how fast you get used to the game mechanics. Although if you are an achievement hunter there is a lot of bonus stuff to do and a lot of secret areas. The game sometimes lags which usually doesn't botch you up but beware and the response time is pretty mediocre. I think the one thing that got me the most was the final boss battle. Note that the first level is a bullet hell shoot em' up but is very short and very easy. The rest of the game is a platformer, with portal esque mechanics. The boss battle is split into two sections, the first being a platformer in which you jump around bullet and teleport past lasers while shooting with your pistol. The second stage puts you into a scenario very much like the first stage but 10 times harder. I really do not like it when games boss battle are completely different to the core gameplay and all your experiance and skills gained throughought the game is completely thrown out the window. Although scattered throughout the core game there is little secret bonus items you can pick up to boost your damage during this level, this does little to improve the anti-climatic boss battle in the end.

En \u00e9l, encarnamos a Yuri, un capitan espacial que lucha para derrocar a un malvado monarca espacial llamado Grigori. Para conseguirlo contamos unicamente con una pistola teletransportadora, una pistola laser y nuestra astucia.\n\nEl juego, con un bonito estilo pixel art retro y una buena banda sonora, nos pone un reto en cada pantalla, ya que debemos utilizar nuestras habilidades con ingenio para poder avanzar hasta la siguiente. Adem\u00e1s, el juego cuenta con numerosos secretos que costar\u00e1 encontrar, y despues, obtener.\n\nEl juego comienza con un peque\u00f1o juego de naves a lo R-Type, donde lucharemos contra las fuerzas de Grigori. Finalmente nos encararemos con la nave nodriza del general, la cual es indestructible y nos tumbar\u00e1 irremisiblemente. Una vez superemos un aterrizaje forzoso, empezar\u00e1 la aventura plataformera de Yuri en un extra\u00f1o y desconocido planeta en busca de un orbe energ\u00e9tico para reparar la nave.\nAdemas de llegar al final y enfrentarnos con Grigori, existen otros objetivos en el juego. Por el planeta se encuentran diseminados 11 celulas de energ\u00eda, las cuales dar\u00e1n mas potencia a la nave una vez arreglada. Tambien existen varias reliquias que nos permitir\u00e1n soportar mas de un golpe antes de morir.\nEl juego tiene vidas infinitas, y una vez se muera, Yuri restaurar\u00e1 su posici\u00f3n en el ultimo checkpoint que se haya tocado.\n\nNo es un juego excesivamente complejo, pero los puzzles estan bien dise\u00f1ados y aprovechan mucho las habilidades de Yuri, el timing de las acciones y el entorno en si. Est\u00e1 muy bien que adem\u00e1s, gracias a aprender a usar esas habilidades, podamos encontrar secretos, algunos bastante bien escondidos. Intentar hacer todos los logros le da algo de rejugabilidad, ya que si algo tiene de malo OTS es que es muy cortito.\n\nUn juego bonito, divertido, entretenido y lleno de cosas que hacer. Dura poco, pero gracias a su bajo precio, es una buena compra. Le doy menos valoraci\u00f3n de la que querr\u00eda por su corta duraci\u00f3n.

While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.\n\nYou play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.\n\nThe game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn\u2019t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic \u2013 a teleportation gun.\n\nWhen Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.\n\nHe can also jump.\n\nThese two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun \u2013 including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.\n\nThe game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short \u2013 this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that\u2019s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).\n\nWas it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t entertained by it, but it wasn\u2019t high-quality entertainment \u2013 the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed by this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1458281941, "timestamp_updated": 1458281941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473498016595840454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21897220": {"recommendationid": "21897220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208784836", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1512690525}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is such a fun game and a challenging one.

Now when you read this (if you even bother) you will think this sounds like the crappiest game ever but you are wrong. Every time you exit the room and enter the next one you feel so happy especially when you beat the final level. 10/10 such a fun game. NEVER GIVE UP IT IS WORTH IT.\n\nP.S.

It had good reviews on Steam, cost less than a dollar (was on sale for 49 cents) and was reported to be a short game. I didn\u2019t have much to lose. Either I lose a few hours of my time or have a brief but enjoyable experience, fortunately it was the latter.\n\nOut There Somewhere is advertised as \u201cinspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid and Portal\u201d. Great! I love all three of those games and I would consider Super Metroid to be my top games of all time. The bad news is that the game doesn\u2019t really fit two of the games. It doesn\u2019t have the multiple guns, boss battles and exploration elements in Cave Story and Super Metroid. The only game that is an apt description is Portal. Buyer be warned!\n\nThe primary mechanic of the game is the teleport gun similar to the portal gun in Portal. The only difference is that instead of summoning two portals, the teleport gun instantly teleports our hero when the projectile makes contact with a wall. The teleport gun makes way for some very interesting puzzles. One common scenario is where you would need to shoot at a wall and quickly jump to maintain momentum after you teleport.\n\nAside from the teleport gun, there is a blaster gun that you can use. Not much to say about it other than it takes a few shots to kill anything and doesn\u2019t feel like it has a lot of impact to it.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to the story. In fact, I can sum it up in one sentence. Generic space hero gets his ship shot down, lands on a planet, explores the planet to find parts to repair his ship and once his ship is repaired he kills the bad guy.\n\nI finished Out There Somewhere in an hour. I could have spent more time exploring and searching for hidden secrets but the game never compelled me to. After finding the parts necessary to get the ship up and running, I wanted to explore the world more. Oddly when I walked to the next screen I was abruptly placed back into the ship and fighting a boss.\n\nOverall I had fun with Out There Somewhere. The game is appropriately paced and the puzzles had a nice even ramp in difficulty. The lack of content is concerning, but given the price there isn\u2019t much to complain about. Out There Somewhere shines well especially when compared to other games of the same price.", "timestamp_created": 1458184211, "timestamp_updated": 1458184211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21880173": {"recommendationid": "21880173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042565290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1449630302}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game with three others on sale, and enjoyed it the most.

As such I had some apprehension about Out There Somewhere.  \n\nI'll tell you that was some misplaced anxiety.  This game has a teleport mechnic that allows it to progress beyond simple muscle reflex puzzles and actually assess all the factors on a screen before proceeding with a solution.  After I completed the game, I felt satisfied.  I felt like I had accomplished some pretty interesting puzzle platforming, and I felt like I kind of wanted to play it through again.\n\nAll that being said, this game isn't very long.  I don't know how much time I spent playing it, currently, but I think it was about an hour(Edit: 54 mins...)  which was actually perfect since I was on a flight and after I finished we were close to landing.  I see myself playing this again on my return trip and probably enjoying it just as much.\n\nOne interesting thing I noticed in the options was the feature to turn on a timer, which seems an interesting little contraption to let you time your runs.  There's also a few areas I can think of where I may have been able to explore but they were early in the game before I really learned the capabilities of the teleporter gun.\n\nThat's another bit that's interesting.  They don't throw new items at you through the game to make places accessible, with the exception of a gun near the beginning.  Anything you are able to accomplish late game with the teleporter you can do at the start... provided you grasp the concept fast enough.  The gun you obtain later is really only to destroy blocks and enemies, but it seemed to me (nearly) every screen could potentially be accomplished without killing a single enemy.\n\nThe last bit I'll mention is that I played this game entirely on the Steam Controller, I've yet to find a platformer that doesn't work well with it, but I'll say playing a game on the plane was MUCH more comfortable with a controller in hand, rather than playing the part of a contortionist to access the keyboard wedged in front of me, though this is just commentary and doesn't affect my review of the game. \n\nAddition: OK, so since I was in an airplane and didn't pay for wifi, steam didn't register the time I'd played the game and wouldn't let me post a review with 0 minutes logged.  I started up a new game and can confirm in the 12 minutes of extra play time I found 3 screens I didn't even register existed on my first play through within the 'tutorial' section of the game.  So if you happen to be an achievement collector, or just like the game you can easily double that hour play time going through with a replay. \n\nIts worth the standard price(which is cheap as it is,) but if you find this game on sale, don't hesitate to nab it if you enjoy puzzle games or plaformers.
