Iconoclasts gets the recommendation; it does a number of things really well.  Visually, it's very well expressed.  Sound design is decent.  Musically, there are some high points, and it builds atmosphere and tone quite well.  I enjoyed the movement and puzzling mechanics, generally.  The sprite work is extremely detailed, and there's a ton of life and thought in the character dialogue (for most of the villains, anyway).\n\nThe Black:\nI walked away from this game after blazing through ~70% of it back when it came out.  I recall being ticked off about the stealth fight.  I returned to it recently to 100% it.  I offer some critiques with this in mind.  \n\nTurning boss fights into puzzles is an ambitious decision, and I respect it.  The down-side, is that puzzle logic and combat logic often don't mix well.  As a broad analogy, the best chess player in the world probably isn't all that great at chess if someone's taking pot shots at him from across the room with a 9mm.  Having to split focus between survival and discerning an enemy's gimmick is a really quick way to test a player's patience.\n\nThe Gray:\nFor a while I couldn't figure out what Iconoclast's visual style reminded me of.  It's very obvious, particularly late in the game when the sprite work gets massive and (intentionally) unsettling.  It's Metal Slug.  Once that piece \"fit\", a lot of the game-play and decisions started to make more sense to me.  I still found a number of the fights frustrating for the sake of it, but I understood what I was working with.\n\nI found most dialogue between the protagonists to be irrelevant.  There was a concerted effort to use them to tell an interesting story, and there was a high note or two, but most of it felt pretty flat.  (But that's just like, my opinion man.)\n\nMy penultimate thought is that Iconoclasts jumped on the bandwagon of adding a melee \"parry\" feature to their Metroidvania.  It's incorporated well; it has a lot of versatility.  Still, it's not a trend or a feature I enjoy, and I earnestly wish developers would stop doing it.\n\nMy final thought is that the boss rush is not worth your time, and I wouldn't bother with it unless you really want that last acheevo.", "timestamp_created": 1699852899, "timestamp_updated": 1699852899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150012180": {"recommendationid": "150012180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115970958", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1641060965}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has one of the most unsatisfying endings in all of videogame history.

I personally feel the game could have come out better had it been stage based, but we know the absolute obsession indie devs have with the former genre. Controls feel fine enough for the platforming tasks at hand, and you have a variety of movies to have you guessing what to do. Levels are more focused on puzzle solving with only some needing pure platforming skills, and all bosses are more concerned with pattern recognition than they are with pure skill. For whatever reason, the designer though that \"metroidvania\" translated to \"taunt the player at all points by placing stuff they can see but not reach until endgame\" at all points of the levels, which started being more annoying than anything else. Speaking of annoying, the platforming sections have a good deal of waiting to them with things dumb enought like waiting for the electricity to run out so a platform gets into position, or because you need to reset the bar, as charging it was way too convenient or something.\n\nTying all chests with the crafting system was also a kinda dumb move, as it makes the chets completely uninteresting unless they hapen to have Ether Fuel, the rare material that for lore reasons is scarce, and by dumb reasons is designed as the core piece of all interesting craftable item. The blueprints you find across the game are not good either, as for whatever reason you somehow need to find 3 different blueprints to create 3 versions of the same item, so whatever you find will likely turn to disappointment as it reveals itslef as your third breathing or wrench spinning extension.\n\nThe story is all over the place, and the plot basically exists as a result of psychologists apparently not existing in a world where everyone lets their emotions run rampant. Your allies are all horrible, toxic people, who spend most of their time gaslighting you into doing something, and apparently one of them needs to be befriended in order to make the final boss less awkward (and this needs to be done with answers across the game, so fuck you if already going solo, I guess). It tries to add humor every now and then, but falls flat most of the time, and the story morals are as subtle as having the dev poking your from behind with a pencil while asking \"do you get it? huh? you get it?\" [spoiler]It was particularly funny when you get to meet Mina for the second time, and notice right away that the entirety of the Isi religion exists just to point out that she's gay. By the end, after having like 3 climatic moments and the mood being dark as all heck, the dev breaks it all and makes sure to slam dunk you with the \"religions are stupid\" message with the final fight, just to make sure you got it in case the pencil poking wasn't enough.[/spoiler]\n\nNot going to stop anyone trying the game.

But I struggle to recommend it.\n\nIconoclasts was developed by one person. That's it. Everything from the music to the pixel art, to the gameplay and story were entirely developed by one person over the course of 9 years. This is an incredibly impressive feat. The amount of work and dedication required to build something of this scale by one person is astounding. But that's about the only thing about Iconoclasts that makes it memorable. It's not that it's bad but it doesn't allow its own strengths to shine and is bogged down by several issues. The fundamental problem of this game is that none of the elements of the game are great, some are boring or bad, others mediocre to pretty good.\n\nThe gameplay is decent. It has some cool ideas. You have a gun that you can swap modes on to fire different types of projectiles. There's three modes that you unlock throughout the game. The regular mode shoots projectiles with auto-aim but has very little range. There's a bomb mode that shoots rolling bombs that's used for some cool puzzles. And there's a beam that lets you swap places with whatever it hits. And you also have a wrench that you can use to melee enemies. Speaking of the wrench, it's the most interesting part your kit. You're a mechanic in this game and the wrench lets you interact with different things in the world in cool ways. But it's a prime example of an underdeveloped game mechanic. Very early on your start to use your wrench to open doors. Then you realize you can swing on hanging bolts with your wrench. So naturally, you expect more and more difficult platforming challenges using this mechanic as you advance through the game. But it doesn't really happen. There are a few wrench jumping puzzles, but not nearly enough creative or skillful uses of it to be satisfying. It's not a fault of the game mechanics but one of boring level design. The controls are snappy enough but the platforming and level design are horribly boring. You're often trudging through the same areas over and over and the movement felt too slow. I won't go too far into the tweaks system other than to say it sucks.\n\nAnother problem is the combat in this game. The combat is pretty bad. The main issue is that it doesn't feel like combat, it feels like solving a puzzle for each new enemy type as you try to figure out what tool or technique you're supposed to use to beat it. Once you've got that figured out, combat is a piece of cake. But it's also not fun. Fundamentally, I think that's an issue of poor combat mechanics in general. Your movement isn't all that fast, your attack range is pretty low, dealing with enemies involves using the specific technique required for that enemy so you can't exercise too much creativity when you deal with them. None of the enemies are difficult once you know their trick. That goes doubly for bosses. Boss fights are super rinse and repeat, easily predictable, boring encounters. I did struggle with a few of them. That is until I figured out a strategy that worked for each boss. Then it was a joke. There was no chance of me dying. The pace of the boss fights is also slow. Often, you're spending most of your time waiting around for the boss to make a super predictable, slow and telegraphed move that you can punish. Imagine playing Dark Souls with all the bosses on 50% speed. You're never ever at risk of dying once you've figured out their gimmick and seen the only 3 or 4 different attacks and they have. To be fair, the game does try to be creative and it's not a glitchy experience. But it's just flat.\n\nThere are also parts of the game where you have to play as other characters, and their controls and mechanics suck.\n\nTo summarize the gameplay of this game. There's not much about the gameplay that's actually engaging. The puzzles are easy and often tedious. The combat is easy and often tedious. It's just a terribly flat experience that feels like a waste of time gameplay wise.\n\nSo are there any good parts to this game?\n\nYes there are. The pixel are is amazing. The music is good but not great. But the most interesting thing about this game is the story.\n\nThe story is rather dark and pretty disjointed. It's hard for me to call it a great story because it's not. There's a lot of useless exposition on it and the dialogue is mediocre at best. But it's a good story told well enough. And it's genuinely unique. The characters are interesting. The setting is interesting. It's got good twists and turns. But it's far from a great narrative and there's not a satisfying payoff at the end. That being said, there is one moment near the end of the game that I thought was quite an ingenious implementation of gameplay and story. In this moment I had to make a choice that felt more visceral than any choice I've had to make in a video game before. Either do what the game wanted me to do to progress, or exit the game and consider my incomplete playthrough complete. It's really not much of a choice but it was driving home one of the themes of this game really well.\n\nUltimately, would I recommend this game? No. In 2023 it's not worth the time and effort it takes to play it. But if you want a unique storyline, it is a decent game. 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1699034478, "timestamp_updated": 1699034478, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568165242671966553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149335461": {"recommendationid": "149335461", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976925673", "num_games_owned": 769, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1698873598}, "language": "english", "review": "The movement and fighting is clunky and frustrating, the story is largely just a bunch of random vague references to abstract concepts and ideals and nobody actually knows what's going on.

Yeah, it's really fun, and the boss fights are extremely creative, chaotic and really satisfying to learn, but this is true for several 'metroidvanias'. What really elevates this is the writing.\n\nWithout hyperbole, this is my favourite story in a game. It doesn't seem to be for everyone, but each and every character was made with extreme care into their personality, relationships, values, motivations, etc.. If you replay the game you can see so many tiny details that a first-time player would have literally no way of picking out, but they're there anyway. Several characters, notably General Chrome and Royal for me, stole the show each time they appeared and have cemented themselves as some of my favourite characters in fiction.\n\nThe narrative itself is just as intricate, and is greatly strengthened by overarching themes that turn it from entertaining to deeply thought-provoking. So much about the nature of religion and human understanding is explored in such a nuanced way that I don't think I'll ever stop thinking about the implications of the ending. I've heard the tone described as unrelentingly dark by some, and it's true that there's a tonal shift towards tragedy near the middle, but I think what it does so well is contrast that darkness with moments of compassion and kindness, making both extremes hit even harder. This world has stakes unlike any I've seen in a video game, and on my first playthrough I genuinely feared for the fates of these characters.\n\nThe only criticism I truly understand is the game's aversion to explaining some of its gameplay gimmicks. Several times you'll be thrown into a fight and be completely unable to damage the boss, without any clear signals as to why. You should absolutely try and figure out what the game is trying to teach you first, but don't be ashamed to look up a guide if it's affecting your fun.

Unfortunately, this doesn't last long. The game remains visually appealing, but the platforming oscillates between being okay and unbearable and frustrating. The worst part might be the boss design, which is just atrocious. However, if it were just that, the game could have been passable. The biggest drawback of the game is its story, which feels like it was written by people who didn't know where they were going and, as a result, went nowhere. The dialogues are a pain and give the impression of being written by 10-year-olds. All of this makes the game a chore to play, and I hoped for nothing more than it to end.\n\nWith a coherent story, I might have recommended this game, but certainly not in its current state.\n\nFR REVIEW :\n\nBeaucoup de potentiel g\u00e2ch\u00e9.\nIconoclast commence en envoyant du lourd avec des graphisme magnifiques, une bonne bande son pour appuyer l'atmosph\u00e8re, et un gameplay assez simpliste mais dynamique. Cela ne durera malheureusement pas, le jeu restera tr\u00e8s beau mais le platforming alternera entre sympa sans plus et insupportable et frustrant, le pire \u00e9tant probablement le boss design qui est juste atroce. Cependant, si c'\u00e9tait \"juste\" \u00e7a, le jeu aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 passable mais le plus gros point noir du jeu est le sc\u00e9nario, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par des gens qui ne savaient pas o\u00f9 ils allaient et qui ne sont donc naturellement all\u00e9s nul part. Les dialogues sont un supplice et donnent l'impression d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par des enfants de 10 ans, et tout \u00e7a rend le jeu juste p\u00e9nible \u00e0 jouer et je n'esp\u00e9rai qu'une chose c'est qu'il se termine.\n\nAvec un vrai sc\u00e9nario, j'aurai pu recommander ce jeu mais clairement pas dans cet \u00e9tat.", "timestamp_created": 1696092468, "timestamp_updated": 1696092468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429292947053909302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147361433": {"recommendationid": "147361433", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962062015", "num_games_owned": 1201, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1696085036}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid metroidvania", "timestamp_created": 1696085099, "timestamp_updated": 1696085099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147320399": {"recommendationid": "147320399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426402767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1370, "last_played": 1643391775}, "language": "english", "review": "this might be one of the best games out there.\nis very special", "timestamp_created": 1696036895, "timestamp_updated": 1696036895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147237194": {"recommendationid": "147237194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198446906133", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1221, "last_played": 1695934383}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Maybe the real Iconoclasts were the friends we made along the way.[/h1]\nI loved every moment of playing Iconoclasts.

And I am so glad I did. This is genuinely one of my favorite games of all time now, I have replayed it 4 times and am currently on my fifth, going through challenge mode. The controls were a bit difficult for me to get at first (keyboard user) but I got the hang of it after a while, and when you get used to the controls a lot of the movement can be satisfying when executed well. The graphics and music are particularly amazing, especially considering everything is made by one man and you can see the effort put into it. Absolutely stunning. All of it. But what really did it for me of course was the story. It's told in a way that, I didn't expect it to cut so deep. The characters are so charismatic and full of life, I got attached to all of them so quickly and enjoyed all of their interactions. The dialogue is realistic and an absolute blast to voice with friends.

It is quite unique to what i have played in recent memory but not necessary a better one than others. \n\nFirst of all there is so much dialogue, events and weird encounters and even more weird bosses you fight than any average metroid-like game. And puzzles. The kind that are so weird that you sometimes don't know what to do, how to even start solving it. Do i need a item that i get later or do some weird trick with the grenade launcher or what. Sometimes you learn of mechanics by watching a YT video when you are so stuck and you go 'huh, didn't know you could do that'. Yes it is one of those games. \n\nGame page lists these among it's features: \n*Hours of nut-twisting platform action-adventure\n*Numerous densely detailed locations filled with fine-tuned action and puzzles\n*20+ gear-grinding, screen-filling boss battles stand in your way\n\nYeah there is a lot of 'nut-twisting' and 'grinding your gears' all right. Thing is this is the kind of stuff that attracts a certain type of people e.g. the kind that want a LONG game that makes you think and really try to absorb the rules of the world. Well i tried playing this in short stings here and there and it worked for quite some time until i realized i am just stuck and don't really have the energy to once again wonder what i have missed this time. It starts to add up as you progress even though in the end the advancement is quite linear. The problems and puzzles you need to solve to go forward in this tunnel though is anything but linear. \n\nSo a careful recommendation it is. Just don't expect this to be really casual in any way in the end. It has a relaxed mode to help with tough fights but puzzles can drain your stamina just the same so be careful what you wish for.

Although actually playing it, Iconoclasts is the type of game I would ABSOLUTELY enjoy. I'm a fan of metroidvania platformers. I've played a few Shantae games and The Messenger (underrated game) and enjoyed those quite a lot. So Iconoclasts was on sale and I decided to finally pick it up and play it.\n\n...DAMN this game is much deeper than I thought. I think that's a huge part of why I like it so much. The story is very deep, it was keeping me wanting more. When something major would happen it would genuinely surprise me and hit me super hard, like \"Oh shit, that just happened.\" \n\nThe reason I like The Messenger so much is for it's clever gameplay, fantastic OST, and amazing humor. Although with The Messenger, the story didn't hit me as hard. Iconoclasts does that job a bit better in my opinion, with how the world in the game is structured. And how literal characters die right then and there in the game. It hits hard. Really hard. \n\nThe gameplay is solid! I didn't 100% it because there's a lot of hidden walls and what not I didn't wanna run around finding just for the sake of \"completing\" it. But I did like the platforming and puzzles quite a lot. I only had to search up what to do ONCE, and it was because I had to backtrack to a different room to find a hidden path in a wall (lol). The abilities too are very clever, I would be using them in way I didn't think would be possible, or \"ohhh, I can do that now!\".\n\nThe music was.. alright. Nothing that I would go out of my way to listen to again, but it was delightful to listen to in game. Not bad by any means, of course. \n\nBack to the humor side of things, I do like the characters humor quite a lot. With characters like Royal, Mina, Chrome, Agent White, it was a blast reading their dialogue and having fun. And don't even get me started on the One Concern agent dudes too. They'll just be talking about whatever the hell they want sometimes, and it's hilarious to stand by and listen for a while. I think Elro is the opposite of humor, but even he has his own bit of charm. For how seriously he takes things, and.. not so seriously at the same time.\n\nOverall, I like this game quite a lot!

En cuanto a los bosses, en varias ocasiones tendremos que averiguar su mec\u00e1nica particular para vencerlos, la cual no es siempre es obvia y puede llegar a ser frustrante morir varias veces seguidas por no saber lo que tenemos que hacer (una vez sabemos como vencerlos hay que reconocer que mola que se lo hayan currando y no sea simplemente un machacabotones).\n\nEl juego me ha llevado unas 14 horas completarlo al 100%, desbloqueando un \"modo desaf\u00edo\" y un un \"modo boss rush\".

The player uses a large wrench and a blaster with various modes to solve unique puzzles and defeat powerful bosses.

Usually it took me an attempt or two to figure out what I was supposed to do, and then another attempt or two to actually pull it off successfully. But every time I died I could blame myself for not dodging properly or shooting the right thing at the right time.\n\nThe puzzles were pleasant, naturally many require upgrades that you receive along the course of the story, so you go back and handle them. And clearly there's plenty of hidden nonsense since I went back to try to sweep up all the mapped chests I'd been unable to open before making my final run on the boss, but still finished having found only 81% of the components. A few sections had you control other characters with different control schemes, which I didn't love, but they were generally brief.\n\nAll in all, a worthy metroidvania that doesn't waste your time (a bit more backtracking than I'd like notwithstanding), certainly worth a look on sale.

Graphically, it is very obvious that much love and care was put into this game. But everything else about it just... clashed.\n\nGameplay wise, it is very simple. But I do not say this as if it were a con. If anything, it is commendable how straightforward it is. It's impossible to deny how intuitive it is to just simply hop in and begin exploration immediately or engage in field combat with random critters. However, there were still a number of choices made that ranged from being 'mildly annoying' to 'aggravating', with my biggest complaint being directed towards boss battles. They're not hard at all once you understand that outside the first mini-boss battle at the beginning of the game, they're all QTE fights. But the amount of visual and audio clutter caused by these bosses makes it unclear what you're initially supposed to do. I ended up dying an embarrassing amount of times to the desert boss because i just couldn't tell how Royal was helping me. The dozens of games that I've played before that utilize AI controlled cross hairs on a platform game, this is the first one that I've seen that uses them to HELP ME instead of KILLING ME.\n\nPersonally, music is a very important factor when it comes to deciding whether or not I keep playing the game. In the first 30 seconds after leaving Robin's house for the first time, I came very close to stopping my play through because of how bland and generic the music sounded. Moving onto different areas to listen to a few more tracks did not change my opinion.\n\nStory-wise, its a bit of a mess. The game does not ease you into the lore of its world, and instead starts moving the story forward assuming that you already know what's going on. With what little I experienced in the 2 hours that I played, I feel that there's an intriguing story unfolding in the background, but I just couldn't feel bothered to see the game thru because of how the story was being delivered. It does not help at all that the character you control, Robin, was made a silent protagonist for no discernible reason, so  instead of being able to piece together on your own a view of the world by talking to NPCs and engaging in two-sided dialogue, you have to wait until the next story event's cut scene plays for the game to do that for you.  \n\nDespite my initial compliments for the art direction, I do not feel that a brightly colored world helps set the tone for a story involving an oppressive theocracy, especially when most of the characters engage you in a serious tone while their bubbly sprites bounce around.\n\nI feel that, fundamentally, there's a good game buried underneath all these complaints somewhere.

It has all the things his games are known for (tight gameplay, great pixel art, a killer soundtrack, elaborate boss fights) but refined and turned up to 11.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of divisiveness in regards to its narrative aspects for some reason, but personally I loved the story, characters, and world this game had to offer. If it all clicks with you then you'll probably feel compelled to continue partly out of a strong desire to see what happens next. I 100% completed this game a long time ago but I still think about it from time to time just because it left such a strong impression on me. I'd love to see its universe expanded upon more; Everything is wrapped up pretty nicely by the time the credits roll, but it leaves just enough questions open to make you wonder about its larger mysteries.\n\nMy only complaint regarding its narrative is that sometimes it moves along at a lightning pace with major events often happening quickly one after another (especially in the game's latter half). Some more gameplay segments inserted between those big events would have been very welcome. Not only because of how good the core gameplay is, but also for helping pad out the game's runtime more.\n\nOn the topic of gameplay: It's a puzzle-Metroidvania with a heavy narrative focus. The protagonist is equipped with an oversized wrench that she can use to interact with enemies and the environment in various ways, and progression is usually tied to using it to solve puzzles that impede your progress. Boss fights typically follow a similar style of feeling like dangerous puzzles that you have to solve before you can actually inflict damage. There isn't a single boss in this game that isn't ludicrously over-the-top in some way, which is always a big plus in my book.\n\nOverall, the excessive cutscenes and dialogue might be a big turnoff for some, but I honestly think this is one of the best and most memorable action-puzzle-narrative-platformers available.

Besides the starting forest-town you'll rarely ever find a need to go back to older areas.\nAgain, these aren't deal breakers; I just wish the gameplay was more.", "timestamp_created": 1680961009, "timestamp_updated": 1680961009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136266553": {"recommendationid": "136266553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213534573", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 997, "last_played": 1680867738}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game, awesome boss fights and great mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1680868446, "timestamp_updated": 1680868446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462645739316940308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136236444": {"recommendationid": "136236444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357636452", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1691183836}, "language": "spanish", "review": "que juego mas weno, comprenlo porfa", "timestamp_created": 1680821331, "timestamp_updated": 1680821331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136175675": {"recommendationid": "136175675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235881006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1683060971}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best metroidvanilla i've ever played :)\nThe graphics are top-notch pixel art, and the music is really cool\nGameplay wise, it's fast paced, all the bosses are very different and it offers difficulty without being irritating.\n\nThe best part for me is the story, for once it's a real STORY that you get wrapped up into, not LORE that you find happenig long before the game, and this story is really well built with endearing and funny characters, as well as some plot twists.\n\nI really recommend this game anyone who like this genre :)", "timestamp_created": 1680732959, "timestamp_updated": 1680732959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503816783428192139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136102721": {"recommendationid": "136102721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011738620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3357, "last_played": 1680617324}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked this game.

If you aren\u2019t in the mood to be bummed out today, skip the cutscenes or skip the game.\n\nI have to be [i]very[/i] brief with gameplay, visuals, and audio, because I need a [i]lot[/i] of words for the story, which sucks because everything besides the story is phenomenal.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs Metroidvanias go, Iconoclasts is near-perfect: a large world with many different environments to explore and secrets to uncover as you unlock new abilities, puzzles to solve, combat that is interesting and varied, and controls that feel tight, responsive, and peppy. The wrench weapon/tool is a fresh idea, letting you interact with mechanisms to solve puzzles and do fun acrobatic platforming. The game offers several difficulties, and most players should find one of appropriate challenge. A \u201crelaxed\u201d option makes you invincible, so you can play just for the puzzles/story. You probably won\u2019t need this mode.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThis game is [i]gorgeous.[/i] Colorful and clean pixel art clearly communicates the game\u2019s challenges, and the character art is charming and smoothly animated. The game\u2019s environments feel varied and have a unique personality. The UI is helpful and unobtrusive.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nIconoclasts\u2019 soundtrack is excellent, though perhaps not as iconic as classics in the genre. Its overall sound design is clear and effective.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI\u2019ve had to be brief in the other sections to cover what I think is the most important part of this review: the story is [i]awful.[/i] Not that it\u2019s badly written\u2014quite the contrary, with deep characters, lots of backstory, and some surprising and clever twists and turns. The few times it [i]wants[/i] to be humorous and charming, it shows it\u2019s able to; it just chooses to be deeply unpleasant almost all of the time.\n\nFirst, the characters. Robin (the player character), through body language, actions, and a select few moments where you can choose her response, is depicted as determined, positive, and helpful. Literally all of the other significant characters in the game are petulant at best and infuriating at worst. As you explore the other characters\u2014including your allies!\u2014you\u2019ll find a miserable cast of obnoxious, churlish, self-centered, pompous, self-righteous, narcissistic, fanatical, back-stabbing sons-of-somethings that aren\u2019t even fun to hate.\n\nThe plot is equally miserable: an enormously pessimistic, passive-nihilist take on faith, belief, and tradition that lays out several groups of \u201cbelievers\u201d and then largely depicts them all as foolish and awful\u2014including the \u201catheist\u201d viewpoint, which is carried by characters who act like complete a**holes. The conflict between all of these horrible groups culminates in an ending which is pitch-perfect in its cynicism\u2014and which I would have cheered if I hadn\u2019t already been in a frame of mind where I\u2019d just as soon watch the planet explode.\n\nMinor spoiler: [spoiler]Then, right at the end, Robin\u2014the only character who serves as a bastion of light in all of this misery\u2014is forced to do something that tarnishes her character as well. And it\u2019s not in a cutscene; the game puts that deed right in your hands. You [i]must[/i] sully her or the game won\u2019t progress.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story is so deeply unpleasant that I genuinely wish that I\u2019d skipped all of the dialogue and cutscenes, and would be concerned for anyone playing the game who struggles with depression or anxiety.\n\nWhat\u2019s most frustrating is that this plot and these characters would have been [i]delightful[/i] as a dark satire, mocking its targets rather than simply lambasting them, and the ending which so many have criticized would have been [i]hilarious[/i] at the end of a comedy.

There's a lot of mechanics and not all of them are perfectly executed like the passive buff system, but the combat is fun and the puzzles make you think. The moment-to-moment gameplay and story beats are really well paced with each level having small story moments as you progress through them and then get out of your way so you can play the game. Neither part overstays its welcome and the game doesn't have moments that are bogged down with one or the other. As much as the gameplay is fun, the story and the writing and the characters are where the game really shines. You really get a sense of who everyone is with their competing worldviews and what brought them to those beliefs. Everyone is governed by their ideology except for the protagonist, Robin who has the sole goal of helping people. She's mute and unlike most silent protagonists, her lack of speech furthers the narrative by contrasting her with those around her. Others bicker and grandstand but she just buckles down and gets things done. Her lack of speech doesn't limit her as a character though, she's incredibly expressive through animations and action and like the rest of the characters in the game, leaves a lasting impression.\n\nI played about half of this game, had some fun, and could tell it was going somewhere, but I moved on to play other things. That's not to say the beginning wasn't good, it was but I habitually try and move on. Recently I've been trying to make an effort to finish more games and this was on the list and I'm glad I decided to come back to it. This game really is something special. Its got the kind of story and message and theming that punches way above its weight. Its the kind of story you'd expect to see in some bigger budget game that cares more about the cinematography than actually being a fun game. But Iconoclasts never forgets its a video game. Even the emotional last few bosses go down with that classic, satisfying chain explosion you expect from a retro run and gun game.

The base gameplay of exploring the world and fighting overworld enemies is mediocre at best, but the story, worldbuilding, and bosses make playing through it worth it.\n\nSo the base gameplay is exploring mostly linear areas as the main character Robin.  You attack with a wrench and a stungun and as the game goes on you will obtain a few additional wrench abilities and gun types that open up additional areas, as is typical with metroidvanias.  The problem arises in that your moveset isn't very varied, and the tools you're given are very frontloaded so you reach your final form so to speak relatively quickly.  Its not bad, but your toolset (ironically despite being a mechanic) is just not as deep as you'll find in other metroidvanias so it just isn't exciting.  This stops mattering however, once you get into a boss fight. The bosses in the game are the best parts of the gameplay.  There are a lot of them in the game and each one feels unique with its own distinct moveset and strategies to fight them.  Finding a new one is definitely the highlight of exploration.\n\nLets get into the story then.\n\nLets get the downsides out of the way first.  There are times in the dialogue where the delivery falls flat.  It isn't often enough to ruin it as a whole, but there's a decent amount of cringe.  The most prime example is that there's a pretty important character who travels with you throughout the game, and pretty much every other character in the game who meets her makes the same lame cringe joke about her being smelly.  Another bad aspect of the game is the sheer amount of jargon that it throws at you, especially early on in the game.  The game will highlight important phrases and concepts to try to make it easier to understand, but there are a lot of times that you will open a lorebook and get assaulted by a wall of text full of words you have no idea what they're referring to.  By the end of the game you will come to understand it all naturally as these concepts are introduced in more detail to you one at a time, but in the beginning these lorebooks are very overwheliming and I recommend not trying too hard to understand them at first.\n\nIf you can get past the cringe and jargon, the story and world thats there is immensely interesting.  The worldbuilding is very deep and unique and the story has many unexpected twists and turns.  The characters that you meet along the way are also generally pretty interesting (again if you can ignore the occasional bit of cringe).  There is a wide array of them and I always found myself wanting to see what would happen to them next, especially the villains.  I don't want to get into any more details because it's worth it to experience all of it blind so I can't say any more than this, but these aspects are probably the strongest the game has to offer.\n\nIn summary, the metroidvania gameplay is okay and is saved by its bosses.  If your biggest want from the game is fun exploration and finding powerups then this game might be a miss for you.  However if you're looking for a strong narrative experience with some engaging bosses littered all along the way then you should pick this one up.", "timestamp_created": 1673647205, "timestamp_updated": 1673647403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570165693759918213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130653158": {"recommendationid": "130653158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965303700", "num_games_owned": 956, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1172, "last_played": 1547355690}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most memorable MVs I've played. it has unique mechanics (har har) with the wrench and the story goes absolutely batsh!t.

It might sound shallow, but this is what I dream the standard for pixel graphics was. The GBA aesthetic, the quality of the animations and the amount of effort put into every detail is just too amazing to go unrewarded.\nSecondly, the game is just really solid mechanically. The puzzles are good, the boss battles are varied and well designed.\n\nHowever, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I forced myself to finish this game, for two really big reasons.\nThe writing just sucks, and it's way, way, way too intrusive. It doesn't do a good job to introduce you to the admitedly interesting setting and it doesn't do a good job trying to keep you there. Dialogues with unlikeable \"quirky\" characters are around every corner, keeping you stuck for minutes. As absurd and ill-fitting as the ending was, it being (mostly) wordless was a pleasant if jarring surprise.\nThe game also poorly rewards exploration in two ways. Most of what you can find are materials to build upgrades, of which you can equip three. After crafting a couple I couldn't find a single new one I wanted, so I soon stopped caring about opening chests. On top of that the game makes backtracking through certain environment a really annoying affair, meaning that if it's not disinterest that will kill your treasure hunting it will probably be frustration.\n\nIn the end it's the nature of this game that emotionally affected me the most rather than the story.

The diverse cast draws you in and you really get attached the the main character. \n\nI had such high hopes for the narrative, but it falls flat by the end. Creative and crafty storytelling becomes predictable and, in some cases, insensitive. Characters who show promising growth in the beginning fail to change or learn from their mistakes at EVERY, single opportunity given to them. But one of the most grating aspects of the narrative is how often other characters insistently bully the games second main character, Mina, for her rank odor. \n\nThis detail is established at the start of the game and is treated like a running joke that fails to be funny. This game pits white westerners versus brown easterners and thought it was appropriate to label the brown easterner as smelly and never fix the issue of her smell. At one point, a mock enemy will claim to be able to smell her which will get you caught during the stealth mission. Since \"brown easterners are smelly\" is a real stereotype, it just seemed weird to make it the only one in this game and apply it to a young woman. As the game goes on, it becomes irritating to hear especially when the character's disposition could have easily been fixed and used as a growth opportunity. \n\nPoor character development (Elro and Royal), unbeatable and annoying enemies, and a less than stellar climax has me walking away from Iconoclasts really disappointed after seeing what it could have been. \n\n3/5 stars", "timestamp_created": 1672626073, "timestamp_updated": 1672626073, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493150681257247925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129903574": {"recommendationid": "129903574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981078497", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1688935224}, "language": "english", "review": "buy it", "timestamp_created": 1672624716, "timestamp_updated": 1672624716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448548823595046997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129855937": {"recommendationid": "129855937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325919654", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 820, "last_played": 1672541029}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a wonderful adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1672580589, "timestamp_updated": 1672580589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560775518417358398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129827872": {"recommendationid": "129827872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180827889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1216, "last_played": 1591908050}, "language": "english", "review": "A hidden gem of a game, its world and story are amazing\n\nthe plot is rich and full of depth and its beautiful, one of the few games i teared up at \n\nthe scenery is beautiful and proves that pixel art is truly an art medium that shouldn't be ignored\n\nthe actual gameplay is fun and inventive with tons of puzzles and places  to explore.

They introduce several concepts and organizations at the beginning that ultimately all end up being basically the same organization. While it is a comedy the weird silliness of the one concern is very forgivable because they are COMICALLY inept. Regardless if it is blowing up their own people, accidently hiring known criminals or any dialogue featuring Chrome or White.\nThe second half of the game is just them throwing a bunch of vague nonsense at you trying desperately to get you to take the game seriously. They basically reinvent part of the start of the game to have the brother be a highly wanted and dangerous criminal for no real reason since at the time they were getting him on a different criminal charge. This brother then goes on to make literally every wrong decision for the rest of the game. At the end they just start having bosses appear for no reason to act as speedbumps without any actual foreshadowing or reason.

There is backtracking if you want, but you shouldn't do it, because all you get is upgrade resources for tweaks (basically charms) which are really good, they are sort of weak, but also they disable as you take damage and you have to do various to re-enable them, meaning skilled people get a helping hand they don't need and unskilled people don't get to make use of the system much. I played this expecting a metroidvania the first time and I didn't have a very good experience and quit shortly before the ending (didn't know I was that close) because it's very frustrating playing it. Playing it for what it is however, I enjoyed it a lot this time, both the stories and the actual gameplay. The only major criticism I have against the game except for the largely pointless tweaks system is at times poor communication on how to beat/damage certain enemies. Not just bosses (which is fine to some extent, though some are obtuse), but regular enemies too. I'll take an example (but there are more). There is one tell (a green circle around an enemy when doing a move that through the entire game mean one thing - swing your wrench to counter the attack. But toward the very end and only one specific enemy it means \"use the switch gun\" this is not communicated in any way, I had to look up a guide to figure it out. There are more examples of this.

It was even on sale. Nice!\nI normally like to 100% games of the genre, so I was ready for a grand old double-digit hour long playthrough of exploration and ability unlocks. But well before the half-way point I was watching the progress percentage in the save menu like a hawk, hoping it would go up faster because I was ready to be done with this game.\nTo give credit where due, the art in this game is excellent. Very nice 16-bit pixel animation, with vibrant stages and enemies. But everything other than that suffers from too much ambition and a lack of focus on getting the basic mechanics of the game right.\nThe story/writing, of which there is A LOT of for a game of this length, tries to punch far above its actual competence level; the philosophies and \"inner conflicts\" of all main cast are far from subtle, and interrupt the actual gameplay with frequency. Which would be less of an issue if more of the characters were likable. Mina, Royal, Elro, Chrome, and most of the supporting cast are not. \nBut that could be well overlooked if the actual gameplay was on point. But it just isn't. Hit boxes and interaction points are fuzzy, making puzzles more frustrating than difficult because the mechanics are holding you back. Also, many of the environmental puzzles only help to draw attention to the awkward limitations on how your character can attack/aim/interact with the world compared to most other games in the genre. Combat encounters can be frustrating because, while the game is MOSTLY good at communicating what the trick is for any given enemy, the slop in how your attacks might register can make it seems like you need to try a different tactic, and this can be true after repeated attempts.\nThe character improvement is very thin. With tweaks rarely feeling of much consequence or importance. Some of the weapons/items are very nifty, but that shine inevitably gets sullied by some puzzle made unreasonably fiddly by the loose gameplay.\nAlso, as a final bad taste, [spoiler]the game checkpoints you as you walk into the final boss room, despite there being a save point a few rooms over and no combat between. This prevents you from changing tweaks with a reset(?) if you wanted to... [/spoiler]\nI was unhappy with the experience, but relieved it was over when the credits rolled.

I was initially drawn to it because of the art style, and the beautiful main character, however after beating it after 11 hours, I'm so glad I'm finally done with it. It's held me hostage for so long. Though my review says I don't recommend it, I merely am not recommending it to people in general. I'm sure that this game will appeal to a minority, and I address this in my review\n\nI've just beaten the game after slogging through the last 3 hours of it, and I cannot say I feel accomplished in doing so, nor will I ever pick it up and play it again.\n\nThe game cannot justify its length with its lackluster gameplay, and the story of the game (while interesting) Isn't enough substance to make the player want to continue. I don't believe I would ever subject myself to playing it ever again.\n\nSo where do I even begin?\n\n\n                                                                                   ===\n                                                                                   ART\n                                                                                   ===\nThe art style of the game is beautiful and charming. Character sprites have fluid movements, and the environments are all interesting from a visual standpoint. Our main protagonist is a silent buxom blonde, with a heart of gold, supported by a cast of other interesting and quirky characters. The game is far from political, besides its theme of hurrr religion bad, and isn't afraid to craft characters with beautiful physical features, which is a breathe of fresh air in todays world of dumbing down, or making characters outright ugly.\n\n                                                                                 =====\n                                                                                 STORY\n                                                                                ======\nWhile others may dislike the story, It was literally the only thing that kept me playing. I was interested in the mystery behind Ivory, why the planet kept shaking every 5 minutes during gameplay, and history and technology within the world. I do think there are many dialogue heavy moments that interrupt the flow of the game, but after realizing the gameplay wasn't going to change at all for the next 6 hours, I didn't mind the various interactions between the characters. \n\nWhat I hate about the story is how the ending isn't explained at all.. The game spends all this time building up to what is essentially a confrontation with god, only to subvert your expectations with a completely different final boss. Then once you off that final boss, It isn't explained who he was, or where he came from, thus leaving you to pick up the pieces on your own. I extremely hate when stories do this, and if you're going to force me to slog through 11 hours of your repetitive gameplay and dialogue, you could at least explain what the fuck is going on in the ending.\n\n\n\n                                                                                 =====\n                                                                                 MUSIC\n                                                                                ======\nA lot of the music is forgettable. This isn't exactly to say the music is bad, it just has many generic scores that don't try to stand out. They serve their purpose, and I suppose that's good enough. There were some tracks that I bumped to for a bit, but most of the music is pretty bare bones.\n\n\n                                                                             =====================\n                                                                             GAMEPLAY (hardest mode)\n                                                                             =====================\n\nOh boy, where do I even start. Mechanically, the game is interesting for the first 2 hours. You're given your tools you'll be using for pretty much the entire game within these two hours, hoping for the gameplay to change or shift besides a one off puzzle or mechanic, but it never does. Any new item or ability your character gains only serves to progress them through the specific environmental puzzle they find themselves tackling. The combat never changes, and the weapons you're given don't feel like weapons, but rather tools used to solve puzzles. This may be okay for some who are merely stimulated through overcoming a puzzle, but for those looking for interesting and engaging combat, you will be left disappointed.\n\nThe bosses were the most fun part about the combat (except for the infamous ASH fight, seriously, fuck this boss) and each boss I faced was a breathe of fresh air after the slog it took to get there. I believe that the creator wanted to put various mechanics in the game (as is evident by the plethora of stealth sections) but never committed to one exact style of gameplay. This means you get a variety of different types of gameplay, at the cost of the game being a jack of all trades and master of absolutely none of them.\n\nThe level design is by far the weakest of all aspects of the gameplay. I'm not only talking about the infamous tower level, which literally took me a good hour of riding elevators and navigating hallways that look the exact same, only to find one specific key to progress. I'm more so talking about how off the levels feel as you traverse them. They feel like rat mazes with puzzles littered throughout them, and aren't really fun to traverse. \n\nOne of the most dreadful parts of the game is getting stuck in an area trying to figure out what convoluted solution to a puzzle or hidden area you missed, which has you back tracking and exploring the entire length of the level for minutes, only to realize you missed one switch, key, or hidden door.\n\n\n\n                                                                                ===============\n                                                                                 FINAL THOUGHTS\n                                                                                ===============\n\nI started off hopeful when I first began playing this game.

Iconoclasts is not that game. It's not a bad one, but I was not in its target audience.\n\nI passed up on Iconoclasts initially because of its association with the notably scummy publisher Dangen Entertainment and would not have purchased it directly through Steam either way. On top of that, I gave it a try through alternative means and left off of it, something about its gameplay rubbing me the wrong way. This is definitely a title I would give a \"thumbs sideways\" if Steam allowed for such. \n\nAfter receiving a key for it from a friend, I resolved to give it a more serious attempt. What I got was a game with quality art, dialogue and storytelling whose mechanics constantly get in the way of the former, at least for me. It's rare for a game to make me feel as many different things as Iconoclasts did, and not just because of the harsh juxtaposition of its cute sprite art with a dark and at times bleak narrative.\n\nIconoclasts deliberately cloaks much of its backstory for plot reasons, so I suppose I will as well. I will say that you are Robin, a plucky blonde mechanic with a stun gun and a very large wrench, in a society that relies on mysterious \"Ivory\" fuel as the basis of its civilization, where performing a job that you were not assigned to do by the all-seeing \"One Concern\" electric company, thus defying the will of \"He\" and his representative  \"Mother\", is considered an outright sin and grounds for having you and your entire house flattened from orbit as \"Penance.\" Robin, of course, is not an assigned mechanic. Whoops. What ensues is a surprisingly emotional tale of grief, recovery, wanting to do the best by people, overcoming the expectations of others and, of course, the dangers of theocratic rule- a lesson that I suspect we will need to take to heart in the coming years.\n\nGameplay wise, you can call Iconoclasts a Metroidvania, through it is much more linear then then most of those for much of its runtime, and it's really more of a puzzle platformer then a Metroidvania, lacking not only the power fantasy found in Metroid and the RPG mechanics of the Symphony of the Night-style Castlevanias but much of the quality of life found in most similar indie titles. Robin can use her Wrench and various ammo types for her stun gun to manipulate physics objects in the environment, and you typically cannot proceed from one room to the next on your first trip through a region without solving a number of puzzles. Some bombshell line of dialogue or plot element is dropped in nearly every cutscene after the first quarter-to-third of the game, and each time I was eager to see what happened next before nearly groaning audibly when I was faced with yet another puzzle room. \n\nFurther complicating matters is the game's relative lack of equipment progression- you receive a small handful of wrench and gun upgrades over the course of the game, with all other improvements relegated to its fairly asinine \"wrench tweak\" system. Scattered throughout the game and sometimes in hidden areas are chests containing crafting materials used to make said tweaks, which can be equipped up to three at a time and grant bonuses of varying usefulness, such as the ability to ignore one hit's damage, run faster, hold your breath for longer, etc. Any damage you take, any at ALL, breaks one of your tweaks- three hits and they're all broken, and have to be repaired by gathering \"Ivory squares\" from defeated enemies, parrying enemy attacks, and completing puzzles. Oh, I didn't mention the parry mechanic before? Well, I was about as good at using that as I was in Dark Souls. Which is to say, effectively not. In addition, there are no maximum health upgrades whatsoever. At the very least, there is no ammo mechanic- some of the stun gun's attacks overheat though. On top of that, interacting with save statues does not repair your tweaks, though it at least restores your health.\n\nThe feel of Iconoclasts' combat seems specifically designed to punish players like me in particular, someone who not only prefers the controls of a First-Person Shooter, driving game, strategy game, shoot-em-up and just about anything else except maybe fighting games to platformers, but someone who grew up playing DOS and Windows games instead of a console and has never been as comfortable with a controller as with a mouse and keyboard- a setup that platform game designers seem to have it out for- those of Hollow Knight in particular.  I got hit again and again, managing to struggle my way through Iconoclasts' combat encounters largely due to the fact that it frequently grants you mercy-health items, especially when defeating the flunky add enemies in boss fights. Add to this some irritating bonus bosses that I simply decided to skip after a few attempts given my general dissatisfaction with the combat, and you have one of my least favorite games I've ever finished. And quite frankly, were it not for the story I've given up on the game and maybe even downvoted it.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is surprisingly mid for what is otherwise an aesthetically high-level indie platformer.\n\nIconoclasts is, in summary, a mixed bag. I can't rightly call it a bad game, but it wasn't the right game for me and I would say it might be worth looking at for more serious platforming fans, leastways ones that can handle a large amount of puzzles and a disappointing upgrade system. I recommend picking it up from a key reseller if you are interested in not giving Dangen money.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1667444093, "timestamp_updated": 1667451334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124800233": {"recommendationid": "124800233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243194104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 754, "last_played": 1667381148}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Se trata de un metroidvania bastante entretenido y disfrutable (aunque me hubiera gustado que el personaje tuviera m\u00e1s mejoras destacables).

Jokes were hit and miss for me, but I really liked how the silent protagonist was done here, especially the intro sequence and endgame [spoiler] yeah let's just punch the final boss to get its attention lol [/spoiler]. Soundtrack is typically good and catchy, though they occasionally feel randomly reinserted or out of place (maybe just me). While metroidvania games definitely inspired the work to an extent [spoiler] (let's face it, the eyes are basically X parasites [/spoiler], I see weirdly see similarities between this game and Metroid Dread (2021) [spoiler] Iconoclasts has the Ivory beast, Dread has the X abomination [/spoiler], though Samus Returns (2017) came out beforehand, so I wonder if there was any two way inspiration) between these games, as they play quite similarly. You have these semi-linear metroidvania games with similar types of combat, and it was refreshing to see a similar but diverting approach out there. I saw a review of Inmost that basically said to play Iconoclasts instead for multiple playable character action, so I decided to try it. This is definitely better. Others might compare it to Owl Boy, and I think Iconoclasts and Owl Boy rank comparatively well against one another as platformers with multiple playable protagonists. \n\nI compared this to Metroid games already, but I think I should use one more to describe Iconoclasts: Fusion. It's metroidvania gameplay that forces the player to complete certain tasks at certain times, much like Metroid Fusion. Although many despised how much Fusion differed from Super Metroid, there seems to be more opportunities for interesting planned segments in the linear metroidvania gameplay of Fusion and Iconoclasts. Every once and a while, it will feel like you are playing the stage of an arcade platformer, which is kind of neat. Combat is interesting, but not quite as tight as in Metroid Dread. Bosses are generally fun, but a few are especially annoying or silly [spoiler] Blocker is annoying fast paced repetitive button sequences, while the boss you fight as injured Elro is kind of boring and seems highly unrealistic lol [/spoiler]. I think the game does a good job of telling the story it intends to tell, though sometimes it gets very lore heavy (which I find way too easy to tune out), and other times they say nothing or leave it entirely to lore notes (which is not unusual in these types of games, but also can be confusing in this case). The game is quite interpersonal relation focused, and you do get a sense of the thought process of different characters, as silly as it may sound in the context of a sci-fi game. In both obvious and obscured ways, it shares the importance of understanding others [spoiler] The obscure way being answering questions posed throughout the game a certain way to appease shadows that attack you in the dream sequence before the final boss [spoiler]. I did not find the tweak system too interesting, I just used it for three damage-free hits and didn't buy any other ones. I am sure there is some strategy for optimal tweak setups for speedruns or something. Swapping between different characters throughout this game was pretty fun, though some segments were confusing at first glance [spoiler] particularly the Ash fight, which was preceded with too much vague text explanations of what you were expected to do; not to mention, \"stealth\" had no role later in the game.. kind of glad about that, but why say it in the first place? [/spoiler]. [spoiler][/spoiler] \n\nBesides some of these hiccups, the game also has bugs/weird issues:\n1) in windowed mode, if you are in full resolution, every player death/gameover screen transition will resize the window to a certain smaller size every time.\n2) in the tower, I found that it was possible to hold onto the ladder while riding an elevator up past the auditorium. This was under the circumstance of doing what is required for a cut scene to activate in the auditorium, so I was essentially stuck in a room transition next to it with the lights dimmed. Upon resetting the game, I made sure not to press up on the elevator ride, and proceeded to see the cut scene normally once I got to the correct spot for it. \n\nOverall, it feels like a neat passion project that people should experience.

Honestly, this is another title where I'd prefer a \"meh\" review category.\nI really liked the game's story, once the plot threads became unraveled passing the mid-section of the game, and most of the riddles were fun to solve as well. Personally, I was fine with the differences in pace between puzzle and action segments (though, looking at other reviews, this also seems to throw quite a few people off).\nBuuut... at its heart Iconoclasts is still a Metroidvania - and the combat system is way too non-fluent for that.

First off - weird. Iconoclasts is weird and a little jarring, and it swings both ways in whether it fits or it doesn't. The nature of the story is significantly more sinister and serious than the art and music, and this isn't really ever addressed, so you have a strange sense of not-belonging that makes earlier sections of the storyline seem just... bizarre. However. As the game progresses into the second half, and the hidden secrets start to spill, the scope widens and there's a very pleasant mysteriousness about where everything's heading that really sucks the player in when it counts. IF the player ever gets there - the primary side character Mina is so infuriatingly antagonistic and douchey that the early-middle portions of the game are a complete drag and I cried tears of joy at her becoming much more secondary as things moved on. The developer hits you with a message, and then hits you with another message, and then some others, and somewhere in the mix is what the game wants you to take away as the point, but contradictions in who the good guys are and what the bad things are presented as (which you won't fully realize until the ending sections, hence why this game has a \"political\" reputation) make what seems to start out as something more concise fumble around and ramble. Thankfully, you don't have to care much about that in the face of some excellent boss fights and decent, if occasionally unfair puzzling. The game has metroidvania elements, but I'd shy away from referring to it as such - the upgrades and progression are relatively useless, considering every boss can be soundly defeated with what you're given by default. On a final note, there's a character loss near to the end that's pretty unsatisfying, but honestly, I respect the developer for taking a memorable route, even if it's not executed super well. Overall, Iconoclasts is a little rough on the dialogue,  but once the conversation gets going, you'll have plenty to talk about. \n\nNote: if you care about achievements don't skip the credits, I beat

It seems to be arranged in a light metroidvania fashion, with minimal backtracking. Puzzle elements are engaging, though not overtly difficult and do not hold you hostage, interrupting your progress. Boss fights are much the same; mechanics may seem complicated at first, but are very forgiving once solved. Having a selectable difficulty at the start of every load is a nice modern touch and allows for more emphasis on progression and story if desired. The standard mode is well balanced in my experience and allows for a challenge without bogging down the plot progression.\n\nWhat surprised me most about this game was the depth of the story. While this isn't the first time I've been surprised by an outwardly simplistic appearing game, it's always refreshing to be surprised yet again. In a world of cheap and hollow grind fests with bare bones scripts, having a well written and executed story is a nice reprieve. I was reminded of classics such as Chrono Trigger several times throughout the dialogue sequences; just spot on writing. The characters are quite memorable and charming.

To think that one man made this is astonishing.[/h1]\n\nThe biggest selling point for this game would be its narrative. Iconoclasts is not the game you would think it is at first glance (which unfortunately works against this game). Both Steam and the game's introduction give you the feeling that it's a colourful, happy-go-lucky platformer that almost seems generic, but in fact this game is very rich in its story and eventually becomes brutal in its violence. \n\nReligion and faith is the central focus of the plot as characters conflict on the notion of God and how society revolves around worship. So many characters suffer and experience some form of tragedy in their life as the game progresses and at one moment near the end of the game one character's despair moved me to tears. There are a lot of little details in the story that you can piece together as not everything is told outright to you through the narrative and its very clever in how its shown to you but not outright told directly. Doing a second playthrough of the game after knowing the entire picture will change your understanding of the game's events, revealing new light on the narrative through your newfound context. Simply put, it's all so very beautiful.\n\nWhile the upgrade system is somewhat questionable with most perks being afterthought upgrades, the core gameplay is simple, fun and tightly-knit. I never found myself feeling bored as there was always something to do or interact with. The puzzles aren't too hard and the boss fights are on the easier side with only some standouts giving me particular trouble like the optional ones.\n\nThe music is phenomenal, the pixel artstyle is wonderful to look at, and everything, and I mean [i]everything[/i] is incredibly animated. The game oozes with gorgeous sprite animation that shines its brightest during boss fights and cutscenes.\n\nI loved every second of this game as its themes and characters continously caught me off guard.

Made by one person! [/h1]\n\nThe strengths of this game is definitely the design. There are many unique looking characters and enemies you will encounter, especially the bosses. Boss fights are the highlight of this game and are mostly fun; some boss mechanics are really creative [spoiler] such as that drilling worm and the skeleton with a shield [/spoiler]. but some felt dull and underwhelming [spoiler] such as Ash and that warping girl [/spoiler].\n\nWorld building and lore are unique and intriguing, however, it has somewhat poor the storytelling. The game's info dump often left me confused and overwhelmed and the characters were not that well-written as how they behaved were sometimes kinda got on my nerves and didn't make sense. Some characters just came outta nowhere and didn't really add anything to the story.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are fun but there's nothing special. It's a bit frustrating how there are sometimes  little to no hints on how to progress the level. I had to shoot everything and jump around like crazy to find out that i had to progress by going through a hidden passage. The weapon upgrades didn't seem that necessary and some are well hidden. The dev is really good at hidden content as when i finished the game, the progress only displayed \"50%\".\n\nI had a lot to complain about, but overall, Iconoclasts is a very fun game with lots of love and passion poured into it.

A m\u00ed lo que impact\u00f3 fue su sistema de control, que pr\u00e1cticamente vuelve prescindible el uso de los gatillos. S\u00ed, con la botonera de A-B X-Y, la cruceta y el bot\u00f3n Start tienes suficiente para jugar a este t\u00edtulo, cosa que da la impresi\u00f3n de que su creador lo ha estado probando durante mucho tiempo sobre un teclado. Esto en un principio potencia el aspecto retro, pero m\u00e1s adelante dir\u00e9 algo que no me ha gustado.\n\nEstamos ante un t\u00edtulo que aparentemente bebe de los juegos de los a\u00f1os 80 del Siglo XX, aunque su acabado est\u00e9tico es m\u00e1s propio de la Super Nintendo. Siendo m\u00e1s concretos y desde mi punto de vista, parece inspirarse principalmente en los dos primeros Metroid: el juego original de NES y el Return of Samus publicado para Game Boy. Por otro lado, parece nutrirse tambi\u00e9n de lo que conocemos en occidente como Super Mario Bros 2, que fue el patito feo de la saga de plataformas Super Mario Bros lanzada para NES. Super Mario Bros 2 no era un mal juego en realidad, pero qued\u00f3 totalmente ensombrecido por el 1 y 3, considerados por algunos como los mejores juegos de plataformas de todos los tiempos.\n\nHay que reconocer que Iconoclasts entra muy bien al principio. Su acabado art\u00edstico es de diez, los dise\u00f1os y las animaciones son tambi\u00e9n de diez, la m\u00fasica es fant\u00e1stica y su planteamiento es bueno, aunque en comparaci\u00f3n con otros metroidvania prima m\u00e1s las plataformas y los puzzles que la exploraci\u00f3n. La ambientaci\u00f3n y la historia son realmente muy buenos, y aqu\u00ed es donde llegamos a dos puntos a tener en consideraci\u00f3n.\n\nPese a tener un aspecto infantil, la verdad es que la historia es bastante oscura y adulta. En ella se toca de manera muy superficial la sexualidad y el jugador ver\u00e1 algunos momentos duros que quedan suavizados por las limitaciones t\u00e9cnicas y el acabado art\u00edstico. Vamos, que la historia no va orientada, ni mucho menos, a los m\u00e1s peques de la casa, as\u00ed que no la subestim\u00e9is por el aspecto est\u00e9tico del juego.\n\nPero como amante de los metroidvania tengo que decir que Iconoclasts va de m\u00e1s a menos, y la raz\u00f3n est\u00e1, precisamente, en su historia. A nivel de desarrollo s\u00ed est\u00e1 inspirado en juegos m\u00e1s modernos, y aqu\u00ed me ha recordado al Metroid Fusion de Game Boy Advance. Lo malo de Metroid Fusion es que intentaron contar demasiada historia y aquello perjudic\u00f3 al [i]backtracking[/i]. Pues bien, aqu\u00ed nos encontramos ese defecto multiplicado por decenas de veces, por lo que, con tanta historia (en esta faceta parece un JRPG de la vieja escuela tipo Final Fantasy), al final el juego apenas invita a explorar como lo hace Super Metroid o Hollow Knight y terminas realizando un trazado muy lineal. El [i]backtracking[/i] tampoco es que est\u00e9 muy bien implementado, as\u00ed que al final dejas atr\u00e1s zonas que posiblemente te convendr\u00eda volver a visitar.\n\nOtro detalle que no me ha gustado ha sido el sistema de control. Al principio mola tener unos controles tan simples, pero la incapacidad de disparar en diagonal ha sido sustituida con un auto objetivo que resta desaf\u00edo a los combates e incluso puede terminar li\u00e1ndola en situaciones en las que hay varios enemigos cerca pero repartidos en distintas ubicaciones. Me hubiera gustado que los gatillos superiores hubiesen sido utilizados para apuntar en diagonal y as\u00ed dar m\u00e1s control al usuario, tal y como lo hacen los Metroid en 2D a partir de Super Nintendo.\n\nQue no se entienda mal, Iconocast es un juego de notable, pero su exceso de historia termina diluyendo su forma de metroidvania para pasar a ser m\u00e1s bien un juego de plataformas y puzzles. No tengo nada en contra de que un metroidvania prime los puzzles y las plataformas si lo hace bien, pero s\u00ed hay un problema cuando lo hace a costa de la exploraci\u00f3n y el [i]backtracking[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1655154723, "timestamp_updated": 1656159123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

game has a lot of love and charm put into it that allows me to enjoy it in spite of its shortcomings.\n\nAlright, so, Iconoclasts is a rather odd game. Its gameplay is as simple as it comes. You can shoot, jump, and after very early in the game, swing a wrench that can be used as a melee attack, a parry, and a tool to activate specific bolts that work like buttons. As the game progresses you unlock a few extra moves like a grenade launcher or the ability to charge yourself electrically. This is used to solve the game's MANY puzzles, and to fight the game's plentiful bosses, a decent chunk of which are glorified puzzles with a little more tension. I hope you like that, because that's essentially the gameplay loop. Mechanically speaking this game isn't very difficult and one can beat a casual playthrough rather easily even in the highest default difficulty, even if you end up getting stuck in a boss or two.\n\nHowever, while the gameplay is not going to win any awards, the rest of the game is fantastic. The setting is outstanding, particularly in the way it slowly and subtly unfolds itself to the player. The spritework and animation is exquisite, and gives so much characterization to especially the protagonist, Robin. The writing is genuinely pretty solid as well. It's nothing special, but it's well delivered and there's plenty of enjoyment to be had from characters like Mina or Agent Black, and notably, from Robin herself, being probably the first mute protagonist I've actually liked in a videogame. The music also sets the tone of the game pretty well and is generally just great. There's also a large amount of side content that you can find by returning to different places and exploring, however...\n\nI will come out and say it: the metroidvania parts of the game (returning to previous levels with new upgrades) don't feel fun. There's very little incentive to return to previous areas due to how slow it is to do so, and the fast travel somewhat helps, but you will typically still have to do plenty of walking anyway. It wastes a lot of time when you consider that you're revisiting rooms that you have already figured out, yet in some cases you still have to redo the puzzles again. Also, the second half of the game is completely linear: you go in a straight line with no way at any point to leave and return to the rest of the game. You do get a moment before tackling the final boss where you can do all you have to do, so fortunately, there is no \"Point of No Return\", thank fuck. Even then, after that, you'll probably want to just fight the final boss anyway, so it feels like there's no point at all to \"go back and do what you couldn't before\", at least in a casual or first playthrough. \n\nThese were all minor criticisms, but what I actually want to adress is the tweak system. It blows. The reason for that is simply how unbalanced it is: Tweaks are temporary upgrades that are lost on hit. Typically, they're misc stuff, like being electrically charged for longer or being able to swim for longer, which saves up time in some puzzles but doesn't really give you too much of a bonus. The problem is that these tiny QoL buffs are heavily outclassed by the tweak Iron Heart, which just allows you to take a free hit. Since tweaks break when you take damage and slowly get repaired by doing damage or destroying certain background elements, there is no point in running something that'll give you a small boost and get lost whenever you make any mistake over just not taking a single instance of damage. There's also plenty of optional tweaks that could easily have been small permanent upgrades over how tweaks actually work, since character progression is fairly limited, as it is just \"you get new tool for puzzles\" instead of more tangible growths. If the system used to replace these wasn't so poorly balanced, I would have no complaints, but, alas, it's how it is.\n\ntl;dr: this game is worth playing alone for its artistic value (read: writing, aesthetic, worldbuilding, and all that) but expect gameplay to be underwhelming, at least outside of boss fights\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1654683420, "timestamp_updated": 1654683420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116612476": {"recommendationid": "116612476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045649162", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1518708261}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un Metroidvania muy accesible: es sencillo y atractivo a la vista dado por su arte pixelart tan colorido.

And true to what I'd seen, [b]this game delivered.[/b] The storyline, however, leaves a lot to be desired. \n*It keeps falling back on tiresome \"girl power\" tropes and implies misogyny repeatedly when it isn't warranted. More on that below.\n*The amount of LGBTWHATEVER \"representation\" is downright gratuitous. [spoiler]One of the player characters is a lesbian in a relationship with a woman who I initially thought was her sister.[/spoiler] A little surprising, but no big deal; such things are generally beneath my notice, and I could care even less. [spoiler]But then a flashback reveals that one of the recurring villains [i]maybe[/i] had a crush on/relationship with [b]a person of unidentifiable gender,[/b] complete with half their head shaved and hair dyed purple.[/spoiler] [i]That[/i] made me sit up and take notice that something was off here. Two LGBT couples in one game? Given the setting of the story, the odds of such people finding compatible partners seems statistically improbable at the very least. It doesn't feel [i]organic,[/i] which begs the question of what message the writers are trying to convey. This detail was also what made me really start to notice the other political messaging in this game.\n*True to the title, this game takes a very strong stance against religion, with the main villains of the game being leaders of a cult (with obvious Christian influence) ruling over a dystopian society with an iron fist. Obnoxiously, one of the recurring villains will periodically stop what he's doing to read scripture from their cult's holy book. And one of the so-called protagonists is a high-ranking, superpowered member of the cult who was so sheltered by said cult that everything he does makes the situation worse for everyone. The main group of dissidents are scientist hippies who worship the earth/trees. And, predictably, the foundations this religion are built on ultimately prove to be false (though, credit where it's due, the reveal and design of the final boss are actually kinda clever). As someone who has studied world religions, the false dichotomies of science vs religion/Christianity vs every other religion got tiresome a long time ago, and it annoys me that this studio decided to fall back on such a tired strawman.\n*This game seems to take a very, [i]VERY[/i] dim view of men. The only three male characters to receive significant screentime are all presented in a negative light. The first of them is the scripture-quoting villain. The second is the aforementioned sheltered cult member who fucks everything up. [spoiler]In retrospect, the fact you have to abandon him to a fate worse than death to reach the end of the game takes on a more sinister tone.[/spoiler] The third is the main protagonist's older brother, who is picked out as the unwitting instigator of all the bad things that happen in this story. Ordinarily, this would not be an issue. But the writers for this game seem to go out of their way to paint him as painfully stupid [spoiler](assassinating a major character in a fit of rage in a flashback, then ironically escaping without actually going into hiding)[/spoiler], imply he's misogynistic (painting concern for his sister's well-being/safety as him being a paternalistic control freak), and heap all the responsibility for what happens on him. What's more, they run him through the meat grinder: [spoiler]by the end of the game, he's lost an arm, an eye, his house has been demolished, and his wife and daughter are dead.[/spoiler] This brother doesn't feel like a real character, he feels like a political strawman who exists specifically to be punished by the universe itself. Even if I didn't disagree with the inherent politics of this story, [b]that's bad writing.[/b]\n\nSuffice to say, the omnipresent socio-political messaging left a sour taste in my mouth. There were parts of the story I liked (especially their use of one villain's headaches), and my aforementioned criticisms wouldn't be nearly as pronounced if the writing team were able to integrate them into the story with a modicum of subtlety. As it stands, though, these issues stand out like a sore thumb and indicate that this game is trying to push some sort of social agenda. Even if I agreed with said agenda, that kind of politicization in media makes me extremely uncomfortable. Consequently, I only played through Iconoclasts once.\n\nBasically, the game is fun if you can manage to ignore most of the storyline (or, I assume, if you agree with the devs' politics).

Yes, it takes place in an interconnected map, yes, you occasionally get upgrades as you advance the story that grant you access to more areas, but it never really feels like a metroidvania because you never really have the freedom to explore until you're literally to the final boss.  It's as dialog heavy as a JRPG, but fortunately the story is a well-written one, despite going with the common silent-protagonist trope.  The story really fits the title, in that it revolves around characters breaking tradition, religious and familial, and dealing with the repercussions of that.  All in all, the story is the biggest strength of the game, by far.\n\nAs for the gameplay, well the areas themselves you take them in the order the story presents them to you, and explore through said areas in a more or less linear fashion.  As you explore the open world, combat very much takes a back seat to the puzzles  - using your wrench, electricity, and blocks to work your way to the next room.  The enemies are just there as little breaks between puzzles - they don't come in many varieties, each has it's own weakness that you need only figure out once, and you can straight up ignore them half the time - heck, sometimes you *need* to just avoid them.\n\nThe boss fights are the only time you're going to really be challenged from a combat perspective.

This was all made by a single developer, which really makes me appreciate the effort that went into this game that much more. \n\nThe characters of Iconoclasts are likeable and serve the story satisfactorily. The lore got me engaged but it also left me with several questions and wishing that it went a bit deeper with its explanations. \n\nI wouldn't say it's a flawless game though.

It is without question a very well made Metroidvania title that has a increasingly dark story that has some really fantastic elements like its bosses and platform puzzles, albeit with flimsy combat and short length. In this it is a good game. Essential? No, but if there was a clear 7 out of 10 old Metroidvania title, Iconoclasts is it. Part of me wants to rave more about Iconoclasts. As a game that took best part of a decade to make by a single person where its quality and attention to detail is top notch, I really want to hold it in higher regard. Alas its shortcomings are just far too glaring to say it ranks up there as an excellent title.\n\nDespite my negative tone, I\u2019m going to repeat myself: Iconoclasts is a good game. It will no doubt be one of those titles that someone out there sees as the best title of all time, if not the kind of title where the story has made someone rethink their life and how they live it. While this may sound hyperbolic you have to consider how well thought out the story and world to Iconoclasts is. Like Owlboy released in the same timeframe it has that kind of whimsical initial feeling slowly give way to a rather complex world littered with misery and chaos. If anything the conflicting attitudes and ideals of each of the (rather extensive) cast makes for a very memorable tale of religious zealotry, authoritarian social orders and cultural clashes all set in a sci-fi world that fleshes itself out nicely over the course of its 15 (or so) hour slow burn. Granted it gets a little convoluted in places as some rather important seeming characters appear and then are swept away before you have the faintest idea who they are, but the core cast of Robin, Mina, Royal and Elro are all delt with rather well. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail due to spoilers, but if I were to advise getting Iconoclasts for one thing, it\u2019s the expansive story. Considering I normally am so mechanics focused, that I guess says a lot about its story line.\n\nOutside of the yarn it spins, there is not too bad a game underneath. What you get is a puzzle focused Metroidvania. Most of the progression is based on figuring out what happens in the numerous puzzle rooms in the game, running back and forth trying to work out what you are missing and, on occasion, working out if you have the right tools for the job. Almost all of the game is based on what weapon you are using and how your mighty melee wrench can be utilised, turning gears, spinning up cogs or charging things with electricity. A lot of the puzzles are well designed and clearly had a lot of thought put into them, and they needed to be good as, bar the puzzling, there is not much to the game.\n\nCombat is where the game is let down really. Most enemy encounters are just distractions that, due to the auto aim on the stun gun, are more distractions than real progress impeding threats. There are some combat sequences that are a challenge, but they are few and tend to come in far too bunched up moments, making them frustrating. That said the bosses are all rather fantastic and, like the platforming, are mostly puzzles that need solving rather than being stand-up fights.\n\nAside from the weak combat there is the issue of playtime and replay value. While the game can easily last over 10 hours, the world itself feels rather small all things considered, and the cutscenes take up a great dollop of that time. Exploration is there, but the progression made is mostly linier, giving way to moments where backtracking seems less interesting and more a chore. Combine that with what seems to be little in terms of replay value and Iconoclasts may seem like a hard sell in a genre that is known for its vast exploration and searching in the tiny nooks and crannies.\n\nAll negativity aside I know someone out there will love Iconoclasts to bits. Its story is phenomenal and has been one of the nicest surprises I\u2019ve had from this genre along with Cave Story. Is it as good as Super Metroid or Hollow Knight? No, but it does not need to be. A great way to kill a weekend or two with.\n", "timestamp_created": 1644540239, "timestamp_updated": 1644540239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109897463": {"recommendationid": "109897463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100854070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1644459246}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Mucho texto, poca sustancia.", "timestamp_created": 1644459344, "timestamp_updated": 1644459344, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455172419548034668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109894858": {"recommendationid": "109894858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975886598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1644564343}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game where the designated villains literally announce from the start that they hate the protagonist because she \"helps people,\" Iconoclasts quickly turns into a surprisingly deep cosmic horror story about how inhuman humans can be to each other when they have nothing but superstition to rely on to understand the world they live in.", "timestamp_created": 1644455114, "timestamp_updated": 1644455114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109876350": {"recommendationid": "109876350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121984801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2993, "last_played": 1644440978}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bastante guapo el videojuego, increible 10/10, le follo la boca", "timestamp_created": 1644441884, "timestamp_updated": 1644441884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109815420": {"recommendationid": "109815420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960447161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1644346917}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]It has everything.[/h1]\nTight control.

Instead, Robin will auto-aim to a degree. While the checkpointing is mostly fine, there are a few areas where there will be very long periods between them.

This is a huge positive in terms of the game design and makes for an enjoyable, non-frustrating experience traversing the large, varied biomes present in this game.\n\nIn regards to the gameplay, it\u2019s a lot of fun, and both combat as well as platforming mechanics (like spinning Robin\u2019s wrench to stun enemies or using it to grapple across the map) are super satisfying. It\u2019s not really a difficult game, but it strikes enough of a balance in terms of difficulty such that it offers a relaxing but engaging playthrough for most gamers.\n\nThe story is interesting and involves Robin working with an eclectic cast to try and stop a bunch of corrupt mages who terrorize villagers and are unwittingly about to destroy the planet. The game\u2019s many characters are varied and for the most part each have unique personalities, and Robin serves as the cheerfully optimistic anchor at the center of it all. The narrative balances its more dramatic segments with humor and overall doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, making for a fun and engaging story overall.\n\nAdditionally, the pixel visuals are awesome, and really fit in well with the overall tone of the game. Animations are very smooth and so well-polished that it\u2019s easy to forget that this was largely made by a one-man developer team. Furthermore, it has an epic soundtrack that pairs really well with the energetic vibes of the game.\n\nAll in all, Iconoclasts is a really enjoyable and refined Metroidvania that doesn\u2019t really have any flaws going for it. Exploring its vibrant and memorable world is a ton of fun for casual gamers and its 10-hour runtime is one that you\u2019ll definitely have a good time with if you\u2019re at all into Metroidvanias or action platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1642728349, "timestamp_updated": 1642814109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108215200": {"recommendationid": "108215200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076515057", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1678051757}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was very fun to play the sound and music design (especially the boss music) are top notch the graphics are good\nand the story is amazing so im reccomending this  BUT the tower was pain in the butt to play iwas constantly going up and down searching for things i needed it was very annoying another thing is i feel it was kinda short and a lot of mechanics werent reused like the stealth mechanics in shockwoods with ash ( ithink that  was his name) and maybe this becuase i played easy (dont sya hey wait he played easy yet) i played it cuase i wnated a story witch it deliverd buti dident notice i had ifinet health till halfway throungh. i reccomend this game but maybe get it when its on sale", "timestamp_created": 1642438926, "timestamp_updated": 1642438926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627242565155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108078791": {"recommendationid": "108078791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798916286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1653961201}, "language": "english", "review": "fun so far\n", "timestamp_created": 1642274253, "timestamp_updated": 1642274253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107980988": {"recommendationid": "107980988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058635909", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 650, "last_played": 1642164721}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Cave Story, you'll like this game.

The poorly thought out story is what brings the game down the most for me, and I honestly wish most of it was just cut out.\n\nThe overall setting and worldbuilding was strange and didn't feel believable to me. The game's \"finale\" is probably the worst offender, as it goes on for way too long and feels like a joke that wants to be taken seriously. By the end, you're left with a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nWhile it's impressive that one person developed and spent nearly a decade of his life on making this game, it sadly didn't pay off in my eyes. One thing the dev definitely needed was someone else to edit the dialogue, and generally more advice on the story from other people.\n\nThis game remains rather obscure and \"underrated\" for good reasons.

From distinct areas to satsifying sound effects with every action you do. Amazing setpieces that stand out even with how basic it might be (like grass or desert biomes).\n\nGameplay is surprisingly simple, giving you only a few real abilities to traverse the areas with like your wrench and guns. What it excels at is using all these tools in different ways, both in combat and for exploration. Tweaks themselves are a nice extra for passive benefits like longer breath or damage immunity, but I never felt forced to use any of them. And sometimes the game switches it up with changing the playable character for a few sections.\n\nThe story itself isn't too complex to follow but the execution of it is great. Lots of memorable characters you will love or hate with a great silent protagonist. The way it also goes between humour and serious moments is also great, making it both compelling for the tragedy and likeable for the comedy. It also helps the lore is rich and the world feels alive.\n\nThe greatest strength I find is the boss fights, with each one standing out on their own. Whether you get to play around with the gimmicks of a new weapon, have to puzzle solve to deal damage or even ignore the boss to do something else.

It's a bit railroaded for awhile until the endgame lets you go pick up the rest of the collectibles; as other reviews mention, compare Metroid Fusion. The puzzles are generally well-designed: there are a couple weird ones (and a couple moments where the game kinda lies to you about where to go next). There's one sort of odd reason for the lack of combat focus, though: you gain basically no raw stats over the course of the game (just a couple of the tweaks). The difficulty curve is fairly shallow, and the exploration rewards are just materials for tweaks with minor effect so there's not much upside aside from personal satisfaction.\n\nThe story is sincere but lacks focus: there are a dozen significant secondary characters each with their own storyline, and most of them don't really get the time needed to resolve.

It's just kinda... boring. I'm only 6 and a bit hours in, despite what my playtime says. But it's just so repetitive and the story is boring and the characters are woefully unlikeable. Gameplay is very simple, usually you stand off to the side of an enemy wholly unintersted in you and mash X or B until they die. Puzzles are sometimes fun but after a while they all become very samey. All a variation on \"move the blocks in the correct order\".  A simplifcation, yes, but the game has yet to engage me with the puzzles so I will not give it the benefit of the doubt that they become better later. The game, even so early in, feels too long. It's just not interesting enough to justify this length. \n\nSeriously, every character, except the main character, is so fucking awful. Robin is silent, so maybe that's why she's likeable. But I don't want to help any of these people. I just want the planet to blow up already, or whatever the fuck the main threat is. It's tonally bizarre as well, like I'm sorta supposed to care about the silly chibi pixel art people's problems as the chipper chiptune music blares endlessly and then [spoiler] Erlo gets his actual literal fucking arm torn off and he screams in agony [/spoiler] and I'm thinking to myself \"what the fuck is going on?\" \n\nIt's also not a good Metroidvania, the sole reason I bought it. All collectibles are crafting components for extremely minor stat increases, of which you can only have 3 equipped at a time.

I have a particular fondness for platformers, so if that's all you're interested in, Iconoclasts does a serviceable enough job to scratch that itch.\n\nI'll start with the negatives so that I can end with the positives.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n1. [b]Conveyance[/b] is a particularly large issue in this game. While the game does give you a great amount of freedom to explore things and figure them out, as you wish and at your own pace, it doesn't do a particularly good job of showing you things at times. Sometimes, it's bang on the money, and you can get it right off, but there were bosses or sequences where I sat there with my thumb up my hind parts, trying to figure out what I was supposed to do before I died enough times to be willing to try anything. The underground tunneller boss comes to mind in particular for me. His second phase was a big \"uh, what?\" for me. There just wasn't the feedback from the game there, and because I streamed my whole playthrough, it devolved into me just asking the chat what I was missing or complaining that \"that idea was poorly conveyed.\" It's my biggest complaint about the game.\n2. The [b]Politics[/b] of the producer are plainly obvious to anyone who is actively paying attention. It was kinda cringe, but didn't actively or permanently damage my impression of the game. It was just a quick eye roller here or there, though the more politically inclined might make or break based on this.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n1. [b]Controls[/b] are tight and responsive. There will be a few misses where you'll feel like you probably should have hit, or that the game should have been more forgiving, in regards to some jumps and sequences, there are equally just as many hits that feel out of place. Both are few and far between, and largely can be placed squarely on my own shortcomings. Overall, I'd say the controls are tight enough to make you feel like you have recourse, and that if you're quick, you will be able to respond to every challenge placed in front of you. This is the most important part of any platformer, and I'd call this section a success.\n2. The [b]Art Direction and Design[/b] are magnificent. The sprites are lively and full of emotion, and are well designed. The actual art of the characters ranges from cute to beautiful. Even the use of pixel art as the medium was a good one, because it added another layer of storytelling that otherwise wouldn't be available.\n3. Speaking of [b]Storytelling[/b], this is where this game shines. I won't go into spoilers, but I can say that this game does a very good job of staying above board with it's storytelling, and it remains internally consistent, even as it gets wild. If I had any complaints, it's that the game leans into the characters faults to attempt to portray growth, and at times it can get a little heavy handed. That said, the supporting cast in the One Concern grunts had great humour beats, the antagonists felt believable and unique for motivations, the designs of each new character was engaging, and I wanted to see where it went if nothing else. The world feels silly and cartoony, but overall was engaging, and it didn't take itself too seriously, which was a boon.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this game was a 3.5/5 to a 4/5 for me.

I don't think there was a single boss that I didn't die to the first time. Thankfully the game is generous enough to start you at the beginning of the fight. Figuring out how to beat each boss is soooo much fun! I cannot stress how great each boss encounter is.\n\nSurprisingly, there is also a rather rich story with lore. At first glance, I rolled my eyes at the heavy-handed, done to death \"RELIGIONS ARE EVIL!!!! CORPORATIONS ARE DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT!!!\" plot, but there are some really nice plot twists and character moments. Now, as someone who teaches English, maybe I'm a bit more sensitive to this, but it was clear that someone who doesn't speak English natively wrote this. It's fine for what it is, but the script could've used a once over to cut-down on long-winded dialog and awkward, unclear phrasing. But again, I don't think most people will notice that. I went in thinking I would hate the story, but I ended up really liking the world it created and wanting more answers.\n\nSo yeah, HIGHLY recommend this game. It was a joy to play. The late game was pretty tough and a slog because it was truly difficulty; you couldn't just smash your way through things.

It's a pity that this isn't a more puzzle-focused game.\n\nThe pinnacle of this is a certain boss fight that's actually not much of a fight, because it involes sneaking around in tall grass and puddles of water.

The non-combat mechanics are flexible enough to hold it together. Again, it's a pity that this is an exception, and not how you deal with enemies on a regular basis.\n\nMost regular boss fights are puzzles, too, in that you don't just memorize patterns, but also discover the principle of a given fight. It's much more rewarding than traditional boss fights and gives you at least some reward for having to repeat the same fight over and over (actually, I beat most of them on my second or third attempt). Once you discover the principle, the fight becomes easy anyway, and I like it that way, because it makes me feel that the game rewards thinking.\n\nThe main problem with \"Iconoclasts\"  is that it tends to make things more and more complicated. It doesn't show restraint. The puzzles are exempt from this, because they hit a natural limit once they become about two screens large. They can't get any bigger because then they would become impossible to track. This keeps them at an enjoable level. The same does not apply to combat. In the first half of the game it feels clunky and a bit frustrating, especially once the soldier type enemies begin to show up. Then at some point the challenges begin to stack in ways that break the already strained mechanics, and suddenly you hit a brick wall. Same thing occurs with boss fights. At some point it's just no longer fun: yeah, I get what this fight is about, but now I also have to keep practicing until I do memorize the patterns. I know some people enjoy this kind of gameplay, but to me it feels like work. It just stands in the way of the fun parts.\n\nA similar problem plagues the narrative. The story itself is simple, but the game obsfuscates it with so many, many, many words. The characters talk too much. They use complicated phrases to convey simple thoughts. They hold meaningless arguments. Their emotions are cartoonish. They are also entirely one-dimensional. At first I thought the verbose dialogue was meant as a parody, but no, it's not a joke: the game turns out to take itself super seriously. It's a pity, because the central conflict actually has an interesting \"it's not what you think\" vibe to it, and definitely deserves a narrative with shorter conversations covering a larger number of story beats.\n\nI don't usually skip dialogue in games, yet here I did it all the time, because I just couldn't bear it.\n\nAll in all, this game is not so much \"bad\" (quite the contrary, I've enjoyed large parts of it), as it is inconsistent. It just begins to try too hard at some point, and that's why I've ended up disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1636320039, "timestamp_updated": 1636320039, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102400921": {"recommendationid": "102400921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120089018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1636311555}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Not too hard but not too easy puzzles & bosses, even minions have certain methods of defeating, ok story, characters are great.\n\nCons: Upgrades could have been more diverse.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1636311626, "timestamp_updated": 1636311626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102389085": {"recommendationid": "102389085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368075321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 847, "last_played": 1626502846}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Interesting labour of love, weighed down by bad writing. Deserves to find its audience [/h1]\n\nThis game was made by one, clearly very talented (or just very hard-working), dude who clearly put his heart and soul into it. As such, it's a valuable, interesting and worthwhile game that deserves to find an audience that vibes with it. To find out if you are one of those lucky people, watch the trailers and imagine that game, except with four times the dialogue, one-tenth of the exploration (don't be fooled, this is NOT a metroidvania) and with a clammy wet blanket of depressing, pessimistic angst thrown over the cheery, bouncy pixel art visuals. \n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the story and writing, which is bad because there is so much of it. It feels like the game is trying to cram an entire JRPGs worth of story, lore and characterization into a ~12 hour action game.\nMoreover, much of the writing is just...bad. You can tell that English is not the writer's first language. There's a certain stiltedness to the dialogue that makes many of the jokes fall flat and much of the more florid writing feel overwrought and just subtly wrong. The tone veers between despair and vulnerability and MCU-style \"great, just what I needed...more robots for me to shoot with my cool gun!\" self-aware snark from moment to moment in a way that is awkward and baffling. The pinballing between dystopian horror and cartoon comedy just felt uncomfortable, like watching a friend of a friend have an emotional breakdown at their own birthday party.\n\nMany aspects of the world that do turn out to be legitimately cool and unique are rushed and poorly explained, not helped by the fact that the pixel artstyle just does not do enough to communicate the nuance this original setting and these complex emotional beats would require. \nWhen the story does come together, it's not at all bad. Across 30 or so hours, with expressive character portraits, more detailed backgrounds and maybe voice acting, it could've been a great, emotionally resonant RPG, but here it just saps the joy out of what would otherwise be a fun, bouncy platformer. I felt BAD after every session. Not moved, not motivated, not touched, just BAD.\n\nAll of this is a huge pity, because everything else about Iconoclasts is really good. The game especially does a great job creating cool, memorable set pieces and unique bosses. It's well animated, colourful and visually charming, plus it handles well. Without all the writing, this would've been an easy recommendation. Gameplay has its nitpicks, but overall is very good, at times even great.\n\nThe game just shows that just because you can and want to do it all yourself, doesn't mean you'll do a good job. The developer is clearly very good at a number of things, and pretty good at a bunch more. He's just not good at everything, and that weighs this game down to beyond what I'd call enjoyable. I would have quit midway through, but the game's story, bad though it was, was interesting and irritating enough that I powered through to the end, using one of the Shantae games to clean my palette after every session.\n\nIf an unnecessarily downbeat, overly-written, mostly-linear 2D platformer with minimal optional exploration sounds like your jam, then ignore my rating and go buy it. I can't recommend this at all, but that's not because there's nothing good here, but because there was a lot of things I didn't like. You might like it and if so, the dev certainly deserves your support.", "timestamp_created": 1636297687, "timestamp_updated": 1636942674, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102293329": {"recommendationid": "102293329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210235485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1124, "last_played": 1654494827}, "language": "english", "review": "Good sountrack, great controls, amazing story, loved that useless prince bastard and I am going to miss him", "timestamp_created": 1636161851, "timestamp_updated": 1636161851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102128566": {"recommendationid": "102128566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155487103", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1636686794}, "language": "english", "review": "Characters are wonderful and the puzzles are very creative\nGame indeed good", "timestamp_created": 1635908781, "timestamp_updated": 1635908781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102116228": {"recommendationid": "102116228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179689122", "num_games_owned": 1071, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1635889780}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game all around.

It's not the easiest thing to get into and even I had a hard time really getting invested until a few hours in. \n\nAnd I think in the end it sits in the category of being \"okay\". Amazing sprite and pixel art, but okay. On the gameplay side of things there's a lack of visual clarity and way too many occasions of enemies having only one weakness, that weakness is the only thing that hurts them, but not going to tell you what that is. Nor do the enemies give you that much in visual hints. Something that looks armored can't be damaged by the stun gun, but you can take it out with a bomb. Makes sense. Until you find more armored enemies that can't be damaged by bombs either. Or machinery that looks roughly the same as other machinery that could be damaged by the stun gun, except these ones do need bombs and rockets. Or more armored guys with shields that resist everything, but you can take them out just by ground pounding on their heads. \n\nMost of the bosses at least follow the \"use the new technique you just learned\" somewhere which can help narrow things down. But not always (Awkwardly spent way too much time trying to break glass/ice with every explosive I had, till slowly realizing I was supposed to use the wrench...)\n\nI am also torn on Relaxed and Standard Mode too. There is a steep difficulty spike right near the end, one that seems doable but absurd, and then there's Relaxed Mode where you just cheat through everything. I wish there was something else in between.\n\nStory wise, it's interesting, not at all what I thought it was going to be though. I won't say it's bad but I could see why some people wouldn't like it, as I think it runs close between being too miserable, or sounding too pretentious a bit too often. I'm not so sure it even accomplished what it set out to do [spoiler]Most if not every character seems about the same or worse off than at the start, tbh. Besides Robin I guess?[/spoiler], and I think I had more questions than answers by the end of it at any rate.\n\n\n\nTL;DR, Iconoclasts is something of an experience and still worth checking out if you have the slightest interest in it. Especially if you love retro 2D games of that style. It's another one of those games I could totally see fitting in with the rest of the \"weird, niche titles that somehow got a cult following\" gems (Mischief Makers, Terranigma, etc) solely on the vibe it's got going on. I always suggest waiting for sales though.\n\nAnother indie it reminded me a lot of is Owlboy.

While [i]Iconoclasts[/i] itself plays just as one would expect from a traditional Metroidvania, there are instances of minor stealth and character switching that mix up the formula the game uses.\n\n[h2]Iconoclasts Indeed[/h2]\nImagine a world in which the majority of the populous believes a divine power outside of their comprehension oversees the world and its inhabitants. Now, imagine said world with many punishments and hardships for those that defy the teachings or fight against this entity\u2019s will. Imagine if there is some truth to this divinity, but you\u2019re unsure as to what exactly this god-like entity is. With that, you are presented with the general idea of what [i]Iconoclasts[/i] is at its core.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt0c5tE5Gno&ab_channel=Plebles%27ReviewClips\n\nAs the name suggests, [b]Robin[/b], the protagonist of our story, accomplishes many different feats, including helping people and meeting new friends, sometimes making dents in the [b]One Concern[/b]'s plans along the way. She is an engineer, and initially gets in trouble when caught fixing something in a relative's house, which is a felony in this world. [b]Robin[/b] encounters people that are devout followers and members of the [b]One Concern[/b], who worship a god-like power known simply as [b]Him/He/His[/b]. She also meets people that believe it\u2019s all nothing more than a means to control and interfere with their way of life, while more still slowly change their views as the story unfolds.\n\nThe story as a whole had me guessing at every turn. What really stuck with me after completing the story most, was how people lived: aside from the constant fear of assault from a benevolent force, most of these well meaning people are effectively brainwashed, whether it be through just sheer fear or unconditional love. I experienced the world through the eyes of [b]Robin[/b] and to a lesser extent, her friends, but I couldn't help but wonder all the while about the innocent people. Every decision has a ripple effect, and thinking how every single human has to cope with all of this really makes me wish there was a little more focus on the common man/woman's life, just to see what day to day challenges they'd face.\n\n[h2]Weapons, Mechanics, and Combat[/h2]\n[b]Robin[/b] starts out with a stun gun and wrench, which the game refers to as \u201ctools\u201d. It\u2019s amazing and outlandish to think she can effectively fight the many threats and enemies that get in her way. It works well enough though, and other more powerful tools are obtained later on that would definitely do some serious damage, such as the roller bomb shot. There are instances where the game requires the use of specific weapons and tools, usually for puzzles and bosses, and the standard simple puzzle to get you acquainted with said weapons.\n\nWeapons can be charged, serving both as a solution to puzzles and combating enemies. The wrench is the ultimate tool: any nuts found scattered about can either be used as a means of swinging from place to place, slide on airborne rails, fight bosses, or even open doors and manipulate the environment itself to continue onward. Projectiles can even be knocked back towards enemies, in some cases being a very effective means of counter combat. The last mechanic I\u2019d like to cover is the implementation of small bonuses that help out with general gameplay known as tweaks. Throughout the game, schematics can be acquired that grant [b]Robin[/b] the ability to use these bonuses once the necessary resources are found. I didn\u2019t use a large majority of them because I didn\u2019t feel they were necessary, but I found \"breathless\" and \"fleet foot\" useful. Having more time underwater before oxygen deprivation became an issue and moving faster were very helpful and made all backtracking more bearable. Up to three tweaks can be used at a time, and duplicates can be made for use, so long as the material is available. Taking damage \u201cbreaks\u201d them, however, and defeating enemies or destroying certain objects replenishes the tweak\u2019s health. I don\u2019t like how this was implemented, as one hit essentially removes 1/3 of your bonuses, but serves as motivation to get good at least.\n\nCombat is handled the way one would expect in a Platformer: you jump and climb, take cover, and attack enemies with your weapons. There are a few cases where direct combat isn\u2019t the answer, however, such as certain stealth sections. The stun gun is the fastest-firing weapon available, though the shots are rather weak. I feel it's not a great weapon, as once I got used to enemy patterns, it was just a matter of me using another weapon for more damage while dodging. It\u2019s useful for dispatching weaker enemies and small crowds, especially since it has a form of aim assist, which makes aerial threats easier to deal with. The roller bomb shot is a rolling ball bomb, like one would imagine. Shots roll a set distance and explode after a short time, which can be useful in some combat situations. When charged, a missile is fired that won\u2019t arm until it moves a certain distance. This means that if you\u2019re too close to an enemy or object that obstructs the shot, it\u2019ll just bounce off and land harmlessly. While competent, the combat isn't very interesting but works well enough.\n\n[h2]Audiovisual Direction[/h2]\nGraphically, [i]Iconoclasts[/i] ticks every box on my \u201cgreat visuals\u201d checklist: vibrant colors, pretty pixel art, and various locations with their own flavor. Enemy and boss designs are sometimes wacky, sometimes tacky, but always unique.\n\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613485380\n\nThe character designs are neat, but I personally feel more love and care could have been applied to certain characters, with the most prominent character design that I find kind of odd being [b]Robin\u2019s[/b]. It\u2019s more than likely her weird looking chicken legs were intentional, but they throw everything else about the character\u2019s look and feel off.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal overall, with some tracks, of course, being hits and others being misses. The true beauty here is the variation in the genre and tone of the soundtrack as a whole: the game throws some chiptune style at you one moment, then later you may find yourself listening to some ragtime, and even songs that sound like a mishmash of many different genres serving as background ambiance. I love music, and I was quite pleased with the variation most of the time.\n\n[h2]\ud83d\udcbbPerformance\ud83d\udcbb[/h2]\n\nMy Specs:\nCPU \u2013 Ryzen 9 3900X\nGPU \u2013 AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT\nRAM \u2013 16 GB\nStorage - HDD\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Technical[/th]\n[th]Value[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Visual & Resolution[/td]\n[td]2560x1440, max settings.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Controller Support?[/td]\n[td]Yes.

There are cases in which just shooting at your problem or working out puzzles won\u2019t work well, as scripted events call for different ways of playing. This is not very common, but it happens enough that it grants a refreshing shake up to the experience. For its price point, the gameplay to price ratio is fair.\n\n[quote][i]If'n you liked this review, want to see what else I have opinions on, or just want to read more from me, check out my curator, [/i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41675313/][b][i]Plebby's Place.[/i][/b] [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1633595217, "timestamp_updated": 1672889449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606421291828155518", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100566630": {"recommendationid": "100566630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254210107", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1596604850}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game as a gift awhile back from my wife.

You can tell that much from the trailer and I can assure you it looks that good from start to finish. I'll even say it's pretty creative with how you use new abilities to solve puzzles and find new areas, which is a hallmark of a good metroidvania. However, past this point I have nothing good to say about this game.\n\nIconoclasts' game play never stopped annoying me. One of the best parts of any metroidvania is travelling all around the map and going back to old areas with new abilities that totally change what its like to move through them. In Iconoclasts, going back to a previous area to complete a quest or pick up one or two chests that you needed a specific ability for feels like a chore even after you unlock fast travel.\n\nStarting-area enemies can still be annoying at the end of the game because plenty of them have quirks that make them immune to all but one specific attack in your arsenal, which is doubly frustrating when the attack you were preparing misses because your attacks are so clunky to use. Of course this gets 10x worse with bosses where you have to decipher their quirks in the heat of the moment, flipping through your weapons while trying not to die before you can sleuth your way into figuring out you've gotta swing off their hand [i]just so[/i] in order to make them vulnerable. Except that's not true. As long as you equip Iron Heart on all your tweaks you don't have to worry about dying. The boss just becomes a game of how long are you willing to sit down and practice lining up your shots.\n(To be fair not all the boss fight are this complicated. Sometimes all they have you do is hold right and press a button when you reach the boss.)\n\nThe story doesn't save this game either. All the characters are so insufferable and self-centered all the time. Especially Elro, who practically spends the entire game throwing a tantrum because he can't make everyone do what he wants. The only character who gets any development is Royal, but before he can complete a character arc, [spoiler]he gets left to die on the moon[/spoiler]. I get the sense that I was supposed to be invested in these characters before I bought the game. Like the creators released biographies on all the characters leading up to release. But I'm just sitting confused as everyone in the game keeps telling Robin how heroic and helpful and good she is when all I've been doing is letting the world take me where I need to go to progress.\n\nThe game calls itself \"a beautiful platform adventure that tells a personal story about faith, purpose and the challenge of helping people.\" To which all I can say is... eh? If you insist? I don't know if I helped that many people when it seems like most of them ended up either miserable or dead.\n\nEDIT:\nI spent a bit more time hunting down all the achievements. Not much more to add except the Usurper is uniquely frustrating to use. Also nothing wears you down quite like fighting Agent Black and Star Worm/Bird in challenge mode. The former would be easy if not for the lack of save points between the phases, and the latter overcompensates for how easy it is with a health bar that feels bottomless.\n\nIt just hit me [spoiler]that the final boss of the game is this alien bird mechanic.[/spoiler] Just out of nowhere. Never gets resolved. It sorta adds to the feeling that the people making this game just got tired with it toward the end. The pretty bits looked pretty and the boss fights worked, and everyone wanted to bring it to market.\n\nI guess I had more to add than I thought.", "timestamp_created": 1633237930, "timestamp_updated": 1634262327, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624840974807739258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100398795": {"recommendationid": "100398795", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999517145", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1975, "last_played": 1631117255}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1633213243, "timestamp_updated": 1633213243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466417908668518066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100272335": {"recommendationid": "100272335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343471000", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1209, "last_played": 1633134326}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendado para todo aquel que le gusten los juegos de plataformas y acci\u00f3n.

The pixel art is gorgeous, the story is interesting (albeit a bit abstract), the gameplay is fun, but with some quirks. I beat it in 8 hours in standard mode, an additional hour was needed to 100% it with the secret boss. A highlight of this game are the well made boss fights, except the secret one, way too spongy (only weakness are bombs, which have very low attack speed) and his attack pattern doesn't change much.\n\n\nHere are some negative aspects to the game: \n- Most enenies are immune to most of your attacks. You have to figure out what their weak points are. Some enemies are immune to any attack.\n- You don't get stronger, there are no health upgrades. Equipable upgrades are not really helping much. I only use the speed - upgrades to get to the next area quicker. There are only 2 gun upgrades and 2 wrench upgrades, which are permanent.\n- Because the equipable upgrades are so useless, completing 100% of the game feels tedious, because there are no reward when collecting additional materials for those upgrades.\n\nStill, I had fun playing this game, a clear recommendation. 7/10.

This game, albeit it paling in comparison to a ton of other games I've played in Playtime, is easily in my top 5 games of all time. The gameplay itself is solid. Combat is simple yet fun to play. Melee, Range, Parry, the usual hijinks. Bossfights is where it shines though. All of them have a unique gimmick to them that's fun, surprising and never overstays it's welcome. Even in the odd instance that I wasn't an enormous fan of how a certain enemy would have to be handled, they never drown you in doing the same mechanic. \n\nWhere the game shines most for me is it story however.

Almost every part of it looks visually excellent, and there was NEVER any detail that took me out of things - it was consistent all the way through. Absolutely great art quality, direction, animations, everything. I only have one gripe with any part of the art.\n\nI don't like Robin's design. It's the leg and arm designs - big sleeves with tiny chicken legs doesn't mesh with me. I preferred more or less every single other character design in the game to hers. Her hair is great, I don't mind her actual shapes, and her animations are great - it's the choice of attire that bothers me. \n\nThere are a few segments of this game that are not fun. They're difficult, finicky in the mechanics in use, and don't really feel that satisfying to complete. There are quite few of them, but there ARE a few. I can understand why only about a third of players have actually beaten the game.\n\nThe core cast generally aren't that likable. Robin herself is fine; mostly silent, but she still comes off as quite strong and upbeat, which is good. Mina...eh. She's a VERY mixed bag, moreso than even actual people tend to be. Elro was irritating every time he was on screen, without exception. Royal...I'll be honest, Royal was the only standout character for me. He showed actual growth over the story, and seemed to have been developing towards a positive outcome. The only character to actually try to understand others, even if he was bad at it.\n\nThis is not a great example of a metroidvania. There is basically no motivation to backtrack at any point, and no need to actually go any direction except in the linear, straight forward one. I actually stopped bothering to check rooms about three hours in, because I knew the game would force me there eventually. And it did. It's still fun, most all of the mechanics are good, but it's not quite what I was expecting.\n\nThere is one mechanic that bothered me immensely: quirks. Quirks seem...mostly worthless. I think I crafted 3-4 in the entire game, because none of them really seemed worth anything except for the ones that made charging up quicker. There was no difficulty curve that required them, so they felt redundant. Upgrades should be something you really feel you're benefiting from; not just a thing you can say 'oh, I guess that's nice' to, whenever they happen to be there.\n\nIn conclusion: Good game, okay story, fantastic art.\n\n\n\n\nNow, some quick theory stuff. DO NOT read this if you haven't played the game.\n\nThis 'planet' is entirely artificial, and is not meant to have humans on it. It's a giant machine, designed to carry out a specific set of operations. Humanity accidentally arrived on it, propagated, and put the whole thing in jeopardy with seeds from earth which could rapidly consume the fuel source for this machine. This is probably when first contact with the alien ship occurred; early human settlements were probably wiped out, and all of Earth's nature was suppressed to keep damage to the machine to a minimum. A deal was struck with the stranded humans who remained: use as little ivory as possible so the planet doesn't run out, and you can stay. Unfortunately, like most things, time passed and people distorted events into a religion worshiping the aliens instead of actually upholding the agreed upon deal. This is why the birdman at the end was so angry about the fuel being used up - it was causing the machine's ACTUAL purpose to run out of fuel and break down.\n\nIncidentally, this is also why the 'Eyes' cannot connect to normal humans. Humans aren't part of the machine the eyes are designed to integrate with; all other 'life' on the planet IS. Those with ivory in their bodies were also susceptible to these Eyes as a result of the ivory itself - the foreign element in their physiology. \n\nI'd wager a guess that the alien had NO intention of humans ever getting injected with ivory, as this would be a waste, and as shown, gave humans the power to actually break the shell on the alien's ship. Imagine if that ship confronted Mother, at the peak of her power? She could have ripped the bird man out of it. There's no way he would have been okay with humans getting that kind of power.\n\nLast thing - the bird man himself had no special powers, just technology. It's possible humans developing power over ivory via injection was something his species had no idea was possible - and might even be something only humans were capable of, due to their radically different physiology. That might even be something latent in humans that the ivory was stirring up.\n\nOh, and - no reason Royal should be dead. Considering his relative invulnerability, if the part of the moon he's stuck to ever fell to to the surface, he'd regenerate. So it's not as if that character has been written into the 'absolutely dead' corner. I'm not saying he SHOULD be alive, but it wouldn't be hard to explain it if he was.", "timestamp_created": 1632280242, "timestamp_updated": 1632281768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99697262": {"recommendationid": "99697262", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995017064", "num_games_owned": 1009, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1016, "last_played": 1632197059}, "language": "english", "review": "The retro graphics are amazing and the story's an intriguing one, I guess.\n\nBut the game's simply not fun to play, half of the time.

There's a lot of nice environmental storytelling, and characters don't exposit more than they need to. I felt like they had realistic motivations and character arcs. Though I feel like Robin could have used a little more characterization, I got the gist of her, and that was more-or-less enough. Some of the dialogue is written kind of awkwardly, but overall it seemed like a lot of care was put into the story.\n\nThe pixel art and character designs are very good. The cast is very distinguishable and there are rarely any moments where you get confused about what's going on visually. I felt like the characters' emotions came across very well through the animations, and all of the zones of the game were distinct. \n\nThe music is also very good and I find myself listening to tracks from the OST sometimes. I really liked Ferrier Shockwoods and The Tower. There are a lot of good, emotional character themes as well.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it has a good feel for a platformer, and fighting feels fun. I've read other reviewers say that the save/continue system was frustrating, and that sometimes you restart too far back, but I didn't really fail enough at the gameplay to notice anything like that. I've seen other reviewers express frustration about being lost or not knowing what to do during boss battles, but that didn't really bother me.\n\nNow, I played it on Hard Mode, which I felt was a decent challenge, but I have some criticisms:\n\n- The tweak \"dodge\" feels like it'd be more fun if it were its own thing. It takes up a Tweak slot, and Tweaks break when you take damage, so it feels kind of lame when you lose it. I always made it my first Tweak so it'd be behind two other Tweaks. Maybe it'd be better if you got a tweak to extend the invincibility frames of dodge instead.\n\n- I didn't really find myself using the energize ability during combat much. It didn't really feel like it added a significant amount of damage sometimes. The Tweaks that improve it felt outclassed by other Tweaks so I never used them. A lot of enemies felt too dangerous to approach with melee attacks so it didn't really feel worth investing in melee, especially since you can lose dodge.\n\n- The Tweak system itself I feel kind of breaks down in Hard Mode. It's so difficult to obtain energy to repair your Tweaks and so easy to lose them that I tended to stick with dodge and two shields. It'd be nice if there were tricky things you could do during boss battles that like, instantly reward you with enough to repair one Tweak or something. Maybe there could be a short window where if you spin your wrench to deflect a shot just before it hits it could repair a Tweak. Honestly I feel like the Tweak system is sometimes just sort of a gimmick that makes you not want to play around with it.\n\n- It would be nice, for convenience sake, if you could instantly switch to and fire any of your gun modes with one button press, instead of cycling through them. However, not every system has enough buttons for that, so I suppose I can understand that.\n\n- Firing direction lock, so you can keep firing in one direction while jumping. But that would also take up another button, so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.\n\nOverall, it felt like a 4.5/5 experience. There was enough to overcome the flaws in the gameplay mechanics that I enjoyed it, and for most people it'll be fine.

First off, this is one of those games where I can give you an 80% synopsis of the story with a 30% explanation of why.  For example, the main character is a heathen is a simple enough trope.  Why?  Because she's an unlicensed mechanic.  The whole thrust of the story is that you, your brother and his family, all get persecuted by religious zealots because she's caught adjusting water pressure without a license.  Why doesn't she just apply for her license?  That's just one of many instances of plot happening but I'm left with more questions than answers.\n\nThe Metroidvania aspects are quite linear, which I'm okay with because there's really no incentive to go back and get crafting materials for a Tweak system that's pretty useless.  There are exactly two sidequests: Delivering Love/Breakup letters and trying to give a girl in a bed a twinkie.  Those quests really did not expand the world, feel meaningful in the moment, or offer meaningful rewards.  \n\nThe gameplay is fun.  Wrenching and shooting.  Puzzles.  Ziplines.  There wasn't a single aspect of the actual gameplay that frustrated me.  The bosses were pretty easy on normal, so I'd just start on hard.  \n\nThe story elements are bizarre but ultimately stick with you.  I woke up today trying to figure out the story and in a 10 hour metroidvania game with a silent protagonist, I would call that an accomplishment.

I finished it, but I was pretty done with it by the end. The game's high points, for me, were the beautiful and super cute animations, the puzzles and the clever and demanding boss fights.\n\nBut atmosphere and story of this game are all over the place. There's a weird disconnect between the cutesy-tootsy graphics, the light-hearted quips (some of them are pretty funny!) and the very, very brutal plot. The lore and dialog don't make all that much sense to me, mostly because quite a few characters speak in riddles. You're constantly thinking \"all right, I'll understand what this character meant to express later on\"... but it never becomes any clearer. I guess I sort of understand the gist of it, now that I'm through? But.. really, there's no shame in having a straight-forward story for most of your game. At least introduce your world a bit more first. By characters not literally quoting in-world scripture on a cliff.\n\nI wish I could give a more nuanced score on Steam, but this is a 6/10 for me.

If there wasn't so much dialog, then that wouldn't be such a big deal, but I sort of wish I had skipped the story. The concept for this world is certainly interesting, but it's all potential and very little pay-off, in my eyes.\n\nStill giving it a thumbs up because of the wonderful production value.

Yeah, this is one of that.\nThe game is not bad, it's efficient at being a game and all, but I just don't care about this one.\n(Yeah I've read about the development process of this game and how it affected Joakim Sandberg, but the game tho...)\n\nAlrite, let's go through the good stuff first:\n \n- The visual design is pretty darn good, the pixel art quality reminded me of great GBA games like the Megaman Zero series, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and the Metroid games. Even the UI designs made it feels like it belongs on the GBA, that's how slick it is. Nothing looks lazy here, that's for sure.\n\n- The combat mechanics and the boss fights are generally fun. Set pieces with boss encounters are genuinely unique, at least for this type of game. Many of the bosses required more from the players, wanting the players to use most of the main tools given, instead of just mindlessly damaging them with your weapon. Good job, Joakim! Oh yeah, the final boss's great! \n\n- Ah shit, I've run out of great things to say about this game\n\nNow, the middling stuff:\n\n- The gameplay's fine, mechanically the entire game feels like it works well enough for it not to fall apart. You can tell that certain details in the game are there to accommodate gameplay mechanics that aren't very flexible with its utility outside of combat. Certain blocks and switches just had to be there so gameplay can happen. I'm not gonna fault the game for being a video game, I just thought that thematically and visually these things are not very cohesive with the world its trying to build.\n\n- The story we got here is an amalgamation of Dune, dystopian fiction tropes, and Final Fantasy 13? No, wait think about it! A female protagonist (Robin) goes on an adventure to save her sibling (Elro) from a theocratic authoritarian force, accompanied by someone outside of the main community who coincidentally has the ability to save the world (Mina) featuring a white haired boy (Royal) with a mommy issue! Oh my god, what other game rips off FF13, my dude?! Alrite. Kidding aside, the story's just okay. The worldbuilding didn't excite my curiosity and my imagination. I don't care about Ivory nor the world. Replace it with Mako energy and nothing will change. The story and lore might be thematically deeper than what we got in the game, but I don't care anymore. The humor's nice at times, some of the more serious dramatic parts overstayed their welcome. There's like one backstory exposition dump right before a boss fight that's as memorable as how many times I save a game before I close it. Eh.  \n\nConclusion:\n\nWant a great story?

And, like many games in my library, I should have played this one much, much sooner. \n\nAs my 40ish shared screenshots of this game suggest, the pixel art in this one is fantastic. Each area, set piece, character, or enemy the player comes across was painstakingly crafted to be as visually striking as possible. I don\u2019t normally gush about graphics in games, but some of the scenes in this one will stick with me for a long time. Of course, screenshots don\u2019t do the game justice; one has to see it in motion to really appreciate it.\n\nBut I don\u2019t personally believe that a metroidvania can be carried by its graphical style alone. Luckily, this game was fun as all hell to play! But, while there are a lot of standard metroidvania traits here (exploring, upgrading, backtracking, etc.), I can see how it might not be someone\u2019s cup of tea\u2026 This one is extremely puzzle-heavy and story-driven.\n\nIt might be saying a lot about me, but some of the puzzles really twisted my brain into knots. I found them to be very clever, even when finding the solution had me slamming my head against the wall. The few puzzles I felt I needed to google never left me crying \u201cbullshit\u201d \u2013 the answer was in front of me all along and I was either too dense or too many beers deep to see it. But the puzzles aren\u2019t just limited to static environmental stuff: every boss is treated like a puzzle, too, making each one unique and memorable. I really loved the way they made me recall and use all the tools at my disposal in order to defeat them.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the story. I was absolutely a fan of the narrative: it was kind of nice to see a game in this genre really dive in and explore the themes it presents instead of delivering them in abstract ways and letting the player piece everything together themselves. In other words, it\u2019s lousy with longwinded characters. On top of that, it has some strong opinions about religion and government. It\u2019s literally the name of the game, after all. So, you know, if a story that critiques theocratic authoritarianism that threatens planetary devastation would get you hot under the collar, you should probably steer clear. \n\nAnyway, as always, if those things didn\u2019t turn you away, this one is absolutely worth your time.

I loved both Ori games, I loved \"Dust - An Elysian Tail\" and finishes all games at least twice. I also finished Hollow Knight so I know my way around hard metroidvania / platforming.\n\nIconoclasts is frustrating. The controls aren't as precise as the game needs them to be, the hidden treasures are boring and useless and often in dead ends so you don't even progress with the story line while solving a rather annoying puzzle.\n\nAnd the puzzles are annoying. Many of the puzzles are trial and error, often you have to do the puzzles not once but twice because the first time you activate something that you need on your second run which actually lets u pass the puzzle. If you die after that puzzle progress is not saved and you have to start from the last manual save point.\n\nThe story is uninteresting, hard to read and extremely long. Sometimes it feels like I'm reading a comic, not playing a game. I'm also not a fan of the art style but you see that before you play it so that's on me.\n\nAnd often you simply don't know what to do. At one point you switch from Robin, the main character, to Mina, the side character. She has a gun and for the longest time I didn't know how to use it. Every other weapon was \"press x (on controller) to fire\", hers wasn't. The first time you press x, there is an aim line that you move up and down with the controller stick. Only the second press of the button makes it shoot. But beware, if you turn the stick ever so slightly to the left or to the right you will point your gun horizontally in the direction you accidentally moved the stick to and that happens immediately. You also can't walk while aiming so trying to do that will result in you completely losing your aim, giving the enemy time to hit you.\n\nI'm not patient enough for this game so I'll leave it be.", "timestamp_created": 1626170786, "timestamp_updated": 1626170786, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95532450": {"recommendationid": "95532450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121280386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1626206856}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it", "timestamp_created": 1626003457, "timestamp_updated": 1626003457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95532212": {"recommendationid": "95532212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085700069", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1625862731}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10", "timestamp_created": 1626003163, "timestamp_updated": 1626003163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519774019718170166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95455314": {"recommendationid": "95455314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006026851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1625904500}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the exact type of Metroidvania I've been looking for.

I played it all the way through only because I play these kinds of games to complete them, but it was painful. Although I respect that one person made the game basically himself, he could have really used an editor. The story was all over the place, making all kinds of political commentary about religion, communism, fascism, economic and environmental issues and yet never really making a point. Rather, it just seemed to go out of its way to make almost every character unlikable because they were all some kind of nut job for one faction or the other and none of their plot lines really resolve. They don't seem to learn anything from their experiences, just kind of die or go home at the end. The main protagonist was the fine, I guess, but other than a few dialogue sequences, had nothing to say. The story was a convoluted mess and none of it really made sense and the end felt dragged out, with too many plot twists that didn't seem to really twist much. \n\nThe vast majority of the upgrades were optional, so it didn't feel like there was much real progression other than the few weapon and wrench upgrades, which were probably the highlight. There were very few of those though.\n\nThe controls felt sloppy and could have been a lot tighter, but precision was required where it seemed unnecessary and was not really possible when it would have seemed useful.\n\nMany of the enemies had certain tricks or weak spots, but the game doesn't really provide for any way to figure out what they are other than to die, repeat, and just experiment over and over.\n\nOverall, this game has many neat elements, I think if the designer had brought in a few people to help cull the story to make it more intelligible, fine tune the controls, and add some better communication of some of the key elements of the puzzles, enemies, and boss fights, it could have been really great.

As is widely noted, the art is spectacular, the animation is wonderful, and the music is great. The platforming is extremely tight with great controls, and the boss fights - Joakim's hallmark - are fun as hell. \n\nIt's the story that sets it apart, though - underneath its retro-fun and often colorful exterior, it has one of the most mature stories I've ever seen in a video game. It is a story about characters that do NOT grow and change - as in the real world, it is filled with people whose lived experience has calcified their beliefs and prejudices. And yet, these characters are written so well, that despite the limitations of 16-bit-style text boxes, their motivations, personalities and general being is so believable that you are constantly surprised by the empathy you feel towards them. \n\nThe world of Iconoclasts is intriguing and mysterious from the beginning, and the game explores and explains this world, bit by bit, while beautifully avoiding the sort of out-of-character exposition that is so common. Like any great story, it shows, rather than tells. Iconoclasts explores weighty themes that are rarely touched on in such a well-architected manner. Think of the kind of stuff that's often present in modern, epic JRPGs, but without being hit on the head by it. The world opens itself up to you to reveal these themes, rather than having them endlessly explained to you, as if you were a child. I suppose that's what I mean when I say how mature the story is; it doesn't require tremendous amounts of silly lore to flesh out a realized world. For me, Pathologic - an absurdly text-heavy game - is the high point of gaming in terms of writing and dialog, and I think Iconoclasts, a game with a story told in small text boxes and environmental clues, is right up there with it.\n\nThere's much I'd like to write, but won't to avoid spoilers - I'll just say that I found myself constantly awed by moments in the game. The ending may be my favorite ending in any game - it ties up all of these themes and ideas in a shocking, and incredibly satisfying way. (As an aside, the concept of \"Ivory\" and its uses is masterfully creepy while being understated.)\n\nI know this was a fawning review, so, is there anything I DIDN'T like? I can only think of one, and it's incredibly minor - the \"power-ups\" in the game felt like a bit of an afterthought while playing, and lo-and-behold, when I read an interview with Mr. Sandberg, it turned that it indeed was - at some point later during development he felt it was a necessary component in a metroidvania, and added it in. And who knows, maybe it is? I'm not sure if I would have missed them if the game didn't have them, and regardless, they certainly don't detract from the game or story in any way.\n\nI adore this game.", "timestamp_created": 1624589048, "timestamp_updated": 1624589864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94027447": {"recommendationid": "94027447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049949159", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1556338967}, "language": "english", "review": "The good: I like the artstyle.

Because of this, everything else, like the visuals, is less important and not as necessary to make a good game; this also means that a story in a videogame is superfluous and can be very simple or even absent.\nDespite this, videogames can be an interesting base for a story, either by finding interesting ways to tell it or by making it feel more personal thanks to the connection it creates with the player, who is functionally acting the story by playing.\n\nWhile playing Iconoclasts, I was enjoying the gameplay: it's the result of many years spent perfecting it by the developer, who single handedly created also everything else, so the game is solid throughout its entirety, with very few issues. As a videogame, it does its job perfectly.\nHowever, it didn't fully convince me: the base movement and combat is fine, but the later upgrades don't add a lot to the game and between the 'modifiers', only a handful of them are interesting. The game does fully deliver with the best it has to offer, the boss battles, which are all great and many of them even excellent, so, even if I didn't fully enjoy some of the gameplay, the game was still very fun.\n\nThe game is worth playing already by only considering the gameplay, but it also has nice visuals and a competent soundtrack, so that's enough for a successful videogame; it didn't need anything else, so a simple story would have been enough to tie it all together. But that didn't happen...\nThe title is maybe the most interesting thing of this game: it is never referred in the game and it's also an uncommon word, but it perfectly describes the story and its characters, which are truly the best thing of the entire game. It has been a while since I played Iconoclasts, but I needed some time to completely assimilate it, because it makes you reflect: the story poses interesting questions, the characters have deep motivations that are not clearly stated and, if that wasn't enough, the lore hidden in the game is plentiful and difficult to comprehend.

So all positives, here.\n\nThe mechanics are a mixed bag. I thought the environmental puzzles were fine, and while some were, to use a word seen in other reviews, \"fiddly,\" many multi-screen puzzles seemed pretty polished. Boss fights were interesting, as it generally took me about 2-3 attempts to figure out what the game wanted me to do. There are telegraphs for actions throughout, but the player's hand isn't \"held\" with most of them, which increased satisfaction in \"solving\" boss fights. That being said, both boss fights and the game in general, as many have pointed out, are extremely linear. Like other negative reviews, I too take issue with labeling this game as a \"Metroidvania\" due to that linearity as well as the sparse amount of power-ups. The tweak system had potential, but the truly interesting tweaks are hidden away within the game's small handful of sidequests. Plus, since you can lose the use of the tweaks when getting hit, it doesn't affect player choices enough to really play much of a role in the game-playing.\n\nFInally, the narrative: this is unfortunately what killed the game for me. My short version of summarizing the tone of the cast of characters, aside from the silent protagonist Robin, is that \"the women are angry and the men are deluded.\" Most characters spend their time 1.) yelling at each other, 2.) obtusely philosophizing with ambiguous antecedents, or 3.) making strange and often plot-dictated decisions as they act more like caricatures than characters. There are a sparse handful of emotional character notes that shine, but these were quickly lost by such notes being repeated over and over. A theme of self-loathing also echoes across many characters (again, aside from Robin)--which never seems to reach any sort of resolution, and in fact for a few, seems to only loom as an inevitable prophecy of destruction. It is unfortunately advised not to form an attachment to characters either; not many survive the story. Those that do (or do not, for that matter) grow/change as characters either not at all or very little. I acknowledge that this story seems to operate under the nihilist ideology of a capricious universe that giveth and taketh away without rhyme or reason, which is certainly a viable narrative choice. Simultaneously, I as a player putting work and effort into the unfolding of the story felt especially pained at the empty-reasoned losses suffered throughout. I stopped playing right as the rocket sequence started; at this point I did not feel like the story was rewarding me for sticking with it, but rather punishing me. I ended up watching a playthrough of the remaining game, and it was still quite painful to observe at several points.\n\nI think part of what is difficult to hold about this story is that feels like it has the capacity to be something more than it is. There are a lot of interesting  opportunities, especially with the world-building. But it seemed to never reach beyond a veiled and vaguely derisive socio-environmental commentary, and even this is defeated by a bit of a deus ex machina ending (which, perhaps, was the ironic point of the final boss and aftermath).\n\nAnd perhaps I am expecting too much realism from this world, but I still can't figure out how Robin's ponytail up in the wrench-u-shape could logistically work. Bothered me the whole game. I think part of why it did was because none of the other characters had any similarly inexplicable visual traits.", "timestamp_created": 1621845544, "timestamp_updated": 1621887362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92495626": {"recommendationid": "92495626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025907641", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2097, "last_played": 1622947044}, "language": "english", "review": "it took me 34 hours to complete my 17 hour playthrough", "timestamp_created": 1621814363, "timestamp_updated": 1621814855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440597683191299438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92428785": {"recommendationid": "92428785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859054225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1114, "last_played": 1609731741}, "language": "english", "review": "An underrated gem", "timestamp_created": 1621712669, "timestamp_updated": 1621712669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92311973": {"recommendationid": "92311973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025632123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1617029847}, "language": "english", "review": "Very very disappointing.

Though for a metroidvania it is quite linear.\nThe story... and here is where the weak part was, at least for me. The thing though is: it is well considered story with realized characters. The bad part was that the game started out with a ton of jargon that left me feeling at arms' length from the story. And several plot points that I think could benefit from being explicitly spelled out was left implied. As it was I was never quite sure what to feel about the various going on's since I didn't feel like I had a solid grasp on the interpersonal relationships and the political and theological make-up of the settings. Once I read up online what was going on I thought the story was quite strong, but the fact that I had to read online to understand it kind of illustrates why I found it lacking. In addition: the ending really drags on, so once you feel like you've reached the climax, bear in mind that there is a lot left to do, so if you're forcing yourself to just finish the very end you might like me stay up way past bedtime and have a sleep-deprived brain like the game less. I should also mention that it was only at the climax that I had a solid enough grasp on the plot to get the emotional impact of the going ons, and at that point it worked, though I was really tired.\n\nSo in summary: A great game whose story means I probably will have forgotten all about it in 6 months.", "timestamp_created": 1620858949, "timestamp_updated": 1620858949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91851485": {"recommendationid": "91851485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143377613", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1620782388}, "language": "english", "review": "i HIGHLY recommend this game.\nsuch a fun metroivania!\ni also like how the game has built-in god mode, so if u are stuck, u won't be.\noverall i really enjoyed the game!\nand boy do i love robin!

This never came up anywhere else in the game, and I don't recall a single place that mentions it. In the end all I had to do was take a few more steps back and it worked fine. The missile doesn't cause damage to the player, so the activation range just serves to make using the weapon annoying. Along those same lines you need to charge up your weapon to fire the missile and after you do there is a cool down. While it make sense to do this so players don't spam a powerful attack in combat, it makes puzzles tedious because a small mistake means having to wait for the cool down to try again. On the combat side of things the extra damage/ larger size of the charge attacks were never worth the cost to use them. Not only do you need to wait for a cool down, you can't even fire your regular weapon while you wait. Using the charge attack in combat was never worth it as firing your regular gun a few extra times dealt with most enemies just fine, I only ever used them for puzzle solving which just made the cool down pointless and annoying.\n\nOne of the core mechanics of the game is you can get upgrades to make yourself strong or better at doing things. Standard affair, but it was coupled with the confusing choice to make it so those upgrades turn off when you take too much damage. The only way to get them back on is to kill enemies or break statues. So on top of having low health you now have none of the upgrades you worked hard to get that might have actually made having low health less of a problem. The right most upgrade is always the first to go because 1 hit makes it unusable, so I usually just stuck something there I didn't care about and focused more on the other two slots. I have no idea why they did this, it made the upgrades almost pointless because as you traverse through an area, or fight a boss fight, you eventually lose all your upgrades before you reach the end. On top of that the upgrades themselves are very minimal, so the whole thing just makes one wonder why the developers included the system at all.\n\nThe story starts out simple, perhaps a bit cliche, but it pulls you in and makes you route for Robin the main character. But as it went on they just start throwing more and more at you, new characters, new concepts; and all of it is presented as either everyone knows about it so explains nothing properly, or no one knows anything so nothing is explained. It quickly became a mess and I lost all investment to keep playing as I no longer understood what the stakes were or why I should care. \n\nI don't wish to drone on much longer, but I wanted to quickly mention the boss fights. They are hit or miss, with the hits making it to the bare minimum of a good boss fight, and the misses being boring or frustrating fights. They tried to incorporate puzzle elements to the fights, with you having to use your weapons and abilities to make an opening to deal damage. But none of it works well together, and for several boss fights part of the process is getting far enough to see what knew thing the boss does, die, then start over with your knew knowledge. \n\nAll the work for this game when into the visuals, but I wouldn't call the game visually stunning. Everything looks nice, the animation is crisp and expressive, but there is almost nothing interesting to look at, and you constantly run back and forth through the same areas with the same nothing to look at. In comparison to something like Hollow Knight, another Metroidvania, even when you had to go back and forth through the same area you at least had interesting things to look at. In Iconoclasts the level design feels like a school project, functionally acceptable but visually uninteresting. If they put as much work into the world as they did the cute animation of Robin shaking her head or nodding her head in place of a simple yes or no text option, Im sure there would have been something of more substance.\n\nAs it stands, I can't say the game is worth buying at any price. There is a lot in it but it feels unfinished, and like the developers didn't care to hone their game play. The animations are nice, and the sprites cute, but thats not even close to enough to carry the game. I am 6 hours into a 20 hour long game and the thought of spending another 20 hours playing this game makes me feel dreadful. \n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1620110205, "timestamp_updated": 1620110205, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445687830448150635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91362408": {"recommendationid": "91362408", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970396550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 735, "last_played": 1621369222}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a beautiful looking game - however the characters are generally unlikeable.

TL;DR 8/10 overall, an incredibly well-made puzzle platformer with a compelling story marred by a weird ending and tacked-on crafting.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, and the music is fantastic. The gameplay feels really fucking smooth and polished. When you press the jump button, you immediately feel \"oh, that's a good jump\". The different weapons are pretty classic, but there are only a handful of them. The game has boss fights at a regular pace, and they range in quality from \"fine\" to \"the best fucking bossfight in a 2D game I've ever played\".\n\nIt's got the trappings of a metroidvania with gaining new abilities to solve puzzles in areas you've already gone through, but the rewards are paltry. I didn't care, though, because I found all the puzzles to be genuinely fun and engaging by themselves. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this game as a metroidvania, but fans of metroid will find themselves at home with the basic gameplay.\n\nI should note that I ran into multiple bugs while playing that other people don't seem to have run into. During cutscenes, the audio would constantly peak and then rewind a second, which was frustrating to say the least. I also ran into several moments during boss fights where the scripting would break, leading to my character being elevated off-screen as the second phase of a fight just fails to load. I also had multiple crashes, mostly happening when the game went to autosave before a cutscene and boss fight. I'm playing on a 6 year old laptop, so I don't expect these to be common issues for others, but they *can* happen. Outside of cutscenes, framerate and performance were solid.\n\nThe real strength of Iconoclasts is in the narrative and characters. If there was ever a game that's a poster child for Cerebus Syndrome, this is it. The first hours are deceptive, and by the end I was deeply invested in the fates of these characters. Elro and Black in particular are incredible. The unfortunate part is that in the very final minutes, the narrative takes a barely-foreshadowed left turn that shatters the mood that had been building up to that moment. I can understand why Konjak made the decisions he did with it, and it's not total nonsense as some might believe, but I personally think it's a step down from the powerful narrative leading up to it.\n\nIconoclasts is flawed. Fans of metroidvanias may find themselves disappointed with the lack of upgrades, and fans of puzzle games may find themselves disappointed with the amount of combat, and fans of the story may find themselves bored by getting dragged back to gameplay just as the story is getting somewhere.

Me pareci\u00f3 curioso el c\u00f3mo se me permiti\u00f3 tener una boss fight en menos de 10 minutos de juego y, de hecho, gracias a este tipo de planteamiento no tan com\u00fan me atrap\u00f3 de inmediato.  \n\nUn muy interesante juego de plataformas (porque de \u201cmetroidvania\u201d tiene poco y nada, la verdad) en donde es muy divertido, gracias a las mec\u00e1nicas, ir de un lado a otro. \u00c9stas mismas son bastante s\u00f3lidas en su ejecuci\u00f3n, tal vez pecan de ser poco explotables ya que no hay modo de diversificarlas, pero funcionales y divertidas, en definitiva.  \nRealmente, nunca sentir\u00e1s que te sobran las mejoras que consigues, el juego sabe aprovechar los recursos que tiene para que todo te sea \u00fatil a lo largo del mismo... bueno, esto no es del todo cierto, hay una gran excepci\u00f3n y son las \u201cmejoras crafteables\u201d que el juego provee.  \nEsto es lo \u00fanico que pienso que debi\u00f3 pensarse desde cero en temas de jugabilidad, porque no sirven de mucho. Me pas\u00e9 el juego en Normal, craftee las 3 primeras mejoras que encontr\u00e9 y no las volv\u00ed a cambiar en toda la partida, y todo esto sin ver afectado mi progreso en pr\u00e1cticamente nada.  \n\nLas peleas con los jefes (que cr\u00e9eme, van a ser muchas) a lo largo del juego est\u00e1n para mi sorpresa muy bien pensadas. Y es que a esto me refiero con que no sentir\u00e1s que te sobra casi nada, no hay jefe que se parezca al anterior en mec\u00e1nicas ni ejecuci\u00f3n. La progresi\u00f3n de los mismos es muy org\u00e1nica de cara a derrotarlos, te puedes llegar a atascar en ciertos momentos (como me pas\u00f3 a mi) pero no creo que te cueste nada deducir el patr\u00f3n o modo de vencerlos. \n\nLos personajes que este mundo presenta est\u00e1n bastante bien, algunos no cambian en absoluto a lo largo de la historia, otros son bastante memorables por el desarrollo (simple, pero muy efectivo) que poseen. Como tambi\u00e9n el propio mundo, el cual es bastante interesante, teniendo sus propias culturas y/o religiones (todo esto siendo importante para el propio desarrollo de la historia) sus reglas y sus formas de vida... digo, no es impresionante, pero todo fue ideado por una sola persona y el resultado es bastante gratificante.  \n \n... \n \nPero, creo que mi problema m\u00e1s grande con este juego es con su narrativa... no exactamente en lo que cuentan si no en c\u00f3mo nos lo cuentan, me explico: \nGran parte de la historia de nuestros personajes la podemos saber gracias a las cinem\u00e1ticas, gracias a estas sabemos qu\u00e9 piensan, qu\u00e9 quieren o c\u00f3mo interact\u00faan entre s\u00ed... pero todo esto, sacrificando tiempo.  \nLas cinem\u00e1ticas (aparte de seccionar la experiencia al crear una l\u00ednea muy visible entre JUGABILIDAD/HISTORIA) son muy sobre explicativas, y no lo entiendo, el juego se esfuerza en repetir ciertos pensamientos, ideas, justificaciones, etc. a lo largo de la historia para que el jugador entienda de qu\u00e9 va todo, pero generando conflicto con el conocimiento que ya hemos adquirido anteriormente porque todo al final se vuelve reiterativo. \nTambi\u00e9n, la manera que tiene el juego de hacernos saber estas cosas es solo a modo textual, casi no hay interacciones entre personajes m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de hablar por largos minutos, y no me agrada mucho en un juego que tiene muy notorias intenciones de ir un poco m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del est\u00e1ndar. \n\nPero, para ser sincero conmigo mismo, la historia (a\u00fan con los defectos que coment\u00e9) merece ser experimentada, hay un intento por contar algo nuevo y al menos a m\u00ed, la experiencia en general no me decepcion\u00f3. \n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, Iconoclasts me parece un juego que, aunque tiene defectos muy notorios, merece m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n de la que tiene. \nRecomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1619564593, "timestamp_updated": 1619580040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91000371": {"recommendationid": "91000371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971442549", "num_games_owned": 861, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1619524541}, "language": "english", "review": "A linear-ish 2D Metroidvania with plenty of corners to explore.\n\n+ Really beautiful pixel graphics with some nice backgrounds.\n+ Complex, very serious, dark and bleak story.\n+ Mostly interesting characters.\n\n- I feel it went on for too long.

Iconoclasts is a metroidvania. I\u2019m fully aware a lot of reviews I\u2019ve posted over the last months have all been metroidvanias \u2013 it\u2019s a genre I enjoy playing and as a result will have some reviews about them \ud83d\ude09\n\nIconoclasts surprised me. Going through my steam queue I noted a pixel graphics style metroidvania, so obviously that went onto the wishlist. It stayed there forgotten for the better part of a year, until it showed up in a bundle on Fanatical. I got the game because I had it wishlisted, and I have to say \u2013 zero regrets.\n\nThe theme\nCharming, proper retro feel and a lot of attention to detail. The main heroine of the game is a mechanic in a far and distant future where a white liquid called \u201civory\u201d is used to power biomechanics and electricity. World changing in a way you could not imagine until you reach that point in the game where things are explained without spoilers.\n\nThe game gives a feeling of various super nintendo-era games and does this very well. Right down to the not-so-smart sidekicks, over protective siblings and evil characters turned good. For the art and movement style I would say it reminds me of Starbound, crosscode, chrono trigger and stardew valley. Somehow all those styles were turned into a single metroidvania, and it was done well. The graphical style is very colorful, and the characters both good and evil have a way of showing quirks that really bring them to life. This game is not for the faint of heart. People will be kicked off hills, arms will be torn off and characters may or may not be vaporized by a giant beam of death from the sky. You have been warned. The comedy especially really just \u201cworks\u201d, and it works very well.\n\nAny other SNES era style RPG where your character nearly drowns and gets fished up \u2013 would be the start of the story.

After seven years in development, that doesn\u2019t really surprise me, but it made playing the game rather unenjoyable.  I never would have expected it to have turned out like this; this is not what I thought the game would when I first saw its store page, but here we are.  It is average at best, and to some it\u2019s even worse than that.  It is clearly enjoyed by some, but I could never recommend this.\n\nMany of the reviews describe the game in a way that I feel gives it too much credit.  I would describe it as average overall.  Although there are points where it stands out, it doesn\u2019t make up for what it lacks.  \n\nI would not consider it to be a metroidvania, as the game is very linear and the upgrades it provides has very little, if any, impact on gameplay.  With that in mind, the exploration becomes unrewarding and unfulfilling, as they only offer these upgrades and the materials to craft them.  This is closer to an action/puzzle platformer if anything.\n\nI would also not consider it well written, its jarring tonal shifts clash with the rest of its presentation.  In a game that first presents itself as bright and fun through its great artstyle and soundtrack, it gets shockingly dark and gruesome as the game progresses.  It feels hamfistedly placed into the game, and I am not certain how Konjak thought it juxtaposed well with the game as a whole.  Not only did it feel joyless to play through, the story failed to garner any of my investment.\n\nThe gameplay is your average action/puzzle platformer.  You\u2019ll get some tools to kill enemies, solve platforming puzzles, and explore the world as you try to reach the end of the game.  Some of the puzzles are clever, the combat and movement as a whole are serviceable, but there is nothing in particular that I would say makes it stand out.  Even if you cared about gameplay above all else, the game would still only be average.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Konjak has put a lot of time and effort into Iconoclasts.  This isn\u2019t some asset flip worthy of the truly bad title, I just did not enjoy it as much as I would have liked.   I commend him for his effort; game development is not easy, especially solo.  I do not write this review because I hate him, nor do I wish for games to be bad solely so I can point out the obvious.  I only wish that this turned out to be something I enjoyed, but it sadly did not.  I wish him luck on his future endeavors, he has proven that he has the ability to do great things, and I will be watching intently, even if I may feel otherwise about this game in particular.\n", "timestamp_created": 1616806729, "timestamp_updated": 1616806729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643815934658050537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89017167": {"recommendationid": "89017167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028211626", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1617118391}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels great to play, looks beautiful, and the music is fantastic, but it is a shame that the tweaks are kind of meaningless.

Fun at first, but did nothing but slow me down and annoy me later on.\n\nBosses are fun. Each one is like a mini-puzzle that you have to figure out.\n\n[h1]Upgrades/tweaks(2/10)[/h1]\nThis is outright awful, because this one feature ruins the entire game. For now, all you need to know is:\n[list]\n[*]They are craftable. You get blueprints and you know exactly what you're getting immediately after getting a blueprint.\n[*]You can only use 3 at a time.\n[*]They break. When durability drops to 0 they get disabled until they are fixed.\n[*]Most of them are useless outside of platforming puzzles. I used movement speed for gameplay and the rest was for metroidvania obstacle reasons.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Exploration(4/10) [/h1]\nThe base for exploration in this game is great. Tools you use in exploration are fun and synergies between them later on also seem nice. Mechanically the game is sophisticated enough to be amazing. \n \nSo why 4/10?\n[list]\n[*]Rewards are materials for crafting previously mentioned upgrades. Upgrades are useless so crafting materials are also useless by extension.\n[*]A lot of puzzles are too easy, which makes it feel like the game is just wasting my time. Like imagine a room with 3 consecutive jump (with ledge grab/climb) sections. Does that sound fun? Why is that even in game? It's not challenging nor fun! it's just pointless.\n[*]Metroidvania style backtracking.... a lot of it. This one is only a problem because rewards are useless. When rewards are not meaningful enough and puzzles are dull, backtracking across entire game to do 1 more puzzle for a useless reward feels like a chore.\n[/list]\n\nI think 2 biggest mistakes are related to exploration being unrewarding:\n[list]\n[*]Giving blueprints, lets me know ahead of time, that those items are useless. That means I am not incentivized to look for materials for those blueprints. If chests gave those upgrades directly instead, I would still be inclined to explore, because I wouldn't know what I would get.\n[*]3 upgrade slots means crafting 4th item is pointless. I think getting upgrades to improve instead of getting duplicates would greatly help with that. It would raise the power cap, but it would give 9 items value, instead of just 3. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1616020416, "timestamp_updated": 1616111633, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88589333": {"recommendationid": "88589333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073201533", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1370, "last_played": 1615986080}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay itself might be simple, but this game is a great metroidvania.", "timestamp_created": 1615990080, "timestamp_updated": 1615990080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88543276": {"recommendationid": "88543276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151779098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1607046271}, "language": "english", "review": "When I started the game: \"Awww, this is so cute!

A smooth experience all around with unique mechanics that build on themselves although not to a very complex degree, and sometimes there will be times where you'll forget something you haven't done for a bit if you don't keep playing the game a lot. The combat uses all of the mechanics from platforming, but in different ways to bring pain to your enemies although there will be times where doing the one thing will trump doing anything else which is often unfortunate in games. One last thing to say is that it indeed fills out most criteria to be a \"Metroidvania\" (2-d exploration platforming puzzler with bosses centered on movement) it is a rather linear game. There's often little to no reason to go back to \nArt\\Animation: I'm not very good at recognizing what is and is not good visual art at times, but I do know what monkey brain likes and monkey brain likes this a lot. Things are almost always cute in the 2-d pixel style that encompasses the entire game. It's got a lot of heart here and when things move it is absolutely buttery-smooth. I love just watching anything move in this game as everything is crafted with such detail that momentum and weight can almost be felt. There are times near the end that seem a little lazy, but I didn't mind all that much it was really only to slap one more mechanic at you.\nMusic: Not particularly impressive in any one regard honestly, but it's always very fitting. I enjoyed most tracks, and there are a few that really stand out and are just fun to listen to. \nStory: Absolutely knock-out of a story. There's lots of really great humor and cute little scenes and it just keeps coming which is good because it really needs as much of that as it can get because this is a tragically dark tale. Deep morals about philosophy and environmentalism, what your role in society is, and how much it can hurt just to help someone else. With the cute music, and art the writing makes the game almost seem almost bi-polar, but not in a bad way. \n", "timestamp_created": 1614993215, "timestamp_updated": 1614993215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87895459": {"recommendationid": "87895459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401922475", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1646880044}, "language": "spanish", "review": "J u e g a z o.", "timestamp_created": 1614954845, "timestamp_updated": 1614954845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87893767": {"recommendationid": "87893767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323468518", "num_games_owned": 902, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1686606840}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, fun and all", "timestamp_created": 1614952834, "timestamp_updated": 1614952834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87854106": {"recommendationid": "87854106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071911974", "num_games_owned": 1767, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1614887372}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, that was a ride.\n\nThe dialog felt a bit strange at times, but the world and story are fascinating.

Beyond the colorful aesthetic, there is a very grim underbelly to the world that was a joy to uncover.\n\nOne criticism is the upgrade system leaves a lot to be desired. From beginning to end, you only ever have 3 slots for abilities to equip, and these are very generic. One blocks damage for a hit, another increases damage for your wrench or length of its spin attack, one increases the amount of time you can hold breath underwater, and mau. You never have the ability to upgrade health, weapon range, cooldown times for firing, radius for bombs, etc. Simply not enough variety, and in a game that provides plenty of challenging puzzles that reward you with upgrade materials, there wasn't enough incentive for me to keep doing them after the first couple levels. I had the abilities I wanted, and never swapped for the entire game. That's a long time for a 15 hour game... More variety of abilities would've gone a long way and really would have been pretty simple to integrate in terms of coding. Especially when considering the amount of work went into the pixel-perfect art assets, this would be nothing by comparison.\n\nThat however, is a small critique in an otherwise very worthwhile game that impressed the hell out of me in terms of artwork and its intriguing theocratic world and lore.

Lots of \"show, don't tell\" in the design. I could easily have seen this cast and plot in a JRPG. I loved the \"twists\" and surprises near the end, bulge and all.\n\nSome weird inconveniences that I don't fully understand. Your abilities, called \"Tweaks,\" break when you get hit. They refill mostly by successfully killing. So in practice, these Tweaks, which should make your fighting and exploration easier, are exclusively for people who are already good enough to not need them. Taking damage already feels like failure when you just lose HP, but nullifying an ability really rubs salt in the wound. Imagine if you were playing Mario and every time you failed a jump your jump height got reduced a little: that's how this feels.\n\nExcept not really... because Tweaks are all mostly inconsequential save for maybe a few key moments that call for them to be stacked. You can craft and stack 3 Underwater Breathing Tweaks, for example, and yet you never *need* them for any area or puzzle except an optional secret (and even that area only needs 2).\n\nThis creates a weirdness where you feel bad because you lost a Tweak but also you don't really care because that Tweak wasn't helping you much to begin with.\n\nAlso, I'm certain that the only reason it takes two button pushes to charge your wrench is to justify equipping the Spindle Tweak. \n\nBut enough about Tweaks!

The gameplay itself is solid, allowing for very fun puzzle-solving and exploration using Robin's tools, while also constantly switching things up to make sure you're never repeating things for too long. The art and music are a treat and complement the gameplay well.\n\nThe game does have some faults in it's combat; while the controls are responsive and smooth, there are a lot of enemies that require specific actions or positioning that is difficult to intuit; this tends to make most boss fights more of a puzzle than an actual test of skill, which is sometimes rewarding and sometimes...annoying. It can be especially frustrating if said boss can only be hit from a very precise angle (Looking at you, [spoiler]Ivory Beast[/spoiler]).

Here's a skim of it\n\nThe game looks absolutely stunning, It's without a doubt one of the best looking games i played, and it runs smoothely even on my potato\nThe characters, story, and lore are the main selling point. If you love getting lost in a world's history and setting, this is the game for you\nThe music is bretty good\nThe boss fights are universally loved, and you unlock a (in my opinion too difficult) Boss rush at the end\n\nAnd now for that bad.\nThe gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Enemies are more like annoyances than threats. Along with that, the game isn't really about combat at all. This is by all intents and purposes a puzzle game. Unless you're in a cutscene or a boss fight, You're completing a puzzle or moving from A to B.\nSome of said puzzles are unfair. Not in the sense that it is too hard, but in the sense the the solution is dumb. Once a game also makes the way you have to go a hidden path, another time the instruction are just unclear. Don't be ashamed for looking up playthroughs, Everyone has.\nThis game is NOT a metroidvania. and there is no reason to go back to an area even if you didn't get any chests in it, Since tweaks are almost useless. There is also no feeling of getting stronger or getting new abilities, since the abilities and guns you do get are almost exclusively for solving puzzles\nThe ending is...very divisive. I hated it, But some people like it. I can't really say anything more on it. The story up to it is still really good though\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that this game FAR darker than the artstyle implies. Like, Your entire family dies in the first 20 minutes level dark.

This little gem was sadly overshadowed by Celeste that came only 2 days after the release of this title, so it's understandable how it went a bit under the radar. Aside from this, let me list what I enjoyed about this game.\n\nThe visual art style was very enjoyable for me, sure there is a case to be made about the oversaturation of pixel art style games in the indie market, but each title never ceases to amaze me how they can all look so beautiful and can be so different. Games such as this one, hyper light drifter, celeste, and shovel knight are all fantastic examples of the diversity of the pixel style and the jaw dropping visuals they may have despite their simplicity.\n\nThe music is top notch, there was not one track I did not enjoy in my entire playthrough, they all had their place and fulfilled their purpose, a few of which amped up the thrill of a scene, generated great suspense, or just really tug at my heart strings. \n\nThe story was quite enjoyable for me, may have been weak at some parts but the other aspects of the game really come into full force to compensate for it. after finishing the game 100%, I just craved for some more about this world the developer created, it has a genuinely interesting premise that I hope is explored more in the future... hopefully not another 8-10 years this time.\n\nNow for the fundamental aspect, the GAMEPLAY. The gameplay reminds me alot more of megaman then it does of a metroid or castlevania game. Sure there may be SOME backtracking, but 90% of it is for collectibles and not for actual progression, still fun to backtrack and find new secret paths with your acquired goodies though. Puzzle solving is very enjoyable, nothing too stellar but it was def a highlight of the game for a few portions. Now for the action and platforming, both of them are top tier for me, the speed, the little mechanics here and there and some of the tweaks you earn really make maneuvering and combat a blast, especially for the boss fights where each and every one is memorable and thrilling! I just crave MORE and a sequel just can't come soon enough, I'd certainly get some DLC if the option was ever given to me.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get this game, you won't regret it!", "timestamp_created": 1611167122, "timestamp_updated": 1611167122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85023797": {"recommendationid": "85023797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400573225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1689525220}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the game, would recommend since the mechanics of the game rely on tools that you use to progress through the game.

But I didn't think it would be that good.\n\nIconoclasts is... Probably more Mega Man and Castlevania than Metroid, and the sooner you think that way the better. Almost every time I fought a boss I was miffed by the drastic changes and the almost frantic shift in how to approach them that I swore against the game in terms of gameplay almost every single time, questioning how you were expected to know how to respond to a move change or attack that either disorients the player or makes you offensively bankrupt by playing too offensive.\n--But when you take out the idea that it is remotely related to Metroid, the bosses make more sense, and the game just feels better to appreciate. \n\nThe thing that kept pushing me from buying the game was the idea that I kept hearing that males were just making all the bad decisions and females were mainly the ones who thought rationally and made an actual difference in power and intellect.\n--While those people aren't entirely wrong, I feel like it is more of a representation of the types of characters that ended up gravitating towards the MC (Main Character) more than anything... Just thought I'd say that before I went on if there was anyone else kind of annoyed by that in media...\n\nSince I already started on that note, Let's talk about the characters as a whole.\nALL OF THEM... are GREAT!\n--Do I like all of them? NO... But if you've ever met someone so consistently continuitous to their character or motive that you really want to know why they are the way they are, then I implore you to play this game. There are kindhearted characters, selfish cowards, stoic, blasphemers, self righteous, narcissists, ignorant, naive, silent, brash, egotistical, arrogant characters in here. To the point where they are crafted in a way where it is surely believable that these characters have in fact been living for a very long time, because they behave in such a personified, dictionary sort of way that you cannot help but want to know more about them for your own sake, so when you deal with those emotions or feelings you do not hold the mindset that possessed these people to be so cliche in the way they present themselves. \n\nThe story... Well when you're playing, if you're like me, you wonder why in heck the game is called Iconoclasts, but when you play it and realize so many characters are pushing the bubble in a race to see who pops it first, it makes perfect sense. I'm not sure if I've done nearly enough to speak on the story even though I beat it, but it is quite simply... A world set in an environment where certain people have been given an amplifier of sorts, that amplifier is something I will tease you by comparing it to Mako energy in Final Fantasy VII... So the people who have this power are individuals who think and act differently because of the people they are, and since they were all human, their experiences and hardships have molded and perhaps broken their mental state over time, and because there is almost always a larger force at work, it's like watching a bunch of people with authority at each other's throats for inconsequential slivers of power.\n-On the other side of that fence is regular people, Skilled people who shape the world with knowledge and not power. You wonder sometimes how they even got involved, but at the end of the day... The tease I made at Mako energy will probably spell out why things are the way they are.\n\nGameplay is next...\n-Gosh... I played it on the harder difficulty and I will say that the game is a very smooth experience when you get familiar with what you are doing. THANK THE GODS that the game will save checkpoints before boss battles and after important events. Because most if not all of the difficulty comes from being overwhelmed by mechanics and patterns you either are not familiar with, or didn't really have enough time to figure out. \n-That being said, there are a few times near the end where mechanics that are required have tight hit zones, and because charge attacks overheat your gun, things that you rely on working can leave you in a state of helplessness. Granted, for a short time.  Other mechanics like swimming and jumping can really make you scratch your head because there are at least 5 instances where you really feel like you should be able to get to some chests and areas, but cannot because of a lack in ability that seasoned gamers will not suspect is halting them from getting where they need to... very small quip. \n\nI would say Graphics... but no.\nThe art style is deceptively adorable, but aggressively so. The only character that has any business looking that cute is the MC. Every other character has some sort of personality that warrants them to have a more seasoned, deliberate type of style that exposes them for being who they are. But the sad part is, it accomplishes what I just said, but the way the characters are almost purely cliche in terms of their behavior and ambitions, I can't help but feel like there could be more done to give more life to some of the harsh, vivid and somewhat playful text bubble content that some characters speak towards one another.

I managed to get to 60% in 10 hours.\n\nThe short version is: the game is a mess of everything.\n\nI utterly love metroidvanias (I grew up playing Metroid a lot, so yes I'm old), but this game just poorly executed everything. The biggest offense is that somehow it's a very linear metroidvania. You go from area to area, usually pick up 1 new upgrade/trick, which you then use to move to the next area (after the mandatory boss fight). Once further into the game, the world slightly opens up more, and you can go back to previous areas to pick up missed items/secrets. However, the world is still very small and closed/linear. There is a very clear step-by-step area-by-area design in place, which does not fit the spirit of a metroidvania. A metroidvania should have a very big and open world, where you run into obstacles that you know you will later get back to once you have the right upgrades.\n\nThe story in it's idea and concept are kinda interesting, however, execution is poor. Too much poorly written text. So much unnecessary drama, just to try to make it not bland. But it just ends up with annoying and either simplistic or unrealistic characters, dialog is abysmal. Sometimes there are quests which just means talking to 2 people back and forth 4 times, and then you get some item. In other words: Boring.\n\nThere is a party system, where the main character has friends with her as you play. However, it's completely and utterly ignored/useless. You cannot switch between characters, so this just means that in the top-right corner there are a few faces of your group which you just ignore. So far (60% complete) you needed to use 2 characters while playing and switching between them. Twice in 10 hours... just leave it out then.\n\nAs you explore the world, you find materials which you need to craft simple upgrades for yourself. Besides 1 or 2 key upgrades, they are overall quite weak. On top of these weak improvements, you can only equip 3 at the same time and if you get hit by an enemy 1 breaks. So now health went down, as well as getting weaker due to 1 less working upgrade. This is completely an unnecessary mechanic, neither fun or sensible.\n\nOverall, everything just feels like a mix of ideas that aren't executed well nor do they blend nicely together.

Though not necessarily a bad thing, it played a lot with my expectations all the way until my very last achievement, and I personally thought that was the [i]second[/i] best part of my experience for its omnipresence.\nThe first has got to be the difficulty.

Then I saw gameplay of it and was instantly interested, and eventually here we are, game was bought Ive played it fully and my thoughts were very positive. It certainly doesn't feel like most other games of the same genre with more of an emphasis on puzzle solving and boss fights than exploration and upgrades. \n\nThe game also does more with the story than ive seen most metroidvanias do, having a constant narrative reason for doing the things you do, and the story and characters are definitely one of this game's strongest aspects in my opinion, giving you a world that gives you enough lore to have you understanding it but leaves you asking questions. The cast itself is certainly something that comes to my mind with the silent but eager hero Robin, to the mysterious yet dweeby Royal. I legit was on the edge of my seat for a lot of the story wondering where it was going to go next. \n\nThe gameplay itself is also quite solid, with a lot of puzzle solving mixed in requiring you to think of how you can use your arsenal to progress while also sometimes require you to think quick as well. Combat isn't normally what keeps you going in this game as you don't get too many weapons throughout the course of the game and charge shots require a rather hefty recharge time. However boss fights are where the game really kicks up in terms of gameplay whether they require you to figure out how to expose their weak spot with puzzle solving or are just 1 v 1 reaction tests where you need to dodge using what the game gives you, or use one of your many tweaks that act as pseudo character upgrades to give you an edge in combat and movement. Either way, the boss fights and story was what kept me going in this game as I was constantly wondering what was coming next... not to downplay the stuff in between because every area is interesting to explore (minus one area that I wont spoil here). The bosses and story is the driving force that will keep you going most likely. \n\nPresentation is very solid too, Iconoclasts is a game that takes cues from 16 bit games with vivid colors and crunchy sound design that was popular... though it feels less Super Nintendo and Genesis and more Game Boy Advance if that's wierd to say... tho maybe not since the game had heavy inspirations from Metroid Fusion, either way the game's looks and sounds were amazing and catchy. Characters moved really fluently and despite not being the most detailed sprites in the world I could typically tell exactly how a character was feeling during cutscenes, with music that fits each area very well and makes every boss encounter feel really invigorating. \n\nOverall Iconoclasts is a great game that I'd highly reccomend to anyone who enjoys metroidvanias. The game really has a great feel to it that makes it overall just fun experience.

puzzling, but the story was pretty good.\nFor the combat:\nSort of metroid-style, with different guns you switch between. Most enemies aren't very interactive, and it feels like a waste of time to fight them when you can just jump over them. The ones you cannot usually have some form of a gimmick where, for example, you cannot hit them unless they are attacking you. I believe this was supposed to make them feel like more of a challenge to defeat, but in my opinion, it made them moreso annoying than anything else. Other enemies are literally unkillable unless you make them walk on spikes, which are a whole different story.\nThe boss-fights feel more like puzzles than actual enemies you had to defeat, where once you knew what you were actually supposed to do they became very straightforward. Sometimes you had to figure out you had to use a specific gun, or use a specific move (like a wrench swing or a ground pound) on a certain hitbox.\nNext, the puzzles:\nSome were pretty good, but they all rotated around a few mechanics that (in my opinion) got old pretty quickly. Not only that, but it got pretty repetitive to always have to solve a puzzle to get a key to unlock the next area.\nIf it wasn't to unlock an area, the rewards for the puzzles were usually just an extra \"quirk\" material, which are this game's collectibles. They're not the most creative upgrades, where most are just, for example, making you capable of swinging your wrench for an extra fraction of a second. And so, it felt pretty bad to solve a puzzle, only to find out all I got was another piece of \"improvium\" I was never going to use.\nThe story:\nThe story was definitely this game's main focus. It was fairly good, with a cast of characters that get developed and influence different events around the game's world.\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a very story-focused game with relatively-fun gameplay on the side, look no further. On the other hand, if you're in it for fun and engaging gameplay, you may be disappointed.\nOverall: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1599068881, "timestamp_updated": 1604983366, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75283313": {"recommendationid": "75283313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027966953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1176, "last_played": 1598980970}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to just sit back and zone out!", "timestamp_created": 1598981003, "timestamp_updated": 1598981003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75280095": {"recommendationid": "75280095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117085660", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 773, "last_played": 1595544351}, "language": "english", "review": "this game... it sucks. i hate it so fucking much. it is a game that has hurt me on many levels, and the story is very disappointing and boils down to misery porn. a lot of bad stuff happens in this game for no reason whatsoever, and it is emotionally abusive and scarring. do not play this game unless you are mentally and physically prepared for bullshit and emotionally draining negative moments with no truly happy resolution or any reasonable justification. the ending has been done better by a person on ao3 than the actual developer", "timestamp_created": 1598976680, "timestamp_updated": 1633879307, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488740116357803345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75278341": {"recommendationid": "75278341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088923635", "num_games_owned": 1045, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1549938203}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game for a bit on PC, refunded it because I wasn't really feeling it, but recently bought and played it in full on Switch, so keep that in mind.\n\nIconoclasts was a very interesting game. Made by one person over the span of several years, it sports gorgeous pixel art, great music, unique puzzles, and a surprisingly dark and existential story. It follows the story of a young adult named Robin, who ekes out a life as a mechanic for her small settlement - illegally, as much of the world is dominated by a theocratic empire called the One Concern, which forbids unauthorized civilians from tampering with Ivory, essentially a magical superfuel that the One Concern have integrated into just about every part of construction possible. Robin's life is thrown into turmoil after the One Concern find her in the middle of repairing her brother's home, and she has to go on the run to escape them, with the assistance of Mina, a \"pirate\" whose society is hunted by the One Concern for offering a different religion than theirs; Royal, the pompous if disillusioned heir to the One Concern's pope analogue; and occasionally Elro, Robin's traumatized older brother. Through her journey, Robin learns more about One Concern as a society, Ivory's true nature, and the lengths people will go to to fulfill their ideals.\n \nAs a metroidvania and a game, I can't recommend Iconoclasts. Movement and action is generally smooth, but never changes enough for me to really enjoy it - there's only a handful of upgrades through the game, which generally just let you solve more puzzles instead of offering new and interesting ways to move around the world. You also obtain upgrades in weird ways, they're usually just handed to you with little fanfare instead of getting them for completing a boss or challenge like you'd expect. Combat isn't super interesting, and I found myself actively avoiding it by the end of the game since often it can just be waiting for the opportunity to reflect any enemy's shot or spamming gunfire until they die. If there's a part of the gameplay I can compliment, it's that the puzzles are overall very unique and often are really good! What's more, bosses are plentiful throughout the game and each one is really interesting and usually fun to fight. Some can be pretty tedious or annoying, but overall each boss is very unique and there's a ton of passion behind their design.\n \nDespite the problems I have with the gameplay, I'd still recommend Iconoclasts as a must-play, because its story is excellent. Characters are interesting, have depth, changing motivations, and quiet moments that make you feel for them even if they're unlikeable as people. Decisions made by characters impact the story greatly and it's amazing to see a lot of the themes they address. Like I said earlier, the game is surprisingly dark in the latter half, in an existential sense that makes you imagine what choices you would make if you were in their situation. It's emotional to play through at many points. The only downside I can claim about the story and characters is that the English translation can often be confusing or poor, which makes some parts of the story harder to grasp until further in the game. \n\nOverall, please play Iconoclasts.

It follows the story of Robin, a mechanic, as she travels across the world as chaos ensues and she has to bolt it back together (being vague since this is seriously a game that the story is that important) I got Iconoclasts from Chrono.gg as the last game I got before their Chrono Coin Shop closed and being the most expensive new game they were selling I got it quickly with no clue with what I was getting.\n\nGameplay of Iconoclasts features the usual platformer getup with a standard jump, solid movement, and a stun gun to shoot things with. Robin has a few more inclusions in her moves like having a ground slam move, or being able grab up ledges. But one of Robin's most versatile moves she has is her trusty wrench. As a mechanic Robin can screw bolts in the world to activate various machinery or use to them to swing across to higher platforms, as the game progresses you get more abilities to use with your wrench and stun gun with that introducing more ways to solve the game's many puzzles, platforming challenges and amazing variety of bosses. Also included is the tweak system where you can choose up to 3 buffs to Robin that can help you out but the catch is that if you get hit you lose a slot and you'll have to fill it up again by defeating enemies. (You can also play as other characters briefly during the story mode which was a nice touch)\n\nIconoclasts has a pixel artstyle for practically everything in the game and it's some of the smoothest and most beautiful pixel art I've seen in a while. All the sections of the game feel distinct from each other thanks to sheer amount of effort in the environment, visual and enemy designs and animations. Robin and many of the other characters have a cutesy art style which is fairly different from their portrait art but is still animated so well. Like Robin's crawling animation has little tip taps and it was just so adorable, while characters like the Agents have more gritty animations in the same style. Major props for some of the bosses having so much dang movement and speed that it was just amazing is see and fight.\n\nNow I don't really want to spoil the story of Iconoclasts that much since it's definitely one of the best things about that game and something that kept me hooked and invested for the entire journey. LIke during my second session of the game I played it for 12 hours from the 3rd area straight to completion and I was invested in both gameplay and the story. The music here also is pretty awesome and fits the mood perfectly for whatever's going on and you can purchase the soundtrack separately if that interests you.\n\nThere were a few criticisms I had with the game, like with bosses' having so crazy moves that it's hard to understand what exactly you need to do to deal damage, while it didn't prevent me from completing the game it did take a few tries and attempts to learn almost everything about the boss' moves. Also a very tiny nitpick is that the health pickups aren't affected by gravity which was annoying when I needed health but the pickup was just a tad bit out of my reach. (Obviously this was me playing without the double jump tweak)\n\nOverall, Iconoclasts is just a fantastic game, with solid mechanics, great music, and an amazing story that left an impact on me. In fact I enjoyed my time with Iconoclasts so much that I even made [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2204555723] Fanart [/url] of one of the Agents.

Not to say that this makes it bad on its own, but it wasn't the experience that I enjoy.\n\nThe gameplay itself feels great. Very smooth and interesting, not overly complicated. The problem is that it doesn't much evolve. Throughout the entire game, you essentially unlock a few new guns with interesting mechanics, but that's about it. No health upgrades. There are also small \"upgrades\" you can craft called tweaks, but they are hard to rely on since they break after you get hit, you can only equip 3 at a time, and there is no way to unlock more slots.\n\nAs for the story, it's very deep and quite interesting. My personal problem is that it took over the gameplay. There is a LOT of dialog, and thus a lot of reading. I got tired of some of the back-and-forth between some characters, and at times would wonder \"when can I get back to actually playing?\". The story itself also was disappointing. It gives the impression that choices matter, but it is very much a linear narrative. Also, (Sort-of spoiler) [spoiler]the end seemed to come too quickly, left a lot of unanswered questions and was in some ways confusing.[/spoiler]\n\nI played through the whole game, and got all the achievements (except for the challenge mode) to feel I got my money's worth.

The visuals are really great, but don't bother with this game if you place more importance in gameplay.\n\nThe only thing this game has going for it is the sprite work. Visuals a truly great for a pixel art game. You might also enjoy the soundtrack if you're into 8-bit music but, since I'm not, it's hard for me to tell how good it is.\n\nWhat's not hard for me to say is how extremely far all the other aspects of the game are lagging behind its presentation.\n\nFirst, this game can barely be qualified as a metroidvania. The feeling of non-linearity comes more from how contrived the level design is rather than how open it is. I was following a very linear path, I just didn't realize it because that path required me to do so much back and forth that it gave me the feeling of being lost. The fact that level traversal is so unremarkable didn't help keep my attention, which might be tied to the fact that upgrades are few and far between, and don't really open up the gameplay as much as they let me finally progress. \n\nCombat is extremely basic but functional, and the Tweak system that lets you pick minor buffs has so little impact that I forgot about it until the game reminded me it existed. The bosses are a highlight and they're definitely visually fun, but they didn't present much of a challenge as soon as I found their gimmick. Until that moment, they could be frustrating as their moves were sometimes chaining too fast for me to figure out what I needed to do. In short, die a couple times while you figure out what you need to do, then kill the boss on the next try because execution isn't a challenge.\n\nThat also applies to most puzzles in the game, if you can even call them that. They're mostly a 2-3 steps puzzles that take about a minute to figure out since they aren't many possibilities and your move set is so limited. When the solution wasn't immediately obvious, I just tried everything I could do and the solution was clear within 30 seconds. Again, this didn't help with how boring the exploration was for me. My thoughts kept going back to CrossCode while doing these puzzles, and I find CrossCode to present much more interesting puzzles than Iconoclasts, both in terms of complexity and execution.\n\nStory-wise, I can't really say much since I couldn't bring myself to finish the game. After looking it up, I made it a bit beyond the halfway point, and none of the characters particularly grabbed my attention. I found the setting and the bits of world-building to be pretty interesting, but they are too spread out and center too closely around the religion and limited natural resource of Iconoclasts' world to leave me satisfied. I would also have appreciated the ability to always skip to the next bit of dialog as the game can sometime be slow to move through dialog phases, but that's a relatively minor nitpick.\n\nAll in all, I find this game to be very amateurish. The only aspects Iconoclasts shines for me was its art direction, while the rest felt like an unfocused and underdeveloped pile of ideas borrowed from games whichexecuted on these ideas much better.", "timestamp_created": 1596329908, "timestamp_updated": 1596329908, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73582048": {"recommendationid": "73582048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074084515", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 992, "last_played": 1596238033}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics are absolutely lovely and it has a well made story with a lot of different characters.

The controls in Iconoclast are great, being very responsive, excellent air-control and plenty of jump, climb, or reflexes stages to put them in use, a very important factor for a metroidvania/plataformer. The sound is also top tier with  plenty of adorable and very good music. \nThe game does not shine in the combat, being more a bothersome than anything rewarding, after some time you will just skip enemies since there is no xp mechanic and the game is focused chiefly on story and puzzles. And that has its own problems, I found some puzzles, despite easy-ish, to be infuriating, some timed mechanics are not fun to play, and the rewards are always boring materials to craft stuff that you don't really need or even can use since you are limited to three Tweaks active. Also, for every metroidvania there is a crucial factor, the map and how well can you navigate on it. Despite a very good map and some, not great, fast travel mechanics, I felt that mostly of the areas to be incredible annoying to traverse. That ivory tower made me grind my teeth with the elevators. The game also has places that are scene dependant, meaning, you will reach a place, find nothing and move on, but after a scene that place is now important, something the game does not make it clear, and because of that you will wander the map for much longer than you should, a big flaw for a metroidvania game.\nIt is a good game, not a great one unfortunately.

Seriously, this game needs to be studied for years to come as a prime example of something that ends up being LESS than the sum of its parts, defying all logic and reason. The developers clearly tried too hard and wen't WAY overboard with the overall design. For an analogy: despite having used top quality ingridients to make a cake, they let the cake bake too long so while the cake is still edible due to the good ingrdients, its too overcooked.\n\nIt's mind-bogling really when you look at the individual parts: the game has excellent pixel art, nice gameplay, decent music, interesting characters and intriguing story. But when those elements are glued togheter here in Iconoclasts, the final form is... a very weird kind of bloat.\n\nBut once you start digging at each piece of the project, the problem of \"trying too hard\" and over-design starts to become clear:\n\nART: Excellent craftsmanship of pixel art... but its actually too noisy. The ground and tiles are too exagerated and over detailed. The effects for projectiles are overdone too and it's very common in boss fights to lose track of projectiles and boss attacks because everything from the explosion effects to trailing projectiles blend togheter and you can't see shit.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Nice gimmick with the wrench and Robin controls really nice for the platforming... but the gimmick ends up being just that and the platforming feels unrewarding. Compared to other platformers, there much less action in this game since there's a lot of puzzles to solve, but they very quickly become more of a chore than anything which in turn means that there isn't a good feedback loop to it all: you're just moving from screen to screen, you know, just going trough the motions, because there's no real challenge to platforming, the puzzles are at best a chore and unrewarding, and as for the combat outside of bosses, you can just pretty much run past anything as it's a better use of your time than have to deal with each individual enemy gimmicky-way to kill them.\n\nMUSIC: Decent enough... but sometmes it just doesn't fit: eletric guitars playing when where they don't fit the scene theme, etc.\n\nSTORY: I could write a whole thesis about it, so I'll try to keep it short: There are some very interesting topics, themes and messages underlying the whole plot... but it's delivery is completelly and utterly tone-deaf given the surprisingly dark themes that it tries to tackle, and it is also way unecessarily verbose in its dialogue delivery, and the overall plot is too overbearing and long-winded to it's own detriment, with the cherry on top of being kind of obtuse just for the hell of it.\n\nAlso interesting to note that this came in the same period as the game Celeste... you know, a properlly refined game that while it is also ambitious with its goals, managed to cut down on unecessary bloat in all its elements to keep the overall experience feeling tight and rewarding, eding up being MORE than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou know what, despite my negative review I'm actually going to recommend that you play it till the end, if only to see for yourself the very rare and unique case of a game that embodies that old saying: \"too much of a good thing, ends up being a bad thing\".", "timestamp_created": 1595575468, "timestamp_updated": 1595575468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470320045948028564", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73185697": {"recommendationid": "73185697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396407198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 777, "last_played": 1595636551}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts is VERY reminiscent of Owlboy, if you've ever played that, but a little better.

In general, however, this is a pretty game with some interesting ideas, but it is sometimes a chore to play.\n\nTo start, what I liked:\n\n1) Gorgeous graphics and nice music. You can tell the dev is an artist.\n\n2) Interesting mechanical idea. I like the idea of a mechanic hero who wins encounters by ingenuity rather than brute force.\n\n3) Interesting world concept.\n\nFor the bad, I think a good example is this series of thoughts I had in rapid succession toward the end of my playthrough:\n\n\"Why is there a bullet-sponge boss hidden under an underwater maze? Why didn't it tell me that swimming faster is less oxygen efficient? Why is this the only boss I've died to that doesn't autosave to the beginning of the boss fight? Why is the first stage of this boss only vulnerable to a particular weapon?\"\n\nMost of these are things that I could've discovered with some experimentation, but because of the save mechanic, it was a 10-minute boring slog between attempts and this really characterizes much of how this game felt. So much backtracking, so much downtime between clunky combat encounters. Occasionally, there would be a somewhat clever puzzle, but that was itself a rarity. Occasionally, I'd solve that puzzle, not want to backtrack to a distant save point then get stun-locked on the next screen and die, forcing me to redo a puzzle I had already solved. No matter what choice I made, I'd be traipsing through screens I had already played, wasting time on play that just isn't engaging.\n\nSome things that I think would greatly improve the game (and would be valuable to a follow-up game):\n\n1) Remove the save points. Just auto-save by screen. They don't really add anything but wasted time. Having a much quicker reload pace on whatever challenge I'm currently working on means it's less frustrating to figure out certain rooms by experimentation.\n\n2) More traversal upgrades that feel good to use. The zip-line is nice, but very situational. End-game getting around the map is the same as the beginning of the game, except now I've seen everything a dozen times, and getting to the teleporter can itself be time-consuming.\n\n3) Better collectible/sidequest tracking. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that small gold dots on the map were already-collected pickups. I assumed they were bigger pickups like quest items and blueprints. It's also difficult to tell where are in a side-quest when you've done some bits while on your way to something else.\n\nThe wrench mechanics are a neat idea, but usually they just mean the melee attack is a context-sensitive use button. There are a few bosses that make good use of it (especially the final boss), but they're often so hectic and fill the screen so much it's difficult to concentrate.\n\nThe writing leaves me wanting a bit more. A lot of the characters (as well as the cultures here) feel more like archetypes than fully-realized.

You won't be able to complete those areas anyway and it's pointless to get those materials. You'll be able to get back later. I'll get to the review now.\n\nSo, I must admit my first impressions were bad. While having cool graphics, the gameplay was really simple, and the dialogues were PAINFULLY SLOW, and also having too much of them in a short ammount of time. At some points I read so much faster than the speed at which the new sentences appeared, I decided to skip them. And honestly the story wasn't that interesting yet. Overall it felt almost like a game for little kids (and it isn't the case).\n\nBut everything got better as I kept going. A big part of the game are the small puzzles you have to solve along the way, which get more interesting after the first areas. The boss battles were mostly interesting and fun, being themselves in a lot of cases little puzzles to solve, discovering how you can beat them. \n\nThe story ended up being a major part of why I enjoyed the game so much, with great themes and characters ( and also with a darker tone than I expected), and some good plot twists. By the end I cared a lot about some of these characters, and I'm really happy I kept playing. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1595252354, "timestamp_updated": 1595252354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72961677": {"recommendationid": "72961677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258766093", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1595181348}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't expect much when buying this game, but it's is beyond my expectation.\nThere are about 20+ bosses and they are really fun to fight.\nAlso, the story is surprisingly good.\n\nThe only bad thing is the exploration, you'll be only rewarded with materials to craft some tweaks.

Some of the confusion can also be attributed to visual clutter, it's a pretty game but sometimes it would be hard to tell what exactly is going on with all the vibrant colors.

My first few hours playing was a mess of frustration and keymashing confusion. I thought I would've gotten used to the controls after playing it for awhile but I really didn't, and the game demands a lot of quick and precise movements from you on some puzzles. \nThe default setting puts the jump button right between the attack button and second attack/main action button, so it's a bit awkward to get used to. \n\nThe bosses are all very diverse and most of them are very fun to fight. On some occasions, I found myself mildly disappointed to defeat a boss when I had been enjoying the battle so much. Similarly, the puzzles are very satisfying to get through, but because many of them can get kinda difficult, it can end up being a bit frustrating when something just doesn't click. \n\nThe game is also very dark, which is not something you'd expect from the cute pixel art and music. The story is interesting, though the lore can get kinda hard to understand. The game is not afraid to kill its characters, or put them though torture, death, suicide, grief, etc., and force you to do things you might not want to. The fact that everything looks and feels so cute makes the darker parts of the game even more jarring, but I think that adds to the game's charm.\nIf you're looking for a lighthearted game though, this one isn't for you.

Es un juego con una historia sencilla, pero que me encanta, esta basado en un mundo donde el marfil es un liquido que se usa como fuente de energ\u00eda, pero es limitado y la gente es obligada a vivir sus vidas conforme la \"Sociedad Unica\" dicte. Una religi\u00f3n (o secta) que funciona a la vez como govierno, que usa la ciencia como si fuera magia, si sucumbes al pecado, la \"penitencia\" va literalmente a por ti. La ciencia es limitada y solo la Sociedad \u00danica decide lo que es bendito y lo que no. Aqu\u00ed es donde entra nuestra mecanica, Alondra, que con ayuda de su llave inglesa, ayudara a su familia y nuevos amigos, afrontando varios puzles y jefes en este metroidvania.\n\nEs un gran juego, el cual te pasas en... 12 horas... Bueno, yo me lo e pasado en 12, pero yo ya tenia este juego... Aunque no en steam... no se si me explico jejeje. Pero me gusto tanto que lo compre para apoyar a este gran creador. Busque en el pasado y el desarrollador tiene otro juego parecido, no lo recuerdo bien, pero creo que se le parece.\n\nTengo que decir algo que no me a gustado de este juego y es... El \"bossrush\", que se trata de luchar contra los jefes sin parar. La cosa que mas deseaba que estuviera en este juego, resulta que combates a los jefes con una sola vida, y los \"AJUSTES\" (luego digo que es), son los de resistencia y no puedes cambiarlos. Soy bastante bueno con este juego y me lo voy a volver a pasar por 5 vez. Pero me fastidia una barbaridad que empieces cada jefe, del bossrush con la vida con la que te dejo el anterior, y con los ajustes igual que antes...\n\nEn este juego existe una cosa llamada \"ajustes\" que son como \"habilidades\", se obtienen de \"diagramas\" que te encuentras, y de cofres, los cuales suelen estar MUY ocultos, que tienen un objeto, estos objetos los combinas en una mesa de creacion y obtienes el \"ajuste\" el cual equipas en el mismo sitio donde guardas la partida. Pero tiene una pega MUY GRANDE, resulta que cuando recibes un solo golpe, el ajuste de la derecha del todo se \"rompe\", tienes un total de 3 ranuras de ajuste, y se van rompiendo conforme te golpean. Se pueden reparar al resolver puzzles, destruir objetos del entorno y enemigos, pero NO al guardar la partida... El \"doble salto\" es uno de estos ajustes... a y por cierto, es opcional (ademas de que creo que se hace con un jefe secreto).\n\nUn consejo MUY IMPORTANTE, el arma inicial, la \"aturdidora\" (lo que parece una pistola), tiene un ataque que es mantener pulsado para un ataque fuerte, para \"simular\" un doble salto puedes beneficiarte de esto, pega un salto y apuntando hacia abajo usa el ataque fuerte de la aturdidora, llegaras mas alto y te ayudara a encontrar mas cofres al inicio de la partida, yo lo uso mucho, no solo para los cofres. Parece que los desarrolladores no se dieron cuenta de esto, lo digo por como est\u00e1n puesto los cofres y los puzles, ninguno requiere doblesalto, para avanzar, lo mismo con todas las partes del mapa obligatorias, ninguna requiere doblesalto.\n\nHay una habilidad en el juego que esta \"abandonada\", es decir, no sirve para hacer NADA en el juego; si tu pegas un salto para caer en picado (pulsado el boton de salto + abajo estando en el aire) y lo haces en una rampa, derraparas mientras caes por la rampa, es una tonteria y no sirve para nada... Pero \u00a1EH! hay esta... A por cierto, esta habilidad ya la tienes desde el principio, la de caer en picado tambien.\n\nEspero que os guste el juego tanto como a mi, creo que tengo que a\u00f1adir mas cosas, ya editare el comentario si me acuerdo.", "timestamp_created": 1594391877, "timestamp_updated": 1594391877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72408228": {"recommendationid": "72408228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044287902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 905, "last_played": 1594327482}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you have 12 hours too kill?\nThis is a good game with a compelling story.

I guess I'm just naturally mechanically minded ;)\n\nSecondly, someone said that the wrench has to by very precise to hit the bolts you swing off of and that if it's ever so slightly off it would make you completely miss the bolt. Again, nope. I actually found it pretty forgiving most of the time, unless I'm just naturally super accurate :>\n\nAnd last but not least, I've heard people say that some of the bosses make no sense, and that you have to learn how the boss works, usually by figuring out it's patterns and dying in the process. Excuse me but isn't that how bosses usually work? Like name one main boss in any video game where you instantly knew how it worked and didn't have to learn it's patterns.\n\nPersonally, I've died less to these bosses than in most other games. Usually it took only one or two tries to figure out.

Konjak himself [url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-08-tearing-down-the-lone-developer-myth]said he didn't really like it either[/url].\nThere's a lot of irrelevant details before a certain boat docks at Settlement 17, and the story is confusing if you don't pay attention to the stuff inside and after the boat.\nElro is a poorly written character.\nRobin never wears eye protection when doing mechanic work.\n \nOther than that, I enjoyed the game, but I don't think it's must-play. Different people hate different parts of it. Play it only if you're curious about what it has to offer. I liked illegally opening doors, exploring the world, collecting items that I know I'll never use, and reading optional conversations, such as the one with Petra and Mina. The puzzles rearrange familiar mechanics more than they add new ones, although the ones outside the Tower were a bit easy. The music is good. I spent a lot of my hours pausing the game, leaving the sound on, and doing something else. The story and non-Elro character development get deep and sometimes uncomfortably honest. It's definitely not a \"they all lived happily ever after\". The conflicts seemed to be based on what a real person would worry about if he spent 8 years developing one game.\n \nMy favorite mechanic (yes pun intended) is how Robin carries her wrench and all 3 guns at the same time, and how the Tweaks and other items are mostly useless.

If you disagree with me, please, talk to me, i would like to hear more opinions (as long as you're respectful with me).\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhole Review:\nOk, this will be a pretty difficult one to review, since it has some stuff that, IMHO, it's worth mentioning. You're very welcome to disagree with me. Talk to me, guys. Maybe i didn't see some stuff you did. I would like to hear (well, read) your opinions about it.\n\n1) Pros:\n- Graphics: I don't really care about graphics, but, omg, this game has an astonishingly beautiful pixel art. I mean, The whole game is visually very detailed. The characters, the landscape, everything, so, the graphics are 10/10.\n- OST: The same as the graphics. Each piece of music fits the environment and the moment perfectly. Every single music is most certainly worth having on your phone/PC. I would like to highlight the music of Blrockrock at the morning, Darland Ascent, Boss battles and Isilugar, since they fit their respective places . So, it's 50/10.\n\n- Villains: I have a reason for not putting characters, but anyways... Most of the villains are very memorable with interesting backgrounds, looks and stuff. Black, Chrome, Sna... i mean... Lawrence, the Samurai dude on the tower are all memorable.\n\n- Gameplay: The gameplay is very fluid and responsive, so it fits well to a platformer and/or metroidvania. The only issue i had is with the stairs, since, if i hold the up button while i'm walking and get to a stair, Robin climbs up ok. However, the same won't happen with the down button. Somehow, if i walk to a stair while pressing down, Robin won't get to the stairs. It won't ruin the experience, but it's a little annoying, specially if you've played Megaman. I'm not sure if this is something with my keyboard or a bug, but i thought it was worth mentioning.\n\n- Weapons: They're awesome, nuff said! You have a stun gun that, once charged, becomes a nuclear blaster. You got a bomb that becomes atomic when charged. You got something i can't even describe that, once charged, you can switch places with stuff (you thought i was going to say atomic related stuff again, huh... think again!), which is VERY useful.\n\n- Bosses: They are awesome. No more comments needed... <3\n\n2) Cons: \n\n- Tweaks: Well, since Robin is a mechanic, she can hunt for materials and build those tweaks for making things easier. Unfortunately, those guys are minor improvements such as breath a little longer in water, spin your wrench for more time and stuff. They're pretty useless if you ask me, since you don't need them to proceed. I guess that's ok, but you get discouraged really quickly on hunting for materials, since it's not worth the effort. If you have the breath, spin and shock tweaks, you're definetely good to go (like you weren't without them) and can maximize your performance really quickly!!\n\n- Plot: Since it's a subject i value most, i must say that i didn't like the plot that much. It's pretty confusing and doesn't explain stuff very well. It's like you need to play another game before this one. It also seems that stuff are just thrown in your face with little development. So, when the story starts to make a little more sense, you're not that appealed to pay much attention to it. One of the exceptions is Black's story, since she starts as an villain with a big grudge (for, at starters, no discernible reason) against the main character and ends as a tragic anti-hero. It's a shame we can't play as her (as far as i know!)! Chrome, with his messiah wannabe attitude is really appealing as well. Aside from that, i'm afraid that the plot isn't that interesting. HOWEVER, i liked the idea of the \"Iconoclast\" part, since they're going against an oppressive sect that, despite having its reasons, lost its objective as time passes. If the plot was a little more developed, it would be a great story.\n\n- Main characters: They fall in the same issue as the plot, they're not well developed and, as a result, you don't seem to connect very well to them. The villains are more interesting than the characters. The fact that Robin is silent is a little proof of that. Even though you play with her, it doesn't feel that way.\n\n- Party System: Well, i liked the idea of a party system in a metroidvania. Castlevania III did something like it and it was awesome. However, you can't switch characters (again, as far as i know) at anytime you want, only at specific (and very few) moments. What's the point of having a party system if you barely can use them (i would be ok if you had, at least, 5 times more chances or using them, even if they were to be used in scripted chances). That also affect that bond with the main characters i mentioned above. Man, what a waste of having a \"stealthy\" thief with a darn shotgun and barely use it (and believe me, using Mina is great!).\n\n- Gimmicks and Puzzles: Don't get me wrong. I love gimmicky and puzzling games, with different stuff to do and different way of solving stuff. However, there's a problem: They are too many! In fact, there are so many gimmicky puzzles that breaks the pace of the game, which, imho, doesn't fit metroidvanias and platformers very well. Ok, i know metroidvanias such as SotN had some puzzles, but they didn't break the pace as much as this game. I took 10 hours to finish the game, and i'd say 6-8 hours was with those pacebreakers. I know that's the core mechanic, but, i think they were just too much. Not to mention some puzzles are not as easy to figure, which also breaks the pace the game (or, since i'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, maybe it's my fault). So, in short, this game takes a pretty long time to finish, but not for the right reasons. Speaking of which...\n\n- Gamedesign: That was a tough one to choose, but, due to the previous item, i find it as a con, due to the pacebreaking gimmicks, which, for me, ruined the experience. Since it is a metroidvania, it has its backtracking moments, but, with the pacebreaking, it becomes pretty annoying. Also, the game is pretty confusing, since it starts as a platformer with metroidvania and ends as a puzzle game with little to none battles. It seems that the game is inconsistent on what it wanna be.\n\nI guess that's about it.\nWell, it seems like i hated the game (no, i liked it!), so why i'd recommended? Because, despite its flaws, it serves is purpose very well, it is fun, with silly yet funny jokes, with interesting villains, touching moments, great OST. So it's definetely worth a shot, but it might get tiresome due to these flaws and becomes less appealing as time passes, but it IS a fun game and worth some hours of your time.\n\nHowever, i must praise Joakim Sandberg for such a great work, since it was developed by him alone. You have great talent and i expect more games from you, man. Also i felt he did this game with tender and care. Some stuff wasn't very well executed, but it was a game made with love nonetheless.\nSo, if i were to rate the game, i'd say something between 6/10 to 7/10 (i'm conditioned to rate as 7/10).", "timestamp_created": 1593986553, "timestamp_updated": 1594141826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72069981": {"recommendationid": "72069981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025073875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1227, "last_played": 1567478802}, "language": "english", "review": "No game has been more satisfying to play than Iconoclasts", "timestamp_created": 1593928894, "timestamp_updated": 1593928894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72052369": {"recommendationid": "72052369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003689987", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 757, "last_played": 1593999025}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game with its flaws, has BEAUTIFUL graphics, nice musics, cool characters, but it's a simple metroidvania, there wasnt much impact on upgrading things (the Tweaks).\n\nThe story is a dark one in contrast with the colorful game, wich was a  nice surprised, but to the end it got difficult to understand some things.\n\nThere were some scenarios that was a little difficult to know where a i needed to go, but in general it was a smooth ride.\n\nIt took me +- 10 hours of gameplay on normal to finish it,  and in my opinion it's a worth buy, especially on those STEAM sales.", "timestamp_created": 1593903381, "timestamp_updated": 1593903381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71982427": {"recommendationid": "71982427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353682029", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 4844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3098, "last_played": 1670839611}, "language": "english", "review": "buy this game idiot", "timestamp_created": 1593819002, "timestamp_updated": 1593819002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477272719144821167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71915424": {"recommendationid": "71915424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859876648", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1593247266}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a metroidvania with bad exploration, bad  combat and frustrating puzzles.

Iconoclasts is a rather linear puzzle platformer with a heavy focus on story with a large amount of dialog and cutscenes. Progression is usually gated by story triggers instead of abilities, however you can backtrack to previous areas for some collectibles. It's quite similar to [url=store.steampowered.com/app/115800]Owlboy[/url] in this regard. You play as Robin, a girl mechanic with a wrench (used for melee attacks, parrying, grappling, as a makeshift lever etc) and a few weapons (blaster, bombs, and a third weapon acquired late in the game). Puzzles involve moving blocks around with bombs, electricity charge (from your wrench) and of course turning nuts and bolts in the correct order. The puzzles are generally on the clever side and it's an enjoyable gameplay loop, if a bit repetitive at times. Most enemies and bosses are again puzzle like in their nature and must be either hit with specific attacks or have their weak point exposed first. It's not uncommon to get obliterated by a boss because you've no idea what you're supposed to be doing, and then effortlessly beat it once you finally realize the correct strategy. There are 20+ completely unique bosses, each featuring gorgeous sprite work, and they're definitely one of the highlights.\n\n[h1]Collectibles and Power Ups[/h1]\nThe only collectibles in this game are schematics and crafting materials stashed in chests in each level. They're used to create \"tweaks\" which are equippable perks and act similar to the charms in [url=store.steampowered.com/app/367520]Hollow Knight[/url], you can equip up to three and they have effects like: +movement speed, +wrench attack, +air when diving, tank one hit etc. The only real game changer is the dodge roll (don't spend any ivory oil until you find the schematic for it). Now, this \"tweak\" system is a bit controversial, as it acts like the weapon levels in [url=store.steampowered.com/app/200900]Cave Story[/url], you lose a tweak slot (starting with the right most one) when you get hit and you need to kill a few enemies to restore it. Tanked multiple hits? Whoops, all your special abilities are locked. Thankfully you can usually regenerate tweaks by hitting a boss so the system is not too punishing in the boss fights.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Music[/h1]\nThe graphics and music/sound are very, very impressive for a [b]single man project[/b]. And even if it were a group effort I'd still rate the pixel art as some of the best in the industry. Excellent choice of colors, many frames of animations for every silly little action (including cutscenes), true uncapped framerate (yes, this is one of the few 2D games you can play at 144Hz). Sure, Cave Story (another 2D side-scroller made by just one person) was impressive back in the day, but this is on the whole other level. Joakim Sandberg (Konjak) sure knows his craft. The music ranges from catchy chiptunes to sorrowful piano pieces and it's almost always a good fit. Overall, production values wise Iconoclasts reminds me of the [url=store.steampowered.com/app/999020]Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX[/url] games a lot, but more technically sound and modern.\n\n[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]\nNow the story is where the things get a bit more murky. Konjak sat on the game for way too long and managed to cram in way too many themes and tropes into his story and worldbuilding. You have government conspiracies, religion, environmentalism, rebels, pirates, literally agents from [b]The Matrix[/b], superhumans, aliens, brainwashing and many other things that I don't want to spoil. It's a mess, and the general writing is bloated as well with characters often going off on random tangents or having mental breakdowns every other scene. And despite the fact that the story is so verbose the protagonist is (mostly) silent. There's a backhanded explanation for this but it feels bizarre that Robin just blindly follows whoever happens to yell at her. Still, the twists aren't too bad if a bit convoluted at times. I just wish the script was trimmed down a bit and proofread by a native English speaker.\n\n[h1]Bottom Line[/h1]\nAs far as 2D side-scrollers go, Iconoclasts is a meaty game with a lot of content and will take you about 10-15 hours to beat, depending on how thorough you are with collectibles. As a story heavy puzzle game you will probably not want to play it again, but I still very much recommend experiencing it if you're a fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1593111148, "timestamp_updated": 1593841051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746900081634521484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71300207": {"recommendationid": "71300207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076487468", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1087, "last_played": 1593048201}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1593050725, "timestamp_updated": 1593050725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510763168334960938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71298744": {"recommendationid": "71298744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043911915", "num_games_owned": 1256, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1593044765}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is all about the story and writing, and it does it WELL.

The longer I played, the more frustrated I got with everything, and the more I didn't want to play anymore. It's less about the game as a whole and more about how each minor annoyance adds up and overshadows the rest. Throughout the entire game, things just felt... off. Not a lot, but enough to be noticeable.\n\nThis is not a metroidvania game. Exploring is absolutely unrewarding. All you'll find is blueprints and materials to craft Tweaks, a system similar to Hollow Knight's charms, but utterly underwhelming and cease to function if you take a hit. If you're hoping for some nifty new abilities or power-ups, prepare to be disappointed. There are lots of hidden places, but none of them are worth exploring.\n\nMovement is fluid and responsive but platforming is just serviceable. There are no issues with ledge grab detection but the precision required to lock onto some track bolts becomes really, really irritating when it throws off a timed puzzle several times in a row or forces you to recharge the energy lost flailing futilely in mid-air. Oh, and an entire boss fight is built around this mechanic, too.\n\nSpeaking of, the bosses are all visually and mechanically distinct, often with multiple phases and changing attack patterns. Some are pretty neat, and others are just awful. The one that stands out the most involves stealth, does not explain what it expects mechanically, and what I thought should work, didn't. Ultimately, there's only one solution for each and once you get the pattern down, it's a cakewalk. They don't all play great, but at least they look great.\n\nI do like the art and animation. The level art style is also good, but I didn't care for the level design at all. Progress is constantly impeded by environmental puzzles and one-way shortcuts that force you to retread the same paths over and over again. I will say they are clever and creative, but more often than not I found them tedious to complete, especially when combat is mixed in, and combat quickly grows as boring and tedious as the rest of the game.\n\nI almost made it to the end, but I just couldn't stand it any longer. The story is bad, there wasn't a single character that I liked, dialogue is cringe-worthy, the varying mechanics feel bolted on for the sake of being unique instead of interesting and engaging, and the game either over-explains or doesn't explain at all what it expects from you.

The story and characters are the main reason to play, in my opinion, as you will get a lot of interesting people with complicated motives inhabiting a richly built world. The story takes a little while to get started, but when it did I was hooked. This is one of those stories where nothing is handed to you, in fact the central plot isn't even known to any of the main characters, you just have to piece it together on your own.\n\nPuzzles are mostly good. Lot of obvious puzzles, but enough good ones and nothing I would consider hard or too obtuse. I will say that near the end there is a certain puzzle room that is really annoying, as it requires you to blindly rush to your death and memorize the enemy patterns, but dying requires you to restart a few rooms back. This was a very annoying experience.\n\nRegular combat is OK, you have a few attacks and most enemies are weak to something, you just have to figure out which attacks to use on which foes. There are a few rooms though that are infuriating, say an enemy that has two attacks, you have to duck one and parry the other to damage them, but there are two of them and they alternate different attacks. It's impossible to beat them, you either have to reset the room or just run past them. In fact, most combat in the game you are better off just bypassing.\n\nBoss fights are a mixed bag. You just have to learn their patterns and the only way to do that is to die to them over and over again. Once you do figure out their patterns most are pretty easy. Most of the bosses are at least interesting, if not good. A few too many are of the \"you can only stand in a little space in the far end of the room\" variety. Overall I liked more than not, and only hated a few.\n\nA big warning, the game suffers from Meat Circus Syndrome; the final act of the game is way, way harder than the earlier sections. Expect to breeze through most of the game and then spend the last act dying a lot. Another warning, people are calling this a metroidvania but it is not. You will need to check your map and navigate with new weapons, but the game is almost purely linear, you will rarely need to explore, and rarely more than just a few rooms.\n\nOverall, it's a neat little adventure game with a complicated, rich story.

The first half of the game, very light-hearted, Shantae-esque/Cave Story mechanics, humor, artstyle etc. The second half of the game then suddenly nose-dives into lore, mature themes and characters forcing themselves into 'plot elements', and starts to try to mold itself into a Devolver Digital game like Katana Zero instead. \n\nThe first half of the game feels like a breeze, the second half feels like the game's suddenly a rush. Major characters have really interesting tidbits about themselves, but are never fully explored in detail, and are even sometimes conflicting and incompetent. The only exception to this is the character \"Mina\", who is the only really compelling character in the game. But otherwise, when I finished the game, I just had more questions than answers for what was going on, and yet I still felt like I could predict what was going to happen, and I actually ended up not really caring for most characters in the game, regardless of their importance towards the plot/the main character, Robin.\n\nThe first half of the game has a nice pace with a rising difficulty spike, the second half of the game throws a complete screw into the formula and has very anomalously hard bosses with somewhat cryptic patterns with no room for error. With other bosses allowing for \"haha gun go brr brr\" levels of brain-dead. The game has a mechanic similar to Cave-Story in which the character is somewhat upgraded based on not getting hit and for killing enemies, but this ends up being very high risk-low reward and I start to avoid late-game enemies (which tended to be the same three reused over and over due to the plot). \n\nAll of these nitpicks are further accentuated by the very contradictory art style. I was very surprised to see such a bold, gritty and realistic title-screen, only to be greeted with very soft, cartoony, Shantae-esque sprites in game (which is personally the style I preferred).\n\nI liked this game overall and I could see the work put into it, but these poorly executed concepts and ideas may throw some people off. Even though I feel like I'm thorough in terms of Metroidvanias, I only ended the game with 49% completion. Most \"items\", or should I say \"components\", don't feel too significantly major to collect. \n\nIf you want to play the game, I'd recommend it, but in my opinion, this is not a Metroidvania which I'll revisit after my first playthrough.\n\nThumb-neutral-positive game.", "timestamp_created": 1590815008, "timestamp_updated": 1591321547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652595341205596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69977879": {"recommendationid": "69977879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070497253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 802, "last_played": 1590732592}, "language": "english", "review": "Visuals: A+\nSoundtrack: B+\nGameplay: A\nStory: B\n\nOverall: B+, definitely would recommend :^)", "timestamp_created": 1590732727, "timestamp_updated": 1590732727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69800441": {"recommendationid": "69800441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047309432", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2094, "last_played": 1590438162}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice little playthrough, but the gameplay kind of stalls about halfway through the game. \n\nChallenge mode is a bit of pain in the ass but for casual players it's not too bad.", "timestamp_created": 1590438308, "timestamp_updated": 1590438308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69783788": {"recommendationid": "69783788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035182410", "num_games_owned": 1117, "num_reviews": 368, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 708, "last_played": 1590511377}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great metroidvania.

While the game doesn't do everything perfectly, it more than makes up for it with a high level of polish, and an abundance of charm. Sprites are well animated and have a ton of personality and detail. Each locale is vibrant and unique, dripping with color and providing unique challenges and puzzles. Music and sound are a great fit for the game, with music conveying the right ambiance for each scene, ranging from upbeat and chipper, to eerie and depressing.\n\nCombat is fairly simple, albeit a bit clunky.. Mechanics like melee and parry are introduced early but seem underutilized in many circumstances. Enemies in the latter half of the game can be tedious and annoying as you need to switch weapons and avoid obstacles to fight them. Tweak system, (which gives you various bonuses) is also underutilized as many of the more useful tweaks are only unlocked after you've beaten most of the game. Majority of tweaks don't feel game changing or all that helpful, especially since you lose your tweaks if you get hit. Aiming can also be a bit frustrating in more demanding fights but, this usually isn't an issue. Combat is satisfying with just enough depth to keep you invested. Most enemies have unique mechanics which require you to approach tackling them differently and create unique situations. Bosses are all also very unique and introduce their own new mechanics into the fight,\n\nThe story is great and probably the best part of the game, covering alot of different and mature themes by the end. Despite being a platformer the game does a great job of conveying the weight of your actions and helping you to empathize with both heros and villains of the game. The story takes a bit of time to get going, as the mystery of what exactly ivory is takes time to unfold but by the end, it would be hard to not be invested in the cast.\n\nIt's not hard to recommend this game but if you're looking for a challenge then this game might not be for you. The game isn't overly easy but, provides moderate difficulty throughout with a few sections peppered in that are a bit challenging. Certain areas are a bit esoteric and the game doesn't always do a good job of letting you know where to go next, but the world is manageable enough.

I enjoyed it from start to finish.  That said, the game is a little on the shorter side.\n\nNow, I will admit I used a guide here and there.  I do that for games like these because I have to play them to 100% and usually some things can end up missable, but I was happy to find out some of the things I discovered in said guide would have made me frustrated if I didn't read it.\n\nIgnoring those things entirely to avoid spoilers still makes it a very enjoyable game.  I spent about 11 hours on my fully completed save.  I also bought it on sale for about half off or so.  So, I'd say it was money well spent on it.  Is it worth the full $20, though?\n\nHere are my thoughts on the rest of the game:\n\nThe gameplay is very reminiscent of the genre it comes from.  There's no real RPG elements like level gaining or stat-boosting, but you do gain powerups that open new locations for you.  There are extra items you can \"craft\" that can enhance certain things about you, but can be optional for the most part.  In fact, except for optional stuff, I probably could've gone through the entire game without them, but they were pretty handy.\n\nGraphically it looked like 2D 16- and 32-bit era.  Very colorful and every area has it's own vibrant palette that makes it stand out.

If the ending changes my mind I will update this.\n\nTL;DR version, love the game, hate most of the characters. Still recommend despite that.\n\nThis is a great game, but boy, did I not like most of the characters. Like there are probably 5 \"major\" characters that are not a$$holes, naive pompus fools, and/or religious zealots that acting like they are doing things for the common good but are either actually doing it for their own gain or are making things worse. Of those 5 characters, one is the main character, one is a character that is just doing their job, but they are surrounded by idiots and assholes while also living in constant pain, one is a toady of one of the bad guys, one is a bad guy that was doing his job but saves the main character at one point, and the last is a sidequest character where you have to hunt them down in hidden parts of the maps. And this is coming from someone that likes to look and focus on the good aspects on things.\n\nThere was one character that you [spoiler]actually have to leave for dead due to a situation where you cannot escape  without leaving him. When I realized this, I did it without hesitation. I just dumped him on the ground like a wet sack and ran off. And this was a character that for most of the choice I genuinely picked the supportive and positive responses for. There is some sympathy within me for said character and his situation as he tried to do things he thought was right only to actually cause doom for the entire planet and get abandoned and mistreated by his fellows, but that sympathy weighs a lot less than the outright naivite, selfishness, and careless stuff the character does and believes.[/spoiler]\n\nThen there is the [spoiler]main character's brother. Granted he the rest of his family due to the a$$holes he works for which makes him overprotective of his one living relative. But he takes that feeling waaaaaaay too far. Even more enfuriating where you have to control him in a \"split the party\" situation. Thing is, due to circumstances he is a melee only character, moves SUPER SLOW, and faces a boss where you have to walk up to them while dodging and parrying their attack, hit them once, then the boss knocks him back to the other side of the screen. Repeat this 10 times until the boss dies. And then when you see him again later he refuses to push the button he needs to push as part of a 2 person sequence BECAUSE HE REFUSES TO PUT HIS SISTER IN DANGER. I might add that this is a task he wound up volunteering for despite him saying he did not want to do it, but wound up volunteering anyway because he didn't want his friend, who volunteered to do it, to do it. The combination of those various factors really made me hate the guy's guts right there.[/spoiler]\n\nOne character I am ambivalent on is the 4th \"party member\" (I say party member in quotes because they are only occasionally controllable and/or do things as either an npc or tag partner during bosses, but most of the time they are only with you in cutscenes and their presence indicated via a character portrait in upper right. She is overall decent and funny but she has her moments [spoiler]like her back and forth love and hate of her mom, and how she is kinda a \"religious\" person as well, but of a different \"religion\" as the main religion shown in the game. I put religion in quotes because hers is more Eastern like where the thing they revere are their ancestors, their passed down knowledge, and the ships their people used to arrive on the planet. She also does not like the main religion of the game and their practices (more on that later). Especialy cursing their irrelevence and mistreating of things of her beliefs. She is one that is quick to anger and also to deride others, but there is also some genuine care for others and some remorse for some of her actions later. That alone is enough to make her not a TOTAL a$$hole in my mind, but still not enough to erase the blemish on their record[/spoiler]\n\nThen there is most of the other characters in the game, most of which are either practioners of or key players in the combination Corporation and Main Religion of the game. Most of which make it on the $hitlist because of their zealotry and the fact that [spoiler]their actions are killing the planet, and the religion is one of those that instills fear of death into their flock as heretics and sinners are killed via \"penance\" which is pretty much the explosion of their house and everyone in it. There is also the fact that they hide things, mess around with and control a substance that everyone needs to power stuff but also doesn't want to change to some other alternative to power things because \"it isn't as powerful or not enough to power everything\". So it is kinda the worst of both worlds with little to no visible actual benefits to following it.[/spoiler] They also seem to view that the unliscenced practicing of repairing or tinkering with stuff as heresy and a sin. *shrug*\n\nThat all said, I highly enjoyed the game and the story overall which is why I still recommend the game. It just that towards the end the end most of the main characters just went from likeable/slightly enjoyable to \"I dislike this person now.\" If I had to rate it overall, I would say 7/10.

One of the biggest pet peeves I have with this game is the extreme rigidity in aim directions. The story is passable but only just. The storyline feels as if the characters should get some form of development during the middle of the arcs but (spoilers alert,) they remain one dimensional at best. Iconoclast has a plot but it feels cheap to involve so many \"deaths\" and injuries in an otherwise upbeat game. Other parts of the story feels as if there are different paths to take, but when replayed it reveals that there are actually no real choices that matter. \n\nAnother major issue that pissed me the hell off was that there is a complete lack of potential sequence breaking so prevalent in metroidvania games. Within the first 2 minutes of gameplay there's a \"secret\" entrance that is completely inaccessible until the boss is fought no matter what. After defeating the area boss, the location allows you to simply walk across the secret threshold, but till then its completely solid.\n\nAs far as I have explored, there are only three guns. Crafting items are utterly useless unless you happen to find the Ivory Oil and even then the tweak crafting recipes suggest that you should be finding an abundance of it. I found the boss fights to be infuriating in the way that you might have to struggle to find the sequence of guns/moves to begin damaging it. It could be that i took the time to figure each boss out on its own, but aside from pixel perfecting every boss move, some of the boss fights on higher difficulty settings would basically force you to play as robotically as possible (aha.)\n\nI like the artwork. It feels like a lot of interest and effort was made into animating the enemies and characters but I feel that the artwork does not fit the overall doom and gloom of the plot. But the hell do I know about storywriting and art design. The music is good, but severely lacks of variety and begins to grind at my nerves when I have to backtrack a lot. This effectively forced me to play without music for a good portion of the game. Upgrades are more of a \"dammit finally....\" feeling rather than a \"holy shit yes\". \n\nOverall: 6/10. Buy this game if you absolutely love the art and love the more puzzle aspects of metroidvania, otherwise I strongly suggest another game.", "timestamp_created": 1589592853, "timestamp_updated": 1589592853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458820998668670654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69174381": {"recommendationid": "69174381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248798938", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2000, "last_played": 1672737892}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts is a platforming shooter in the same vein as Cave Story, with a bit of metroidvania thrown into the mix.

I expect that I could complete a second playthrough in an afternoon. One thing that streamlines this is the inclusion of New Game+, which allows you to retain your upgrades and frees you from the need to tediously hunt down every little secret all over again.\n\nOverall, Iconoclasts is a superb game, with a story that I won't soon forget.

Super cute player character. Catchy music that doesn't get old, reminiscent of Towerfall Ascension's soundtrack. Straightforward gameplay, easy to learn but hard to master, satisfying and responsive. Lots of unique enemies. \n\nThe story is both well-written, detailed, deep and quite dark. Reminiscient of Final Fantasy 7 (The original - i haven't played the remake)\n\nI can't get over all the little details in the animations - these pixels are more expressive than most people! Absolutely gorgeous visuals that always surprise with their incredible amount of detail.\n\nDETAILED REVIEW:\n\n\nWhere do i even start? The art is FANTASTIC. Despite being pixel art, it's so detailed (and so extremely well and fluidly animated) that you can make out anything from how your character (which is absolutely adorable, by the way!) jumps in different manners based on how fast you are moving, to how her cheeks puff out when you're holding your breath! Adorable, adorable pixels... And sometimes oddly sexy, which is confused me at first due to the overall look of the world. It seemed out of place, but only at first glance, before i learnt more of the story.\n\nDon't let the appearances decieve you. There is a LOT more depth to this than i thought at first glance - i'd never imagine the story, and it's characters, would be so interesting. There is a lot of depth to all of the main characters that appear. I am barely four hours in (without a break, unusual but this game just keeps me going) and there has already been several twists and turns i'd never imagine. \n\nThere is a lot of originality here. It's very refreshing.\n\nBesides the breathtaking graphics, the music is also outstanding. You never really get tired of the ambience or the atmospheric music constantly playing in the background - all the sounds work extremely well to draw you into the experience. Also, did i mention your adorable player character also has adorable music notes for footsteps? And Kirby-esque sound effects for jumps!\n\nIf you like true metroidvanias, you are going to LOVE this. Unlike others of its kind, there is hardly any backtracking - you'll only ever really have to backtrack if you get lost, and there's always a map available for you to use should you need it.\n\nCharacter interactions play out really well, with great writing (and translation) as well as extremely lifelike expressions and gestures. I've never experienced anything like it before from pixel art.", "timestamp_created": 1589276823, "timestamp_updated": 1590246381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482758641242980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68995470": {"recommendationid": "68995470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981256877", "num_games_owned": 852, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1589327536}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say that Iconoclasts is an excellent game.

There's nothing wrong with explaining to someone what Iconoclasts is in one word but I feel there's more to be said there. While Iconoclasts does have some metroidvania elements inside its brightly colored environments and peppy soundtrack, its heart and soul lies within its characters. Iconoclasts characters are well-developed and like-able. They trigger a sense of emotion within you as you progress throughout the story. I know that it's hard to sell Iconoclasts based on the characters themselves when the content of the game goes for ten to twenty hours. Besides the characters, Iconoclasts does shine in the gameplay department. Its over twenty bosses is its main selling point and it's saying something. Nearly every boss is fun to defeat, once you figure out its weakness. You can receive upgrades throughout the game to your trusty stun-gun and to your staple weapon, the wrench. Speaking of wrenches, being a mechanic is not just some job placed on the character you play as, Robin, but the story and gameplay explain why mechanics exist and certain puzzles make you feel you are mechanic. May I point out that this game was developed by only one person? Joakim Sandberg developed the art, the music, the story, the characters in the game, which I'll say is not a small endeavor. I would question the price tag on the game, however. $20 seems a little steep, but that could be the cheapskate in me talking. I would wait until the game goes on sale to purchase. Although, I am not disappointed by the $20 I spent. \n\nTL;DR\nIconoclasts is more than just a metroidvania.

The time time and dedication shows with each world.  Boss fights are incredibly inventive and Robin, the mute protagonist, is as endearing as they get.  I DO recommend most folks give this a go, as it might engross them long enough to reach the end.  I was not one of those individuals.  \n\nWith a rather convoluted plot, an uninspired crafting system that leads to mundane powerups, and some of the worst backtracking I've had to deal with since Axiom Verge, my interest dwindled towards the back half.  There's a chance I might pick this up in the future, but I had to cut my adventure short on this one.  I know there will be a lot that will still enjoy the adventurous side of roaming the game's world.  I just don't have that kind of time anymore.  \n\nWith some the best pixel animation you'll see in games of this genre, and some incredibly designed boss fights, this is still worth anyone's time.  If you can accept the game's shortcomings in plot progression and a sub-par crafting element, Iconoclasts may well be worth your time.\n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1587680928, "timestamp_updated": 1587680928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523121416568756104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67840130": {"recommendationid": "67840130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160251611", "num_games_owned": 1249, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1591808414}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

But greater things are afoot, and the world itself seems to be shaking beneath your feet\u2026\n\nThis game\u2019s story is odd. The premise of the story seems strange, but the game quickly pulls you into the strange world. The One Concern is a military-religious-scientific organization that basically serves as the world government. Led by Mother and her agents, people with seemingly magical powers and supernatural resilience, these people praise Him. This seems like a fairly standard \u201cevil church organization\u201d plot, but in truth, it\u2019s anything but; the One Concern is much more than some sort of bizarre cult, and many of its most important members clearly don\u2019t believe in the benevolence of their god, and have other tasks on their mind.\n\nThe characters are armed with guns and explosives of various sorts, and there\u2019s a great deal of advanced technology all over the place. And yet, simultaneously, many of the people seem to live very simple lives. This dichotomy becomes increasingly apparent the further you get into the game, and it becomes increasingly clear that things are complicated. While at first it seems like a fairly simple \u201cOne Concern bad, hippy commune folk good\u201d sort of plot, the further you get into the game, the more you come to understand what drives the One Concern, and also how much further they see than their sort of happyish opposition.\n\nThe game has a certain sense of humor to it that reminds me of the sillier bits of Final Fantasy 6, and yet it also has a lot of very serious bits to it. This creates quite the dichotomy; the game early on seems fairly lighthearted, but it starts getting darker and darker, and many, many people start dying or being very gruesomely injured. The further you get, the bleaker the story becomes, as everything goes wrong, more and more people start dying, the hope for humanity seems to become increasingly distant, and the end of the world seems nigh.\n\nAnd then, after all that buildup, the game\u2019s final area is fairly anticlimactic, and the final boss appears with a visual gag introducing them. What exactly was going on is not explained, and the player is left wondering what the point of it all was, as a major subversion of the player\u2019s expectations is thrown out at the last minute, raising even more questions about why the One Concern was worshipping Him in the first place, at which point the game ends.\n\nThus, it\u2019s hard to say whether or not the story actually delivered; it definitely has some high moments, and I felt bad for several characters, including a few of the villains. Ironically, two of the least sympathetic characters you end up seeing are two of your teammates, who treat other people like garbage and aren\u2019t a lot of fun to be around. All of this is good, and I wanted to see the characters succeed.\n\nBut at the end, it feels like the story deflates, and ends rather abruptly and unceremoniously after some quite solid buildup.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is fine. The overall motion of Robin is quite fluid, and she\u2019s fun to control on the whole. You run, you jump, you swing around on your wrench, you have three different guns (each with their own charge shot), and you can \u201ctweak\u201d yourself to get different bonuses. The game has over two dozen bosses, and they\u2019re quite varied overall \u2013 there are a lot of different types of boss fights, from the straightforward to the puzzle boss to the sort of boss where your goal is to survive while doing some other task, and the variety in terms of bosses is very good.\n\nUnfortunately, while the bosses were pretty good, the levels were more of a mixed bag. There were definitely some good areas in the game, but other areas felt kind of tedious to go through; they weren\u2019t difficult, they just required you to go back and forth a bunch of times, and that wasn\u2019t particularly fun to do. The tower sequence in the middle of the game is particularly egregious in this regard. The biggest problem, however, was simply the fact that the enemies didn\u2019t really feel all that interesting to fight most of the time; they were interesting at first, and figuring out some of them was fun, but in the middle part of the game, it felt like the game stopped really introducing interesting new enemies for a while, only to start doing so again at the end.\n\nOverall, Iconoclasts is a decent game. There were a few bits that were quite good, but there were other bits that were disappointing \u2013 including the very end of the 14 hour long game, which left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nIf you like Metroidvania games, this is a fine game, but there are better ones, like Hollow Knight, and more visually striking ones, like the Ori games. I don\u2019t regret playing this game, but there are other games in the same genre that are of higher quality that are worth playing over this one. Still, you could do worse than Iconoclasts. \n", "timestamp_created": 1587549484, "timestamp_updated": 1587549484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623695254325866699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67779755": {"recommendationid": "67779755", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999077265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 951, "last_played": 1581123866}, "language": "english", "review": "Very charming and lovingly crafted game.

The sprite art is gorgeous, as are the animations. Colors are bright and vibrant.\nOn the other, it feels and plays like a standard metroidvania game.\n\nAs far as character design, there's room to improve. I didn't have any sort of investment in Robin, since its hard to parse a personality out of a mute protag. Other characters fare little better, with their experiences acting more as punctuation to a level more than being integrated within it. The vast majority of my gametime was spent solving puzzles and navigating levels, not getting to understand these characters and what their struggle is about.\n\nAs far as themes go, this game plays with the idea of faith and faith within society. Which is... neat? But it doesn't marry with any other parts of the game outside of dialogue and imagery. Is there a message I'm missing? Because, all of the characters within the game treat theocracy and planned society like it's second nature. The main exception being Robin, because we're left to fill in the blanks for her.\n\nI think this game is good, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to muster enough nerve to make it through the tower area; which is so annoyingly designed that I more or less succumbed to tedium of trying to actually navigate it. Doesn't help that by that point in the game I was beginning to grate on Robin's limited moveset and obstacles placed specifically to exploit that limited moveset.\n\nIt's interesting if nothing else, but is it a game I'd recommend?

Se trata de una suerte de \"Metroidvania\" que no se limita a reinventar o alterar la f\u00f3rmula que ya sentaron Super Metroid y Symphony of the Night, en su lugar, sorprende con una jugabilidad nueva y \u00fanica. Y sobre todo, fresca.\n\nLa exploraci\u00f3n y las interacciones con el entorno son mucho m\u00e1s importantes que el combate, y los jefes parecen m\u00e1s bien enormes puzzles que superar. Todo ello se acompa\u00f1a de un apartado art\u00edstico y gr\u00e1fico precioso. \n\nPero lo que de verdad importa de este juego es su historia. Porque el juego est\u00e1 enteramente dise\u00f1ado para contar una historia, con unos personajes interesantes y carism\u00e1ticos, con los que empatizamos r\u00e1pidamente y que vemos como progresan a lo largo de una trama de ciencia ficci\u00f3n y existencialismo profunda e intrincada.\n\nHay que tener en cuenta con \"Iconoclasts\" que el aparentemente infantil y desenfadado apartado visual esconde una argumento complicado, violento y triste, con momentos muy perturbadores. Aunque no le faltan momentos c\u00f3micos o desenfadados\n\nLa trama es oscura, esot\u00e9rica y por momentos dif\u00edcil de entender, aqu\u00ed la pretensi\u00f3n narrativa juega en contra de la comprensi\u00f3n de la historia, y no obstante, pese a ello, vale la pena experimentarla.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1587123330, "timestamp_updated": 1587123330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67401584": {"recommendationid": "67401584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064818787", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 873, "last_played": 1601936533}, "language": "english", "review": "Oozing with character, Iconoclasts is one of those games I can't stop thinking about weeks after finishing it.

Even the combat is very puzzle-like, because you often have to use a combination of weapons and and the environment in order to defeat the many bosses and enemies.\n\nIconoclasts looks like the prettiest SNES game that never got made and its story is surprisingly dark and violent despite the cheery colorful look.

This along with the visuals make the game seem a lot more finished than i really is.\n-THE VILLAINS: the agents were really cool, they have some decent deph and are really entartaining. \n-The worldbuilding: Its a pretty interesting world, and i like the contrast of the happy visuals with the downright disturbing things taking place.\n-The boss fights(half of them): This is an example of the limitations of this being developed by one person. This game has some really fun boss fights, but those are really in the first half of the story. Later boss fight get really clunky an boring design wise. And there are some that are just bad... like a stealth boss fight for some reason.\nCons:\n-The heroes: I hated every single character that wasn't a villain. Everybody acts like an teenage girl in a 80s movie: dumb, anoying and overly emotional. And most of these character dont feel like they belong in this epic tale about the future of the planet and the religion implications of it. Its as if the cast from Glee were dropped in the middle of mass effect 3.\n-The Story: the world may be cool, but the storytelling is a bit on the boring side. The story keeps taking this weird turns that feel really out of place. And right at the end when you feel like things might add up to something cohesive, it takes another even weirder turn, AND THEN ANOTHER, and then it ends... Its just a mess.\n-The combat- its pretty whatever for most of it, but there are some weird design decisions that make it a bit annoying, like the gun cooldown times that i dont know why were included at all. And the equipable upgrades that break when you take damage, making them completely useless.\n-The puzzles- most of them are just not that fun, the tower level for example, was one of the most confusing levels I have ever played. And it doesn't help that the bomb bounces all over the place when fired, making things quite clunky.\n-The secrets and backtracking: since all you get are materiels for the upgrades(witch are useless), there is no reason to explore.", "timestamp_created": 1586462664, "timestamp_updated": 1586463023, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618515968322753906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66963792": {"recommendationid": "66963792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087293144", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1587268706}, "language": "english", "review": "REVIEW IN PROGRESS:\n\nKonjak has made his name well known among the Multimedia Fusion indie game developer crowd for some time -- particularly for his Metroidvania-style games (look at Noitu Love) and his frankly gorgeous pixel artwork.  \n\nI remember when he first released the Iconoclast demo years ago and had released a statement following its warm reception that the project had been cancelled.  I was pleasantly surprised when the game did eventually release - and not only on PC/Steam, but on consoles! \n\nICONOCLASTS follows a similar gameplay style as his other games: in a Metroidvania-vein style presentation, you play as ROBIN, a young mechanic who finds herself in a world where operating machines is illegal without sanction from the holy Mother.  On the run after she is caught servicing her brother's broken-down home, you end up on a globe-trotting adventurer with several other party members - often on opposing ideologies and sides - as you unearth the mysteries of the mysterious One Concern organisation.    \n\nGameplay is tight and features Robin's signature wrench and her stun gun, both of which get upgrades throughout the game in the form of new features that unlock traversal options.  You also pick up materials as you go along that go into various equippable power-ups that allow Robin to have more health, swing her wrench harder, or dive roll - but taking hits from enemies temporarily disables them, slot by slot, until you regain them through exploring the world or defeating foes.  It's a neat little system of offering you a small way to customize how Robin plays without drastically becoming reliant on them.  \n\nOne critique that I have seen on the discussion boards which I agree with is the fact that the game offers quite a few different combat options, but often makes enemies frustratingly weak against just one.   Having to figure out which specific attack is useful against the enemy that you're fighting can feel like grunt work and removes the flow of adventure that the game does have and which halts the exhiliration you get from running into room after room. \n\nSimilarly, the pacing of the game can sometimes feel [i]too[/i] breakneck.  You often end up feeling like there isn't a pause in the game; while there are some towns and villages that you get to spend some time in, other than speaking with the locals, there often isn't much to do and the game is content throwing you into the next dungeon as it is.  \n\nThe writing also suffers a little - the dialogue is a bit stilted and sometimes reads a bit awkward.  The plot is engaging but the use of various terms, with the inconsistent highlighting, also hampers some of its coherency.  Overall, however, Konjak tackles some challenging and relevant themes that are handled quite well.  The party that you travel with unfortunately isn't the most engaging crew -- some of them are quite unlikeable, to be honest -- but I do feel that most people who pick this up are in it for the gameplay, not the story. \n\nHeartily recommend.

Cuando quieres volver a recoger los objetos que has ido dejando atr\u00e1s ya est\u00e1s en una parte del mapa sin comunicaci\u00f3n ni transporte con las zonas en las que dejaste cosas por recoger, lo cual te obliga a pegarte un buen paseo hasta la primera zona que tiene comunicaci\u00f3n con el resto.\n\nPor si fuera poco, el paseo apetece a\u00fan menos si cabe cuando te das cuenta de que los objetos que recoges son completamente innecesarios para completar el juego.

Pues bien, pr\u00e1cticamente todas las mejoras que puedes construir tienen una utilidad nula o limitada. Despu\u00e9s de probar varias y de no saber si la que has elegido funciona o no, acabas tomando la decisi\u00f3n de que lo mejor es equipar tres veces la mejora que limita el da\u00f1o que recibes.

After watching some videos afterwards, some of the things that confused me make more sense.\n\nThe story follows the main character, Robin, who is a mechanic. In a world governed over religion, each person in the world is supposed to follow the job that they are \"bestowed\". Failure to do so gets your house and/or family destroyed through a \"ritual\" called Penance. Robin doesn't follow this religion and wants to go her own path. What follows is a tale about going against said religion, and the crazy evil truth behind it all.\n\nNOW, the only reason I can tell you all this is because the videos I watched helped clear up my confusion. Throughout the game I felt I could understand the story somewhat, but a lot of it was a lil difficult to follow. This may not be the case for everyone, but it was for me.\n\nThe gameplay is super solid, it's a 2D action platformer that's almost like a Metroidvania. You'll unlock new guns and upgrades to your wrench to traverse the world. You can also find hidden materials to equip tweaks like being able to run faster, or increased melee damage.\n\nMy personal favorite thing about the gameplay is the party system. You'll occasionally find other playable party members who have their own different playstyles, and it's especially fun when they help you in boss battles.\n\nThe boss battles, OMG! I believe the boss battles were my favorite thing about this game. Each one was memorable and had the perfect amount of challenge. This also goes to the art style of the game which reminded me of the animations in Metal Slug, cept now I get to play with taller models and in an RPG-like setting.\n\nThe music was very good, I hummed along to some of the tunes while going through dungeons. I believe this game's strongest suit is definitely the characters. Both the good guys and bad guys were very well written and I found myself eager to learn more about them and their motivations.\n\nI have a few gripes however. The story, though really good, was also really confusing on my first go round. I eventually was able to understand after I did some research after the game, but part of me wished I could understand it better while playing. The two times I got stuck in the game were kinda meh as well, Once I got stuck because I didn't hit a box with a certain weapon in the right square so I ended up thinking that I was doing the puzzle wrong, but I was actually doing it right. And then there was a boss battle where it wasn't clear at first what I was supposed to do so I had to research it and figure it out. Basically what I'm saying is, sometimes the game was quite unclear on how to do things, but it did not stop my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nFinal thoughts? I liked it it. The boss battles were my absolute favorite parts of the game. It reminded me of how good the boss battles in Crosscode was. I can honestly recommend this game if you want a good 2D Action Platformer. Took me close to 10 hours to beat so it's a good moderate length. Thanks for reading!\n\nTL:DR: A good and colorful 2D action platformer.

The pixel art looks phenomenal, easily one of the best I've seen yet. The amount of detail on characters and environments is astonishing. For a tile based pixel art game, I think this might be as good as it gets.\nThe music is pretty good and well composed, with a few memorable tracks.\nControls are very fluid and the game is overall really stable.\nCharacters have great, recognizable design.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about it, and I wish I had more to praise here.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a \"metroidvania\" but with the inclusion of puzzle rooms. However, in terms of mechanics and content, I've found it to be an exceptionally weak metroidvania and not very entertaining to play.\n\nCombat is par for the course but your character sort of auto aims her basic gun which takes away some of the challenge (despite being able to shoot up and down, already a big boon in this kind of game). You can charge your guns for a more powerful shot, but this causes an overly long cooldown before being able to start charging again or even shoot uncharged shots, a baffling design decision after decades of Mega Man and Metroid being out.\nBosses are often cool looking but they tend to rely on trial and error with simple patterns that, once memorized, provide little challenge. I'd certainly consider them a highlight of the game nonetheless, and I enjoyed fighting against a few of them.\n\nThe puzzle rooms wore out their welcome really early on for me. While maybe novel at first, it didn't take long for them to become showstoppers, breaking the flow of the game and, consequently, my engagement. They are numerous and in basically all of them you're required to do tasks such as using your bomb weapon to time an explosion or move a crate onto a button in order to open doors and activate platforms.\nNone of the puzzles felt particularly clever enough to warrant their inclusion; I found myself figuring out solutions quickly simply because there aren't many options to begin with, and after seeing a few puzzles, you've seen them all. Even worse, some puzzles, due to their navigational nature, need to be done again if you revisit certain rooms. It felt like busy-work. Overall, I found the puzzles repetitive and intrusive to what would be otherwise a much more free-flowing action oriented game.\n\nThe mandatory upgrades felt very lackluster and didn't enhance overall gameplay, their acquisition serving only as step-stones in order to progress. This could have been salvaged by the Tweak system, if only it had any semblance of good design behind it.\nTweaks are upgrades you can apply to your character at any save point, and you have three slots in which to equip these Tweaks. Tweaks need to be built on workbenches you find around the game world, and for that you'll need to first collect a one-time-use blueprint of the particular Tweak, and resources, one of which, Ivory Oil, is quite rare. Some Tweaks don't require Ivory Oil, but the more useful ones do.\nThe problem: Tweaks are overall not worth the effort of making them, providing negligible bonuses such as a slightly faster running speed or a few seconds of additional underwater breathing. Some can be built more than once allowing for effect stacking, but the three slots limitation forces you to choose between distinct weak effects or a twice/thrice stacked effect that will still not change much at the end.\nTo make matters worse, upon taking a hit, your rightmost working Tweak slot \"breaks\", nullifying the effect of that Tweak until the slot is repaired by collecting shards that enemies and environment statues drop, and quite a few are required to repair a single slot. If you fail to repair a slot before taking another hit, the slot to the left of the broken one is now broken as well. In three consecutive hits, you'll have no working Tweaks.\nWhat this means is that three Tweaks fail to improve your character in any meaningful way and even if they did, taking a hit and losing at least one Tweak for some time is an always looming possibility, especially during boss encounters. \nBecause of this, pursuing materials for Tweaks felt like a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, materials and Tweak blueprints are all you're going to find in secret areas, so the exploration aspect of this particular metroidvania is rendered moot.\n\nI understand perfectly well the desire to have an original system in a game, but this just doesn't work. Optional, even limited upgrades are not a new concept and they've been implemented perfectly well in past games, so what happened here?\n\nNot to mention the many nonsensical design tidbits, such as: too many platforms requiring you to grab onto their ledge to pull yourself up instead of being able to clear them normally, taking longer to navigate them than necessary; including a basic move, dodging, as a Tweak, which will be lost if you take three hits at most; a very specific and costly Tweak being required to access a secret area, which will only net you a material to make more Tweaks anyway; one of your abilities taking two hammer swings to fully charge - the first swing stopping just short of being enough - but there being a Tweak that will allow you to fully charge with a single swing. Why?\n\nNow, regarding the story, I'll tackle both plot and writing together in this case, for convenience.\n\nI personally didn't like it. It's such a heavy-handed, bleak, drama-filled story that is a stark contrast to the gameplay. Pretty much every significant character, aside from the silent protagonist, is a broken mess of an individual with deep personal issues who flies off the handle, punches walls and shouts to high heavens about ideology or their suffering at the slightest provocation. Even non consequential NPCs treat the main character with an unjustified disdain I don't often see in games.\nThis kind of melodramatic writing would be grating enough anywhere for me, but here, in a colorful metroidvania where I'm supposed to be happily running around finding secrets and shooting enemies, of all places?\nThe in-game world itself is an absolute hellhole to live in, with a pervasive, on-the-nose evil religion that deprives a family of their livelihood, or even kills them, for so much as interacting with a \"sinner\", and it doesn't take much to be a sinner in this world. \nThe game is also surprisingly violent, with many characters dying or getting injured, sometimes in gruesome ways.\n\nI found no aspect of the worldbuilding in this game to be anything but joyless. The constant bickering and moaning from the characters made me not care about any of them. There was no cool place, information or goal to look forward to, nothing for me to think \"well, this makes it all worth it\" or \"this is really interesting, I want to know more\".\n\nAll in all, my time with Iconoclasts was not enjoyable. It's a real shame, one of the biggest ones since I've made a Steam account almost 8 years ago. But it is what it is.\n\nNow, I am aware that Iconoclasts was, according to the store page, made by a single developer over seven years. As harsh and unfeeling sounding as this review is (an unfortunate byproduct of the text medium), I have no intention of, nor the presumption of being able to, taking this achievement away from him. The fact he managed to make everything in this game by himself is nothing short of praise. Anyone who has worked on a software, game or any similarly big project knows how monumental of a task it is and I feel secure saying most people are not equipped to deal with it alone, but this man did it and that's really inspiring to me.\n\nCongratulations, Joakim Sandberg, for pursuing your dream and seeing it through to the end. More important than anything I've said here, I believe you have incredible tenacity and talent and I hope you'll continue gracing the industry with these strengths in some form or another.

The vast majority of the game is played in linear fashion following a story that starts a bit weak but really grew on me and by the half way point I was fully invested in the characters though the overall lore/story was dodgy at times. But the moment to moment happenings really shine; largely thanks to stuff actually happening. This game is very good at keeping the plot moving and I'm adding a spoiler section to the end of this review to rave about one portion of it.\n\nNow past that Iconoclasts has vibrant, engaging audiovisuals that start off a bit generic but get to an unique point. All the characters have ton of variety in animations and really bring the world alive.\n\nThe gameplay starts equally basic but as you gather a few more weapons and abilities(there aren't that many; it's a tight package) you really get in the groove. Especially during a variety of bosses you are really allowed to get in a flow state that just works and normal difficulty is tuned just right where you have enough time to learn the mechanics on one life but if you are a bit slow on the uptake the game will kill you. I only ever needed 3 lives to beat a boss but still felt like I was being challenged to an good degree. The puzzles are lplentyful and relatively light, no complaints there.\n\nSo yeah all told I can really recommend Iconoclasts as a light metroidvania with highly engaging characters and fantastic pacing throughout.\n\n\n[spoiler]Now a big thing that kinda surprised me was that people die in this. To me this looked like your normal PG cutesy indie game where maybe bosses kinda disappear off screen and so forth. But no, both bad and the good guys properly kill named; major characters off. Limbs get torn off, bad guys shoot characters in the face and good guys make dudes burst in very explicitly painful ways. Now to be clear all of this is rather free of blood.\n\nAnd even the main character gets in on that action. Late in the game(after you have fought her a couple of times) you come across your nemesis again and one of your friends basically says \"hey I know you've had a chance or two before and haven't taken them; but right now you really gotta kill this bitch\" and then you actually do it.

Every so often the game will expect you to backtrack through a level or, on one occasion, comb through a level you just went through to find a plot trigger to move the game on, which made me resort to just using a guide. Aside from that, there's not really much of a reason to explore because the rewards you get for exploring (tweaks) are generally unessential and not very useful. I used the same set of tweaks for almost the entire game.\n\nThe bosses are where the gameplay really shines in my opinion, and there are quite a lot of bosses. Each boss feels unique and requires a different approach in order to be defeated. I found myself having to tank quite a bit of damage in most boss fights before I could figure out their pattern, but the fights rarely felt unfair. \n\nThere is a lot of emphasis on the game's plot and worldbuilding, and I think it pulled it off quite well. The story seems to meander from one thread to the next at first, but it builds up to a tense and dramatic climax that really made the whole thing click for me. There are some weird and slightly questionable writing decisions, like the amount of focus on a particular character's family melodrama and an endgame reveal that left me disappointed, but none of that ruined the plot for me.

Exposition and explanation is deliberately withheld in favor of a more \"natural\" sounding dialogue for characters that don't accommodate clueless players.  This can be fun for puzzling things out on your own, but the sheer quantity and frequency of cutscenes feels less like learning an intriguing mystery and more like reading a book where you skip chapters at random.\n\nWorse, the abundance of story constantly clashes with the game's aspirations of being a metroidvania.  Areas can be revisited with new powerups to unlock alternate routes, but instead of using level design to guide the player, the cutscenes constantly roadblock, teleport, and redirect the player character.  Once, I defeated a boss and got sent to a part of the level I hadn't seen before.  I worked my way back to the center, assuming a landslide I saw earlier would be clear and I could progress.  It was still there.  Instead, I had to go back to where I was teleported, go in the opposite direction a bit to trigger a cutscene, and THEN go to the cleared landslide.

It's insane that this was only made by one person in the course of 7 years (art and music included!)\n\nThe story is... interesting. It is very heavy on it. It kept me interested in some parts but lost me in others. Not in the kind that I didn't understand what was going on, but I was rather wondering \"Why would x do x?\". It was angering at times.\nThe characters are written and presented in such a way that you kind of know what to expect of them, but they're likeable. Villians have even more depth than main characters, pretty cool.\nI think if it was a more to-the-point story with less erasable filler and instead expanded on the whole world/religion/situation would've been better. Dunno why it was left to an NPC in a church to explain /very shortly/ on some of those things instead of it being included through game cutscenes and expanded upon.\nI also expected with such a heavy story that you'd be able to make choices to affect the story in any way, but the choices you're given don't really do much.\nFinal Boss spoilers: [spoiler] It's kinda like the dog ending in Sillent Hill 2 lmao, definitely not a worthy payoff. Would've been better if it was only the Starworm. I also wish he actually spoke. I know he's supposed to be controlling all of it with the mind control ray thingy but it is all left in a big question mark. Theres also no epilogue[/spoiler]\n\nThe game is not very difficult, unless you've played through the game once and unlocked challenge mode (wish you could've picked it from the start!) I played through the game on the hardest difficulty and without doing any ability upgrades in game to try to make it a little bit more challenging, got through it just fine.\nGameplay spoiler: [spoiler]I appreciate you being able to play as other characters (albeit VERY short gameplay of them), really wish you were able to play as other characters more, it actually doesnt really matter who's in your party or not[/spoiler]\n\nThe reason that I am writing this review however is one thing: the bosses. These are the most fun boss battles I have EVER played in any game, each and every one of them brings something different to the table. They felt like rewards after going through the puzzles, and their themes are mostly hyping up the battle.\nThey're seriously what made the game for me, they never felt repetitive or unfair. \n\nOverall I like this game. The art is amazing, music too, it had a couple of very memorable pieces like Psychopomp and Preacher, and it has controls that are fluid, but the amount of backtracking that you have to do currently prevents me from wanting to play through the game again in challenge mode but I might do it sometime.\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1579842678, "timestamp_updated": 1579842678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62291885": {"recommendationid": "62291885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300992403", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1732, "last_played": 1693419466}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game that I think deserves more attention", "timestamp_created": 1579811107, "timestamp_updated": 1579811107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62251027": {"recommendationid": "62251027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044804757", "num_games_owned": 787, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 894, "last_played": 1578856463}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a work of love, everything in this game has been done with care and attention, from the fantastic pixel art graphics to the level design.

The dialogue was plagued with references to things the player has no context for, that only get explained in the most hand-wavy kind of way later on. Stuff just kind of... happens, and you just happen to be there when they do.\n\nThe level design is alright, but there ends up being a lot of backtracking. There're a few levels that are effectively closed, by which I mean they are self-contained and feel claustrophobic without intending to. There's one area that is meant to feel that way and it does a great job of it, but I'm wondering if it wasn't by accident, given that much of the game ends up feeling that way.\n\nI think, overall, the game is worth playing through once.

I recommend Iconoclasts. However, if you pick this up, this is what you will get:\n\nA varying difficulty puzzle platforming metroidvania style game. The story apparently divides people, I thought it was good - be prepared to read a bit, and it should be easy enough to follow. The gameplay is decently tight - I wasn't sure that I was playing the same game that many of the negative reviewers did - this may have been due to some updates, I can't say for sure, however, all in all it's a fun play. \n\nThe bosses are either great, or frustrating beyond belief (the hide and seek one gave me a lot of stress). This game is either great at communicating to the player what it needs, or really, really bad at it. Some of the controls are a little wonky, but the wonky controls are never the base controls for the main character (looking at you, Mina's shotgun). \n\nThe puzzles are frustrating not because they're overly difficult, but because you simply forget what all you can do at points. \n\nAs for story, I did like it. The world is decently built, and leaves a lot of questions, though you may not exactly like how it's built. For example, what the hell is the finale? What is the blue infection, and why does it look like it doesn't belong, and yet seem like it does? (You'll understand by the final boss what I mean here. I get most of the concepts and lore of the game but this blue infection in particular is quite trifling, I just don't see why it's there if it's totally acceptable in the game world. Can you sense my confusion about it yet?) Additionally, and this may just be me, a certain character was LGBT, and it wasn't clear until the end - my problem is not with the LGBT part, simply the fact that she fearlessly defends her culture, which is one centered around male and female reproduction. This made the inclusion of the LGBT here seem heavy handed, whereas if it had been Elro, it honestly would've fit much better. \n\n\nEnding (spoiler thoughts)\nThe ending is confusing and potentially bad, depending on your point of view, but my biggest thing with it is that\n[spoiler] it seems to almost make the game a sort of joke? As in, the whole planet is actually some weird alien's personal ivory gas station for their star worm space ship. Seriously though, why does the blue infection affect the bird as well? I really don't understand it - everything else within the narrative and lore has a place, except for this strange blue infection.

Doesn't feel super motivating to get chests, even though they have some fun puzzles.\n- Lacking technical polish\n\nOverall I really like this game. When you are doing the platforming and running through and shooting, it feels really tight, and the animations and controls are top notch. It tends to get less fun when you have to deal with a boss without being given a clear method to do damage, and the story is pretty darn dark and serious for the cutesy art style and music. The further into the game you get, the darker it gets. I also feel like more time could have been spent providing more information about the world of the story; I've picked up a fair amount of what the state of the world is, but not how it got that way, or how the antagonistic force in the game came to power, or anything.\n\nSpeaking of story, the writing here is hit-or-miss; the developer wanted to go into some deep philosophy about religion, freedom, morality, duty, etc. , but I'm not sure if English is their first language, and it's led to some awkward sentences and conversations in the game that could have been smoothed over. Not a big deal, but it keeps me from giving it a higher score.\n\nI call this a 'Metroidvania-lite' because there aren't that many upgrades, and you don't unlock that many new things in previous locations with them. Revisiting old locations is mostly to get materials to get some small perks (more damage, bigger explosion, free damage hit, etc.). Because these perks (called 'tweaks' in-game) don't significantly change the game, getting materials from the aforementioned chests doesn't feel super rewarding; for the most part you're going to select a set of tweaks that works and rarely change them or build more, so the materials are just a badge of achievement than something you will actively feel the need to look for. That said, the puzzles around the chests can be fun.\n\nFinally a few technical issues that deserve mentioning:\n* I've been playing on a computer monitor. When I try fullscreen, there is a ton of screen tearing, and there are no video options in the game to fix this. I do not have this problem when playing windowed, but there is no borderless windowed option, so you'll end up seeing your icons and the title bar doing this. Not the biggest issue, but it is annoying.\n* Whenever I die in-game, the window shrinks to a smaller size, and I have to re-expand it. I guess this acts as a deterrent to death, but the issue below explains why I end up having to deal with it more than I like.\n* This is the most egregious: a good portion of the time, taking damage gives you iframes that also make your character invisible onscreen while they are active. This means when you take a hit, you have about 2 seconds where you don't necessarily know where you are due to knockback, and if you are surrounded by a lot of things that can do damage, you get stuck in a loop where you continually take damage, become invisible, and try to figure out where you are and if its safe or not. During normal platforming this isn't a big deal, but it's very frustrating in boss fights or when there are many hazards/enemies present. I'm not sure what causes this, but if it would be the number one thing to fix if this game ever gets bug fixes.", "timestamp_created": 1577559227, "timestamp_updated": 1577559227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60767487": {"recommendationid": "60767487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274434523", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1577651706}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No es el mejor de su g\u00e9nero, como metroidvania es flojo, pero es muy entretenido y los puzzles son interesantes, a bajo precio es disfrutable completamente.", "timestamp_created": 1577553623, "timestamp_updated": 1577553623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60723480": {"recommendationid": "60723480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063568257", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1577506012}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is almost really good. but it actually kind of sucks.\nThe pacing is really odd and after a while it just seems like you are running around just because it's what you are supposed to do since it is a platformer.\nThey devote so much screen time to dialogue, oh god. it's not that the plot is bad but it is not compelling in any way.

Finish this game and it was an interesting experience (in its own way). That being said, it has quite a number of UI Decision flaws. Overall I'll give this around a 7.5/10\n\nI'll start with the bad. Firstly I wish there was a better audio soundtrack. I had to lower my music by a lot because of the consistent audio loop that is quite monotone. Secondly, the teleportation system is bad. It's placed at areas that are near the city but arent in the city, which means you have to do some distance walking which waste time. Thirdly, there is no functional maps. You have to guess or remember which place is located where which sucks because you wont really know where is the next objective. Additionally chest that are open are not indicated if they are open so you have to guess which is open. \n\nLastly, it doesnt help that the tweaks are completely irrelevant. You can get by in the hardest difficulty with just having the t\"hree chance no hit\" tweak. And because you will have to backtrack to get the better tweaks, you just dont want to soooooo you just miss out in that. I wish the dev had at least given some schematics to try out instead of needing to backtrack to find the goods one to give incentive for players to get the good tweaks\n\nSo whats good about this game? The story is interesting. For an indie game, it has an original storyline with [b] VERY [/b] interesting dialogs. It's not ground breaking dialog but its different. The platform part of this game needs a bit of thinking to get by and the animation is top notch for an indie developer. \n\nGive this game a try. Dont be put off because of my negatives.

You've got youself a nice kit with a roll, cooldown reducer and armor, and guess what, you can't roll in a long bossfight *when it's needed* because it's just broken. Your hp is almost full though.\nCave Story used weapon levels to encourage players to dodge, though you can still fight with lvl1. This game discourages you to use tweaks, because your tweaks become unreliable. Just fill it up with speed boosters and forget that this system exists. Either dodge everything perfectly (hello hitboxes), or just don't bother.\nThis game wants to be Cave Story, but it can't deliver what it's promised.

And a note, I had this game gifted to me by a friend.\nFirst and foremost, is inconsistent information. At the start of the game, and enemy jumps at you with a green flash, signalling that you need to hit it with a wrench to make it vulnerable. Then a couple of minutes later, a enemy flashes green and it fires a projectile that you need to deflect. Seems alright? Right? Then much later in the game certain bosses will expect you to just know when to deflect projectiles/stun them with your wrench.\nThere's a lot of things you can only learn by tanking damage, and would have no way of knowing with what the game has taught you. Certain power ups have applications that you have to learn through trial and error, and certain items seem just barely reachable, before you realise after an hour of trying to jump perfectly that there is in fact a power up to make it work.\nThen in another area there is a puzzle, in which I shit you not, you have to first roll a bomb up a slope at a 45 degree angle in the ceiling after jumping in order to get it to push a piston. Seems alright? Well, you also then have to get the exact positioning to get your bomb to roll on the very top of the hill before the slope. It seems like the sort of thing you'd get a power up later to solve, but is in fact just a skill shot. It's never clear whether you should keep grinding on figuring out how to solve a puzzle or if you need a powerup to get further.\n\nHowever, if you can look past these frustrations and inconsistencies, you'll find a fun metroidvania game with some of the most realistic characters I've ever seen, put in a shitty situation that there isn't a clear solution to, all with different goals, aspirations, beliefs and culture put behind their every action. I was seriously impressed with the writing.\nThe art could carry the game by itself, and there is a lot of variation in character design. It never once felt like they were trying to cut corners by giving certain characters limited animation. I was especially impressed by the character's animations and art in cut scenes, all of them felt like their own unique character brimming with personality in their every gesture.\nThere are a multitude of incredibly interesting boss designs, and there are a LOT of bosses. It felt like I was approaching the end of the game around halfway through because of the sheer number of bosses I had fought, with all their own unique mechanics.\nSadly, the bosses also suffer from unique gimmicks you have no way of knowing without taking damage or dying to figure out, because none of it is explained beforehand. But there's a lot of interesting bosses each with their own mechanics. i never once thought that a boss was too similar to one I had fought before.\nThere a lot of unique and interesting puzzles, that also suffer from the poor explanations of what your kit can actually do, and signs telling you what powerups you need for a certain puzzle. If you want to 100% this game on your first run, you'll need a guide or to comb over the entire game again once you know you have every power up, because doing it after getting a new one in each area is quite frankly painful.\n\nThis is a fantastic game that is well worth your time, but will frustrate you with small problems throughout the otherwise great experience. It's worth your money.\n\nA final complaint, with major spoilers ahead, is for the ending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a massive build up, to an anti-climatic ending where the character punches the god of the world, makes a speech bubble about a tree, and then the worlds problems are literally all solved at once for no reason. Could have done with some more explanation, or even better just showing the dead god and fading to black. You might disagree with me, but I didn't like this ending much. Especially after putting all the effort into making realistic characters, only for the main character to fix everything by killing a god.

On one side it's gorgeous art, brilliant story, mostly tight controls and likeable music set this game up for success. Sadly the overall result is a frustrating slog. Like a long walk where mid way through water makes it way in your shoes. After a very charming introduction, your will to play will be slowly sapped. All caused by it's continuous clumsy execution. Thankfully it's quite short.\n\nThe tweaks are god awful. A useless and poorly thought out system. I bought a ton and stuck with the first three I ever made except for the swimming point where I had the breathing tweaks. The breaking / repairing system picked up from Cave Story is exactly the opposite of fun. In Cave Story, the gameplay is based on upgrading to more powerful attacks and empowering the player when they do well. This game would have been better without it. \n\nThe enemies are mostly bad and boring. Unless you're locked in a room with them, simply skip them. That could be said for all Metroid like games because it's a feature from design unlike Castlevania like games. However what Metroid likes usually do well is to have inspired enemies that are original and fit in their environment / story. The other thing they do is usually serve to introduce mechanics and give other helpful hints for the story, potential secrets and bosses. Not here.\n\nThe bosses all feels like chores except one. The boss battle that satisfied me the most was Chrome. Well executed, entertaining and tight. Very well done. Now obviously that is the result of the great story and could not have been done for all bosses. The main issue with the bad bosses is the gimmicks... that are supported with partial invulnerability. Always. Prepare yourself to see that icon that means your attacks are ineffective because it's going to come up a lot.\n\nFinally the things that is not straight up bad but just clumsy. The dialogue during battle, they're not voiced and will not stop the gameplay. No health upgrades or tweak slot upgrades. The many beautifully drawn NPCs are usually seen once with a single dialogue and they're done. Why such waste?\n\nAt least the save system is solid. Five slots! With autosave!

On the basis of its puzzles, combat, platforming, boss fights, and other enemies, I'd probably rate the title about an 8.5 out of 10. These aspects are all very good.\n\nHowever, the writing is absolutely fantastic. It was substantially above my expectations, and I have very high expectations. The way the plot weaves tragedy with small shreds of hope and mixes occasionally fulfilling those hopes or setting up another tragedy is pretty masterful. Your journey through the world is a very tiny part of something much larger, which you have very little awareness of. This is my favorite type of telling a story, as I love to try to piece things together while I play a game. There are a few 'explanation dumps', but there's still a substantial amount of information that is only explained once or twice. I never felt like the game was hammering home plot points into my brain because the authors felt I would be too dumb to understand, which is something I typically feel in games. Without engaging in spoilers, I'll also say that I particularly enjoyed the ending because it subverted many of my expectations for what would happen.\n\nThis isn't even getting started on the characters, who are also very well written. They all have their own current concerns, backstories, and personalities. While your closest companions are the ones who get the most direct characterization, the (mostly silent) protagonist, Robin, also gets characterized, if mostly through actions. She's consistently kind (sometimes to the point of naivete) but also very driven. This makes her kind of a pushover in many regards (in that she can be swayed by smooth-talking), but she's unwilling to budge on her ultimate goals of helping people who matter to her. The rest of the cast is equally well-rounded for the most part, with the only exceptions being minor characters who only make a couple of appearances. Honestly, even that is a strength. A few of the characters who rarely appear are some of the important ones within the enemy organization. Just by chance, Robin's path takes her through some of these figures but not all of them. This is more realistic than fighting an enemy force in an endless series of 1v1s (though there's certainly no shortage of that).\n\nHonestly, in retrospect, I would have bought this game if it was just a video of watching somebody else play it.

Either they're blatantly obvious or they are \"exactly at this spot you have to jump into the wall\" while the \"spot\" doesn't look any different at all from any other wall. Half the secrets don't show on the map, so essentially finding them is either getting lucky af or hugging every wall on the map. Very innovative. The poorest secrets I have seen in a metroidvanian in ages.\n\nThe puzzles are often a chore, because they will refresh. So half the time, once you solve a puzzle, you can go through the room without problems, because they save, the other half they don't, so you spend time doing the same mediocre puzzles again and again if you want to find secrets. \n\nHalf the time the game betrays its own mechanics as in \"oh, you can't grab THIS ledge, silly, just because we say so. It looks like a perfectly fine ledge. But you can't, otherwise there would be more than one solution to our garbage puzzles.\" Again, very poor for metroidvanian standards. Have you played ANY Metroid or castlevania game where you have to do half the puzzles again, because, why the F not? Yeah, I doubt it, too. \n\nSome enemies have shots you need to parry so you can defeat them, but guess what? There are enemies that tell you, that you have to parry their shots, but still are invulnerable to them. Again, the game betrays its own mechanics. Also, there are literally invulnerable enemies. Fun, right?\n\nThe bosses, oh boy. Gimmicky to the max. Started out interesting, then it's just \"figure out what the F the game wants you to do, break weakpoint, deal dmg, do it over until next phase, learn pattern\", and once you do, there is literally ZERO challenge. Some bosses have super flashy effects, so often it's hard to see what actually hurts your character and what is just a flashy effect. Some bosses literally have a very clear giant attack, and a flash around them, but guess what? All of a sudden, literally everything hurts you. Why go through the effort to make a sprite for an attack, when the blue circle around the boss is the damn hurtbox? WHY!? This game is inconsistent with EVERYTHING.\n\nAlso, there are puzzles in the second area that require a weapon you find only five hours later. Altogether the game is ABYSMAL in terms of the tools you get and that you can use. It's a joke, really. This game is a mediocre action platformer, not a real metroidvania after all. \n\nEVERY character in this game is a complete and utter idiot. Every. Last. One. Artificial drama that even preschoolers would find tedious and it gets worse in every instance, the further you go. \n\nI mean, the game literally cracks a joke about the unnecessary overusing of \"do it all again, go there, fetch three Xs then, go back and do it all again\" kind of quest loops, just to literally send you the F around in a loop! Beat area 5? Good, now go to area 2. Not there? Go to area 4. Not there? Try area 3. HAHAHAHA, it was in area 5 all along. Seriously? Fking seriously? AFTER you made the joke about bad quest loops in area 3? Wow. The game literally feels like two different teams worked on the game, the first one was fired after ~3 hours of content. From area 3 on it feels like a bloody chore. No new tools, no nothing. \n\nHalf the time the puzzles and secrets are so abysmal, the game tells you how to use each tool, only to expect you to use them completely differently or just laugh in your face like \"lol, I know what I said, it just doesn't do anything!\".\n\nI mean, there is literally a note next to 3 boxes saying \"do not expose to open electricity or X[redacted for spoiler]\".  But if you use your skill that allows you to literally create ball lightning that floats in the air, guess what happens? Yeah, nothing. \n\nOften, the game will send you from the right end of the area to the middle of the already explored area to continue, because you have to go to the extreme right, trigger a sh*tty cutscene, and all of a sudden, the way is open. That's poor design. Artificially inflating playtime by literally wasting yours. Great job.\n\nFast travel exists, but as soon as you unlock the machine to do so, you gotta visit every damn area by using it, otherwise you have no chance of knowing (in all but one case) where the access to the fast travel network is. How can you f*ck that up? Metroid didn't even have a fast travel system and still did OK, because it wasn't designed like sh*t! One, singular long map from left to right. Wow, what a good idea. Splendid. And THEN you F up the fast travel system. Good job. \n\nControls are OK-ish. Your character has some kind of auto-aim for ranged attacks, problem is only, for some reason, half the time it just doesn't work. And if it does you have to be about 30-50% of the max range of even your already short-ranged basic attacks. Wtf is the deal with that?\n\nLiterally EVERYTHING in this game is half-baked and feels like they went with the first idea they came up with, no testing, no revision, no polish, no comments, nothing. From story, to controls, to the way literally everything else works, every aspect of the game seems like 50% effort. \n\nThe pacing is horrible after the first 3 hours. In these the game really feels excellent, is fun and you have the feeling that there is actually some challenge, secrets and you make good progress toolwise, etc. After that, it breaks off, you gain no new abilities and no tools, everything feels like you are running around in circles. Even IF you get something it feels absolutely not impactful or interesting.\n\nYou have three \"tweak\" slots, which get broken one by one every time you take dmg. Some of these actually grant weak and rather uninteresting abilities, some just allow you to deal more melee dmg, negate a single hit or make you hold your breath for longer. Not a fan of that system, for many, many reasons, number 1 being that your hitbox is garbage. Sometimes you get hit in the legs while being well away from the attack, but mind you, if you wanna collect powerups (health you have to collect, everything else flies into, why the hell is it so INCONSISTENT, AGAIN?!), you better catch them with your legs, because the upper half of your character has super-sharp borders and you better be dead center. Arms sometimes don't count, whysoever. How about one or two tweak slots that are \"safe\"? Oh, and that's it, btw. You start with 3, you finish with 3. The end. Great progression system.\n\nEverything, literally everything is inconsistent as F*CK! Why does your character lose more oxygen per second in smoke than while full breast-stroking through water. ARE YOU AN AMPHIBIAN!? What is it with that? Why can't the game behave the same way it introduced you to it under the same or similar premise?! \n\nSaving grace: Sound is OK, Soundtrack is fine, graphics are pretty good, the world is interesting enough. But nothing is phenomenal and they made far less out of their world than they could.\n\nThe game is a dumpster full of good ideas that were exploited for 50% of their value and then tossed into the garbage. Shame, I hope they get it right the next time, because it could have been a lot better if they stayed consistent with their writing and pacing from the first few hours. \n\n______________\nTL;DR: Game feels like they half-*ssed 50% of literally everything that's in the game, and the unsettling degree of inconsistency is the only consistent variable I found. Also, this game doesn't stick to anything that can be considered a standard for a metroidvanian game for good reasons, making it more of a very weak action platformer than an metroidvanian. Got this for 8 bucks, still feels like too much, since they half-*ssed everything they should get 50% of whatever they are asking for already.", "timestamp_created": 1573733118, "timestamp_updated": 1577488024, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559426069259643555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57139428": {"recommendationid": "57139428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129932693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 1627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1627, "last_played": 1573632170}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first started [b]Iconoclasts[/b], judging by the [b]cutesy, stylized [i]pixel-art[/i] style[/b] and [b]joyful music accompaniment[/b], I expected a [b]heartfelt, quirky storyline[/b] throughout, presented in a [b][i]RPG-y[/i] fashion[/b] - and do not misinterpret my words: [b][i]it is[/i][/b].

right a review. \n\nI got Iconoclasts through a giveaway and knew nothing about it aside from what the main character looked like, not even who developed the game or what the age rating was. Due to her oversized wrench and funky hairdo I thought this was going to be a cute, silly game. Then [spoiler]she got called a harlot within the first fifteen minutes of the game[/spoiler] I'm not sensitive to that sort of stuff, but wasn't expecting that. It just got darker as time went one, but I won't go into that for fear of spoilers.\n\nGameplay is pretty fun, you have two weapons, a wrench and a gun that can use different ammo as time goes on. I have gotten stuck a few times due to the fact that I forget that when there is a small gap your character needs to be able to hang off it to crawl through it OR be on the same level as it. There's a few parts where you are slightly lower than the gap, not lower enough to use it as a handhold, and can't do anything with it. \n\nThe art is also super fun, despite being pretty pixelated it's very detailed, especially for bosses. My computer sucks (sometimes even Minecraft is too much for it) and this game runs beautifully which was a nice surprise.\n\nThe music is weird, but in a good way. That's the only way I can describe it, I'm going to try to get the OST some time.\n\nThis next part is going to be mostly spoiler tagged, just in case, it details the mechanics of a certain boss battle. \nMy biggest complain would be how the game does throw you into situations head first sometimes [spoiler]During the boss battle where Robin and Mina tag team to beat the guardian robot you need to switch between the two while fire, bombs, and smaller enemies are being rained upon you. This is the first time you can play as Mina and her play style is way different than Robin's involving having to stand still to aim her weapon among other things. I died several times to that boss just trying to figure out how to play Mina well.I would have appreciated a chance to be able to use her in a less stressful situation, maybe the wall comes up before the battle starts and you need to play as her to trigger the fight so you can get a feel for her controls?[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, if you're willing to get frustrated sometimes I'd totally recommend this game!

The plot - whilst occasionally humorous - is both overly ambitious and underwritten. It's at times almost incomprehensible, with this melodramatic Metropolis-esque dystopian theocratic story that often doesn't reflect the tone of of the game, the visuals, nor what you're actually doing outside of boss fights, which is laboriously backtracking through labyrinthian maps fighting monsters that are - so far at least - totally unconnected to the main plot. It's actually a real turn-off - it's impossible to care about this story. \n\nThat's not what matters though. It's a passion project of one person, so in the face of the gorgeous visuals, a lackluster plot is totally acceptable - not every first major release by a solo developer can be Cave Story. However, the problem here is the gameplay, which is occasionally fun but gets more and more tedious as it goes on. A lot of the time the game doesn't even hint at what it actually wants you to do, which was acceptable in the early 90s to an extent, but not today. I'm only on Isilugar, the third level of the game, and already I'm ready to put this game down for good. The puzzles just get increasingly tedious, the fights moreso - I'm fighting this group of robots at the minute, 2 at a time, that almost act like minibosses considering the ludicrous amount of health that they have, and it's just totally joyless. There's no tension, no feeling of reward when I eventually win after dodge + jump + shoot shoot shoot for 8 minutes or so, it's just a total chore. The game might pick up later, but unless someone else recommends I keep going with it - and it seems no-one else who has pointed out the same flaws that I've noticed so far would do so, since even a few genuine fans of this game still seem disappointed with the ending - I'm out. \n\nIt's a shame, because with some assistance with the actual gameplay element of the game and perhaps a ghostwriter to help sort out the plot a bit, this chore of a game could easily have been a minor masterpiece. It's not that the developer doesn't know how to program a game - this isn't a game that suffers from glitches, in fact a lot of the time the programming is too precise - it's that he doesn't seem to understand - or care - what fans of this genre want. Look again at Cave Story - a metroidvania which is visually far more simplistic but still very evocative, with a wonderfully written story and gameplay which is frequently challenging - especially if you go to hell - but is never not fun.

Easily the best $20 I have spent on a video game in a long while. Iconoclasts is a fun game that has a limited number of mechanics, but a surprising amount of ways to implement them. The puzzles are appropriately difficult, there were a couple of head-scratchers but nothing that couldn't be solved with some out of the box thinking. Where the game truly shines are the boss battles, which are fun and engaging, and pleasantly varied. One boss requires multiple phases where you switch between two characters. Another simply relies on learning the patterns and knowing when to dodge. One is a slightly annoying \"stealth\" fight. Every one however, is enjoyable and requires you to adapt to the bosses' gameplay style, which goes beyond using whatever mechanic the game just introduced.\n\nIn terms of story, it's pretty good, probably a 4/5. The game does its best to tackle big issues, and does give you a good amount to think about. There are cutscenes that feed well into boss fights, and the carnage that you wreak in the name of your quest will give you second thoughts about if you're doing the right thing. Pacing is good as well as dramatic elements, though some may seem cheesy at first. The characters are endearing and while the story has a rough start and leaves some plot threads unresolved, I enjoyed it. How it affects other players may vary, and is ultimately up to personal preference. Story is definitely more JRPG than traditional platformer.\n\nIf I have any criticisms with the game, it is that occasionally there is too much happening on screen, during both gameplay and cutscenes. In one instance, a boss fight in an elevator takes place during a plot critical conversation in the next room, requiring me to dodge the enemy's blows while trying to keep up with the plot. The music is well done, though it lacks a staying power (don't buy the soundtrack, is all I'm saying). There are a few stages where I wondered a stage aimlessly trying to find the way to the objective, though that may just be my own insufficiency in playing Metroidvania games. There are also sidequests that have minimal impact on the story, but you'd be forgiven for forgetting them.\n\nDespite my criticisms, I had a thoroughly enjoyable time, clocking my first run at 11 hours. The game does a lot well, and I would encourage everyone who likes action-adventure platformers to try it. There are also aftergame features, such as a boss rush and new game +. I won't retry immediately, but I'm sure I'll return soon to give it another go. 4/5", "timestamp_created": 1569130445, "timestamp_updated": 1569130445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55206586": {"recommendationid": "55206586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117841027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1569028314}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting a fun indie metroidvania, but Iconoclasts turned out to be a captivating story with a big focus on interesting puzzles.\nEven the boss battles are more puzzle than spam-until-dead.\n\nI really like this game a lot, and I still daydream about the surprisingly rich story.", "timestamp_created": 1569028500, "timestamp_updated": 1569028500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55194452": {"recommendationid": "55194452", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993268038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 708, "last_played": 1568963342}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality metroidvania style action game that also has a focus on story.

But I have a hard time leaving a game unfinished, especially right at the very end. So I reinstalled and started a fresh game file. I got bored really quickly, as everything was still a little too fresh. I moved on to other games and gave Iconoclasts a long rest. For close to a year.\n\nGiven plenty of time away from the game, I came back and started it up fresh with a third game file. Here are my thoughts, this time after actually finishing the game with 98% completion:\n\n- Story: For the most part, I haven't changed my opinion here, except to soften it regarding the dialogue. It's still obtuse and preachy, but you can just skip it if you don't care. With the ending under my belt, I can say the story between the lines is much more interesting than what happens in the game. It has a few potent emotional beats and a decent plot structure, but it's probably not going to wow you unless you get something profound out of the dialogue. The lore and worldbuilding are where it's at with this game.\n\n- Mechanics: Thoughts here are pretty much the same as below. I don't know that I'd call it a metroidvania, but that's fine. Fast travel (which I didn't mention before) is a little clunky, but makes it easier to go back and collect items you missed, once you find all the travel points.\n\n- Combat: It's still probably the least impressive gameplay element, but it's not as bad as I made out originally. Some of the tweaks that require Ivory Oil can modify it in useful ways, like adding a dodge roll or making the Usurper Gun go through walls. Also, said Usurper Gun will often, but not always, trivialize puzzle based enemies. The frustrating combat challenge was not so bad this time around. Maybe I'm just better at games now or maybe I was looking for an excuse to quit. It still killed me once, but that's not terrible at all.\n\n- Bosses: I still think the best bosses are the puzzle bosses. They make more use of the unique skillset Robin brings to the show. I even cleared an optional pure combat boss fight this time and hoo boy was that rough.\n\n- Player Characters: Yeah, don't make me play Elro or Mina ever again. Especially for their respective boss fights.\n\nI came away this time with a more positive view of the game, but Iconoclasts is still not for everyone. It's probably not even for me, to be honest, but it's a decent effort all around. Give it a try if it looks interesting to you, but keep your finger near that start button and don't be afraid to press it if the dialogue isn't your cup of tea.\n\n-------\n\nVery early on, there was something about the game that made me question whether I wanted to finish it or not. Aabout halfway through, I was absolutely certain I wouldn't be getting 100% item collection and still couldn't decide if I wanted to actually finish the story. In basically the eleventh hour, something happened that frustrated me so much I decided to quit playing and uninstall the game. Here's what I think about the experience in more detail:\n\n- Story: It's serviceable whenever the characters aren't talking. There's a decent flow from location to location with nice little lore bits scattered throughout the world. However, the dialogue basically ruins any enjoyment. It's obtusely written with long winded monologues and preachy philosophical ramblings toward the player poorly hidden behind the religious conflict in the game.\n\n- Mechanics: As a metroidvania style platformer with an engineer as the main character, Iconoclasts does well to focus much of its moment to moment gameplay around puzzle solving. In general, those puzzles are fairly well designed with solutions that make sense once you figure them out. However, a few of them can be almost as obtuse as the dialogue. Like a metroidvania, upgrades to your equipment will open up new solutions to (often) old puzzles/locked doors you had to pass by the first go round. However, those upgrades seem to come at fairly random intervals without any real fanfare and the split up world structure means you typically have to go out of your way to go back to a given puzzle rather than organically circling back around to it.\n\n- Combat: Iconoclasts falls really flat here, in my opinion. There are a lot of different types of enemies, and many of them try to be a mini puzzle to solve. That's fine the first time you see an enemy, but it can become grating the tenth or twentieth or fiftieth time. There's nothing wrong with giving you a way to dispatch old enemies more quickly after a few encounters. Hopefully without spoiling anything, the thing that made me want to finally quit playing was a really frustrating combat challenge that added more puzzle mechanics onto enemies I'd seen before.\n\n- Bosses: There's an interesting sort of variety in the boss encounters in Iconoclasts. Some of them act more like puzzles to solve, while others focus almost entirely on combat. In general, I prefer the puzzle bosses, because they play to the strengths of the gameplay design, whereas combat focused bosses tend to just be exercises in frustration until you learn their patterns.\n\n- Player Characters: This deserves special attention because it is a uniquely frustrating aspect of the game. Robin (the blonde with the wrench) is the player character for a vast majority of the game's playtime. While not necessarily incredible for combat, her mechanics do feel cohesive and fairly well polished. And being that you spend a lot of time with her, you at least become familiar enough with them to make things work even when they're being obtuse. However, there are a few times throughout the story where you are forced to play as a different character to advance some aspect of the plot off in a different part of the world. None of these feel particularly good to play, and I think it's because the alternate characters just don't feel as polished or put together as Robin. Two of those character cutaways are actually necessary boss fights, and they're closer to what I'd call combat bosses rather than puzzles. They are simply not fun gameplay moments. There are also a couple situations where you have to switch back and forth between characters and I don't particularly care for those either.\n\nAll in all, if you can get past its flaws, Iconoclasts might be a good game for you. I just don't think I can recommend it in the long run, particularly because it frustrated me to the point of quitting so close to the end.", "timestamp_created": 1568911666, "timestamp_updated": 1603320756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490238040685653687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55178823": {"recommendationid": "55178823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214168928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 544, "last_played": 1631493433}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are nice, everything feels nice with the movement.

Don't be fooled by the tags of Metroidvania.  The art, action and story telling style is more comparable to Cave Story. Here are some observations I've made.\n\nThe animation of the characters remind me more of a game that would be geared toward children but man.. it's jarring to see some mature themes set played out in a Scribblenauts aesthetic.  Be aware of that if you are playing with someone that isn't \"ready to handle themes of loss or brutality or censorship or misguided religion\", you might want to avoid playing with them.   Maybe a different art style would help?\n\nThe protagonist is affected by \"mute syndrome\".  There is little known about her personality or her deposition before and after key events.  For all we know, she could be a super cheery and optimistic person then turning resolute to make it to the end but we just don't know for sure. The lack of definitive dialog takes away from this character. While on the opposite side, all the support characters flaws and quirks are exaggerated.  The protagonist doe not have anything to complement the support characters.  All of these characters were in position to play a big part of the interactions and when they join the protagonist on her adventure but nothing really significant is brought about it.  The characters and party system seems intentionally unfinished and leaves a noticeable void.\n\nThe action overall seems easy on standard mode. The platforming action and combat is akin to what Cave Story offered back in the day.  The bosses are unique to the themes that it had making it endearing but not really memorable per se.  It might get a little frustrating with some areas not completely logical but whatever. \n\nThe equipment system is pretty basic and the \"tweaks\" system seems like there could have been more done with it.  Also the restriction of 3 tweaks at any time seems odd.  A lot of resources could be gained through tracking chests but it doesn't seem to amount to much other than minor advantages.  I hope the sequel \"buffs\" the use of the tweaks and makes it something that the protagonist can use to create a noticeable influence on their play style.\n\nOne thing that has been done well was the exploration and backtracking experience.  While some boxes are easy to find, other secrets are especially well done and are rewarding to find. \n\nWhile Iconoclasts is a solid game in its own respect, there are quite a few things here and there that are \"slightly\" off making the game feel weird at times.  Cave Story is a masterpiece in its time pioneering something that hasn't been seen back in its day.

I fell in love with those pleasant sounds (for instance, Robin jumping and running and working with wrench), music, controls and beautiful colorful pixel graphics. As it turned out it's a very serious work. The story is for elder people, I think and it so much triggered in my head because there are themes I care about and try to understand too.\nMusic is charming as well. It beautifully makes mood for each location. I most of all loved the piece of Blockrock before the final fight. Such a spooky, calm, soothing and nostalgic tune! Like I heard it somewhere, but I'm sure it's just a tune he created under influence from games of our common past. \nThis game has so much of that retro-charm! And a true adventure too, my favorite genre! A lot of secrets to find, places to visit, people to talk to and things to find and upgrade. Just what I like.\nOh, and those bosses!!! Amazing experience. It's very interesting to fight each of them. Battle system and all damage effects are very pleasant. Colorful fickers when you hit an enemy is something I love in retro games; also there are some comic-like video effect when you hit someone. All this is a sign of a very thoroughful attention to details.\nWhat's the most charming is characters pixel animation. Robin had it the most ) Very very cute animated poses, emotions, actions. And lots of them. Some only to be used once ) That's how creator Joakim loved his main character! I was so surprised and touched seeing Robin SPOILER, DO NOT READ WHO DIDN'T PLAY sitting in the lotos pose instead of on all fours as usual in location closer to the end :) SPOILER ENDS HERE \nThat's sooo cute! )\nAnd those beautiful text boxes in game... People, you won't see this often. It's a work of art. You are like playing a comic book. And letters express person's emotions with changing size, colors, movement and speed of being drawn. Something similar is used in recent Katana Zero.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some cheap animations - like a water splash or trees growing and some more, it's a common practice nowadays - Rayman origins, Ori, again above mentioned Katana Zero and a lot more, they all use that. I call it plastic animation. Maybe made out of time economy. \nBut hey. No grudge. Those games are fun. We are all not without a sin! ;) Especially considering a man did all by himself. It looks ok in the game, but a bit sticks out. I just always aim for perfect animation, I know that's a problem maybe. And perfect animation is hard. So I guess I'm nitpicking here. Overall the game is very very pretty!\nI'm glad for you, developer of this masterpiece! It took some time off your life, but you fulfilled your dream and created a good thing! Finished sinners won't understand what it's about, but you didn't make it for them, did you? ;) You did it for yourself. And I like what you did very much. I also dreamt about making a game... Maybe there's still time. Hey, what if every gamer made own game? Own work of nostalgia... I think that would be awesome! We rely on companies too much, but look what one man can do.\nAll the best to everyone!

But it's just damn good.\n\nThe only cons i'd say is the story does get kinda obtuse and leaves a lot that you want to know more about or get explained, and a couple points in the game the way forward gets a little but obtuse. \n\nOverall this game is wonderful, and if you like action platformers, this one is an absolute gem.

I didn't until 90+% of the way through the game.\n\nStory - 2/5 - There's an interesting world here, too bad that it's so covered in BS that you never get to experience much of it. Storylines and showpieces are introduced and hinted about and then dropped like nothing. This story is jumbled, confusing, and overly obtuse.\n\nCharacters - 1.5/5 - The cast of characters in this game give you nothing to care about.

Let's go over pros and cons for me to express why, because I don't want to write paragraphs of opinions in this review.\n\nPros:\n- Great pixel-art\n- Pretty interesting and solid lore, overall good writing\n- The music is pretty nice\n- Some mechanics are actually enjoyable (swinging and jumping from bolt to bolt, riding powered rails (especially when charged up), power-stomping and sliding on top of curved surfaces as the result)\n- A lot of jokes and overall humor are also pretty good \n\nAnd now, cons:\n- Tweaks (will get more in-depth about them a bit later)\n- Game fails a lot of the times at telling you what you need to do exactly (Ash's boss fight, top side of the ice block, waiting for the Silver Watchman to teleport first and much more)\n- Puzzles become more and more tedious as you progress, eventually turning into a chore that you just want to get done with and never touch again\n- Hitboxes. Yes. (more of a minor issue honestly, but I did struggle a lot in the Impact Zone because the charged shot didn't hit the eyes pretty much all the time)\n- Smoke, gas, etc in the places where they are just overkill (again, more of a minor issue because it was not nearly as common)\n- Absurdity of the final boss (of course not saying what it is, but in my opinion it honestly fucks with the lore and doesn't give any explanation whatsoever)\n- Movement could be a tiny bit more fluid just to make dodging things easier (without the tweak, that is) \n- Horrendous level design and enemy placements later in the game (especially Impact Zone)\n\nNow, about the tweaks. First of all, gathering materials for actually useful ones requires Ivory Oil, which is mostly rather hidden, and you need quite a bit to even make a couple of tweaks. Sure, you could look up a walkthrough, but it's nearly not as fun or exciting as finding them on your own. But this, again, is more of a minor issue, even though you do miss out on some cool stuff without them. \nSecond, the biggest issue I have with them is the fact that they break and their durability. I understand that if they wouldn't break it would have probably been somewhat overpowered, but trying to balance very low durability by collecting bits from enemies is just dumb. It takes like 3-4 hits for all of them to break, and honestly most of the benefits (except Iron Hearts and the ones that require Ivory, of course) are not even that significant. You could at least make it so that they fully or at least partially repair at the save shrines like how it restores health, but no. \n\ntl;dr negatives overweigh positives from my personal experience, so I can't recommend it for the gameplay at all, but if you want some good writing and smooth pixel art and animations, then go ahead, up to you\noverall, 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1563140088, "timestamp_updated": 1640255062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616011261940002441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54083205": {"recommendationid": "54083205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058479940", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1696386179}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend Iconoclasts. \n\nThe art style and soundtrack immediately make the player feel at home in the unique world the game builds, and as the story continues the world becomes more real, fleshed out, and intriguing. Progressing through Iconoclasts' world was a unique experience from a gameplay standpoint, as well. The puzzles scattered across the world often require some thought, but aren't frustrating. I'm no puzzle game master, but there were very few instances in the game where I had to resort to a walkthrough for a solution. The new tools and ideas are introduced little by little, increasing both the number of tricks in your arsenal and the number of different puzzles the game throws at you. \n\nAs soon as I started the game, I began to grow attached to the main character, and since then many of the more minor characters have also earned a place in my heart. The story itself is phenomenal, and it's what made me feel a connection to the characters and their journey. Every protagonist is sympathetic, whether you agree with them or even like them, giving the narrative a satisfying degree of realness. The antagonists, while not always sympathetic, have personalities that are crafted to make you love them, or, failing that, crafted to make them fun to hate. \n\nThe fights against said antagonists are somewhat difficult but not impossible. They all leave an impact on the player, whether it comes in the form of a boss requiring twitch reflexes, or a boss requiring slow, methodical strategy. The game is very good at creating dramatic tension, and making a fight feel epic or daunting. As you progress through the game, the sense of scale of the story grows wider and wider, with more pressure mounting on your shoulders as the stakes are drastically raised.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a 9/10. It's definitely worth your money and deserves a place in the modern metroidvania hall of fame.It carves out its own niche to stand out against many other games trying to do the same thing it successfully accomplishes. The only con I can think of is that the tweak system is almost completely irrelevant. That didn't hurt my view of the game much, it's just a strange inclusion for a mechanic that's unnecessary and barely affects your experience for better or for worse.", "timestamp_created": 1563064574, "timestamp_updated": 1642931131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54065006": {"recommendationid": "54065006", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981939677", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1563067304}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like metroid and castlevania had a baby, I can't think of a term for this though.", "timestamp_created": 1562985593, "timestamp_updated": 1562985593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54046512": {"recommendationid": "54046512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819545274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1275, "last_played": 1564647860}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Story-intensive and character driven with plenty of exposition and helping of side-quests.

It goes on to construct a highly unique and complicated world filled with very real and genuine characters. The world is surprisingly deep and the story surprisingly serious despite how colourful and streamlined the game otherwise looks. The only real weakness in the story is that certain concepts towards the end are not fully explained to the player, which leaves them uninformed on the nature of why certain things are happening. The plot is executed near flawlessly otherwise and is honestly both indicative and worthy of being its own film or novel.\n\nThe gameplay itself is smooth while being decently varied and creative with the various mechanics. It certainly does feel distinguished among other platformers. However the tweak system is quite lackluster. Not only are there a limited amount to pick from but they don't even matter half the time if the player is getting damaged a lot. Virtually all of the collectibles in the game are either tweak unlocks or resources for tweaks, so in turn the collectibles in the game are quite boring. It seems like as the game progresses there ends up being less and less reasons to actually fight using melee when the gun is so blatantly easier and stronger. Then eventually only a specific mode for the gun becomes appealing as it is the most blatantly powerful mode, so the game invalidates a lot of the players combat options by the end. Aiming diagonally with the gun is barely possible or responsive at times, while aiming with the other gun you control during certain points of the game is extremely finicky.\n\nThe side quests are one of the worst parts the game. They are incredibly pointless, tedious and unfun. Basically, pick up this item and take it literally maps away to another place then come back to where you got it and quest complete. Maybe, you might have to do that multiple times, literally multiple times; to get the quest complete. The game would be better off if they did not exist as they are not fun, they seem to be designed to waste the players time and the rewards are lackluster. Yet players are tricked into indulging them for the sake of gameplay and rewards, only to simply have their time wasted for near to nothing or eventually just give up and stop doing them since they are blatantly frustrating and unenjoyable. That half hour spent grinding them before realizing this is pointless and not worth it, thus giving up and going back to playing the actual game; that half hour really is a stain on the early game.\n\nThe art is solid but it is the animations that really make it special, there are so many animations in the game for various characters and events with them all being quite fluid. The music manages to be fairly unique with a good variety to the various tracks. The character design is exceptional, lots of different cast members and they are all interesting and thoroughly scripted. Although, it would be nice if the female characters had less blatantly sexualized outfits. The intention with that wouldn't be as noticeable if so much effort hadn't been put into making the protagonist's pixelated buttocks look so tight and plump at all times. And they go out of their way to make her turn around so you can see it often.\n\nThe boss battles are utter genius, it's practically unparalleled how unique they are all while still being enjoyable and satisfying to fight. But the save system could of not existed. It really doesn't add anything onto the game besides the tedium of having to save periodically, and the wasted time of being knocked back to the last save if you lose. This is especially prominent during the three phrased boss towards the end where; the first phase is cinematically beautiful but the second phase is extremely trial and error based. So everytime you die to the second phase, you have to waste your time with the first phase again and have the entire cinematic appreciation of it ruined since you're playing through the same intense story sequence over and over. In general the end of the game starting at the bastion is the point where it begins to get unfun, the difficulty just comes from players being forced to fight groups of enemies whose attack patterns contradict each others. So you can't fight properly since you're always getting hit by something.\n\n\nThe early game anger of discovering, then forsaking, the side quests combined with the late game anger of that one three phase boss fight and all the obnoxious enemy spam encounters before and after; severely wounds the overall experience. While the production value of the game is monumental, and the quality of the story and bosses is marvelous; those sequences of annoying tediousness that the game goes through are incredibly unfortunate.\n\nThis was still brilliant as a whole, and the story straight up deserves to be adapted into a film or novel; but it really is still hard to look back on it without thinking of those extremely frustrating moments. But, knowing the side quests should be ignored and playing the game on normal difficulty; hopefully would make it significantly more tolerable otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1562798693, "timestamp_updated": 1603127508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53608250617980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54004557": {"recommendationid": "54004557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087610673", "num_games_owned": 2889, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1547, "last_played": 1562700746}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts is an amazing single player story with incredible pixel art. It is fairly short but full of puzzling action from beginning to end. It easily is among the better games on Steam.\n\nThe game is beautiful, Every single pixel in every part of this game is just placed perfectly, And by every piece i really mean every piece, The Menu, The HUD and ofcourse the game itself. It is easy to fall in love with the graphics. The soundtrack is also amazing, it enhances the game every second. It truly exceeds in every aspect.\n\nThe Story is about Robin, Her father died recently, he was a mechanic, Robin wants to be a Mechanic too. In the universe they live people get assigned jobs, Private practices are also prohibited. You meet a lot of interesting characters who all have their own personality. Robin needs to go to the moon and back in order to save the world. It truly is a great story but i won't give any spoilers. \n\nRobin has a wrench, Which can turn bolts, kill enemies, reflect projectiles, charge energy, Robin also has a stungun which can be shot in succession or be charged for a more powerfull attack, There are more weapons to unlock, One Allows you to fire grenades and rockets, another one allows you to shoot a powerfull attack that makes you teleport to solve puzzles.\n\nThe controls are just right, Robin always does what you tell her to do. The game is pretty easy on Hard, But Challenge mode is a real challenge, one hit and you go back to your last manual save point. Some things are near impossible to perfect, So for those insane difficulity gamers, This one might be a challenge.\n\nThere are more than 20 unique bosses with their own attacks and their own weaknesses, If you die from a boss you get to retry right away, No need to load the previous save. If you are up for the challenge there is also a boss rush mode which allows you to set a time for beating all bosses in succession.\n\nRobin has 16 unlockable tweaks, some of which you can stack. Some give you abilities, like double jump, combat roll, meditate to fill tweak slots, others make you faster give you a extra hit without losing any life, make your wrench do more damage or make Robin hold her breath longer. You can adjust your tweaks at any time, but you can only choose 3 at a time.\n\nThere is also a new game plus mode, which lets you keep your tweaks but not your wrench and weapons. It does not make the game harder, But challenge mode is a challenge enough of itself. \n\nIn short Iconoclasts is one for the collection. I give it a solid 10. everything about this game is awesome. It all melts together into a masterpiece that should be played by everyone.\n\nThanks for watching my video, If you liked it, please let me know, I am also open for suggestions on games to review and any questions are welcome.\n\nYoutube Video Review:\nhttps://youtu.be/3PjRVYhiRnA\n\nFollow my Curator Page: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35216846/\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Steam Cloud Save[/td]\n\t[td]Working fine[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Controller Support[/td]\n\t[td]Yes, Xbox One Bluetooth Working[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Achievements[/td]\n\t[td]Easy except for beating it on Challenge mode[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]FPS on Ultra[/td]\n\t[td]Locked to 60[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Launch Command[/td]\n\t[td]gamemoderun %command%[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Issues[/td]\n\t[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]OS[/td]\n\t[td]Arch Linux[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Kernel[/td]\n\t[td]5.1.16[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]DE[/td]\n\t[td]Gnome 3.32.2[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]CPU[/td]\n\t[td]Intel I7-6800K @ 4.20Ghz[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GPU[/td]\n\t[td]Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 (Nvidia 430.26 Drivers)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1562729418, "timestamp_updated": 1562729418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797725200653076172", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53997085": {"recommendationid": "53997085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432356402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1676875534}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute Waifu with a bigass wrench fights the Catholic church. \nIf you're willing to tolerate the kinda irritating movement, you'll probably like this game, cus even if the movement is a major turnoff for me, I haven't found any other major issue with the game so far.\n\nEdit:\n\nDamn its been a few years since I wrote that original review. Due to reasons I was never able to finish the game. I stopped around the final few chapters and if you've played this game then you KNOW that I stopped at the best part.\n\nWhat stands out about this game is the amazing storytelling. Iconoclasts tells a story that attacks religion (I'm religious btw)  and the naive nature of humans. Its a grim story with intense moments and well written characters but it never takes itself too seriously. It's equal parts tragic as it is goofy and I love that. And when I say that, I don't mean the marvel kind of writing where a character breaks heavy tension by trying to be a smartass, the story knows the right moments. The story itself has a few plot holes and can be a little difficult to understand at times but the characters are so interesting that it keeps you going even when the story is a bit messy.\n\nNobody is a hero, everyone hates each other till the end and that makes sense. Too many stories try to make characters suck each other's dick by the end. That's not how things work in real life. You can go through something together and still not like each other and that's fine. The last interaction between Elro and Mina we see is Mina shooting Elro and it was one of the best interaction between characters, which would have been ruined had they been buddy buddy by the end. The strongest characters for me were Black (who isn't black) and Royal, but every character is well written.... except our main character.\n\nWhen it comes to mute, blank-slate characters Robin has to be one of the blandest ones out there. Sure she has charm sometimes (like sommmmmmmmmmmmmmmetimes) but other than puffing her chest and having cute animations, she's so boring. Also her involvement in the story just doesn't make sense, at any point of the story she could just turn back because she's just kinda there for no reason.\n\nNow that I've talked about the story, let me talk about the gameplay. Everything is a puzzle in this game, and I mean EVERYTHING. It's not so much this platform heavy action side scroller that you expect out of a metroidvania but more of a puzzle game with a little bit of combat. You'll be using your guns to solve puzzles more than killing enemies and I find that to be fun. It makes the game more memorable than its peers and I'd rather solves fun puzzles than kill a thousand mindless grunts who will never give me a challenge. But all that said when it comes to boss fights, this game goes harder than any indie game has ever gone. The bosses are so unique, exciting and cinematic that you'd think they belong in a God Of War game. And much like the rest of the game, even beating the bosses is a puzzle. Once you figure out the gimmick they can be pretty easy but its always fun and if you don't figure out the gimmick the bosses can be impossible. Some bosses taunt you, some bosses will make you not want to kill them and some bosses can destroy you in seconds. You'll question if you're right to kill the bosses or if you even can but coupled with the amazing soundtrack and just how fun the fights are, the game keeps telling you to push forward and WOOP SOME ASS! The Black bossfight will be on my mind forever and well unfortunately the final is the weakest of the bunch (Chrome should have been the final boss), but compared to all the boring shit we get in videogames these days, Iconoclast's worst boss is better than the best of most. \n\nI'm glad I came back and finished this game. It's been a while since I've played such a memorable videogame with such a \"videogame\" story. I don't know if you get what I mean but most videogame stories these days are very \"hollywood\" like. They're amazing stories but I always feel like I'd rather watch a movie about that story than play it. Often times the gameplay just gets in the way. Even indie games do that now, but this is a story that you have to play to love. \n\nAnd trust me, you will love it.\n\nMovement is still very stiff though.", "timestamp_created": 1562699519, "timestamp_updated": 1676879251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53995362": {"recommendationid": "53995362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085971400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1562697923}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts is a good game and you should play it.\n\nIf you like games with good stories, action platformers, puzzles, or all three you will love this game. A significant amount of my enjoyment with Iconoclasts came from its compelling narrative which surprised me. I typically find videogames to be a poor medium to tell a story but Iconoclasts just gets so much of it right. The pacing, humor mixed perfectly with dark moments and character emotions, satisfying payoffs and things you are still left wondering about after the credits roll. The lore itself is also very fascinating if you are into that kind of thing. There definitely is a lack of discussion of the lore online and I would like to see more in depth analysis of it. \n\nThe story isn't the only selling point though, gameplay itself is fun and satisfying. Solving puzzles and fighting bosses are the highlights. You're always unlocking some new ability, fighting some kind of new enemy, or exploring some new environment. Playing the game rarely feels stale, there is always something new to mess around with. \n\nAnd the MUSIC OMG, I don't know what it is about these indie passion projects but they always have such good soundtracks! If you like chiptunish retro sounding music you will love the it. I get Stardew Valley vibes from it :p\n\nI feel like this game kinda got overlooked and has not got the attention it deserves. The game isn't insanely long, 10 hours for the main story give or take (20-25 hours if you decide to play new game+ and boss rush modes). Iconoclasts is definitely worth your time. I hope interest in the game will grow greater as it ages. It's not my favorite game by any stretch of the imagination. But the level of polish and love put into it shines through an experience I won't forget anytime soon. \n\nfinal score/TL:DR -> 8/10 would wrench again.", "timestamp_created": 1562694964, "timestamp_updated": 1562694964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53994279": {"recommendationid": "53994279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014260432", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1580949993}, "language": "english", "review": "Very worth the buy, props to the dev!

One's suicidally depressed, another runs away from her familial problems (and b.o.), the third finds a prophetic upbringing does not mesh with reality...

There are additional party members for some parts of the game that we even get to use in some unique sequences. The heart of the gameplay is exploration, puzzle solving and tons of exceptional boss fights. As a metroidvania, it's way more inspired by Metroid but is never too obscure or \"trial and error-y\" with its secrets. Controls are slick and responsive and the balance between action and puzzles is spot on. Boss fights are certainly the crown jewel of the game, visually stunning and mechanically satisfying, with decently high stakes on Harder mode.\n\nAnother big selling point is the story. For the genre, Iconoclasts has a particularly intriguing world building and lore and a complex and ambitious plot. Maybe it does get a bit too convoluted for its own sake in some instances, but overall it's a very emotional journey, with impactful moments. Unfortunately the same heights aren't reached for the characters, as there are some interesting ones but a couple of the \"main party\" members are so incredibly unlikeable. Considering the genre, it's a very minor flaw overall.\n\nCompleting the package we have awesome art direction (gorgous pixel graphics) and a superb OST that deserves a purchase on its own.

The style is beautiful, the characters simple and memorable. The story doesn't hold your hand and guide you through the narrative, but the path you walk to pick up all the pieces is excellent. You'll find a lot of traditional elements here from classic Metroidvanias and platformers, and if you find a little backtracking, expanded mobility, pickup based progression, and themed stages with bosses familiar and beloved, there's a lot to love here.\n\nAlong the way, the story can lose you, and not everyone will enjoy the character beats and narrative changes. The story has some surprisingly dark elements, some touching scenes, and a lot of very cool, occasionally chilling moments. Personally, I enjoyed it from start to finish. I don't know if it can rank among the masterpiece classics of yore, but for an indie game with a limited budget, schedule, and staff, I couldn't ask for better.\n\nIf you looked at this game, read that it was a Metroidvania, and looked the screenshots, chances are you'll get what you came here for and enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1561988326, "timestamp_updated": 1561988326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567567586898803711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52730423": {"recommendationid": "52730423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040492584", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1745, "last_played": 1561846528}, "language": "english", "review": "ow my emotions", "timestamp_created": 1561957145, "timestamp_updated": 1561957145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52711985": {"recommendationid": "52711985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116225812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1109, "last_played": 1561947948}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay overall was pretty entertaining, the puzzle sections did offer a god challenge but the platforming parts were just standard platforming with your \"Iconoclasts brand\" grappling hook. \nOn the other hand the story was good enough, but this is one of the rare times when i keep playing just to see what challenges lie ahead, rather than to see which diretion the story will take me, mostly because the heroe characters are very unlikable, your brother is a manipulative cunt, Mina is a selfish bitch and Royal is just a useless wimp; Because of these I did actually liked the villains a lot better.

May be my gaming laptop, but while the game normally runs smooth as butter, it has frozen once or twice at bad times. Saving often helps, but definitely check those specs.\n\nWith that out of the way: HOLY ****, what an incredible game. I fell in love with 2D platformers as a kid, and this scratches that itch perfectly. The controls are responsive, Robin is a breeze to control, the extra characters are a fun break in control (though I wish they weren't as limited as they are), and the gunplay/melee feels perfect for the setting. I loved the melee just a wee bit too much and adored switching guns on the fly. Tweaks added the incentive to explore for components and made my New Game + playthroughs way more fun as I half broke, half gamed the overworld.\n\nSpeaking of the world, thank god the designers don't think realistic/gritty = grey and brown. The areas are gorgeous and colorful, with distinct set pieces. Are enemies and ideas reused? Yes, but there's no mistaking one area for another. Going back to areas with new tools is sure to reward, and the fast travel option, though it takes awhile to get to, is sufficient (though backtracking can be a bit annoying, there are tweaks to help). I personally backtrack at every opportunity, though it gets repetitive and I'd recommend against it the first time through just for sanity.\n\nNext, the story and characters. Sweet jesus, the story. Keeping it all spoiler free, buckle your seatbelts kiddos, this is a depressing, yet realistic and satisfying story. There will be tears. There will be loss. There will be pain and you will want to hug the characters. Robin as the protagonist was great, because even though she was technically silent, the writing makes it plausible and she does speak, though you get to choose how she acts. And those interactions, however small, WILL impact the story. Other characters are interesting looks into the normal cliches, and for all the AAA titles bragging about \"diversity\" and \"inclusion\", Iconoclasts does it without shoving it in your face. The characters are people first, not just quota fillers. And each has a reason to belong, has stake in the story. The tones and ideas aren't anything new, but they are definitely looked at uniquely.\n\nSo... you can probably guess that I really really love this game and highly recommend it for people who love platformers or good stories in games. If you're on the fence, I would say that, for the price, it's a spectacular game.

There were parts of it that I enjoyed, but other parts that I very much disliked. Perhaps the mostly annoying part was the endless dialogue. The story is very long and complex and because of that, you are constantly having your gameplay disrupted to go thru a seemingly endless stream of dialogue boxes and long/drawn out conversations between the characters. Which is surprising because the main character doesn't talk at all. But all of the other periphery characters don't know how to shut up! I realise this game was made but one person, and he obviously had a story he wanted to tell in very fine detail but it is honestly way too much with the dialogue. If I can use an analogy of an author publishing a book for comparison purposes. There is a reason why books have editors that edit an authors work before it gets published. Because the first drafts are usually very bloated with way too much content that is necessary for the novel to work as a whole. The editor trims down all the unnecessary parts and leaves the novel with a much more poignant story. The developer of this game really needed an editor to do that with the excessive dialogue in this game.\n\nThat being said, there were parts of the game (the actual gameplay parts between the dialogue) that were quite enjoyable. It is kind of a metroidvania, but more linear. The boss fights are numerous and quite enjoyable. There is some platforming elements as well as some combat elements that blend together nicely. The retro-graphics are very nicely done and the music is also well done.\n\nOverall, I completed the game in just over 13 hours (it isn't a short one that is for sure - but that is likely because there feels like at least half of my playtime was taken up by going thru the endless boxes of dialogue). I will give this game a thumbs up because it is obvious the single developer put their heart and soul in this game and I do respect them for that.

Too Much Polish: The game looks very good, and there is a lot of nice animations that really breathe life into the characters. However, it feels to me like there's too much polish, and this becomes distracting noise to the player. For example, on certain screens, there are lots of visual animations and sounds that are too \"bright\", which can be distracting and off-putting. Another example: when the main character runs on screen, she has a clicking sound that matches up with her shoes touching the ground.

This one, however, focuses a lot more on story, as there are very few mobility upgrades.  As such, areas will be inaccessible for story reasons, rather than mechanical reasons, but it's never obnoxious about it; it's smart enough to pace the story in such a way that you never reach something inaccessible before the story concludes.  Which of the 2 styles is better is just a matter of personal preference, but I think that it works pretty well here.  Of course, the strength of something like this is carried at least partially by its story and its characters, and while the story is excellent, the characters are a few hits, a lot of misses, and a surprising number of grazes.  \n\nThe story is about an evil, oppressive religion, but this is only obvious to the player; all of the characters - save for those, who are part of a mysterious other group - aren't so much drinking the Kool-Aid as guzzling it down with a few simultaneous IVs giving an even steadier flow.  The writers paid good attention to detail with this, as people don't use religious colloquialisms from [i]our[/i] world; they use those that belong to this religion, like \"By the Tri!\" and \"Mother be praised!\"  The aforementioned other group are demonized as pirates, but you eventually meet up with them and learn of their own ways.  It goes without saying that the two clash throughout the adventure, and the conclusion of it all is very satisfying, but the neat thing is that you find that neither religion is completely blameless.  In fact, the one to fix it all was the one who didn't subscribe to either school of thought, and only cared about helping others.\n\nThe characters, as mentioned, are a mixed bag.  First and foremost is our heroine; she's quirky and adorable in a way that's not obnoxious, and I love her.  She doesn't actually speak, but she has speech balloons with little pictures in them, and they're all great.  Agent White is one of the villains, and all he ever does is shout one-word accusations, like he's Fujin from Final Fantasy 8, but isn't meant to be taken seriously.  Agent White sets the general tone for the adventure, and he's great, too.  There are a few other minor characters who are cool, but don't get enough screen time to leave much of an impression.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, we start with Robin's brother, who is a self-important jerk, who refuses to give her any credit, when even her enemies respect her.  Agent Black is just an absolutely miserable person with no redeeming qualities.  This is fine, because she's a villain, but then, the story tries to pull on your heartstrings with her backstory, but it doesn't really justify her behavior.  This is where we get to the edge of the coin: there are a lot of characters that go back and forth between being likable and being genuinely terrible people; it's like the writers didn't even know what direction to take them.  This winds up being most of the cast, both protagonists and antagonists.  One might argue that they were supposed to be real people with real flaws, but the way they were written more strongly suggests that these inconsistencies were unintentional.\n\nOf course, no game completely lives and dies by its writing, and a lot of what makes this good is its gameplay.  You have both guns and your trusty wrench.  The guns can be charged, but will have a longer cooldown time after firing charged shots.  The wrench can be used for striking, swung at the right time to reflect projectiles, twirled for a good DPS attack, twisted to crank knobs to move pieces of puzzles the size of an entire room, and can even attach to grapple points.  To summarize, the game plays like a combination of Metroid, Bionic Commando, Castle Excellent, and Monster Party; it's quite a mash-up, and tests your brain just as much as your reflexes.  The bosses are no exception, and since there aren't many upgrades, you often have to think about [i]all[/i] of your skills before you can find a solution that works.  Many of the boss fights are quite engaging and fierce - it's rare for a game to expect you to be a good fighter [i]and[/i] a good puzzle solver - but there are a select few that are stupidly easy or just plain obnoxious.\n\nThe visuals are made entirely of pixel art, but it's not the low-detail variant that screams indie at the top of its lungs.  This is high quality, and has a very unique aesthetic.  The characters - whether I like them or not - all have excellent visual designs.  The scenery is also unique, both in its shape and its coloration; in the very first area, you have trees with little cubes on them for leaves.  The music complements all of this fairly well, and while there are only a handful of standout tracks, few of them are bad.\n\nIf you have good reflexes, can think quickly, and don't mind a reasonable challenge - you're likely going to die a few times - then I'd recommend it, because for all of its faults, it does present something unique and worthwhile overall.", "timestamp_created": 1557641033, "timestamp_updated": 1557641033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598388195037841797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50601920": {"recommendationid": "50601920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427514049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2144, "last_played": 1574713380}, "language": "english", "review": "An odd but great experience.\nIt has truly build a world that looks real and interesting and characters truly flawed.\nThough I did find that the character Elro is by far my least favorite even comparing to some of the villains and I feel like a lot of his behaviour is excused which is a privilege that no one else has in this game.\nBut others are very well crafted and their backstories, trials, flwas and others opinions regarding them are truly entertaining.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting despite I honestly being bad at it and constantly hitting the wrong buttons.\nI honestly disliked a bit how dodge and double-jump are among the tweaks(that punish you for getting hit) and that there is no way to increase the number of tweaks or utilize cominations like the materia from FF VII to remedy that.", "timestamp_created": 1557629150, "timestamp_updated": 1557629150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50568680": {"recommendationid": "50568680", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984820498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1557509955}, "language": "english", "review": "A surreal masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1557472035, "timestamp_updated": 1557472035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514285683631896973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50552560": {"recommendationid": "50552560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179622526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1657606011}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful game with an even better story.

Iconoclasts is primarily a puzzler, and many of the rooms are well designed and are fun to solve and get through. It\u2019s brilliant, the weapons are not only designed to eliminate enemies, but they serve as tools to solve the game\u2019s puzzles. \n\nThe graphics are wonderful, bright and colorful, and the game offers a variety of environments to keep progression feeling fresh.  \n\nThe negatives:\n\nThe story would have benefited significantly with fewer threads. This would have allowed the primary story beats to have more impact and clarity. Instead, by the end of the game, there is so much going on with multiple characters and story elements that it all becomes a muddled narrative mess.\n\nConcerning the dialogue, this is perhaps Iconoclasts\u2019 greatest issue. Numerous scenes span excruciatingly long and are a chore to get through. Moreover, the dialogue is not well written. With revisions, I think the game\u2019s ideas and beats could have been more effectively conveyed. \n\nSignposting is terrible in this game.  Multiple points throughout my playthrough, I found myself completely lost on where to go or how to achieve a goal in order to move forward.  This is perfectly captured by certain instances where you\u2019re up against invincible enemies, but you\u2019re not visually informed that you need to run or solve a puzzle rather than fight. \n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI really like the gameplay and movement, it\u2019s well done. However, the serious narrative tone is in complete contrast and feels incongruous as a result. Dragging it down further, the story is not well written and truly struggles to juggle all its elements.", "timestamp_created": 1557346449, "timestamp_updated": 1557346788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453242599964141846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50546190": {"recommendationid": "50546190", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993360824", "num_games_owned": 3387, "num_reviews": 364, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 538, "last_played": 1557339360}, "language": "english", "review": "Some parts, mostly the art and animation, are excellent.

There's a lot of non-diegetic jokes and commentary, and a lot of the conversations just don't flow, like the characters are having separate discussions from the person their talking to. This serves to make some of the characters unlikable, like the annoying brother and the pitiful psychic guy.\n\nSecondly, the hitboxes and (lack of) invincibility frames tend to make some segments artificially difficult. The hitbox on your character just doesn't feel tight, you constantly take hits to the bottom of your shoe when trying to jump over an enemy, whereas some enemy hitboxes will no longer set off your rolling grenades the moment they start their jump animation, even though they're still on the ground. I'll admit I ragequit several times during the Mothers Corners hidden boss for this reason. \n\nThe game definitely has enough positives to outweigh these issues, especially if you consider the game was made by a single person.

One of these issues stems from just how bland and boring the gameplay is for the most part. The other issue stems from the awful storytelling. Some people will disagree with my opinions on the story, and argue that my politics are involved in the decision, but the problem I have is not which side it takes, but how improper it is within the narrative, and how it waters itself down by way of its shallow understanding of the moral dilemmas it talks about.\n\nThe gameplay:\nThis game is a platformer with some of the most boring platformer design choices I have ever seen. The wrench is involved in puzzles that are consistently worse than the top gadget from Zelda Twilight Princess, but somehow both more simple and more tedious at the same time, which is almost an accomplishment of awfulness. Every bad wrench puzzle is either a very easily understood puzzle that takes way too long to complete even though it is easy, or one that makes you think you have the answer but the answer is actually some thing you could not have known because it involves some item you do not have or some location you have not visited. So many little terrible design choices affect it in wrench puzzles in every area. I want to say so much more about the mechanics of this game, but it cannot be explained, only felt through the pain of playing it. Don't misunderstand, the game is not awful when the action gets going on many occasions, but the wrench mechanics are annoying tedium for the exploration, and the fact that those same tedious wrench mechanics are used in several boss fights makes them insufferable to someone wanting the game to be fun.\n\nThe story:\nHave you ever heard someone say \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"? I have heard that countless times, I bring that up so that I can address it later.\n\nIt has mixed writing. The political and religious commentary not only is lacking in subtlety but also sounds like it was written by a person who just got out of highschool and is angry at their parents. Even so, the characterization is fantastic. Sadly, these polar opposites actually don't mix well due to one simple issue: the moral dilemmas this game explores. You see, the game, as to its title, is about the concept of \"iconoclasts\", which is a whole topic of thought that is a massive subject involving political theory and rectification of moral authority. While the issue is something that has been used as a catalyst in the characters of many great games, it falls short in this one game because the writers do not understand the simple fact that people can be horrible by choice unclouded, and not just by nurture or nature. \n\nAs for the subject of the political and religious commentary in this game, I usually enjoy this topic in games, because it usually is done in an amazing way such as Tales of Symphonia, Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy XII, and some of the Shin Megami Tensei games, which all handled religious and philosophical concepts while opposing the moral authority. However, Iconoclasts does not handle the material nearly as well because it does not actually have anything of its own to say.\n\nIf I were actually to explain just how much of the political and religious dribble is in this game, I would have to spoil the game, so I will:\n[spoiler]\nThe government is a theocracy. The religion practices literal \"whitewashing\". They use a triangle symbol, which may be a bash at the Trinity. The god of their religion is a lie. Every major white male character who is a good guy is either dead or severely and permanently wounded to the point of disability by the end of this game, with the female heroes being unharmed and the story does this as a punishment for their past mistakes, despite none of the important female characters suffering such a penalty. Also, one such character is suspiciously inconsistent in his actions, and such hack writing is par for this game.[/spoiler]\n\nRemember when I asked if you ever heard someone say \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"? The truth is that this old statement is actually a common lie. Sadly, people are awful. People claim they mean well, and when things go wrong they say \"mistakes were made\", but in reality people are horrible and never meant well. Perhaps you have met someone who would lie about you, then smile with glee as you got in trouble for something you did not do? Perhaps you were hurt by someone who clearly enjoyed it? The reason these people did such was not with good intentions, but with selfish intentions. Such people do not cherish others, and truly do such for petty reasons that anyone can see as absolutely evil if such actions and misdeeds were revealed, but the awful person will claim they mean well, that they have pure intentions, and that they are nice. I have dealt with this type of evil human being before multiple times over, and they have many different ways they do their evil deeds. \n\nThe reason this makes Iconoclasts bad is that the game never has a single bad guy who is actually evil and not an ardent believer in something dumb. Every single villain is a virtuous character following some moral or virtue, and none of them are out for personal gain. The truth is if a genocidal dictatorship were to take over any nation, it would do so with overwhelming support. Some would support for their own survival, but many would support it for their own benefit. The evil of people is exactly why the Nazis happened, why slavery has existed, and why there are countless dictatorships across the globe. They chose to be evil, not because of some misunderstanding or misplaced value, but because they take solace or enjoyment in the suffering of others, and fully embrace such choices within open arms to the detriment of others. This game tries to argue that such moral decisions are complex, but the fact is that these choices are very simple, and that the evildoers argue them complex to placate us and pretend themselves clean. If people sell out their good morals for convenience and power, then they are not good people, but willingly and knowingly on the side of evil. The fact that they turn away from the suffering and feign ignorance does not make them good, but rather it makes them dishonest.\n\nHowever, it gets even worse when you consider that none of the heroic iconoclasts of the namesake have any morality of their own. None of the main cast have any moral standing or belief of value other than \"being bad is bad\". In order for one to stand against a different ideology, one must still have ground to stand on; none of the main cast have any grounds to stand on, and none of them provide any alternative moral concept or ideological argument against the system in power. In other words, even if the bad guys are provably bad, the reasoning of the heroes is not at all any better. \n\nI should also warn that the soundtrack is nothing special.

This is a very well made game. But it is just not for me. What I expect from a Metroidvania is uninterrupted gameplay.

Too many equal looking corridors where you have to go back and forth and up and down again and again.\nAnd the puzzles didn't give me any satisfaction solving them. They are too obvious to begin with; they keep repeating the same mechanisms over and over, just the execution is a bit complicated sometimes.\n\nThe handling of your skills is also a bit on the annoying side. One example: to stomp down you need to press down and press jump. Why not do it like Mario where pressing down while in the air is enough?\n\nExploration doesn't satisfy me either, because you never find cool new abilities, you just find the same 4 materials which let you craft things that are not really exciting at all. To me it's important in a Metroidvania to find cool optional stuff here and there. That's just never the case here.\n\nThe boss fights, while looking really pretty, are super messy; maybe it's just me.

Joakim has mastered what many action games try to do with million dollar budgets, with only a few pixels and a lot of polish. The boss fights are not only cleverly intuitive in their mechanics, but are also cinematic setpieces that leave your heart pounding. The game has a bit of an identity crisis, but once you get past that its really an unforgettable experience thats worth playing through.\n\nFirst off this is a narrative driven game. There is very little exploration, but to me this was a good thing. If you like the gameplay of metroidvanias but dislike backtracking then this could very well be the game for you. The story itself is dark, set in an imaginative dystopia, but filled with tender moments. Again, Joakim somehow expresses so much emotion in so few pixels. You can't help but relate and feel for the characters.\n\nWhile your moveset is small, you use literally ALL of it. Rather than a Metroidvania where you tackle bosses out of order and you pick the best powers for the situation, Iconoclasts is constantly forcing you to master even your most basic of mechanics. This combines well with its unique bosses who all bring different gimmicks to the table. Ranging from switching characters mid-boss, to blocking off a rampaging superhuman. \n\nThe game has heavy puzzle elements. Personally I found the puzzles very engaging. The mechanics are satisfying and snappy to execute. Robin's actions all have great weight and feel to them. But if puzzles aren't your thing they're 100% optional and only give minor upgrades that don't impact gameplay much.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this game, but just make sure you understand what you're getting into. This is a narrative-driven, linear adventure game, with some meticulous and well-executed puzzles, and intense boss fights to reward you throughout. It feels like Robin's journey against this oppressive force is your own. Your moveset is limited to a stun gun and some weak bombs, and you're constantly crawling through dangerous and complicated areas against all odds, then you're treated to these cathartic boss fights that leave you excited to start the process all over again.

I was in it for the gorgeous artwork, snazzy soundtrack, and metroidvania gameplay, but what I got was so, so much more. I've been a fan of the developer's work for years and played some of the earlier releases of the game, and I couldn't wrap my head around how much MORE Sandberg added to an already compelling preview of a game. Anyway, focusing on the finished release of Iconoclasts, it's an incredible game that feels so deliciously well-rounded; so much time and effort was put into the narrative, music, artwork, level design, game mechanics, and boss fights (all by one person!), and the result is a game that feels very polished with surprising depth. If you like metroidvania games (and welcome a rich story-driven experience); if you like sci-fi storytelling, complete with its own mysterious world, cultures, and terminology; if you like believable, lifelike characters who don't act predictably, but realistically, who won't just drop everything and taciturnly agree to something that goes against everything they stand for because it's Time to Save the World; if you like running around, shooting things, and solving puzzles that require some thought, you should really give this game a try. Time and time again, while playing this game I felt so taken by the captivating characters, momentous story, thoughtful world-building, dynamic and varied boss fights, ingenious puzzles... everything just blew me away (and I could go on!). The writing can be pretty funny, too, and when the plot twists hit, your heart will ache (unless you're just here for the gameplay and hit skip during every cutscene. It's such a great story but, well, if you don't like reading, there's still a lot here for you, too).\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, go to konjak's website and download one of the early demos--if it feels good to play and you like the world, you'll LOVE what the game grows into. It's such a beautiful game that really builds on itself as it progresses, and the characters will grow on you a lot, too (if you don't already love them from their goofy introductions).\n\nTo summarize, I can't recommend this game enough. My only regret is not playing it sooner. Thank-you so much for making this game, Joakim Sandberg. You've created something deeply moving and unforgettable, something truly inspirational and a testament to what depth and polish can be achieved in art, narrative, puzzles, and gameplay when a game's development cycle can take as much time and creative freedom as it needs. It makes me wonder how many more amazing, thoughtful games could be created if 1-3 year time constraints weren't the norm. (Of course, it takes WAY more than time and creativity to make a game, but I digress.) Iconoclasts has become one of my absolute favorite games of all time; I've already bought 3 copies for myself and others, and honestly, it probably won't end there.

It needs probably twice as many weapons or abilities or something.\nThe only interesting mechanics is the electric tether ride thing and that's fun, but that's it.  \nMost boss fights are puzzle fights that are terrible at telegraphing what you're supposed to do.  \nThe menu interface is terrible, why can't I hover over my items to see what they do, or for quest items find out where I'm supposed to go or who to talk to.\nThe characters are one-note, if they have a note at all...

But...yeah. I just can't recommend this one.\n\nThe opening is actually really great, the graphics are fantastic, the music is nice, the story has potential...then it all becomes a slog. The stages are too long and just not very fun to get through. The puzzles feel more like busywork than like I need to really think them through in any meaningful way. I could often figure out what to do right away, but then the puzzle would take forever because I couldn't land the wrench precisely on the right pixel or get a bomb perfectly in position. It's frustrating, not fun. \n\nWith the bosses, it's the opposite problem. It's often hard to figure out just what the game wants you to do to damage a boss...the mechanics are really poorly communicated. I'm not asking for \"shoot the big glowing eye\" levels of telegraphing how to kill off a boss (this is actually a joke that Sandberg himself made in an earlier game, so I get he wants to do something different), but I had to look at one too many YouTube videos to figure out what the game was asking for. So, again, frustrating, just in a different way.\n\nThe story is also...not very good. It's interesting at first and sets up some cool concepts, but then it becomes buried under a bunch of jargon and a whole cast of annoying characters that I just didn't want to spend much more time with. The heroes are just really unlikable and they talk so damn much. There's no joy to them and the whole thing is just way too serious. I feel like Sandberg wanted to create an epic comic book series and then decided to transplant that storyline into the platform puzzle adventure game that he had just designed. The two things just don't work very well together (I'm not saying they *can't*, it just doesn't work here).\n\nI understand why someone would like this game, but its strengths just can't make up for its weaknesses - great art and cool music can't do enough heavy lifting to support boring puzzles, a lackluster story, and lame characters.

This pixel art is extremely beautiful and vibrant. Pixel art is timeless and will hold up practically forever. The characters have a nice attention to detail with the animations to their bodies.

All of the tracks fit the emotion in the scenes very well in my opinion.

But I had a hard time following certain parts of the story. Overall it was a good story though, which can be rare for metroidvania platformers.\n\nDifficulty was overall pretty low. Not really a complaint since I have a bad habit of putting hard games down and forgetting about them, but being too easy can be an issue for some people. No boss took me more than 2 tries on Normal difficulty and I never died in the overworld. Believe me I'm not trying to brag, I'm honestly pretty bad at 2D platformers even though I love them so much.\n\nPerformance was perfect. There were no graphics option beyond windowed sizes and full screen. Not that it really needs any options. Framerate was locked at 60 for my entire playthrough and it never slowed down or stuttered. \n\nHonestly I feel like Iconoclasts is very underrated.

Who is [i]He[/i]? Explain, game, explain, damn it! \n\nThere's a LOT of dialogues which is unfortunate, because writing is just obnoxious, it's pretentious and self-absorbing. And for some reason all the [i]good[/i]  characters are absolutely nuts, bonkers, insane, annoying, psychotic, and just unlikable and unrelatable, while the [i]bad[/i] guys are actually pretty okay. the problem is that you're going to observe \"good\" guys most of the time, and my god that time is gonna be miserable. \n\nAnyway, you partake on some jolly adventuring around pleasantly looking locations accompanied by cheerful music, all is fine until the game slowly but surely starts to spiral down into the vortex of despair and loathing.\n\nYou solve puzzles again and again, you engage in pretty dull combat from time to time, you walk, and you walk, and you walk, and talk, talk, talk some more, oh great, a boss battle. Boss fights are the only moments when you feel adequate in this game, except for puzzle bosses. Those just suck.

After what seemed to be a final boss encounter whose motivation and all-absorbing hatred was still unclear to me, the game decided that it wasn't done with me, and dragged on for, I don't know, an hour? maybe two?

The gameplay works, the characters are interesting and almost all of them are deeply flawed, and the world is charming and interesting and beautiful and so incredibly unique. But it pulls above the sum of its quite good parts with how you as the player can relate to the characters.\n\nI'm not good at 2D platformers but i played this game on \"Harder\" mode anyway and it was a consistent reasonable challenge that utilized your upgrades as you came across them; you have a gun to shoot things or to charge-shot-jump with, a wrench to smack things or interact with the environment for puzzle solving and mobility. Later this expands to grenades to move heavy objects, Electro-magnetism to power things for puzzles or stun enemies or glide on rails, a dodge roll, Electro-magnetic grenades, a \"Swap-Gun\", and a double jump, and it all *WORKS* perfectly reasonably puzzles are varied and only occasionally tedious combat is interesting and tests you on certain weapon gimmicks making it largely about \"Figuring things out\" and it just WORKS. Things in the end-game get much harder as they want you to utilize multiple things at once and its not always clear what problem-solvers are required from your tool-box but it is incredibly satisfying to figure it out the whole way through.\n\nAnd as for the Story; It's dense, it's complicated, it's confusing and it's seemingly poorly written in some places but never so much so as to draw you out of the experience. Rather the building confusing and increasing complication puts you and the player character in an incredibly similar position of being incredibly out-of-our depth but filled with incredible confidence in our ability to push forward and solve problems in the face of a world that, when you take the time to think about it, is trying its hardest to remind you that there are consequences for helping people. Even if I didn't relate so well to the main-character in an oddly-meta sort of way, the flawed-nature of the side characters is *GREAT* the heroes are idiots, narcissists, and assholes all and the villains can be well-meaning and sympathetic and endearing and the writing pulls far ahead of the standard it sets with regards to its character building. \n\nIf I had to call anything in this a \"flaw\" it would come down to the exploring, I could not 100% this game's collectibles blind, I felt like an idiot doing it but i looked up a guide at 72% and found an optional boss I missed, several dozen useless upgrades/upgrade materials (as I was done with my playthrough)  and THE DODGE ROLL, and the last of those things would have been incredibly useful in a number of boss fights throughout the 15 hours of my first playthrough. I am a moron however, so it's more than likely that this wont be as large of an issue for other people who will either find these things easier or simply not care to go looking in the first place.\n\nI recommend this game, if it's on sale you should buy it, if it's not you should consider buying it anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1549338401, "timestamp_updated": 1549338401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48762314": {"recommendationid": "48762314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029247561", "num_games_owned": 734, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1549320278}, "language": "english", "review": "Best metroidvania story i have ever seen.

The music gives me nostalgia for playing Super Nintendo in the 90s. It looked like the game had a cool over-arcing storyline. I was pumped.\n\nHowever, ultimately, after 6 hours of gameplay I had pause the game and had the realization that I was not enjoying playing the game. Why was this?\n\n1) The storyline, to me, was convoluted and confusing and just TOO DENSE. Eventually I found myself just hitting the start button in order to select \"skip\" because I didn't want to sit through all the text again. I also found that I had no clue what was going on. So many concepts within the story get thrown at you that I realized after a while I couldn't keep track of the story - and the bits I could I just...well...didnt' care about. \n\n1A) Tangentially related: there are a few instances where there's a dialogue scene right before a boss. If the boss kills you (and it probably will a few times) it doesn't restart you at the beginning of the boss fight. It restarts you at the beginning of the dialogue scene. I can't for the life of me understand why developers would make this decision. If I'm trying to progress through a frustrating boss, having to deal with that scene every time makes it just plain annoying.\n\n2) This is the big one: I felt consistently lost. I understand that part of the appeal (for some folks) of the Metroidvania genre is backtracking and things like that - you see an area you can't approach due to some limitation, you play the game and level up, then return to that area later with the ability to advance. But this didn't feel like that. Often times I'd wonder around forever, realize I'd covered what seemed to be the entirety of the map, and see the only clue I had was a vague sentence (yes. One sentence) in the pause menu that offered me no real information. The solution? Well, often times it meant areas I had already been to now had new editions that allowed me to advance - but I was never informed of them. Or maybe it was buried deep within that dialogue I started skipping over. I'm not sure.\n\nUltimately, I don't feel like Iconoclasts respects the players time. I realize that for some, the stuff I mentioned above won't bother them, but for me, it's too much.

The overall game play is a pretty standard affair, with basic platforming, light puzzle solving and some combat mixed in. Although the game does not do anything particularly unique, all of the game play elements feel great so it is a joy to play. \n\nAs you progress through the game, you will collect various resources that can be used craft and equip \"tweaks\". These tweaks provide small boosts to your character such as increased damage and increased movement speed. I do wish these tweaks provided more of a game play boost as I found I rarely changed the tweaks and for the most part didn't even care or notice what tweaks I had equipped. You will also obtain a few \"upgrades\" as you play through the story that will open up new paths to progress further.

Too easy perhaps, and the gameplay might not be fully satisfying. Do not expect a cool world to explore, but a nice platformer with some great moments along the way. \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Player-friendly in the good way.\n+ With one exception, the boss fights all provide lots of fun, and never feel the same. \n+ You have a checkpoint at the beginning of each boss fight so you can really focus on learning their patterns. \n+ Overall, everything is neat and precise. Fights are very enjoyable for this reason. \n+ Very good pixel graphics, with many different areas with their own atmosphere.\n+ The characters are very interesting, with their own personalities, and I really liked most of them. \n+ Just before the final boss you have a save point and a teleporter so you can freely explore the world if you still have treasures to dig out. \n+ The story is interesting and have a few very good, moving, and even epic moments. \n+ In Standard Difficulty, you can die, but when you feel that you sorely need a savepoint and fear to have to restart all over a lengthy sequence, most of the times the savepoint will be there. \n+ Puzzles are usually interesting to solve. \n+ You get three weapons and all three are useful.\n+ You have a skip button to skip the cutscenes introducing the bosses. I would have considered a sin otherwise, so it was a bit of a required Pro but a Pro nonetheless!\n+ Music is funky and very enthralling. \n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Too much slow-paced when you backtrack to find the remaining secrets.\n- The tweak system (slightly similar to Hollow Knight charms but broken) is utterly useless. Chests only provides bonuses related to this tweak system and so you are not incentivized to explore around.\n- With very few teleporting points, exploring past levels feel lengthy and laborious. \n- No real upgrades along the way.\n- The story, though interesting, is a complete mess. Good luck to follow everything and make sense of all its threads. \n- A few sequences are quite poor. Many puzzles are basket-ball based (you have to throw a bomb in some hole). There is a whole sequence with an alternative character where you just have to slug your way through a corridor for entire minutes. \n- You don't have any control on the story. You are most of the time an observer more than an actor of it. Many things happen without you having any grasp on it. \n- The sidequests are under-developed, and mostly feel like an overlooked addition. I think there are two of them in total, drawn in the midst of the main story. You fulfill them more by chance than by purpose. \n- Some story components remain entirely unexplained (even one involving a boss). \n- The progression percentage is completely meaningless (I think it refers to the number of chests you find and tweaks you craft). \n- There is one area with chests you cannot return to. If you missed chests there, you will never be able to reach 100% completion. \n- There is a very lame puzzle sequence where you have to fall and reach some lever in mid-fall. If you fail, you have to take a ladder and restart everything, since the whole area is reset each time you get out of it. I had to redo the thing like twenty or thirty times before succeeding. This is the sort of moments which makes the game tedious at times. \n- One area is elevator-based. You have to backtrack multiple times to align the elevators correctly... I think it is an example of very poor and infuriating level design. \n- The end boss comes out of nowhere and feels a bit out of place. I would have liked an explanation of any sort. It's not very satisfying that the story ends with a disturbing feeling of floating puzzlement.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nTo be honest, I was eager to finish the game because I grew tired of it before the end. And yet, I think it's impossible not to love it in some way. The main character is lovely, and most of her companions are too (even Royal). There are some great story moments, and yet the game is not a visual novel and some of these moments are completely intertwined within the game (as the Ivory remains room!!!) and are part of the gaming experience. However, I think that what makes the game shines are the boss fights. I used not to like boss fights because I find them too long or too difficult, but here they were a delight. Most were challenging and only a few felt too easy (but enjoyable nonetheless). The overall player-friendly attitude is most appreciated. Even though the exploration part is lacking, I think the game is still able to deliver an original, meaningful, and entertaining experience. \n\nI therefore recommend it warmly, unless you are expecting an exploration-based game. \n\n[h1]Additional remarks[/h1]\n\n[b]Tweak system[/b]\nLet's speak shortly about the tweak system. You can equip up to three tweaks (this number is fixed from the beginning of the game and will never increase) at savepoints. To get these tweaks, you need first to find their blueprint or something of the like, and second to craft them, using four kind of materials that you gather from the chests (the secrets of the game, usually hard to find, some of them involving a harder than usual puzzle, or just a more frustrating one). So far, I don't see any major flaw in this system.\n\nThe flaws are twofold. First, most of the tweaks are useless (for instance, breathing longer underwater. Maybe it's useful to find one super secret, but you can skip for the rest of the game) and they are redundant (I think I could equip my character with anything but these \"breathing longer\" tweaks). Since you can get only three of them, I wonder why such useless tweaks exist at all. Second, you loose these tweaks as you are sustaining damage (one tweak per two damage). You can refill them by killing enemies or destroying statues (a bit weird, I know). But it means that, during your adventure, you will spend most of the time without any active tweaks. \n\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nBy exploring the world, you get the crafting materials required for the tweaks. It means you can already forget about it as it won't bring you anything useful. I would have liked much better to find additional pieces of lore, story bits, or character backgrounds info. I think, had it been the case, I would have dig out ALL of these chests. But as it is, I stopped bothering finding them at some point unless they were obviously on my path. \n\nIn some games, I find the secrets only for the sake of 100% completion (SteamWorld Dig 2 being the last example; artifacts are useless there). But here, the other problem is that exploring back the world is boring. Many secret areas are very hard to notice and you will have to go through every room multiple times to find them all. Plus, there are not very many shortcuts unfolding as you progress, which means you will have to redo the same sequences over and over. Given the slow-pace of the character movements, which is fine when you just follow the main game, this gets boring pretty quickly.\n\nIn the end, although I liked the world, the funky atmosphere, the character, the controls, the fighting, the platforming, exploring felt completely devoid of interest, and it contributes to my growing dislike of the game. Fortunately I gave up exploring and focused on the main story, and all was fine again.

It was entertaining for the first 2-3 hours, and you can tell a lot of love went into this game, but it\u00b4s just too flawed to recommend, and I really hate having to say that. Quick breakdown:\n\n- Graphics are nice, cute and vibrant, rather well animated. Nothing groundbreaking, but they do the job and some of the character design are cool.\n\n-Sound is rather good too, the music is cool and the sound effects are Ok.\n\n-The controls are responsive enough, and controlling the characters is easy.\n\nNow, if I find the sound, graphics and controls acceptable, why can\u00b4t I recommend the game?  Well, to put it simply, the controls are OK, but what you have to do with them isn\u00b4t. It\u00b4s boring and derivative, the side missions are just fetch quests \n\nMain Quest: Hope you like searching for keys, \u00b4cause boy are you gonna do it in this game! The levels are OK but they completely overstay their welcome in the most obnoxious way possible. Quick example: There\u00b4s a level where you go around a tower searching for keys and ways to unlock elevators to be able to get to the end, fighting the same \"boss\" multiple times in the process. When you think you\u00b4re finally out? Nope, for some reason the ventilation shaft you\u00b4re trying to use to get out requires 3 keys to open, so you have to backtrack to find 3 more keys before you can proceed. This is unnecessary padding, pure and simple.\nAbilities are meh, just diferent ways to activate switches and open doors (By proximity, by charging a box and leaving it close to the switch, by charging  yourself and generating sparks next to a switch, by charging yourself and throwing a charged bomb near the switch...yawn). None of them add to the gameplay besides their door opening/switch enabling characteristics, and each is used so much it stops being fun. Pulling a lever is not a challenge, nor is it particularly compelling gameplay. \nSome puzzles are actually rather interestings...the first time through. There\u00b4s only so many times you can move boxes by throwing bombs close to them before it becomes a chore. \nThe space between missions is filled with busy work...For example, after a certain point you\u00b4re in point A, you can\u00b4t proceed so you\u00b4re tasked with finding character X, who should be near a settlement B (previously visited area). You go to B, an NPC in a random house tells you \"Oh no, he was here but he went to C (Other previously visited area)\", you cross the entire area and the next one going west to find him in C, where he tells you to meet him in D (ANOTHER previously visited area). ALL of this without any new challenges, new ways to explore or stuff to find. HELL, as the areas are already explored most puzzles and pathways are already clear, you\u00b4re just walking through. Once you get to D, you have a small \"boss fight\" (More of a puzzle, really, and an easy one) and then it\u00b4s time to go back to A, to advance the story. Did any of this sound fun? No?

You get Quest A, bring letter from X to Y, bring second letter from X, and then the reply from X to Y. In the example given both characters are in cities without even anything dangerous close by, you just talk to X, go to teleporter, talk to Y, go back, etc. but there\u00b4s other sidequests that require you to do something very similar, just during the middle of an area.\n\nIt\u00b4s a shame, because the characters, flawed as they are, are endearing, and the story is rather interesting, but after 8 or so hours of gamepaly I realized I had been bored for the last 3 or so.

You run, shoot, platform, and wrench bolts. You can also have up to three \"Tweaks\" on your character, which confer various active or passive abilties. That brings me to my first problem with this game. The idea of crafting equippable bonuses for your character is fine, but your Tweak slots break when you take enough damage. They can be fixed by collecting these shards from enemies and background objects, but this still renders your character customization useless half the time. Furthermore, almost all of this game's optional exploration is focused on collecting materials for crafting more Tweaks. There's no upgrades for your health cap, and all the weapon upgrades are acquired at specific points in the story.\n\nSpeaking of the story, Iconoclasts tells the tale of a young mechanic named Robin. Ever the idealist, Robin uses her abilities to help her community. This brings her into conflict with the One Concern, a seemingly omnipresent theocracy that forces people into specific roles and oppresses anyone who isn't on their nice list. Some people get hurt, some slapfights ensue, and Robin soon finds herself going up against them. That's the premise, anyway. Not all is as it seems, and this story is filled with curveballs.\n\nI won't give anything away. I do think the story is fine for the most part. There's plenty of moments that were genuinely upsetting or even heartrending. The villainous characters turn out to be surprisingly likeable and even a bit sympathetic despite their actions. The very end (as in, the last five minutes) is what bugs me. Without giving anything away, it ruined much of the built-up tension of the situation. It was just so bizarre and out of left-field that I can't really look at the rest of the game the same way. It's like the Dog Ending from Silent Hill 2.\n\nAnyway, I think I consider the strongest aspect of this game to be the boss battles. They're varied enough that I almost always got excited whenever one began. They almost all play well, and almost all your failures actually feel like your own. A couple fights against a major antagonist towards the end, in particular, are just incredibly emotionally-charged and unforgettable. Luckily, there's a Boss Rush available after you beat the game.\n\nPros:\n- Solid platforming and combat\n- Great boss battles\n- Solid story and characters, for the most part\n\nCons:\n- Weak Metroidvania elements\n- The ending\n\nVerdict: I had fun with this game, and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a short, sweet action-platformer or just a good story. Sadly, I feel that the individual parts of the game are greater than the whole, if that makes sense. Iconoclasts has plenty of great pieces. It just doesn't put them together the way I wanted it to.

You only need to look at a random gameplay video or trailer while keeping in mind that what you see - the levels, the character designs, the story, the music, the coding - was made by one person, Joachim Sandberg, to realize how big of an accomplishment this is.\n\nHowever. What I want to do is judge the game on its own merits, and not on external factors, no matter how impressive I might find them. I realize I might end up talking about the things I disliked more than the things I liked, so I'll be clear on this: despite its flaws, I enjoyed Iconoclasts. It's a solid game and it's worth playing. It\u2019s just not the best game I played this year.\n\nFirst of all: Iconoclasts might look like a metroidvania at first, but it's not. There's not much in the way of exploration and, even if you do unlock powerups that let you access new areas, the plot is going to lead you on a very linear path. There\u2019s some platforming, but it\u2019s rather sparse and not the focus of the game: that role is reserved for puzzles and combat.\n\nThe puzzles are relatively simple, with some exceptions. One thing about them that left me a bit iffy is that I was able to \"solve\" some of them in ways that I'm not 100% sure were intended: one of the puzzles towards the end of the game can be completely bypassed by clever use of the pink boxes in the room and the swap gun. Much in the same way, it happened a couple times in my playthrough that some obstacles that clearly required more brainpower than I had available at the moment could be surpassed by simply diving headfirst into them and using those few seconds of invincibility to reach the otherwise inaccessible area.\n\nBut Robin's wrench and stun gun are not going to be used only for puzzle-solving; there's a fair deal of combat in Iconoclasts, too. Generic enemies are varied enough, both design and mechanically wise: simply whacking or shooting an enemy often won't be enough to dissuade them from standing in your way. At the same time, though, I wouldn't say combat is one of the game's selling points; while it does its job decently enough, this is no Hollow Knight or Hyper Light Drifter. The same applies to bosses. Most of them have the tendency to feel a bit - for lack of a better word - gimmicky; there's a lot of \"do this thing x times and you win\", paired with relatively simple attack patterns, so some fights boil down to waiting until the stars align and you can mess their day real bad. It doesn't help that some bossfights require you to use Mina, a different character; this would be a good idea in theory, but Mina's shotgun is much clunkier than Robin's stun gun and it makes for some annoying gameplay moments.\n\nI was also disappointed by the tweak system and, in conjunction with that, by the various treasure spread around the levels. The loot will always boil down to one out of four upgrade materials and, combined with the fact that upgrades for Robin don't feel like they matter much, you never really get a sense of wonder and excitement when you see a new chest; you more or less already know what's in there, and that it won't be impressive.\n\nAs far as the story goes, Iconoclasts is similar to Cave Story in vibe: both games start colorful and wacky and have cute characters but it doesn't take long before you come to the realization that the story is, in fact, pretty damn dark. However, while there are obvious differences in terms of plot, I think Cave Story executes his way better. While it starts off good, Iconoclasts seems to quickly develop a taste for the melodramatic, like it mistakes making everything and everyone as miserable as it could possibly be for how mature narration should look like. There's a ton of gruesome deaths and ugly, sad backstories or destinies for many of the side characters, and as a result it all ends up drowned in the tides of misery. When everything is a tragedy, nothing is.\n\n(also, why does no one give a shit about the blue goo that takes over lifeforms and is literally everywhere? Not even a passing remark? A \"hey what's this thing that looks like some elder god is corrupting our land and why is it here and how do we get rid of it?\" No?)\n\nThe message about blind belief isn't exactly subtle either - City One's \"pearly gates\" are guarded by an old, bearded gatekeeper named Pete that decides who is deserving of entry, in case you're still unsure about what specifically the cult of Mother is a reference to - but I'd be lying if I said I cared much for it, and not due to personal beliefs. I'm not a religious person myself, but what Iconoclasts seems to try to say about the matter sounds an awful lot like a well-worded \"believing in imaginary friends is bad don't do it\" which I feel is too simple of an outlook on the theme of belief. But perhaps I'm wrong and I completely misunderstood what Joachim Sandberg was trying to say. Might very well be.\n\nThe ending is also very weird, and I'll leave it at that.\n\nBut despite all this, Iconoclasts is certainly not a game without its charms; the general design is very good, as well as animation quality; the gameplay, while it might not be a shining beacon, is still solid and varied enough to keep you entertained; the music is also pretty good and, while I might not be the biggest fan of the game's story, I still was interested in seeing where it would go.

None of those name-drops are meant to be uncomplimentary, and they aren't! \n\nLook, this is a labour of love from one fellow - a, Joakim Sandberg - and what a love of labour he has. His inspirations are clear and evident, and his own personal touch shows through in almost every detail. And there are SO many details! Every biome is vibrant, and the enemy designs are - for the most part - inspired.\n\nThis is a typical core platformer in the \"new\" retro style, which means it needs a gimmick to keep its head above water. The gimmick here is the 'Wrench' that our hero wields, and the varied abilities that come with it. You can twist nuts to open doors and move platforms, bash enemies, scoot along ziplines and electrocute power-reliant puzzles.\n\nThe combat feels like Metal Slug \"Lite\". The hammering of your basic gun or the explosive power of your secondary are impactful and satisfying. Yet there are more elements at play here...\n\nAnd it's... pretty fucking fun!\n\nThe story is, fantastic? I think. It bobs and weaves around it's core themes in a way that ISN'T bad, just difficult to follow. I found myself romanticized by the idea of a TECHNOLOGICALLY - ADVANCED world utterly inhibited - and yet, sustained by - it's RELIGION. It's a cool play on those themes, and I love the world Mr Sandberg has built. It's pixel art design belies a darker story that isn't ashamed of shying away from some pretty violent and dramatic moments. Some scenes really caught me by surprise; the nuance of storytelling in a game like this was unexpected and WELCOME. I'd put it on par with Cave Story, with a Tarantino skew.\n\nI can't talk about the story without commenting on the characters though, and they're great. Bloody great, actually. Although there are a bevy of names to learn, and some will fall to the wayside... the core 8-10 that make up the core story are worth their weight in biscuits.

The finale is satisfying, but I can't take back that hour.\n\nThese are quibbles in the face of the FULL, UNABASTED CREDIT that Joakim Sandberg deserves.

[/h1]\n\nIconoclasts is an incredibly underappreciated game. While I personally wouldn\u2019t call it a masterpiece, I do believe others probably would. I'm going to break this review into a few different segments, so that I can write about what I did like, and what I didn\u2019t, both so that the reader can find the parts that they care about, and so that I can try to properly parse my feeling for this game, as i'm still trying to decide on how I feel.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\n\tThis game is gorgeous. Just incredibly pretty. The character designs, while somewhat off-putting in the trailer, look wonderful in the 2D pixel art of the game. The background, enemies, npc\u2019s, animations, everything, all of it just looks so good. Two thumbs way up.\n\n\tHaving said that, I am a massive sucker 2D pixel art games, and am therefore pretty biased, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\n[h1] Music & Sound [/h1]\n\n\tThe music is fairly good. None of the tracks stand out to me as incredible, but all of them seem well composed, thematically appropriate for the places where they play, and overall add to the quality of the game, but not in a huge way.\n\nThe sound on the other hand is great! I... don\u2019t really know anything about how sound effects are produced or chosen, but clearly developer Joakim Sandberg has a real talent for it. Unfortunately, the quality of the sound effects isn\u2019t something that will cause games to fly off digital shelves, but if it was, then this game would be a bestseller.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\n\tThe gameplay of Iconoclasts is probably where the game shines the brightest, though like with the point I made about graphics, I am a huge fan of metroidvania games, so keep that in mind.\n\n\tNow, while it [i] is [/i] a metroidvania, It doesn't really have very much backtracking to find collectibles or anything. There is [i] some [/i] of that, but it is very much optional, and even if you do backtrack, there isn't a great deal of collectibles to find anyway, and the rewards for doing so aren\u2019t that great anyway. For some people, this is a plus, but I am the type of person who LOVES backtracking, so this was actually a negative for me.\n\n\tHaving said that, the gameplay is still fantastic, if somewhat basic. You have a gun with infinite ammo that shoots low damage bullets, but shoots them almost as fast as you can press the button, as well as a few other modes for the gun that change the type of bullets you use. You also have a wrench that you can swing at enemies, though I personally used the gun for combat way more often. The wrench can also be used to grab and turn bolts in the environment, that then open doors or allow you swing off of them, spin gears to make platforms move, as well as do a few other things after you upgrade it during certain story segments. As I said, fairly basic.\n\n\tThe basic-ness of the gameplay, however, becomes a huge advantage to the game, because of the spectacular level design. Almost every single room or screen in this game seems to have been painstakingly crafted to feel like either a breeze to get through or a fairly hard challenge, causing you to feel a sense of accomplishment whenever you finally make that jump accros the thorns that you failed at seven times, or finally kill the last enemy in a room that you've died in twice. Additionally, while you probably will die a few times, the level of difficulty is very fair, even at the higher levels, so with the possible exception of one specific segment just before the final boss, you never feel like smashing your keyboard or throwing your controller. (though keep in mind the gameplay seem much more fun with a controller, I switched to a controller fairly early on in the game and never looked back)\n\n[h1] Story and Characters [/h1]\n\n\tAnd now we get to the interesting part (and the part that is going to be a [u] massive wall of text [/u], because I can\u2019t figure out where to put a paragraph break in here). Normally, I would make these two seperate sections, but I feel I need to talk about them together in order to talk about them properly. Firstly, the characters are phenomenally well written, in the sense that the feel like actual real people, with realistic personalities, realistic motivations, and most importantly, realistic flaws and interpersonal relationships. When something bad happens in the story, the character react in ways that a lot of other, less well-written, video game characters just don\u2019t; they collapse and cry, they scream, they mull over the bad thing, they come to the wrong conclusion, they lash out at those trying to help them, they grow as a character, but then like some real people do, regress that growth, possibly becoming worse. Additionally some of the characters seem to have flaws indicative of possible mental illness, or other things that people in our real world would probably go to therapy for, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be therapists in this world. So the traumas and hang-ups these characters have have time to grow and fester, and by the end of the game (Significant spoilers)  [spoiler] when the world is literally ending, or at least on the cusp of ending, the characters are, for the most part, only able to think about themselves, and what they want, or what they think should happen. [/spoiler] This game is dark, very dark, but it is a nuanced darkness, that exists not for the sake of being dark, but because it is grounded in reality, albeit with a large helping of sci-fi and fantasy baked in. The game even has some fairly funny moments in it, showing that even when bad things are happening all the time, funny things can still happen, just not often.\n\n\tNow having said all that, there is one thing I should mention. I am personally very much biased when writing this review, though not in the way you might think. I understand this viewpoint is fairly uncommon, and a LOT of people disagree with it, perhaps rightly so, but in my opinion a story, no matter how well crafted can be almost completely ruined by its ending. I also think that the opposite is true, that a bad story can be saved by its ending, though I don't think that happens very often, and it also doesn't apply here. The reason I say this is that I didn\u2019t like the ending of Iconoclasts. At all. I personally thought is was fairly rushed, left a huge amount of loose threads, kinda felt like it lost its narrative thread, and was overall just... bad. And because of my previously mentioned viewpoint, I came off of Iconoclasts sad, almost [i] bitter. [/i] [u] BUT [/u] because I know this about myself, I know I should look past this personal hang up when trying to review a game; I know I should try to be more objective. And looking at this game\u2019s ending through a more objective lense, I think it's the kind of ending that would appeal to a lot of people, and is probably, objectively, good. And so that, in addition to all the other positives I mentioned above, is why I still recommend this game, even though I personally didn\u2019t like it.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\t\n\tSo that is my review of Iconoclasts. An incredibly fun-to-play game, that has a very dark narrative, with an ending that I personally don\u2019t much like but I still feel is probably, objectively, good. I also love reading all of the discussions about the ending.

The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I\u2019ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn\u2019t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren\u2019t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the \u201clight Metroidvania\u201d aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it\u2019s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it\u2019s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn\u2019t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn\u2019t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn\u2019t skip it, it\u2019s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn\u2019t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don\u2019t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can\u2019t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]", "timestamp_created": 1545650634, "timestamp_updated": 1545650644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813566923141479492", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47771694": {"recommendationid": "47771694", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995565890", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1086, "last_played": 1562044649}, "language": "english", "review": "On the surface, this game looks like another cutsie metroidvania game, but lying below that pretty surface is a dark story on a strange alien world which is very well written and presented.

Best played with a controller. \n\nBut it's not without its flaws...\n\nSTORY: \nThe story is the main problem I had. There was a lot of unnecessary dialogue. A lot. I say unnecessary because dialogue is supposed to flesh out the characters and the world. There is a lot of talk about Him, Mother, penance and ivory (the lifeblood of the planet), and that's about it. \nThe best part of the story was the optional, secret sidequest; Fitzroy. That sidequest was far better then the entire main story. I enjoyed his sidestory (although an unnecessary pain to find), his character design, and his battle a lot. It should have been easier to find so more could enjoy it, or put into the main story. I actually started to feel something but it was all over before I even had the chance to.\nSome things were left unanswered (like Royal) and I feel a bit let down with the pacing. The focus was too much on what didn't matter in the end.\nThe best parts were the Mendeleev boss and the rocket battle. The final boss doesn't even come anywhere near as epic as those. The final boss' final form was very random and felt out of place. The starworm was all that was needed. I suppose with the existence of the final form, the possibilities leave it open for a sequel should one be made. \n\nCHARACTERS: \nI felt nothing for the characters. Zero. Except for Elro, which was a lot of hate. He has to the most useless character I've experienced in a long while. I found myself hating him very early on in the game and even wishing death upon him come a certain point. A useless, annoying, whingy coward, and when you finally get to control him, the dude with the sword, he's so slow, and again, useless. \nThe main character Robin, with whom you're supposed to sympathise, is the generic silent-type who contributes nothing to the story. She just nods. The other characters like Mina and Royal are pretty cool, but could have been fleshed out a lot more than they were. They were the most fleshed out though, which isn't saying much. \nCome the 10-hour mark I was saying \"Shut the f*** up\" to my screen as I had stopped caring for the characters. I just wanted to see where the plot was going at its snail-pace. \n\nCHARACTER DESIGN: \nAll the sprites are very, very well and smoothly animated. The character designs are unique and original. \nThe only problem I had was, again, with Elro. If you're going to design a character who isn't symmetrical, animate both sides instead of just flipping the image. His eyepatch and which way his hair is combed changes sides depending on which way he's facing. That and something happens to him later on (no spoilers) which proves my point even more. I see this a lot with pixel art and it annoys me very much.\nSome of the coolest character designs aren't in the story for long, like Mendeleev, Grey, Fitzroy, and even some NPCs look cooler than some of the main cast. \n\nLEVEL DESIGN: \nThe only level design I didn't like was under Mina's home. I got tired of looking at its plain-ness. All other levels though look stunning. They're colourful, well designed and laid out, enemy placement is great, hidden areas like a Metroidvania game should. Even the tweak that tells you if there's any hidden areas on-screen doesn't help with 100% of them, encouraging exploration. \nThe puzzles though left something to be desired. Too easy. The tougher puzzles were optional but needed doing if going for 100% of the chests.\n\nMUSIC:\nThe music is mostly great. The boss themes are rockin' and fast, the green, grassy areas are upbeat and make you feel happy to be alive, the desert music feels nostalgic for some reason, but some do get repetitive. Like under Mina's home. It ended up being muted while I looked for hidden chests. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe controls are flawless. Robin handles flawlessly. Zero lag. Combat is always fresh. \nMy only gripe is about high-jumping. \nI kept thinking throughout the game \"Oh, I can't jump up there. There must be a double-jump or a high-jump power-up later\" but then I could get up there by jumping and then firing my powered-up shot downward, propelling me upward. \nYou get the double-jump too late in the game, and it's optional. You get it AFTER defeating a secret boss, which is only available just before the FINAL boss. The main story can be completed, the other secret boss, Fitzroy, can be defeated, and 100% of the chests can be found without it. It's pointless. This should be a standard power-up in the main story which then allows access to previously inaccessible areas. When I learned I could just shoot myself upward, I completely forgot about the thought of a double-jump or high-jump. When I eventually got it (unexpectedly, and 15 hours in of the 17 it took me to finish 100%), I never even used it. \n\nTHINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDED TO AN UPDATE OR FUTURE TITLE(S): \n- Custom map markers. Axiom Verge (another Metroidvania-type game) allows 2 per map. Still, that's not enough for maps of this size. I ended up screenshotting the maps, pasting them into MS Paint and circling areas so I would remember to come back later. I forgot to screenshot 1 place and never got to go back. Even though I have 100% completed the game, it's an unexplored area. I have no memory of where it is. I can't find it again. \n- More power-ups, or get them sooner. Gameplay became repetitive and stagnant between them. \n\nOVERALL:\nAll in all, props to the creator. The credits were very short so I assume he made this by himself, and in Construct 2 no less. Very good job. I envy your talent. Take the negative things I've said here, put them on a scale and weigh them against everything positive about the game, and the positive wins.\nI would gladly pay for and play a sequel, IF the story is paced better and the dialogue is more focused on what's relevant and what matters. I see no issues with the RRP.

It is dark with a fair share of eldritch horror and lots of deaths (you heard correctly, this is not safe for children). It's also smart that a lot of character and world development occur during gameplay, either in the form of a boss fight or otherwise, since it's easy to make a dark setting but hard to make people care-and Iconoclasts most definitely made me care about its world. It also has one of the most exciting and crazy epilogues I've ever seen in a video game. My biggest complaint about the story is the dissonance between narrative and gameplay, as narratively speaking the bosses in the game are so powerful that you have no business standing a chance against them.\n\nGameplay-wise, Iconoclasts doesn't evolve over time as much as other metroidvania titles, since you don't get many new abilities. The crafting system also isn't very interesting, as you can only get passive stat upgrades-and niche stats too, even though the majority of the puzzle and combat in the game involves shooting, there is no upgrade available for your gun.\nThe gameplay shines during boss fights, which are quite frequent: around 20 over a 15 hour story. While their designs range from good to amazing, the way you beat them usually isn't very interesting (namely, by shooting them repeatedly, or by waiting for the weak point to come out and then shooting it repeatedly).\n\nOverall, I would without a doubt recommend this game for its story.

When this came out at the beginning of this year, I had a  strong feeling that this was almost a harbinger of good, quality games. Well, it's almost December now, and boy oh boy was I on the mark. But enough of that, about the game.\n\nThis game is phenominal! The controls are tight and Joakim again shows his understanding of excellent controls for a fast and fluid game. New skills are quick to learn, but tough to master! And there are some clever uses of the protagonists main weapon. It is very much styled to play like a polished smooth metroidvania (do people still use that term?).\n\nThe graphics are in the same beautiful pixel art that one would expect from his previous work. What makes this game particularly more impressive than previous titles in his collection is not just the wonderful full artwork/animation but the larger, more expansive scale of the game's world which requires more artwork. Not only that, but the more mature theme and design gives for more expressive sprite work that really shines end-game.\n\nIf you have read any of my reviews before, you know how much I like to gush about multi-faceted plots and stories that make you think.

When her transgressions place her in the sights of One Concern's agents, she graduates from fixing old machines to trying to fix the world and society she inhabits.\n\nBetween story beats, you'll run and jump through pixel-art environments that are popping with color, using your wrench and your wits to bypass many small puzzles. Though these puzzles are rarely ever very challenging, they all feel impeccably designed, with just enough trickery to make them satisfying to solve. There are plenty of fodder enemies around too, but many of them are small puzzles as well, requiring you to figure out the right trick to bypassing them. However, Iconoclasts' real showstoppers are the bosses. The game has plenty of boss fights, most of them large, elaborate affairs with giant machines or grotesque monsters. But while the bosses are the highlights, every aspect of the gameplay feels exceptionally polished, thanks in part to great controls that feel responsive and even tactile, like the pleasant repetition of working Robin's wrench to open up a door or swing off a grapple point.\n\nIt is when the game returns to the story, though, that Iconoclasts really shines. Robin meets a colorful cast of friends and enemies who all have immediately compelling personalities. There's Mina, a pirate whose rebellious impulses are slowly alienating her from her loved ones. Elro, Robin's protective older brother who fears Robin will fall into the same pitfalls he stumbled into. Royal, a priviledged and sheltered elite who comes face to face with his own inadequacies. Even the villains are sympathetic and layered. All of them tie together into the game's core themes about how rebellion changes, harms, and even destroys those trying to effect change, and it's that thematic cohesion that really lets Iconoclasts' story shine.\n\nIn summary, Iconoclasts combines slick, polished, and varied gameplay with a powerful narrative bursting with wonderful characters and excellent writing.

At first the game was fine, and just fine, but the more I played, the more I disliked it. \n\nThe gameplay is mediocre, enemies all have simple AND similar mechanics. In a fun bossfight, you would have to figure out the bosses' patterns and movements, but in Iconoclasts, boss fights are just another puzzle to figure out. None of the gameplay is really engaging, as your starter shot locks on, your groundpound also locks on, there's really no skill involved to play this game. The puzzles in this game were so frustrating; either they were super easy or super tedious (eg. the tower level). Those tedious levels made me lose my patience for the game, so at most parts I just ended up looking up a walkthrough (which I usually don't do unlesss I'm really stuck and tried everything I could do). Also, for being marketed as a metroidvania, the gameplay and area discovery is very much linear.\n\nThe storyline is boring, I am usually very invested in story rich games, but this one was just uninteresting and confusing. The story itself is all over the place, and tries too hard to be \"deep\" and different. Being a good artist does not make you a good writer, I understand that it takes time and effort to make a game like this by yourself, but it still does not excuse bad and boring writing.\n\nMany elements of the game are also missing. For maps, you can only see the map for the area you're in, as there is no single world map you are able to see. Side quests are terribly designed, once you leave the person that gives you the side quest, you're not able to check the item/quest in your inventory for what you need to do again (you had to go back to the person to check what you need to do), so sidequests were basically forgotten through my playthrough.\n\nOverall: This game has been mis-marketed as a metroidvania, but is actually just a long ass puzzle game with confusing writing and nice visuals.", "timestamp_created": 1541130318, "timestamp_updated": 1551265540, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385314047336578369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45537173": {"recommendationid": "45537173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817597644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 617, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1539009623}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts is a Metroidvania 2D action adventure game created by Joakim Sandberg, a Swedish game developer who is famous for his Noitu Love series. This game has been in development for 8 years - since 2010. You may have noticed that Iconoclasts is inspired by the developer's previous game, Ivory Springs (2007). This means that the developer has been working on this title for a very long time. So the more you play this game, the more you'll be impressed by the developer's amazing work!\n\nThe world of Iconoclasts is dominated by a gigantic & wicked religious group called 'The One Concern' who worship space worms. Furthermore, they monopolize 'Ivory Fuel', a divine substance that is the source of the world and the power source of all living things. In this rough world, you play as Robin. She is an innocent girl who helps people as an unauthorized mechanic. But don't you worry. She has stun guns & wrenches as her trusty weapons. These weapons allow the player to solve various problems in the beautiful & cruel world of Iconoclasts.\n\nIn this game, players will encounter many puzzles that they'll have to solve by using their wrenches & stun guns. But the puzzles you will face never get tiresome. The more you play this game, the more you'll become immersed. This means that the puzzles of Iconoclasts are well designed. In addition, since combat and puzzles are not played separately, users will have a fresh experience throughout the game. Especially if you use the 'Tweak' system properly, your Robin will become even more special. The boss battles are also one of the most enjoyable aspects of this game. There are various methods needed to defeat each boss and with every win, you'll have a huge sense of accomplishment.\n\nIconoclasts has another charm you should not miss - the story & characters of the game. Aside from the puzzles and adventures, you will encounter various unique people on your journey. There are characters who are helping each other through all their suffering and characters who give up because of the frustrations of the world. By interacting with these people, you'll become more and more immersed in this game. Eventually you'll grow to understand this world and love the game.\n\nIf you want engaging storytelling, novel puzzles, and a Metroidvania-style action adventure game along with challenging boss battles, Iconoclast will definitely be a game worth playing. You don't want to miss the beautiful pixel art & exciting music. There are so many things to love that I may not have even found them all. I strongly recommend Iconoclasts!\n\n[Steam] Nayanco Curator \u30fd(=^\uff65\u03c9\uff65^=)\u4e3f\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/33855818", "timestamp_created": 1540985135, "timestamp_updated": 1691216113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574707567691802979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45527338": {"recommendationid": "45527338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099976847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1375, "last_played": 1666829893}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I've ever seen or played.

Chances are pretty high actually. Most people enjoy it. I did not. Just do not have the wrong expectations!\n\nIconoclasts IS NOT A METROIDVANIA. This game is a story-heavy puzzle-platformer and all the gimmicks, puzzles and bossfights seem to be hit-or-miss, really.\n\nWhile most parts of Iconoclasts gameplay seem to be aimed at children, it's storyline is not. The story is getting pretty dark, pretty quickly and I really enjoyed it. There's some kind of Anime-vibe to it. One moment, everyone is joking around, next moment, shit is hitting the fan, arms are being ripped off and people explode. Iconoclast is really getting carried by it's bad guys. They are all awesome! But the german translation however, is not. If I had known how garbage it would be, I would have played it in english but what's done is done.\n\nOne example: A guy called Ash says: \"Du hast mich weggegeben.\" What he probably said in english was: \"You gave me away.\" So, he meant, his physical position was given away. But in german he pretty much says: \"You gave me to somebody else.\" So, yeah, screw that. So many literal translations in the german version it's not even funny. It makes you think, you are reading an instruction manual instead of other peoples conversations.\n\nLike I said before, the level- and puzzledesign can only be described as hit or miss. The level I enjoyed the most is called \"The Tower.\" The only metroidvania-ish part of the game. What happens is, you lose your weapons and powerups and have to get them back, in a magical-tower-like environment. You need to understand how all the rooms are connected and drawing a map of the place in your mind also really helps. That was great! By far, the best part of the game.\n\nIconoclasts bosses are pretty good most of the time but only when the bossfights aren't puzzles with a healthbar. That happens way too often. Like, you know, the worst bosses in the Zelda-franchise also are more of a puzzle than an actual fight. \"Use the item you found in this dungeon, to defeat the boss!\" Would be pretty cool, if I hadn't used this item a million times before! In shitty, way too easy puzzles! And there are so many shitty puzzles. I only enjoyed maybe 20-30% of them.\n\nAlso playing on hard did not really spice the game up, either. The only times the difficulty gave me trouble, were in a few really cryptic boss-fights. I would have had trouble on any difficulty when I just did not understand what the game expects me to do. And that is exactly, what the game was going for in these fights! Make them like a puzzle, this is gonna be good. It might be good if you are a certain kind of player. I just dindn't really enjoy it. And uhm... why does Iconoclasts ask me to lower the difficulty every time I am reloading my save!? That doesn't make any sense at all!", "timestamp_created": 1540284959, "timestamp_updated": 1540473226, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57368934154510498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45389557": {"recommendationid": "45389557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275960613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3291, "last_played": 1632176936}, "language": "english", "review": "I have mixed feelings about Iconoclasts. I picked it up after watching a positive review where the combination of a plot about a young woman fighting against an auhtoritarian suystem and the bright, colorful presentation piqued my interest. I basically came into this expecting a fun adventure with some dark elements, which was not quite what i got. It's not really the fault of the game, but it affected my experience regardless.\n\nI'm not much a gameplay guru, so I can't go into any depth about the gameplay. It was fun. There were some points that required some pretty precise timing that gave me some grief, and there were points where it took me way too long to figure out what i was supposed to be doing. Other than that, playing the game is fun. I kinda wish the 3rd weapon had been introduced earlier, since it's by far the most interesting one and opens up some neat opportunities for puzzle design, but that's a small thing.\n\nReally the thing that killed this one for me is the story. It starts out fun enough, when some wacky supersoldiers show up to your house to execute you for working as a mechanic illegally but get distracted and allow you escape, and continues even more fun when the same wacky supersoldiers catch you hiding in your brother's house and proceed to murder his entire family. And that's only the start!\n\nDark plots are fine, really, but after several hours of everything being terrible and every person you encounter being either an asshole or on the fast road to murdertown, and sometimes both, it started to get a little hard to care about anything in the game. It doesn't help that the game is fairly long by indie rpg standards, so the journey to shitville feels like it's dragging on forever. I still haven't beat the final boss, and probably never will, because i just don't care enough about the world to drag myself through that whole pain in the ass fight to save it. The sheer level of cynicism emanating from this game is honestly mystifying, especially when paired with its presentation.\n\nSaid presentation is the high point of the game. The 8-bit graphics are beautiful, the animations are lively, the music is fun. While regular enemies are good to fight, it's the massive bosses with their threatening presence and over-the-top attacks that steal the show. They just feel like a massive threat and beating them feels like an accomplishment. Similarly, while most of the characters were, to me at least, completely unlikable,the way they're drawn and animated makes it hard not to be endeared by them at least a little. Even when half the lines they spout read like they came out of google translate.\n\nThe dialogue was the real low point of the game for me, even more than the hilariously bleak storyline. There's grammatical errors, confusing turns of phrase, thesaurus words showing up next to casual speech with no rhyme or reason. All the times i had to stop and reread a sentence to try and figure out what it was supposed to mean, or found myself mentally rewriting a line to sound more natural, added up until what is normally the part of a game I'm most excited about turned into a chore. And it's a real shame, because there's plenty of little jokes and personality-revealing lines that might've been great if translated by someone who can fluently speak the language.\n\nI realise I've been going on about the flaws of this game more than its good points, and that's because I'm disappointed. I wanted to have fun playing this game, but all these little things gradually chipped away at my enjoyment until i just didn't care anymore. It's far too well made to give it a negative vote, and it's very likely that someone who's not as sensitive to these things as I am will have a great time playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1540206902, "timestamp_updated": 1540206902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45383774": {"recommendationid": "45383774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086128250", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1616650054}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a wonderful little metroidvania game that blends great platforming with combat mechanics, and some wonderful puzzles thrown around in there aswell.

Both the story and the gameplay are top-notch. Still, there were a few weaknesses in the story and the gameplay that stop the game from being AMAZING.\n\nLet's start with gameplay. It should be pointed out that most of the gameplay requires either platforming or solving puzzles. There's not that much \"combat\". Let's be clear, your character can attack. There's a melee attack and 3 different ranged attacks. However, the attacks are honestly just a \"tool\" for you to solve puzzles.\n\t\u2022 Melee attack: You will mostly use this to solve puzzles. You can also \"parry\" attacks of certain enemies of bosses by melee attacking at the right time, but you don't have to use this all that often. You will pretty much NEVER just normally melee attack because the ranged attacks always do more damage and are safer.\n\t\u2022 1st ranged attack: You will use this to kill basic enemies and early game bosses. The basic enemies provide pretty much no challenge. Hell there's not even any incentive to kill them. You get no experience or loot drops, so it's a better idea to just jump past them if you can.\n\t\u2022 2nd ranged attack: A \"bomb\" weapon that is used for a lot of puzzles.\n\t\u2022 3rd ranged attack: Used for puzzles and defeating late game bosses.\n\nSo yea the game focuses on puzzles, platforming, and combat, in that order. Hell even most of the early bosses are just one big puzzle in the sense that once you figure out their pattern, the battles become easy as hell. However, I should point out that the late game bosses feel like proper \"battles\" in the sense that it's not just a matter of figuring out a pattern. Late game bosses have like 4-8 attacks and you have to react fast enough in order to dodge the attacks. I personally prefer combat so I enjoyed the late game bosses a lot more. Basic enemies are ALWAYS no challenge though :P.\n\nIn regards to the actual quality of the puzzles, platforming, and combat, they're all well done and varied. Everything is not too complicated/difficult, but not painstakingly easy either. There's also a lot of \"tools\" that you have in order to solve puzzles (in addition to your attacks) and you'll constantly be using multiple tools for a puzzle as well as using different sets of tools between puzzles. So the game constantly moves at a nice pace without ever becoming boring. \n\nOne flaw with the gameplay though is the upgrade system. You can't level up in this game and you can't find loot to improve your stats (there are not stats). The only way to improve your character is by crafting and equipping \"tweaks\" of which you can equip 3 of. To do this, first you have to find the schematic for the tweak and then you have to find the materials in order to build it. First of all, most of the tweaks are very boring. They're like \"Stop damage once\" or \"hold breath underwater longer\" or \" move slightly faster\". Second of all, if you get hit once, your rightmost tweak gets disabled. This means that if you get hit 3 times, all your tweaks stop working. I think this was a really poor design decision. You can get hit randomly at any time while exploring and when facing bosses, so you'll be out like 1-2 tweaks constantly. For most of the game, I had \"Double-Jump\" and \"Stop damage once\" times 2 as my tweaks. I never changed my tweaks because\u2026.. Well the tweaks are really boring and that was usually the best setup :P. So yea the upgrade system was not engaging at all.\n\nNow we come to the story. Essentially, this game has a main story focusing around the world and sort of the main character and 4 side stories focusing on 4 side characters. The main story is about how the world is ending and you have to save it. At the same time, the world is currently controlled by a religious organization called \"One Concern\" and the leaders of this organization are planning on taking rockets and leaving the planet. Not everyone knows about this within the organization, creating a lot of interesting interactions between characters. Also, this organization is very dark and you see some messed up shit. Overall, great main story. There are some unanswered questions and a \"What the Fuck is Going On\" type thing with the final boss, but overall I was engaged throughout my play time. The side stories are more hit and miss:\n\t\u2022 Mina: She has an over-bearing mother plus Mina is an adventurous type and so she wants to stay away from home most of the time. This causes her mother to feel abandoned making her become even more over-bearing and so a vicious cycle ensues. I liked this story because let's just say, I can understand :P\n\t\u2022 Elro: His father died because of the religious organization, and so he wanted to take down the organization down. He succeeds in killing one of the important members, but in turn his wife and daughter die. This causes him to get PTSD and a series of unfortunate events occur that cause him to lose an arm and a leg (literally) and make him very\u2026. \"withdrawn\" from the world. Tragic story. Interesting.\n\t\u2022 Royal: He's supposed to be the successor of the leader of the religious organization. However, he's spoiled and kind of stupid so the religious organization eventually shuns him. While he may have his faults, he has the best of intentions at heart and so he helps your hero try to save the world. I felt a lot of pity for this guy and was really looking forward to his \"redemption\". Like, he's been constantly been called useless and told that he should just die  by some of his closest former friends and family. Really sad. UNFORTUNATELY, near the end of the game, YOUR CHARACTER has to sacrifice him in order to save herself. NO REDEMPTION. I really hated this. REALLY HATED THIS. This character deserved better.\n\t\u2022 Agent Black: She's one of the main \"villains\" and does messed up shit throughout the game. However, as you progress through the game you learn about why she's like this and you come to understand her. Basically, she's immortal and it is very difficult to kill her. Her existence is painful and she's tried to commit suicide multiple times. At some point she found someone important to her, but then she lost him and became even more bitter about the world. Now all that's left is her \"duty\" and she will give everything she has for that duty. Without a doubt, she is my favorite character in the entire game. Great villain. \n\nI have to give Kudos for how much emotion the developers were able to convey. There are no voice-overs in the game, but through animating the characters and there speech bubbles, it was as if I was watching scenes in real life. The developers did SUCH a great job in making me understand how the characters were feeling.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. While I would've preferred more combat, a more engaging upgrade system, and for Royal to not get SCREWED OVER, I definitely enjoyed my time playing it :).", "timestamp_created": 1540143347, "timestamp_updated": 1540143347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45358367": {"recommendationid": "45358367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364261204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 942, "last_played": 1540300448}, "language": "english", "review": "one of Metroidvania games I really enjoyed.

Anyway, Our young Robin will start her journey with \u201cChecking a loud crash noise\u201d out of her house before things start to evolve into meddling in a world government and finishing off with saving the world, But we will get to that later on of this review.\nMainly, In Iconoclast the gameplay will be 2D platforming and leaning heavily on puzzle solving. Which I can guarantee to be both brain teasing and pretty much infuriating as some puzzles require more luck than skill and timing, Luckily, These moments doesn\u2019t came out too often. And if you are skillful enough (or like me, Lucky enough to by pass some of these puzzle with \u201cpixel by pixel trick\u201d) You\u2019ll found yourself in a right kind of corner.\nBut the real meat of this game however, lying in a sheer artistic approach (Hat off to Mr. Sandberg who deliver all of these beautiful pixel on his own) And not just that, But the cast of characters in this game are pretty much very interesting. They are so full of characteristic, Hardly to believe all of these happen by one man. I found myself not hating any single characters at all (Excluding annoy ones that is). And the story\u2026\u2026\u2026..You\u2019ve got to try it on your own, Trust me, It does worth it.\nBut indeed, The game does have number of faultiness which probably going to make you throw your controller in a fit of rage (I already does, No worry) So I believe I should warn all of you with list of a reasons:\n-\tSome puzzle in this game really and I quote \u201cserious\u201d as it were really serious a great timing and angle of doing it (One grand example would be the Isi\u2019s Under water lab) also by the 2nd quarter, The game seem to lose its momentum and threw to you, a f..ck ton of puzzles to extend your in game time for more.\n-\tBosses fight whilst aren\u2019t all desperate, some of them are really anger induce.\n-\tSometime the game will throw you into a gauntlet moment where you have to kill everything in that room to proceed, These moment are by far a total mosh pit of unfairness and shone a number of bad designs\u2026..alot of them.\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap, I suppose this game probably best suit for anyone who are looking for 2d puzzle platforming or a supporter of Mr. Sandberg or just want to breath in something new in a while.

As a Metroidvania game, it has to compete with powerhouses that work with incredibly tight control schemes and minimalistic stories. As a Metroidvania, its pattern is well-defined: jump around, find hidden caches, blast enemies, and unlock a story. On all of these fronts, a succession of small flaws build up to undermine the game.\n\nThe platforming is alright, but not great. You jump around as usual, but there are a number of small repeated frustration points. For example, most jumping requires grabbing the ledge. This process requires a half second climbing animation. Not much, right? Except every. single. platform. seems to require this. The entire world is built to be just high enough to never properly clear. You won't unlock double jump until quite literally the end of the game, so enjoy hanging from the edge of platforms over and over...and over...\n\nThere are other control quirks as well. Why is it that you need 1.5 charges on the wrench to electrify instead of 1? Why is the hitbox on the pipe sections so narrow that you can miss it by jumping too close? Why does the down stomp require such pixel-perfect alignment? Why is Mina's shotgun so poorly controlled and require her to stand lock still? Why does the 8directional shot on the guns sometimes trigger and sometimes not? None of these sink the game, but they are annoyances that build over the game's playtime.\n\nWith other genres I would give these sorts of quirks a pass. Not with metroidvanias. This genre lives and dies by the details of its controls. \n\nThen there are the negative tropes. Did you want a prolonged stealth section where you have to crawl along? Have one! That not enough? How about a stealth boss section?! What about a section where you lose all your equipment? Great, have one! A boss battle while without most equipment? Have one! Invulnerable enemies in tight hallways to harass you? Have an entire gauntlet of them!\n\nLike all Metroidvanias, the treasure hunting comes with a large dose of \"Find the fake wall\" and \"find the hidden platform\". While obnoxious, this is kind of expected, so I give that a wash. Just use a guide to find those last couple chests.\n\nThe story is incomprehensible. After finishing the game, I thought I had accidentally triggered a joke ending. No major plot points are resolved, none of the characters grow, and the artist apparently thinks this constitutes a deep story. The driver of the story is an angry, smelly pirate and your overbearing brother yelling the same damn thing at each other, over and over and over. This game subscribes to the avant garde version of story where you are dropped into a setting with no information, no explanations, and no resolution so that you can feel the same annoyance as trying to sort out your in-laws dinner plans over the phone.\n\nAlso, everyone with speaking lines is a giant dickbag. Just...just a giant dickbag. I was actively hoping for a full party wipe by the halfway mark of the game.\n\nI'd rate Iconoclasts 4/10.

There is so much care and effort put into all of the animations and details that it's continually mind-boggling that the game is ~150 MB.  These are pixel graphics but every little thing is designed to have punch, even the dialogue boxes.  They got a lot out of very little.  As for the game, it's an excellent linear adventure-platformer.  There's a lot of variation in gameplay with a gripping story that keeps you continously invested without getting bored.  The controls are simple but fulfilling and the bosses are a lot of fun, if maybe a little easy.  Not every game needs to be hard though, and there's a lot to enjoy here while you sail through.\n\nUnfortunately if you don't sail through, you'll find the metroidvania aspect of the game to be fairly weak.  The incentive for exploring off the beaten path is to get designs/materials to craft Tweaks which are small equippable powerups.  Unfortunately, most of the Tweaks are very weak and uninteresting, which removes most of the reward for finding these collectibles.  Making matters worse, backtracking is required for many of them, and backtracking in this game really sucks.  You eventually get a fast travel hub between zones, but you often have to backtrack to an area after you complete it to unlock it for that zone, and you can't ever warp back to the hub.  All this said, the bright side of how weak Tweaks are is that you can just ignore collecting the ones that aren't fun and not have to deal with this.\n\nI've heard Iconoclasts described as a series of metroidvania vertical slices, which I think is a good summary of what does and doesn't work about the game.

[/b]\n\n\nI\u2019ve always been immensely impressed when a game comes out that is, more or less, made by one person. When you look at games such as Braid, Dust: An Elysian Tale and Thomas Was Alone it\u2019s abundantly clear that they were made with great care and have benefited from the personalized attention that only a game made by one person could provide. The dedication that it must take to make a game on your own is daunting, and something that I certainly respect. You can add Iconoclasts to that list as it took developer Joakim Sandberg nearly ten years to complete his project.\n\nSandberg\u2019s efforts mostly pay off as he has created what I would call a Metroidvania-lite set in an interesting world. I use the term \u201clite\u201d because while this has elements of the Metroidvania genre, like using new abilities to access previously unavailable areas, it\u2019s incredibly linear. While you do have access to fast travel at some point, the game pushes you forward in the story at such a pace that it\u2019s not really encouraged or even necessary to revisit old areas. There are no persistent upgrades and simply \u201ctweaks\u201d that provide buffs to your existing abilities. While I did not mind this approach, I could definitely see it off-putting to some expecting your traditional Metroidvania affair.\n\nThe combat here is perfectly competent, if not unspectacular. You have ranged and melee attacks, and while they work just fine, there is not much depth to the combat. Where the game does shine, however, is in the excellent puzzle design and inventive boss battles. You\u2019ll probably spend more time solving puzzles than fighting and I found this to be a non-issue as the puzzles are rewarding and use your powers and abilities in quite a clever fashion. Despite the combat not being stellar, the boss battles were surprisingly unique and was one of the highlights of the game for me.\n\nThe music is also just a joy to listen to. Mostly filled with light and delightful tones, there\u2019s some really great tracks here and never got old across my ten or so hours of playtime.\n\nOne thing that I was somewhat at odds with was the plot. While the world building is initially interesting, I found it to be a bit convoluted at times. The game tackles religious themes and allegories, which is no small undertaking. It mostly sticks the landing, but it can get lost in the weeds at times and I found you motivation to be doing something a bit muddled. That said, the cast of characters are pretty great with each person having a defined and unique personality.\n\nIconoclasts is immensely impressive, if even for the fact that it was made by one person. For it to be a better than average puzzle platformer is just icing on the cake for me. If some of my problems and concerns give you pause, I\u2019d say wait for a sale to check out Iconoclasts. It\u2019s a good game that I\u2019m sure a lot of people will like.", "timestamp_created": 1536968330, "timestamp_updated": 1607228492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721688389778137207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44717316": {"recommendationid": "44717316", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989493694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1848, "last_played": 1539192692}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amaizing game!\n\npros:\n- Solid gameplay, evey little encounter and puzzle is different.\n- Lots of great bossfights.\n- Well done graphics, this comes from someone not very fond of pixel art.\n- Greately narrated unconventianal story.\n\ncons:\n- I can only think of one: tWEAKs system provides too weak benefits for this hunting for chests to make sense.", "timestamp_created": 1536867830, "timestamp_updated": 1536867830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44705175": {"recommendationid": "44705175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967330668", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1193, "last_played": 1536641327}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant story, just enough mechanics to keep things fresh, and really compelling music.

Wait for it to go on sale. I would prefer to mark this game as \"informative\" rather than \"not recommended\", but that option is only offered to curators AFAICT.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly solid, animations are lively, and the music really captures the mood of each area and boss battle. The controls are tight and responsive, though I don't really agree with the decision to cram 3 guns onto 1 button with a switcher button. The game was not hurting for buttons to use and almost every modern controller is going to have at least 6 buttons. Actually, it's just a little shy on using buttons in general. I guess that makes it substantially more accessible to 1-handed gamers like halfcoordinated (who is in the credits as a tester), but it would still be nice to have the option available as a 2-handed gamer. The curb cut effect is not helping here.\n\nMinor spoilers ahead.\n\nThe game starts off strong, but drags on longer than is welcome. There are two bits of gameplay that absolutely destroy the pacing- a stealth section that is poorly explained, and a slow-paced crawl with an incapacitated Elro followed by a slow-paced boss battle that drags on far too long. Other than that, the powerups were fun and the exploration, while limited for this genre, was satisfying. It actually is pretty interesting how there are no upgrades to health maximum or number of tweak slots (unless they were just insanely well hidden), which is sort of a refreshing departure from the typical metroidvania.\n\nBoss design wasn't particularly memorable. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThe story on the other hand... Honestly kind of terrible and hard to follow. Robin is just another silent protagonist with chronic hero syndrome, Mina is hot-headed and one-dimensional, Elro is a bland nihilist who sorta accidentally is badass sometimes, Royal is a whiny spoiled brat whose motives are inconsistent and who never has a chance to redeem himself. There are so many missed opportunities for story choices, only being offered meaningless choices that you just know won't actually affect anything substantial. I would describe the game's story as a bittersweet wandering plot, as it lacked a clear structure and had a murky and unsatisfying climax.\n\nThis game was almost a chore to finish due to the wandering plot and weak late game.", "timestamp_created": 1536730205, "timestamp_updated": 1536730763, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300343036651611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44692457": {"recommendationid": "44692457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046668598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1625339486}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like a mix of Cave Story and Megaman ZX, with a wackiness that's reminiscent of LISA.

The platforming and especially the shooting feels inprecise, the mechanics with throwing boxes seems crazy. These aren't huge things, but after playing dead cells I've become aware of just how lacking it all is.\n\n- the game design is all over the place. I like some of the maps, but theres a lot of backtracking, often for not a very good reason. As well, some of the story objectives don't really give you a good idea of what to do next beyond just checking everywhere on the map.

No idea what the dev was thinking with that one.\n\nultimately, I'm still gonna finish it, but even for 20$ this game is not worth it.

Am I supposed to just press and let go of a button, or keep the button pressed down? When should I do this, and what should happen? It isn't until you've most likely failed and messed around with the mechanic while taking damage that the true intent is discovered.\n\nOn top of this, you get three \"tweaks\" with bonuses to things like movement speed, melee attack power etc. but you'll lose one tweak if you take damage. To get back that tweak, you need to destroy enough enemies to repair said tweak. This mechanic combined with how many times you'll take damage because of the game slapping you for not reading a walkthrough, I don't feel challenged by an obstacle but rather punished for simply playing the game.\n\nPuzzles are finicky with placements and timing, and doing damage to some enemies is more luck than skill.

If you read any negative reviews and the reviewer only played the game for a couple hours, I wouldn't pay any attention to it. In their defense the game does take a while to get interesting (story wise) so I get it. Personally I couldn\u2019t bring myself to leave a skid mark on someone\u2019s hard work without playing through at least a majority of the game. Also this game was made by a single person. 1 human made this game. Like by himself. It isn\u2019t pure metroidvania but it\u2019s similar. There is a lot of puzzle/platforming elements in this game that make is less of a metroidvania. It\u2019s also on the linear side with some backtracking. \n\nI went into this game knowing almost nothing about it other than thinking it looked worth a play through. It appears to be all happy with cute characters and bright colors with upbeat music. I was expecting a game similar to the Shantae series. Ho-ly-shit this game gets pretty dark and fucked up. Don\u2019t let a little kid play this. I think it\u2019s appropriately rated as a T title but goddamn there are a few cut scenes where some violent shit happens and my jaw was on the floor while whispering \u201cwtf???\u201d After a couple hours you start to realize what\u2019s going on in the world. A lot of the negative reviewers that finished the game say they hated the story. I enjoyed it a lot. I thought all the characters were unique and multi-layered. They all change throughout the story too. I felt empathetic and attached to them. The game doesn\u2019t spoon feed the whole story to you. I was motivated to look up fan theories and more info on the lore. It\u2019s pretty impressive for one man\u2019s work. If you really want to understand and appreciate the game for what it is without looking up shit, start a new game+ and play through some of the beginning hours and things will start to click more than the first time. Little things like posters on walls, background images, narrative, and even the environment details seem to pop out and make sense giving you those \u201cah ha!\u201d moments. I love when games have detail this well done.\n\nThere are some very light rpg elements here. You can explore and find items to add little perks like swinging your wrench longer, free hits, movement speed, etc., but none of them will break the game at all. You could play through the game without paying much mind to them if you really wanted.\n\nI got it during the summer sale for like 70% off or something.

I thought it was okay, and it is indeed a \"good game,\" but it's not for me. I was promised a Metroidvania, and what I got was a relatively basic (gameplay-wise) action-puzzle-platformer with a dearth of the RPG elements I really wanted. I don't know why they went the route they did with the Tweak system (you can get up to a max of three buffs that one of breaks every time you take damage, and the buffs themselves are relatively minor) instead of just having a normal sort of upgrade/level system, but I still wish they hadn't. When going into the game, I expected to be unlocking new weapons and abilities left and right, but was disappointed when I discovered only two other weapons in the whole game (one of which you only unlock close to the end) and that the character's moveset is more-or-less static aside from a scant couple wrench upgrades that aren't really useful in battle or movement aside from a couple pre-determined areas and feel clunky to use. Give me a double jump, give me a dash; just give me anything, please, and design the game around that.\n\nThe real appeal of the game lies in two points: it's visuals and its world. The art style is gorgeous, and the game's graphical abilities are more than enough to accurately get it across to you, The world is all thematically consistent, and it doesn't just do things for the sake of doing them. The fact that the three most basic shapes (triangles, circles, and squares) are all used in abundance integrates well with the nature of the game's world that you eventually find out about.\n\nUnfortunately, however, I felt like the game's writing really betrayed any potential that the world and story had to be great. All the characters felt stiff to me, the dialogue felt confusing and vague at times, and by the end of the story, the only one I actually cared about at all was Robin (mostly because she didn't have any dialogue to tarnish the character I imagined her to have), though I also liked Royal (a character that does a heel-face turn and helps you out) to an extent. The characters all seem to get angry over things that aren't well-communicated or don't have a lot of build-up, and they're all frustratingly bull-headed for no good reason (or, if it is a good reason, it's, again, not well-communicated or built up to; characters just sort of seem to do things because the plot demands it). I know this was a game made by one man, but it'd be twice the game it currently is if he had hired a more experienced writer who knew what he was doing (no offense intended, but that's the truth of my feelings).\n\nI really did want to like this game, but I don't. It's just not for me. Don't let anyone tell you it belongs in the same category as SotN, Axiom Verge, Metroid, Hollow Knight, Rabi-Ribi, or any other Metroidvania.

I've run into a couple baseline enemies that just do not communicate clearly to the player their weak points. If the enemies are invunerable against everything but one specific type of attack, then you need to clearly communicate to the player what is expected of them. If it fires a handful of projectiles at me, and I need to knock a specific one back at it, then make it a different colour to the others. If I need to hit these specific points in a boss battle (this switch, that crank, those gears, that glowing spot) in a specific sequence then have each part change visuals as it becomes relavent, don't just have them all flash and move about.\n\nI have honestly given up; you get an ability to use the wrench to ride along glowing rails, and I reached a part which required me to ride a rail over a spiked floor with enemies that spit poison gas up at you as you approach. The enemies are invunerable to your guns, you have to stomp on their heads; but then you land in the spikes and get hurt, assuming you even managed to hit them through the poison gas (which you can't). You can't ride past them as they spit at your approach, so it's not a timing puzzle, there's no apparent brake for the rail grinding (the game at least has tutorial signposts as each mechanic is required, at first, so I'm pretty sure there isn't a brake), there is no other direction to go instead, and there's nothing about that suggests any method to get past them (oh, and this is about 5 mins from the nearest save point, so that right there is a rage quit moment)\n\nI give up. I am done with this game. Even if I either find out how to beat this challenge, there'll just be another one right after it, another platforming challenge, new basic enemy or boss fight with no idea what I'm expected to do to deal with it.\n\nI played this mostly on the Switch version, I never really got into it on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1534105987, "timestamp_updated": 1534105987, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345268607139587402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44096711": {"recommendationid": "44096711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983545926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 339, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1534563582}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a Konjak game, you should consider buying it if you like 2D action games.

I want to go over every aspect rather than focus on the things that stood out for me, but I'm not good at it. For Iconoclasts, I'd love nothing more than to unpack how you shouldn't underestimate the 'cute' pixel graphics. People die in the first 30 minutes (if you're slow) and there's no magic 'resurrection' story gimmick in the game. A guy loses an arm and the main characters spend no small amount of time trying to find 'Mother' who supposedly has the power to fix it-- only to find out she can't. I'd want to spend some time talking about how the music is so on-point it's creepy. It's so good it's downloadable (oh look, DLC, *click*). And of course, we shan't forget the simple fact of how amazing this game is for being made by ONE guy. It truly is a joy to experience.\n\nI think the thing that 'holds it back' if I were to pinpoint something, is the fact that the story is delivered 100% by text. Even in 'my time' I knew people, friends, acquaintances, who wouldn't bother to read things they were presented, so they skip everything or mash A until it goes away (oh, that rhymed, hah!). I'm the one loser who just eats it up, because I seek meaning in the world around me rather than ride it like it's some kind of tide. But for those who actually do bother to read it, it's GOOD. Someone on the forums described the story as 'akin to a Greek tragedy,' and I feel this is pretty accurate.... for not having any kind of literature degree.\n\nOh wow, I've already said more than I meant to.

I got through them purely to fight the bosses and to continue the story. To be fair, the puzzles aren't all bad. In fact some of them are actually really, really cool.

Everyone has their flaws as people and it consistently makes each character feel realistic for the setting and situation they're set to. Music being great is a huge plus!\n\nThe gameplay being a very metroidvania style but the upgrades are unique to this game. You acquire 4 different crafting parts that you assemble different modifiers to upgrade your character. They act as buffs (speed, wrench power, free damage negation, increased water breathing, etc) until you take damage and they can be regenerated as long as you do some puzzle solving or damage enemies. It's neat as each upgrade is applied to basically first, second and third hits you take... kinda sets you to strategize which buffs you want on the last hit so you can keep running faster or dodging for longer.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're looking for a nifty Metroidvania that does things a little differently!

Beautiful pixel art graphics, amazing soundtrack, engaging story (and it gets pretty darn dark!) great level design... I think what needs to be stressed the most is the gameplay, tho. Everything feels so fluid. You can spend so long in the first area just messing with the mechanics, because they're just so fun. That's not even to mention the boss fights, which are easily the game's strongest points, in a game full of already strong points. Every single one uses the new and old mechanics given in creative ways. Never did I feel like i got hit by a cheapshot on any boss. The only encounters that really frustrated me was the Blocker boss (conveniently in the screenshots of the game above), which I felt was a bit too finicky with how you fight it. And with another boss (which is spoilers), it wasn't quite clear how to get them down to the ground after stunning them. But with how many bosses the game has, there's bound to be a couple not quite up to speed, and it's stunning how creative and different they all are.\n\nWhat also gets me is how the method to defeating bosses is something to be inferred by the player. Sometimes, it gives hints if you go without dealing damage long enough, but it's never outright said what to do, and it's not like a hint box pops up either - it comes entirely from character dialogue. \n\nAlthough i am gushing a bit here, I will say that the game's not too hard.

If this type of game is at all interesting to you, it is without a doubt worth picking up.\n\nEDIT: Steam seems to have not counted most of my playtime. I've played this game through and done some postgame content for a total of about 18 hours.\n\n\n[u]Story:[/u]\n\n    The story of this game is mixed. Many of the characters are pretty archetypal, but all of them were executed well enough that I personally didn't mind.  Dialogue is well written, and all characters have some level of nuance and moral ambiguity with the way they interact with others and fit into the world.\n\n    The plot is interesting enough, if a little cliche. Theocratic dystopia with questionable ideas, impending doom, etc. There's a surprising amount of levity despite the dark premise. There's also quite a few references to LGBT stuff that actually manage to add to the story and worldbuilding. (Take note other game devs) Surprisingly, Iconoclasts does fantastic job at balancing levity through cutesy humor with some incredibly dark themes and moments. \n\n    Quite a bit of the plot, specifically around the middle of the game, is delivered quite messily, with a handful of concepts brought up without ever getting properly followed up. I feel like this game would benefit greatly from optional collectable bits of flavor text to flesh things out a little more.\n\n    In spite of all this, the story manages to build a compelling world and has a ton of powerful moments. Much of the story is told partially through missable visuals and gameplay sequences, which is a huge plus as far as I'm concerned. Overall, the story is saved from slightly-above-mediocrity by a handful of fantastic stand out moments, and some pretty solid humor throughout.\n\n\n[u]Presentation:[/u]\n\n    Not a lot to say here, just look at the gameplay trailers. It's consistently great. One small thing I'd like to point out is that, despite the 16-bit style, this game runs in HD. Most animations are allowed to subtly break the pixel grid, which makes everything feel just a tiny bit smoother. There are also a handful of more advanced graphical effects in use, such as screen space refraction in some sections and subtle use of bloom throughout. The soundtrack is also great, although it would benefit from a few more unique tracks. \n\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\n\n    Iconoclasts is a puzzle-platformer first and foremost. The puzzle-platformer label is usually applied to puzzle games with platforming elements. This is not the case with Iconoclasts. The puzzles, and the actual platforming, are both treated as equally important. Both are decent on their own, but the game is at its best when it combines both seamlessly; which, thankfully, is most of the game. \n\n    There is also a somewhat heavy focus on combat. For the most part, combat is an extension of the platforming, puzzles, or both. All of these converge together to make some of the best and most creative boss battles I've ever played - many of which are also simultaneously well-executed story sequences. \n\n    Each major area introduces one or two new elements used throughout the area, and sparingly throughout the rest of the game world. These are used expertly, most memorably the many variants of the bolts, in platforming bits, puzzles, and even boss fights. The best uses of these elements are in some of the games optional puzzle rooms, which combine different elements in really interesting and novel ways. My biggest gripe with this is that there are criminally few of these more complex and difficult puzzles. What was there was fantastic; but I finished the game feeling there was a lot more that could have been done with the mechanics its introduced.\n\n   There are metroidvania elements throughout. These are well done, but mainly used as a way to gate complexity and keep things manageable. There are also bits where metroidvania elements are used to promote exploration, but this is in no way the main focus.\n\n   Collectibles are materials or blueprints, which let the player craft different tweaks - small buffs that can be equipped to one of three slots. This system isn't particularly complex, but offers some compelling choices. What's more useful: Increased melee damage, immunity to one attack, or slightly easier parries and charges? Of course, it depends on the player. The one exception to this is the 'dodger' tweak which gives you a dodge roll and is unambiguously the best tweak. It's also the hardest to get, so this is fine by me; others may take issue though. Tweaks will be deactivated one at a time upon taking a hit, and can be reactivated by destroying enemies or objects. Tweaks always deactivate in the same order so there's some strategy involved in slot selection. The tweak system adds an incentive to collect the already rewarding collectables, and a reason to avoid damage, even if ample health and regen is available.\n\n\n[u]Conclusion:[/u]\n\nI find numeric ratings to be overly general, but if I had to give one to Iconoclasts it would be a 9 out of 10. Considering how ambitious it is, and the handful of areas it falls short, that should say something about how amazing this game can get at it's high moments. It should also say something that my most substantial complaints about this game are essentially that there isn't more of it. It may not be perfect, but for an ambitious $20 indie game, made by one person nonetheless, Iconoclasts is truly incredible, and without a doubt worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1532213920, "timestamp_updated": 1532214215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43560957": {"recommendationid": "43560957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000902357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 640, "last_played": 1531861516}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to finish the game because the plot seemed interesting, but the gameplay is just awful.

The game itself is gorgeous, the colour palettes of each area, the themes and the aniamations while not always fluid are polished and natural looking. Level design is a bit 'meh', it's not awful, but there are parts that rely on hidden passages with minimal indication, bosses that rely on multiple attempts to divine what method of attack works at a certain stage and a lot of unnecessary backtracking. Difficulty isn't really that high, I played the 'harder' difficulty and it never took more than a few goes. The quest tracking is minimal and doesn't let you track any side quests (I also never found out of there was a point to side quests as there wasn't any reward) and loot is reserved for one time boosts. Progression is more linked to your \"Zelda\" tool procurement through the story than to loot.\n\nEasily the strongest part of this game for me was the world building and story which is not usually a marking point for metroidvanias in my experience, this isn't to say it's a masterclass in writing but you can tell the sheer amount of effort that was put into just the story as it progresses. The main character legitimately had me gushing over how cute she was through the entirety of the game, for a pixely metroidvania I never thought I'd want to spend so much time crawling and listening to the *patpatpat* of the animation. Despite being mostly silent the MC has a bit more character than your standard silent MC, you are offered some dialogue options through the game (which I'm not sure change the result) but it definitely lends to colouring the MC in. Suffice to say I loved her design.\n\nThis leads me to my last point, the other characters. All the characters are very unique and contain their own personality really well, they are not always the deepest or complex characters but that's hardly necessary in a metroidvania. Within the game you are offered a few stages where you can play as two other characters and therein lies my gripe about missed potential. Every named character feels like they could be a playable character at some point and it makes me incredibly salty that I have a less than 5 stages to work with these creations. I hope they do more in another game or DLC with these characters as I feel it would really be a shame to waste all the love that was put into writing these characters whether it's a backstory instalment or a tribute to the character designs. \n\nIn conclusion, while the gameplay is a bit 'meh' and could use a better progression system, the game's strong point lies in the world building and characters. The fact you're able to play some of the other characters in certain stages leaves the game as a giant tease for me and I hope they are working on something to flesh them out whether directly or as a tribute to the character designs.

It follows a primarily linear progression with bits of narrative and dialog interspersed. However, it does indeed have a large, persistent world with exploration enabled by item and ability upgrades.\n\nThe game can be a bit long-winded in exposition, and some of the dialog is a little awkward at times.\n\nIconoclasts fairly nailed its difficulty level. Standard is occasionally challenging without being frustrating, harder is slightly more difficult with seemingly-fewer health pickups and more enemies.

Here are the reasons:\n\n[h1]Delevopment[/h1]This game was made by ONE guy, who spent SEVEN years to made it. (Joakim Sandberg, you can see his name is on the store page of the game).\n\n[h1]Price[/h1]You should bought this game at full price, it's already cheap and it deserve to be sold in higher price (The guy spent SEVEN years to make it, guys, think about it, is it the price you should pay for something that developed in SEVEN years ? Please, if you can, I'm begging you buy 2 copies of it, not for me, not for you but for him, he deserves it).\n\nOK, so it's the background of the game, now I will tell you why I'm begging you to buy at least 2 copies of this game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]Have you ever play Metroid on Gameboy Advance ? Megaman Zero on Gameboy Advance ? Kirby on Gameboy Advance ? If you played one of those games I will describe it in one sentence: This game can stand among those legends. If you haven't, you don't need to worry I will tell you. This game is a 2D Pixel Platformer packed with actions, puzzles, bosses, secrets, choice matters (Yes, you hear me right, choice MATTERS). Each feature deserves it own description, so ... here we go, it's gonna long, LOL !\n[h1]Action[/h1]This aspect feel mostly like Megaman Zero, where you shoot, slash, jump, grab, use gadgets to defeat enemies, unlock new paths or explore secrets, fight bosses ... It won't get bored because it combine action and puzzle very well ! The more you play the more you want to play.\n[h1]Puzzle[/h1]This is the most unique aspect of the game ! The puzzles make good use of everything. Gadgets, Reflex, Intellect, everything that you have. Yet, it sounds CHALLENGING right ? Don't worry, it is challenge indeed but it is not frustrated, plus the levels is well designed so that you can enjoy while solving the puzzle.\n[h1]Bosses[/h1]You will definitely love this one, I swear. The Bosses are many and various, each boss fight is something to remember ! Most of them are EPIC and unique, you are not suppose to kill a boss by \"Shoot at its weak points\" no, you don't. Each boss has different way to defeat. And just like what I said with the puzzle, it is challenge indeed but it is not frustrated.\n[h1]Choice matters[/h1]The game does has choice matters which add up to the replay value of the game.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]Story is deep, interesting and twisted. When the credit roll It gave me the feeling of bittersweet, the same feeling when you finish a good game, the same feeling like you finish The Witcher 3. Yes, we all know what it feel like right ? The story is so twisted that it gives you a different point of view about the characters and events when you play NewGame+, and also add a up to the replay value. The dialogues and script writing of this game deserve to has it own TV series. It require the level of TV series writter to create something like this.\n\n[h1]Graphic[/h1]Very beautiful pixel art with detailed animations (You can watch the trailer to see for yourself and don't worry, no downgrade, LOL). What surprise me more is that it has a wide range of characters variation, each NPCs is unique, most of them are different. This can compare to the smooth, detailed, various animation of Metal Slug 3.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]One thing I love about the sound of the game is it doesn't have the \"Ugh ... Arrgh\" sound when your character getting hit or hitting other things or jumping everytime. And the sound in this game also feel very impact which works well with the gameplay and music.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]Oh man ... how can I describe this ? Wonderful ? Great ? Epic ? I don't think I have the right word to talk about the music is this game, it is good beyond describe. This aspect of the game feel like Kirby games. At sometimes it can be beautiful, at the other times it can feel so powerful that make you feel like you gonna fight Thanos or Godzilla and you could win.\n\n[h1]Replay value[/h1]Yes, this game has hig replay value. Details are in [b]Choice matters[/b] and [b]Story[/b] sections I wrote above.\n\n[h1]The only thing this game need[/h1]Is reputation. Yes, the only thing this game need is more love and more people to play it. Because everything else is either good or perfect.\n\nGamespot: 9.\nIGN: 8.4.\n\nSo, anything else I have to say to show you how good this game is ?\nGo ahead, buy it.

Some of the characters are interesting and there are a lot of funny cutscenes. Unfortunately, all of that is punctuation on gameplay that feels like a best hits collection of bad Playstation era puzzle minigames.\n\nIconoclasts wants to feel like a Metroidvania where, instead of shooting/stabbing baddies until they die, you use nonstandard or creative methods to deal with encounters. That's fine and in keeping with the theme (you're a mechanic with a mediocre stun gun, not Samus), but it relies on an assumption that the mechanics are solid, and the game is consistent about conveying to you what kinds of interactions are valid on the various objects and enemies. Neither of those statements are true.\n\nIn terms of making its expectations clear, the game is abysmal. Sometimes you're told something can be parried with an animation, sometimes you get the animation once, sometimes you don't get it at all. Some enemies that look fixed to terrain can be detached from their mounts, but other enemies with the same aesthetic in the same area are inexplicably immune. One recurring miniboss is immune to some attacks in one fight but not in another, and nothing changes about them or the environment that would explain why. Sidekicks are frequently a nuissance, showing up in fights where they don't meaningfull contribute anything except visual noise, and then appear later as critical elements of other fights. For a game with so much effort put into the sprite art, it desperately needs much of that art removed or streamlined to restore some sanity to what's actually hapening.\n\nOnce you've figured out what the rules are for any given scenario, you're mostly just going through motions. The gimmicks are 90% of an encounter, and once you've deciphered what the gimmick is, there's nothing else to it. This would be bearable (in the sense that replaying a puzzle game you're already overly familiar with is boring, but not offensively so), but the general mechanical looseness makes it feel like a chore. You might entiely know what to do to clear something, but will take a couple hits because you forgot the exact way a given ability or weapon was finnicky.\n\nTen hours later, I feel like I should have watched a Let's Play while playing Metroid on another monitor with the sound off.

Over time, this slowly degraded my connection to the world and its inhabitants. Every significant character is either consistently angry, wildly angsty, or obnoxiously preachy. So many conservations boil down arguments over religious beliefs, lengthy exposition, or incessantly highlighting character flaws. These increasingly occur throughout the game to a point where it\u2019s hard to through hallways without a quick pause for a chat. My version of Robin became more and more dissonant from the rest of the cast. She just idly watches others argue or gets preached to while standing there quietly, waiting to go fix everyone\u2019s problems. They\u2019re label as party characters hardly suits them as they only follow you around arguing or show up as set pieces in boss fights. [spoiler]The rare opportunity to play as Mina was a nice mix-up. Elro\u2019s one showcase as a \u2018rock-paper-scissor\u2019 boss fight was a disappointment [/spoiler].\n\n\nThere\u2019s a fantastic moment of \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019 when [spoiler]you come across skeletons bathed in ivory underneath a room full of chambers[/spoiler]. However, any eeriness is lost on a prior exposition dump explaining exactly what you\u2019re seeing. If it was even preferable to include, it may have been a better choice to add that lecture after having seen that room, since it would\u2019ve piqued your curiosity. Correspondingly, you even find the character who gave you that exposition in the next room.\n\nIconoclasts feels desperate to have deep lore and feel the need to put much of it front in center. There\u2019s an expectation to be acutely invested in the world and its societies. Having that world building for those interested is fantastic, but respectfully placing it off to the side can add length for the curious and convenience for the indifferent. \n\nWhy not convey the thoroughly religious world through visiting countless monasteries full of lore. Perhaps give the player the [i]choice[/i] to talk to characters on their own time to learn more about them. The game already does this well with townsfolk, a personal favorite being [spoiler]the man on the ground weary from working so hard to get his child into the great city[/spoiler].\n\n\n\nIconoclasts feels small. I know it\u2019s not mandatory, and even effective, for a game to not follow the trends of its genre but Iconoclast\u2019s secrets and upgrades are severely lacking. \n\nThere are only three significant upgrades which serve up some great puzzles and combat variety. There only downfall is their overuse. Because they\u2019re so limited in quantity, puzzles lack variety in the long term and become incredibly straightforward with familiarity.\n\nMoronically, I didn\u2019t realize that tweaks were equippable for a portion of the game. However, that wasn\u2019t that big of a problem. The wide majority are useless and, unless yet again I\u2019ve misunderstood things, there are only three slots to use, making a large host of tweaks pointless. Tweaks in general also do very little. The only one I\u2019d suggest is the tweak that lets you spin the wrench for longer, since it clears up how awkward it is to have the spin the wrench twice to charge it.\nThis is a personal preference, but I\u2019m not a fan of the negative feedback loops or leveling down for upgrades, so the tweak system further lost its ground with me. Taking damage and losing an upgrade feels counter intuitive. Iconoclasts isn\u2019t this severe, but it revokes the assistance you had when you need it the most. It may be similar in nature to, say, a Mario mushroom, but you don\u2019t actively work for those. Luckily, Iconoclasts\u2019 tweaks are so menial that this doesn\u2019t become a concern outside of that wrench-spinning convenience.\n\nTweaks are created by crafting with materials that are found in optional secret chests. Several material are required for each tweak and you don\u2019t know what tweak is going to be in a chest. The majority of materials will only let you create repeats of the simpler tweaks. I only found myself going after chests when it was convenient and for the sake of the puzzle. Due to the randomness and uselessness of materials, there was no reason to backtrack or explore, substantially neglecting a critical feature that Iconoclast pushes for.\n\nSince there are no permeant survival improvements, the sense of long term improvement and accomplishment, a metroidvania genre essential, is utterly neglected. This also means that the final boss is just as much of a chump as the first boss you face.\n\nThere are only a few areas. The opening two were wonderful and loop around themselves well and are completely uninterrupted. My first impressions of Iconoclasts was nothing but positive. As the plot sets in, it becomes harder to spend time in the meat of the experience which itself slowly loses complexity.  Getting one of the few power-ups breathes new life temporarily but these few occasions aren\u2019t enough to fill up the deserts between them\n\nBosses can are hit or miss. Combat in Iconoclasts is one of its stronger attributes yet most of the bosses choose to instead offer unique gimmicks that make for a few clever \u2018thinking-on-your-feet\u2019 puzzles. The skill focused or smaller \u2018unlock the weakpoint\u2019 encounters were really well executed. Several other fights tried out either dull or confusing ideas or are were about passive survival. Disappointingly, I found myself still succeeding in the more disorienting boss fights, bypassing an potentially rewarding situation.\n\n\n\nI always feel the need to apologize after producing reviews like. The length and critical tone of this post means nothing against the insanely hard working developers whose long-term devotion to projects like this is something I look up to.\n\nI know it\u2019s always easier to list the problems with something since they are citable examples and the moments stick out more prevalently. The \u2018reviews\u2019 I toss together act as a way to practice writing and reflection while treating games as more than a consumable medium. It\u2019s my personal way to divulge my thoughts on an intriguing subject since I have few people around me that might care about or relate to.

If that last bit sounds just as appealing as having butterknifes in your eyes, you are in the same boat I was in. Unfortunately for me, an indie game called Night in the Woods absolutely ruined story-emphazied  games for me because there was absolutely no gameplay and only complete waste of 9 hours. Thankfully, I cannot say the same for Joakim Sangberg's \"Iconoclasts\". Not only is the story set in an incredibly unique and rich world that feels as original as it is colorful, but being a metroidvania, it has a whole lot of gameplay on calcium-rich story skeleton. Heres the easy pro-con list.\nPROS:\n() Sprite Work - I know, another indie with pixel art, whoopdeedoo, what next, am I going to get another broke college kids art potfoilio? Ok sure, its not exactly a unique style but the ANIMATION is fucking insane. Just to fast travel from one point to another the character will go through about 10 animations in a 10 second period of time. Its unbeilevable.\n() Story - Yeah, its a tough thing to write in a videogame when half of the market is out playing EA sports games anually and the other half sticks the same games that get the most views on Twitch. Thankfully, I think Konjak did a great job making the world and characters feel pretty authentic. Each character has their own motivations and the world has enough problems to make players strive to fix them. \n() Music - Its not the MOST amazing stuff I've heard in an OST, but it certainly fits the bill quite nicely and sets atmosphere with ease, although I partly wish it could decide if it wants to be chiptune or not. \n() Theming - I know that I can very easily HATE it when games smack you with the skillet of \"Oh hey wow we have real world messages, let us poke holes in the fourth wall so you can feel InSpIiIIiiiReD!!\" Thank god Konjak was subtle in implementation, cause that was my big concern going into the game. For example, there is a bit of an LGBT(etc.) message in there, but I didnt really catch it until after I beat the game, but looking back Im able to feel a little stupid for not seeing it earlier on. \n() Humour - Not much more to say, the game never misses a joke.\n() Tone - Its fun exterior hides a pretty dark plot, which Im down for, seeing as how the game doesnt go MEGA EDGY.\n() Puzzles - For me, all of them hit that perfect balance of challenge and accomplishment. The only things I had to look up was hidden walls. \n() Variety - the end experience feels completely different from the start. \n() Combat - Is good. Is not great, but is good. \n() Authentic Indie Experience: No I dont mean this in a stupid Hipster way, but this game was made by ONE PERSON. ONE PERSON. Holy Flying FUCK! Ya gotta give a men credit where credit is due. \nCONS:\n() Difficulty - No, its not that its too hard to or too easy, but the game gives yet another main menu difficulty select option that just ruins everything as it gives the player absolutely no context of what is easy and what is hard, which can a destroy a players experience before the game has even begun. \n() Length - Its a really Short game. It took me like 10-12 hours to beat without 100% completion, and 100%ing only took 15.5 hours. Because of pretty much only that reason I feel like Asking for 20 bucks is a bit much. A full price game wouldnt even give you a dollar \"back\" per hour. I reccomend getting this on sale. -15% was enough for me, although I should say that this is definetly a quality over quantity game. \n() No neat cutscenes - Yeah this is as nitpick as it gets, but the trailer had really good cutscenes that the game just never uses. I guess thats the cost of 1 person development. \n() Achievements - There really arent that many, and in 15 hours I had 91% completion, which is a bummer, but it brought my average game completion up so I guess I cant complain too much. \n\nWell there you have it! As per usual, the cons are mostly nitpicks that couldnt be changed without a decent amount of work put into them (except maybe acheivements). If you see it on sale once more, I'd reccommend picking it up without a doubt! Great Presentation, Surprising Story, Strong Themes, Sense of Humour, Wonderful pacing, and amazing puzzles. It might not be super long, but I'd easily pay $5 bucks per hour for later half of the game. This definetly mends some of story concerns I had going in.\nYet again Metroidvanias prove their dominance. \n", "timestamp_created": 1530683943, "timestamp_updated": 1530683943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43284149": {"recommendationid": "43284149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835745545", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1531283641}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game\nfantastic soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1530666368, "timestamp_updated": 1530666368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43281604": {"recommendationid": "43281604", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961098939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1179, "last_played": 1530655764}, "language": "english", "review": "Tries too hard to have an interesting story, and fails.

Seriously, I\u2019m not usually one to praise a game for it\u2019s story mostly because I rarely care about them beyond the surface level context, but the game\u2019s pacing, character arcs, worldbuilding, and overall narrative is unexpectedly captivating.\n\nThe pacing is probably it\u2019s biggest achievement. It starts off pretty innocuous and typical for games of it\u2019s ilk, but slowly and methodically over the course of the game builds up the tension and intrigue, before eventually catapulting into a jaw dropping finale that by the end will have gone so far off the deep end you\u2019ll have to ask yourself   \u201cWHAT GAME AM I EVEN PLAYING ANYMORE!?\"\n\nThe gameplay, while pretty solid, is a bit less noteworthy.

But overall I enjoyed it and it served its purpose well enough: It\u2019s focus on puzzles more than on combat is a refreshing change of pace, it\u2019s bosses are both visually spectacular and challenging fights in their own right, and the overall challenge of the game ramps up appropriately to reinforce the context of the game\u2019s story.

The contrasting artificial and natural is nice and helps show the player what faction is in charge of what place. At first I thought the whole game was just going to be stylized blocks, but finding the first natural plants really helped show that the stylized block areas aren't natural. The story is about a young mechanic, while being a mechanic is punishable by death, and a war between two different religions. After playing through the game, I found a lot of questions were simply never answered. Why is being a mechanic illegal? Why can't the two factions simple talk to each other, they clearly have two different origins! What on earth is that twist at the end?\n\nBeating the game took me about nine hours, which I'd say is a decent length for its price. However...\n\nCHARACTERS - While most of the characters are fun and charming, none of them seem to be the ones who travel with you. While you are off doing a cool adventure, having fun twisting bolts and the like, most of your companions just want to scream at each other. It's cool to have a character who, without their presence, the quest would be doomed to failure, but's another thing to have everyone except you be useless because they can't, and don't try to, get alone. Most of this seems to come from Elro, who is the main character's brother. He is the worst. The game always seems to go out of its way to show Elro in a cynical, uncooperative, unproductive, whiney, controling jerk, which is weird when by the end of the game you get to play as Elro for awhile and he's super powerful. Everyone else has to clear their own bossfight and they all use guns and stage hazards, but Elro is missing one arm, missing one eye, walks really slowly, and has a broken sword for a weapon. So what does Elro do? He walks up to his boss fight and stabs it to death. \nAnother person who is really annoying is Mina, a pirate girl with a powerful shotgun. While Elro is cynical, Mina is grating and unbelivably hostile to nearly everyone you meet. Also, out of all the people screaming at each other Mina is determined to scream the loudest, regardless of what going on. More about her later, as there are a few parts of the game where you get to play as Mina.\n\nCOMBAT - For the most part, combat is okay. You can only aim your gun in four directions, up, down, left, right, but if you get close to an enemy there is a sort of lock on feature that lets you just shot them instead of having to worry about aiming. This, by itself, would be fine but there is a second combat mechanic that functions something like Cave Story. In Cave Story, killing enemies powers up your weapons and taking damage powers down your weapons. In Iconoclasts, instead of powering up your weapon killing enemies fills up your Tweak gauge. Tweaks are small changes that you can equip, and you can equip up too three at a time, but most of them are so minor that I didn't really care about them. The other thing that made me not care the tweaks is that taking a single hit, from anything, deactivates a tweak. Killing an enemy, or completing a puzzle, gives you about a third of a gauge. This results in having plenty of health, but one or no tweaks active, which means you tend not to rely on tweaks because of how rarely you actually have them. To make this just a bit worse, saving fully heals you but does not fill tweak gauges.\n\nYou do get more weapons, like you would in any other metroidvania, but they never felt better than the starting gun. The reason for this is because every other gun overheats as you use it, but the starting gun can be fired as fast as you can mash the button. This makes the other guns feel more like tools for solving a puzzle, not weapons you want to use in combat. There's also a charge mechanic, but it's not useful. A normal charge mechanic has you wait to charge up to deal more damage and after the charged shot is fired you can immediatly go back to normal shooting. In Iconoclasts, you wait to charge up to deal more damage, fire the shot, then you have to wait again for an overhear gauge to empty. In the time it takes for you to charge, fire, and cool down you could be doing more damage with regular shooting.\n\nThen there's playing as Mina. This is awful. Every movement option or tweak you have normally, Mina doesn't have and she doesn't have anything to replace it with. This adds to not relying on tweaks because you learn that if the game switchs you to a different character then you don't have any tweaks. The biggest problem Mina has is her shotgun. Normally, you just auto aim at enemies, but Mina's shotgun does not work like that. Instead, whenever you want Mina to fire the gun she has to stop moving, a targetting line appears, then you aim by pressing up or down, then after firing Mina can't move again until she completes a reloading animation. Compare all those steps to playing as anyone other than Mina. Normally, if you want to fire your gun you just press the button and do it. Mina removes the fun, fast paced combat in favor of a really clunky gun.\n\nBOSSES - The bosses were... fine. They aren't really a challenge once you figure out their gimmick, but a number of times I died to a boss, looked up how to beat the boss, and was certain I had already tried what the video was doing. The reason I looked up how to beat a boss was because on my first try I was certain I had tried everything, but nothing worked. Sometimes this was so bad that I thought the game was just broken. There are also some bosses that are just plain annoying. Near the end you fight a boss whose is gimmick the room is filling up with a deadly neurotoxin, slowly killing you,  and the bosses strategy is seriously to just stall for time.\n\nCONCLUSION - Yeah, the game is alright. For all I grip about the game does have its moments, but it's not so good that I want to get 100% in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1530572362, "timestamp_updated": 1530572362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43255946": {"recommendationid": "43255946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043577323", "num_games_owned": 1125, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1530566191}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts was alright... as far as the game is concerned that's about all I can say, since there's no option between yes and no for recommending it I'd have to give it a yes as I generally enjoyed the 8.5 hours I got out of my playthrough.\n\nFor those who don't want to read the entire thing \nTL;DR\n-Generally good gameplay\n-Good levels and boss fights\n-Great character/ world building\n-Gorgeous art and soundtrack\n\n-Pointless Tweak System\n-Story completely loses the plot halfway\n-Pacing gets atrocious\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7/10 \n\nNot particularly great but just alright, recommended only at a discount.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\nThe art is blooming fantastic, everything is brightly and vibrantly colored to fit the mood of the area, without ever being too over saturated, all the NPC's and enemies are delightfully animated and full of life and the bosses are all unique and a wonder to fight, Robin in particular is so fluid and expressive with all of her animations which can change depending on her environment, and there's small details all throughout the game.\n\nThe music is also bloody good, wouldn't say it's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard but it does have some solid bangers in there. (In particular Blockrock, Shard Wastelands and Machines were my favorites)\n\nCharacter dialogue and building is strong and charming throughout the entire game, and consistently was the main driving force of the story, which sad to say really drops the ball around the midpoint of the game. (Thats for in a minute though)\n\nGameplay:\n\nWhile it's somewhat toted as a Metroidvania it's more of a very linear platformed with the occasional side path or something you'll have to come back later with a new ability, though it's only ever for optional materials. You'll have a wrench which you can use for some basic melee attacks, a stun gun which renders melee attacking completely pointless except for when absolutely needed and later on 2 different forms of firing the stun gun for combat and puzzle solving.\n\nThe wrench is instead primarily used as a puzzle solver/ mobility tool, allowing you to grapple onto certain screws to swing yourself across gaps and eventually use zipline systems, it's relatively simple but allows for some clever a-ha! moments throughout the game with some of it's puzzles which are generally fairly simple in concept and execution but they don't overstay their welcome and are mostly quite fun.\n\nNow I mentioned materials earlier, those are used to craft Tweaks which are used for the Tweak system and to put it bluntly... It's kinda entirely pointless.\n\nYou can have 3 tweaks attached at the same time, whenever you take damage the tweak furthest to the right is destroyed and becomes inactive until you fill it with enough crystal.... things, gotten from performing certain tasks, collecting things or just killing enemies. Kinda like how Cave Story handles it's weapon level systems.\n\nSounds fine so far, only issue is all of the tweaks are only minor stat boosts, which at best are somewhat useful (aka the +speed or Free Hit Absorbtion tweaks) and at worst are completely ineffective and make the whole system feel moot. (For example there are some for holding breath longer, there's no area in the entire game where you would need to hold your breath that much longer and the timer is already plenty generous)\n\nAs a result of the tweaks feeling useless, finding materials and new recipes for new tweaks quickly gets unfulfilling as you continue to get extra Breath Holding and Wrench damage ups, knowing full well they will never actively help you in-game.\n\nSomething I find particularly egregious is that around 2-3 hours into the game you gain the ability to charge your wrench by holding the attack button to spin it up, however the issue is it'll stop spinning before it reaches max charge which you can't get unless you charge it another time which eats up atleast another second EVERY time you need a full charge.\nNow there's tweaks to elongate the time you can spin for and you only need 1 equipped to make it a charge but the fact your ability to charge the wrench is deliberately crippled unless you waste atleast 1/3 of your slots just felt aggravating, especially when puzzles revolved around charging up and de-charging the wrench.\n\nCombat is also fairly bland, decent enemy variety in the beginning but after long enough (especially late game) you just end up fighting the same 4-5 troopers who all can generally just be gunned down. Or you can just run past any enemy you can because there's nothing to gain from fighting enemies unless they are blocking your only path with no way around, there's no rewards for killing enemies except for tweak energy and health (only drops when low on health though), both of which you lose from fighting them so might as well just make a B-line straight past them entirely.\n\nBosses are generally quite fun and are fine for the most part but sometimes they are just egregious with not telling or showing what you need to do to actually kill or attack them. Just for example there's a boss who attacks you with a sword around 3-4 hours in roughly who you need to parry the attacks of with your wrench, problem being is that you're never made aware of the fact you could even parry a melee attack nor the cues for what is parry-able (I only figured it out from reading up on how to actually beat the guy) and what isn't and to top it all off his character design as a very solid sewer grate looking thing on his head so you think 'oh might need to stomp him to stun him', nope just gets you instantly sliced and receive damage.\n\nAnd to spoil something real quick that boss fight? [spoiler]No idea what his identity was, no idea what his allegiance was, no idea what even his bloody name was, he gets possessed for another fight shortly after saving you from certain death and dumping you in a cave, then he just dies via drowning by getting stuck under a rock and that's it for his story. He never gets brought up again and is never addressed why he decided to attack you in the tower and then save you from it.[/spoiler]\n\nAnd unfortunately this is pretty much how the entire story goes, it starts off really strong, getting a setting going, getting the villians and allies set up, some good world building, some lore, then halfway through the game it just kinda gives up [spoiler]the Big Bad Mother set up as some god like deity being bestowed by the gods just makes a giant cat out of rocks and then dies as easily as any agent, General Chrome survives an anti-Ivory injection given by ONE OF THEIR OWN TROOPERS for no real reason and then gets injected by the same Injection later by Elor and then dies from that for no reason, no real questions raised throughout the entire thing are answered and turns out entire thing happens because of Bird Aliens who ride space ships that look like worms, tries to take the Ivory off the planet i guess until you kill him and then his space ship kills him and..... that's it every one lives happily ever after, never mind that there're still leaders and troopers for the White Goo Scientologists who don't have any reason to stop what they're doing and actively are still out there, never mind the fact there are hundreds if not thousands dead from rioting and genocide via Scientologists, nah everythings cool now and I guess Robin's Daddy Issues(?!?) are resolved? If not for that I have no idea what the point was behind that scene when robin gets mind fucked by the space sperm ship.[/spoiler]\n\nAll that being said that wouldn't be necessarily the worst thing (Yeah I know Hur Dur, story in a platformer), except around halfway into the game it gets incredibly story focused with the dungeons and puzzles slowly getting replaced with straight corridor combat sequences with previous enemies and increasingly simple puzzles with increasingly easy and confusing bosses with long winded story cutscenes gradually taking up more and more and more of the actual play time.", "timestamp_created": 1530571460, "timestamp_updated": 1530571664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43250987": {"recommendationid": "43250987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048977350", "num_games_owned": 2255, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1320, "last_played": 1547301228}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay, visuals and music are all top notch.

An absolutely atypical setting sets it aside from all other games of its genre and others. If I were in the habit of scoring the different creative aspects of the game out of the usual 10, I would probably give out:\n\nSetting: 9\nPlot: 7.5\nCharacters: 6\nMusic: 9.5\nArt: 8\n\nNo distinct goal from the beginning stops the plot from being overly interesting, and changing goalposts result in a few \"Well now what\" moments. Ultimately, the story is about the planet, rather than the characters or their direct motivations, so if a good setting is enough for you to put money down, then it's a win/win for you. I am a sucker for dying planet stories. The characters though, either don't get enough time to shine or become somewhat predictable (and there's one point late in the story where you're introduced to a large number of characters at once and it's kinda jarring).\n\nCalling Iconoclasts a Metroidvania is an... interesting label, to say the least. It certainly has a Metroid style map, and you can get items to craft upgrades... But you can only equip 3, for the entire game. So once you've got your loadout, each pickup becomes merely a fun puzzle or completionist's habit, rather than to inherently power yourself up.\n\nA similarity that comes to mind is Owlboy; a rather linear game that upgrades only very few times, but plenty of things remain collectible around the world for those willing to probe at it. However, if your money was on the line and you had to pick Owlboy or Iconoclasts, my suggestion would be Iconoclasts all the way.\n\nEither way you slice it, it's a great game with fantastic music that doesn't stray into \"Okay bored now skipping all the upgrades\" like I did with other recent Metroidvanias like Guacamelee and... actual Metroid. A great weekend game if you're into the genre, or looking to get into it.

If not, be prepared to be get thoroughly confused by this review, because I'm about to mention a lot of things that don't make sense.\n\nIn a world where Ivory is the rarest material, and Fate decides everything, young Robin wishes to become a mechanical wizard. Fixing things, screwing bolts, that sort of stuff. Unforunately, she'll not get the chance, and instead have to fight monsters and members of the One Concern, the mild threat of the Earth, as well as The Starworm (This game's God).\n\nThe catch with this game is that as you do, you begin getting roped into hundreds of different things that you shouldn't. There's a youtube channel called Gellot who did every boss fight in this game, and I highly suggest you go watch it if you don't feel like going through meager gameplay with absolutely stunning backgrounds and difficult puzzles.\n\nThe issue is, as much as I enjoyed the game, I stopped enjoying myself around the sixth hour.\n\nThat's right. The SIXTH hour. My time is one of the fastest blind runs of the game, and that's not a joke. I can honestly admit that the final boss of the game, [spoiler]The Starworm and the strange bird person that comes out of it for some reason[/spoiler] is actually less final than the boss that came before it. The game is stunning, visually, but nowadays a visual game with thin gameplay is harder to enjoy than it should. The puzzles seem overally tedious at points, despite having very unique mechanical structure (The electrical grenades, for example), but they're not used past the place they get introduced.\n\nDon't get it twisted, by the way; I still enjoyed myself. I've not had a better experience with a metroidvania, and with the release of CrossCode approaching it got me hyped to play it, but I do need to emphasise the fact that you'll be playing a game with less game than I feel it deserved.\n\nSo, still here? Still not convinced about whether you should buy or not? Good, my complaints can now begin much worse.\n\nWhat the hell was that final boss? I feel so bogged out by the concept that I couldn't enjoy the anticlimatic ending that came after it. Funnily enough, as stated above, the pennultimate boss was the boss I enjoyed the most, because not only did it utilise all the tools you picked up, it was absolutely terrifying in concept. I wish I could play it again without having to go through everything again.\n\nBecause, as stated above, this game is EIGHT HOURS LONG. That's without all the sidequests and collectables getting in the way. I didn't do any of them, as I kinda gave up looking for them after the first one took me thirty minutes to try and do, only for it to glitch out and have no importance to the story.\n\nSo, overall, for all its kinks and mysteries, as well as hard-to-enjoy gameplay, odd puzzling....\n\n7/10?\n\nFortunately for Iconoclasts, I found myself continously dragged back inside the world. The characters were easy to love, and the villians were easy to hate. I found myself wanting to help Robin more and more as she traversed the lands, fighting to see her brother and friends again. I genuinely felt sorry for Royal, a character who only wanted to help Robin, after he [spoiler]ended up getting turned essentially braindead by The Starworm and begged Robin to leave him for dead[/spoiler] during the final act. Elro's tragic backstory and constant abuse, Mina's family woes; I watched it all and wanted to help them at every twist and turn.\n\nSo, if you really want to, I'm down to recommend the game. However, just stay aware that the game's gonna take a while to beat, and it's up to you if it's because of the sidequests or the difficult areas.", "timestamp_created": 1529251011, "timestamp_updated": 1529251050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472972989082336426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42781072": {"recommendationid": "42781072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077642205", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1529216717}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is amazing, and then continues being amazing for a good 10+ hours rather than leaving all too soon.

While typically open-world and non-linear like most Metroidvania games, Iconoclasts's story carefully weaves itself together to intermingle with the gameplay so that neither of them clash, encouraging players to engage with the world while seeing where the story would take them next as they collected as much missing loot as possible. [spoiler] I also found the \"give the world one last chance\" arc to be a nice touch as it helped to wrap up some loose ends while proving that despite the current situation being grim, there was still a glimmer of hope in saving it. [/spoiler] And speaking of gameplay, I was pretty amazed at how forgiving the checkpoint system was. For instance, if you died to a boss, you would only wind up at the pre-boss cutscene; whereas dying outside of boss battles would only take you back to the start of the room [spoiler] (or the start of the area, in the case of the final area, which is beyond unforgiving). [/spoiler] The tweaks were also quite the helpful bonus, although I will admit I did find myself keeping at least one Iron Heart all the way through to the end (my personal favourite tweak is Meditation, in case you were wondering).\n\nThe characters in the game are also pretty neat, especially the main ones. Seriously, how can you deny the cuteness of Robin saying her name by using a pictorial bubble of the bird she was named after? My personal favourite overall character, however, definitely has to be Agent Black, and for a good reason. She's just so sassy and down-to-earth, and her speech near the end was certainly one of the most heart-breaking moments in the game. At least by the end, her soul has managed to find peace (rest well, Madelyn Binoche). Mina and Royal are definitely a close second for me, especially Mina, who was a lot of fun to ally with and play as. The only two characters I didn't like were Elro and Mother, the former for his hypocrisy near the end and the latter for only getting around .5 seconds of screen time (ngl, all she does is attack you with a giant cat and then dies afterward).\n\nPerhaps the main highlight for me are the boss fights. Every fight felt more different and unique than the last, and the bosses themselves are also some of the most non-conventional that I've fought thus far. Furthermore, each boss has their own unique set of attacks so even repeat bosses wouldn't feel so boring. Some of the bosses are pretty challenging, but in a good way, and will occasionally provide you with health pickups in case you ever got yourself in a pinch.\n\nOf course, not every game is perfect, and Iconoclasts is no execption to this rule. Here are a couple of things that I nitpicked while playing through the game:\n- I REALLY wish you didn't fight the Silver Watchman in random rooms. I remember getting unlucky both times because the rooms I ended up in had me cornered\n- We didn't get much information on what those blue eye things were, though my theory is that they're a parasitic species that are attracted to whatever (or whoever) has Ivory inside of them. [spoiler] This could explain why they were so quick to latch onto Agent Black and (possibly) the Silver Watchman [/spoiler]\n- Just a minor one on my end, but I was slightly disappointed that Royal didn't get his own playable segment. I know that the reason for this is due to him not having any weapons on his person save for his psychic powers, but still\n[spoiler] - The alien bird guy.

I'm a big fan of Metroidvania-type platform-shooters (and as a result, I've played a pretty decent amount of them, I think), and this one manages to get a lot of things right and do justice to the genre while really standing on its own, both stylistically and with regards to gameplay.  Controls are tight and well-tuned (if a tad unforgiving at times--but that's fine, I don't like my games to hold my hand), combat is fun and often fast-paced, and there are lots of great, frantic boss fights.  I do see some people in the reviews complaining that they didn't know what to do in certain parts (primarily boss fights), but that's kind of the point of the game--it rewards trial and error and expects that you'll need to take a few tries of finding out what does and does not work and building on that (and I'm totally fine with that because--again--I don't like games to just hold my hand).  The game has a very strong puzzle element to it which is really refreshing in the genre.  This one had me scratching my head a few times but with just a little bit of patience I was able figure each part out.  If you really get stuck, there are plenty of YouTube playthrough videos out there to help (I'll admit, I had to consult those once or twice, but it ended up being something obvious that I had overlooked).  Another thing this game manages to get right is backtracking.  In a lot of games like this, you have to backtrack a lot; while there is some backtracking in this game, it's not overboard by any means (unless you're going for 100% completion, and even then it really isn't too bad at all), and even when I was backtracking I didn't find myself getting bored or anything.  For those who dare to go for a 100% completion, be prepared for some VERY tough (but fun) boss battles.  The secret boss fights are ridiculously fast-paced; an absolute treat for any fan of the genre.  Regarding difficulty, while I can't speak for the normal mode (because I didn't play it), I can say that the \"harder\" mode had a great challenge level that kept me on my toes through the entire game.  Finally, I have to remark that this game has a really great aesthetic style; the art, music, and story are very well done and fit together nicely.  I rather like how each character is quite flawed and jam-packed with emotional baggage and trauma, just as you'd expect (unless you've lived your entire life in some kind of Stepford community).\n\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this game and heartily recommend it, especially to fans of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1528082446, "timestamp_updated": 1528082446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42477873": {"recommendationid": "42477873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073088368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 1318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1661619025}, "language": "english", "review": "I have just recently finished this game and I have to say that this game is AMAZING for a Metroidvania game.

I only started playing it today, but I can tell I'm going to stick through till the end. The visuals are amazing looking, nice art style. Sort of 16 bit but way more colors and artistry. The soundtrack is enjoyable. The game play is some of the best! Very well done with tight controls and the puzzles are challenging without being imposible. Great use of abilities in puzzle solving, platforming, and combat! The story so far is compelling and the characters are interesting. There are sections where you have to use more than one character and there is crafting and item upgrades that are very RPG like. A little bit of everything that makes for an excellent experience!

It's not perfect, it's got its flaws, but I really love it. \n\nStart off to say, this game's main strengths are its art and its story. The animations are realy fluid and springy and cute and really well done, and everything is bright and colorful and happy. We'll get to story in a bit. \n\nPersonally, the gameplay isn't quite as amazing as I would have liked, but that's A-OK. It's a puzzle platformer which usually is a genre that leaves a lot to be desired on its own, so I don't fault it. Generally the puzzles themselves were fun and not too annoying (other than the elevators in the tower stage!!! I hated those, but it wasn't a huge deal.) The bosses are mostly just figure out what to do and then ya know, just do it. It's acceptable! There are \"tweaks\" but they're not really.... too amazing. Again, eh, it's whatever. \n\nOnly con I'd have to say is the side quests were really just kind of not good. I don't have anything good to say about them. They're very lose, the rewards are not great, the writing for them seems tacked on and a bit lazy, and the gameplay just sort of ends up being \"go here, and then go back\" and repeat 3 times. At the very least, they're just side quests and because the rewards are so bad, you really do not ever need to do them. Bit of a shame still. \n\nAnyway, the thing that really clicked for me more than anything was the story. I really loved it. I know a lot of people complain that tonally its all over the place, and honestly? It really is. The tone goes mental. But I love that about it. It keeps you on your toes, and when the serious stuff really goes down it feels a little jarring, yeah, but then it also really sticks with you. It felt very real and I guess \"organic\" you could say. \n\nThe worldbuilding is really done a lot better than you'd expect. In so little words and so few actions, you're thrust onto this strange planet with all sorts of strange customs and religions and you kind of just accept it easily. Sometimes things can get a little confusing because of this, but overall I really like it better this way than years and years of dialogue explaining that there's TWO MOONS and wHY IS ONE BROKEN and HERE IS WHAT THE CONCERN DOES EXACTLy and what not. It really hooked me into this place and I wanted to really know what made the place tick and why it went down. \n\nMy favorite thing would have to be the characters, though. I love them. They're all very \"real\" again. Sure, they have weird super powers, are very extremely exaggerated, but they come from a place I think everyone should be able to understand. Everyone's got faults and stuff that they don't like, and some are more faulted than others (YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT) but the writing never excuses what they do and tries to say oh they're a great person really. Yeah, again, you could easily say its pretty amateur and I think on some levels it is, but again, I couldn't explain it, it just felt really good. You could tell the developer really put their heart and soul into this and tried their best and I respect that. I love the characters at their bests and at their worsts. \n\nThing I like was that this game was able to make me laugh and make me feel generally pretty sad at times too. It was often unexpected, but that was kind of what made it special. The story and the characters stick with you even when the game is over and leave you wanting more. \n\nIf you're looking for a game for JUST platforming, I don't think this is gonna be for you. Gameplay is acceptable, but nothing outstanding. Grab Celeste for the opposite of this. Decent story, but much better platforming. This game is meant for a good story with some decent platforming. \n\nAnd again, it is not without its flaws.
