Basically you go to a certain point and watch the next cutscene play. The most intense part is you pressing up and down at the same time to shred some bread.\n\n[b]The story:[/b]\nAnd within the story lies the problem of 'a bird story', as it may not be bad, but sure is boring. Basically you play a kid, who [spoiler]finds a bird that has hurt his wing and then cares for it. The bird proceeds to get healthy, but the boy develops an unhealthy obsession for the bird, which leads to him jumping to his death, killing himself and the bird. Strangely both survive and the bird then gets captured by another bird and in what can only be described as a stockholm syndrom the bird then falls in love with it's capturer. The game ends by giving a happy end, as the bird visits it's boy once more.[/spoiler] The game also features two scenes, which have absolutely no impact on the story and just lead to nothing, as [spoiler]you walk around in a strange time-loop-thingy, probably seeing your favourite moments of life before you die (which would make the life of the boy a very sad life)[/spoiler].\n\n[b]Music, graphic and technical stuff:[/b]\nThe music is what you would expect, much piano and repetition, the graphic... I mean, you can see that yourself. The technical side really pulls the game down, as movement is very clunky and I couldn't even get the game to start, when another game was running in the background (sorry fellow idle-gamers).\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\nThe game may have worked as a cute video (with better graphics for sure), but not as a game. I got nothing out of it, but perhaps some people are looking out for a nice little story about friendship or so and want to spend a quiet hour - then this one is for you. If this is worth a buck for you, then you can certainly spend it worse than on 'a bird story'. But if you are looking for a deep story, you can even find much better games in the developers catalogue within the 'To The Moon' series.

The price tag is well justified and I would encourage anyone who likes a great story to jump on this one - and the others (To The Moon, Finding Paradise, and Imposter Factory) IMMEDIATELY. This is a series you NEED in your library.\n\nThe thing that makes these titles so special is the fact that they're very thoughtful and have complicated storylines, and they run the gamut of content - from light and funny, to dark and serious, to hopeful, heart-broken, upset, happy, and everything in between. This series is one of those that when you start one of the games, you just won't be able to stop until it's finished, and each one has a lot of content/story. Once you start playing, you'll be gripped by it and just HAVE to know how things turn out.. and you'll probably sit there playing until it's done. AMAZING, AMAZING stories.\n\nBasic concept (which, I don't think this will be a spoiler, but I'll hide it anyway): [spoiler] Ever had something you know you're going to regret on your deathbed? Maybe you wish you had done this thing, or made that choice. Now your life is over, and you're regretting how things turned out. What if there was a way to truly believe you HAD done that thing or made that choice? The company Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene work at does just that - on your deathbed, they burrow into your memories, find out what makes you tick, and implant a series of new memories into your head - overwriting the old memories - so that as you pass away, you do so happy with the way things turn out.[/spoiler]\n\nThe great thing about each story is diving into it, figuring out what makes each character tick, finding out all about them... and it's told in such an amazing way. I can't tell you enough how fantastic this developer is at telling stories.\n\nMy recommendation is to play them in order. While each episode is a \"self-contained\" episode, it really benefits the player to play them in order. Kinda like how if you watch different episodes of your favorite TV show... sure, each show might be a self-contained story, but you don't get the full context unless you watch them in order.\n\nTo The Moon\nFinding Paradise\nA Bird Story\nImposter Factory\n\nSome folks might disagree and say A Bird Story should come before Finding Paradise, since it sorta comes chronologically before FP... But one of the things that makes each story great is \"getting to know\" the people involved... and I feel like \"A Bird Story\" is better viewed as the \"deleted scenes\" of a movie, rather than as a prequel. If you watch the deleted scenes on a DVD first, maybe it won't \"spoil\" the movie, but it just doesn't feel right. Play FP first, and then dive a little deeper with ABS.\n\nGet all 4 of these immediately. This is one of the few storyline games that got me a little choked up. I absolutely LOVE the characters and every bit of these stories was phenomenal. I couldn't possibly recommend them any more. They are well worth the full price. I had... SO much fun, and I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the next chapters from this developer. STUNNING story. Easy gameplay.

This review takes a dispassionate look at the intricate elements that compose this short-lived experience, dissecting the narrative nuances, gameplay limitations, and thematic subtleties that, while carrying moments of inspiration, ultimately fall short of the desired crescendo. As the narrative's wings flutter between poignant intent and unfulfilled promise, it's imperative to unravel the fabric of \"A Bird Story\" within the context of its shortcomings.\n\nNARRATIVE FRAGMENTATION AND ABSENCE OF COHERENCE\nFreebird Games' hallmark of minimalist storytelling takes center stage in \"A Bird Story,\" yet the narrative feels like scattered jigsaw pieces rather than a coherent picture. The lack of exposition and overt guidance could have been an alluring gambit, but it only succeeds in rendering the experience disjointed and inaccessible. The titular bird's allegorical journey is laden with the unspoken and unsaid, occasionally veering toward abstraction that impedes emotional resonance.\n\nThe protagonist's interactions with the bird, while symbolically poignant, are curiously disconnected. The relationship, purportedly the emotional fulcrum, lacks the necessary context and development to anchor the narrative's weightier themes. Instead, these interactions manifest as fragmented interludes, rendering it challenging for players to forge a tangible emotional connection.\n\nLACKING GAMEPLAY ENGAGEMENT AND MECHANICAL REPETITION:\nWhile \"A Bird Story\" leans into its narrative over gameplay, the scant interactive elements present seldom succeed in evoking a meaningful experience. The gameplay components gravitate between moments of mechanical repetition and sporadic puzzles that feel incongruous with the game's overall tone. The game's lack of engagement extends to its exploration segments, where limited interactivity combined with a lack of clear objectives render them a tedious exercise in aimlessness.\n\nThe narrative's brevity compounds the gameplay's struggles, leaving players yearning for deeper engagement or more substantial interludes. This shortcoming curtails the potential for emotional immersion, forcing players to navigate through underwhelming gameplay segments to glean the sporadic emotional resonance that exists.\n\nAUDIOVISUAL PALETTE AND ITS IMPEDIMENTS\n\"A Bird Story\" presents itself as an understated visual painting that oscillates between idyllic charm and stark minimalism. While the pixelated aesthetic carries a nostalgic note, it often obscures details that could have enriched the narrative's world-building and emotional resonance. This visual approach, while intentional, inadvertently contributes to the game's thematic murkiness and narrative detachment.\n\nThe audio landscape, while attempting to weave an auditory tapestry, occasionally falters in its impact. The sporadic musical cues and minimal sound effects do little to augment the narrative's emotional undercurrent, leaving moments that should have been emotionally resonant feeling muted and underwhelming.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\"A Bird Story\" occupies a dissonant space between thematic aspiration and unfulfilled execution. The narrative's fragmented approach, while potentially intriguing, results in a lack of coherence that undermines the emotional engagement. The interplay between protagonist and bird remains a missed opportunity, lacking the development required to foster genuine empathy.\n\nGameplay mechanics, though not the primary focus, lack the necessary engagement to augment the narrative's emotional intent, leading to moments of mechanical repetition and aimlessness. While the visual and auditory components hold potential, their impact is marred by the game's thematic ambiguity and fragmented narrative progression.\n\nUltimately, \"A Bird Story\" aspires to invoke an emotional journey through simplicity, yet its disjointed narrative and lackluster gameplay restrain its capacity to resonate. As the ephemeral fragments of this avian tale flutter by, they leave behind an incomplete canvas that fails to paint a coherent or impactful narrative. A culmination of thematic aspirations and gameplay limitations lead to a disheartening conclusion, resulting in an experience that regrettably falls short of its intended flight.\n\nSOME FINAL WORDS:\nIf you found this review useful, please share your opinion with a like and/or an award: it would be appreciated for the effort I have dedicated to the community.", "timestamp_created": 1692703468, "timestamp_updated": 1692703468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504730820655822754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144668964": {"recommendationid": "144668964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201034138", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1692561959}, "language": "english", "review": "just a short emotional story about a boy and his best bird friend", "timestamp_created": 1692562528, "timestamp_updated": 1692562528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627329170703887939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144610369": {"recommendationid": "144610369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155257815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1692500058}, "language": "english", "review": "whoever cry on this, life is too tough for you. just no", "timestamp_created": 1692500202, "timestamp_updated": 1692500202, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421558141708374023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144569072": {"recommendationid": "144569072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878776570", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113, "last_played": 1692455353}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play Finding Paradise or To the Moon.

The story revolves around a young boy and an injured bird, the story leaving a profound impression on myself despite its short length.\n\nThe wordless storytelling showcases Kan's craftsmanship, utilizing subtle expressions and music to convey the narrative. The captivating tone keeps players engaged throughout, with unexpected surprises like a Benny Hill Show reference. Character development is strong, fostering quick attachment to the cast and showcasing Kan's storytelling prowess.\n\nGameplay is minimal, leaning towards an interactive visual novel style. While lacking puzzles and extensive dialogue like \"To The Moon,\" the interconnected locations prevent wasted time and create a dream-like experience.\n\nVisually, \"A Bird Story\" maintains the charming old-school RPG aesthetics of \"To The Moon,\" with stunning portraits and backgrounds that become even more impressive towards the end. The instrumental soundtrack, masterfully composed by Gao, complements the wordless nature of the game, transporting players back to memorable moments.\n\nRather than a sequel, \"A Bird Story\" demonstrates the importance of artists venturing into new territory. Kan Gao delivers a truly wonderful experience that will touch players' hearts and is worth the investment. While eagerly awaiting the next game, it's evident that the wait after \"To The Moon\" was worthwhile.

This style of storytelling continues with A Bird Story, a minisode bridging the gap between To the Moon and Finding Paradise.\n\n[h2] A Boy And His Bird [/h2]\n\nWhen we meet the young boy, he's living the typical life of a latch-key kid. His day consists of waking up, going to school, returning home, doing homework, and going to sleep.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the boy is alone. Sure, there's a parent present, but the only sign of their existence is the notes they leave for the boy.\n\nTo escape the tedium of his daily routine, the boy spends his time making paper planes and daydreaming about flying away. One day after school, this routine is interrupted when he rescues an injured bird. The boy takes it upon himself to take care of his new friend and nurse it back to health.\n\nThus begins a story of loneliness, friendship, and belonging. Much like To the Moon, the narrative isn't likely to blow your mind or shift your entire worldview, but it is told with absolute sincerity, nuance, and deep emotional resonance. Even though someone more cynical might consider its message of \"if you love something, let it go\" to be a cliche, that doesn't make it any less true.\n\n[h2] Scenes From a Dream [/h2]\n\nThe entire narrative is told purely through visuals, without writing or dialogue of any kind (there's even a fakeout where it looks like you'll see one of the notes left for the boy, but the letters are blurred beyond recognition). When the characters do have something to communicate, they do it through comic-strip thought bubbles with simple images.\n\nPlaying A Bird Story feels a lot like watching a dream. Many of the events aren't meant to be taken literally, and the game makes frequent use of \"dream logic\" by condensing and expanding space and time for narrative purposes.\n\nLike To the Moon, the pixel graphics look like the game was made in RPG Maker. The display resolution is still stuck at 640 * 480, but the scrolling is noticeably smoother than in To the Moon. The music is also pleasant and unobtrusive and acts more like wallpaper - supporting the scene playing out rather than informing your emotional response.\n\n[h2] Point and Click [/h2]\n\nA Bird Story plays like a super-simplified version of a point-and-click adventure. This means that you'll spend most of the game moving the boy around using the mouse or arrow keys. Interacting with objects isn't all that frequent, and when it does happen, the objects that require your attention are clearly marked.\n\nAside from some special prompts (like pressing two keys at once to perform an action), that's pretty much it. There are no puzzles or challenges that would take away from you simply experiencing the narrative.\n\nFrom the two control schemes, using the mouse is clearly superior. It gives you more precise control of the main character and makes it easier to hit the interactive objects.\n\nOne major downside is that you can't pause the game during cutscenes, instead having to wait until you regain control of the main character. This isn't a huge problem since the game isn't all that long, but can be annoying if you have to quickly step away from your PC.\n\n[h2] Worth Your Time [/h2]\n\nEven though A Bird Story is noticeably shorter than any other Freebird Games title, I still think it's well worth your time. It tells a poignant story in an appealing way, and honestly, that's more than you can say for most modern games.\n\n[b] TLDR: [/b] A short point-and-click adventure about a boy and his bird friend.\n[b] Pros: [/b] Emotional storytelling, pleasing audio-visual design.\n[b] Cons: [/b] Not very interactive, difficult to pause.\n\n[h3] Final Score: 7/10 [/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1675853498, "timestamp_updated": 1675853498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132358702": {"recommendationid": "132358702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121012571", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1675755897}, "language": "english", "review": "made me care about a little bird more than basically any other character i've encountered in a game before. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1675756101, "timestamp_updated": 1675756101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132303061": {"recommendationid": "132303061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127214277", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1647484630}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego super bonito, totalmente recomendado!!!", "timestamp_created": 1675659558, "timestamp_updated": 1675659558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132302481": {"recommendationid": "132302481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084440251", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1675657883}, "language": "english", "review": "The feels that this game has made me feel without any words, text, or dialogue, have managed to mend my broken heart, break it again, then mend it again. \n\nThere were no words!

Although it chronologically takes place before [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/]Finding Paradise[/url][/u] and adds some backstory to that game specifically, you can easily skip it since it isn't a necessity. Overall, I don't recommend it because it barely has any gameplay elements, the silent aspect paired with the minimal player interaction makes its one-hour playtime overstay its welcome, the story is more sentimental and emotional rather than thrilling and captivating, the game is lacking the cast that really makes the franchise shine, and the game isn't a necessary component to the franchise as a whole.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[quote][b]A C H I E V E M E N T S[/b][/quote]\n\nThe game has a single achievement which is acquired when you beat the game. A normal playthrough takes one hour so it's pretty easy to get \u2014 you'll just have to put the time in.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[quote][b]R E V I E W[/b][/quote]\n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\nThe gameplay is almost non-existent. Although it technically is an interactive RPG, the only things you'll do are walk around and occasionally interact with a few objects here and there. Otherwise, you're just along for the ride and it's more akin to watching a silent movie rather than playing an actual game.\n\n[h3]Graphics[/h3]\nThe graphics are nice to look at and use 16-bit pixel art. The character sprites are very well animated and this helps convey the emotion of the story since there is no text in the game besides some speech bubble emotes. The game also has some lovely landscape pictures which would make for great wallpapers.\n\n[h3]Sound[/h3]\nThe music is mostly composed of soft atmospheric songs (including some soft piano songs) which help set the mood and tone of the various scenes. None of the songs stood out in particular though.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is the main focus of the game and the sentimental and emotional tale helps give some backstory to the main character. As previously mentioned, there is no text in this game and you're basically watching a silent movie so it will take a bit of getting used to. Most of the scenes are actually mind-bending and baffling, heavily blurring the line between fiction and reality, and this might make you question some things about the main character.\n\nAlthough the game is charming in its own way, and also has a few funny moments, I find that the absence of the original cast from [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/?curator_clanid=2750327]To the Moon[/url][/u] really detracts from the game because it lacks the well-written script, hilarious jokes and puns, and likeable characters that are among the franchise's strong suits. I also found that story didn't really move me and I started to lose interest by the last 10 minutes of the game because it felt like it was dragging on unnecessarily. Since I am also more invested in the franchise's overall worldbuilding than I am the individual games' stories, I had even less of an interest in this game since it basically has no tie-in to the current-day world used in the rest of the franchise.\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nOverall, I don't recommend it unless you really enjoy sentimental and emotional stories, you really like animal-nursing stories, you want to have even more backstory for [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/?curator_clanid=2750327]Finding Paradise[/url][/u], or you're just an avid fan of the franchise. It's not a bad game by any means but I don't think it stands up to the rest of the franchise and it certainly isn't a game for everyone.\n\nThat being said, if you purchased it and weren't happy then [b]Freebird Games[/b] offers a very generous refund policy which you can find here: [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/327410/discussions/0/613941122665882456/]Freebird Games' purchasing policy[/url][/u].

I also have to give credit for all the visual symbolism throughout, which gives the game its own identity, while showing connections to the same setting and style as \"To the Moon\". \n\nBut, I'm sorry, I can't recommend playing this game, either. \"To the Moon\" was about 4 to 5 hours, so you could play it in the span of an afternoon. This game, on the other hand, was just over ONE hour, and it has about as much mileage as I would expect. I also found the plot, while charming and visually interesting, to be a bit predictable and saccharine, something along the lines of a \"Full House\" episode.\n\nAnother issue I have is that this game's plot ends up revealing TOO much; I can't help but feel like I ended up spoiling the plot of \"Finding Paradise\" for myself. It's clear that they want this game to be set in the same universe as \"To the Moon\" and present it in a similar way. The problem is they do it beat for beat, and I was quickly putting together what will happen in \"Finding Paradise\". The plotline in this game is the earliest memory, and the motivation, for the client in the next game, \"Finding Paradise,\" most likely after being altered by Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts, meaning they fulfilled his final wish. At the time of writing, I haven't played \"Finding Paradise\", but I now know that's exactly whats going to happen, which will take away from the mystery and suspense of my first playthrough of that game. It's fine to make an in-between game that gives hints, clues, and gets the player excited for the next mainline entry, but not at the cost of giving away the ending. It defeats the purpose of playing the next game in the series. I feel like this should've been an unlockable bonus mode included in \"Finding Paradise\" that you play after finishing the main campaign.\n\nAs I mentioned in my \"To the Moon\" review, this is a plot that would work better as a cartoon or a comic, not an interactive video game; because it just ends up being a tour through set pieces that keeps the player on autopilot throughout their playthrough. Actually playing the game and interacting with the environment or NPC's is too limited and brief. Just like the previous game, I recommend that you watch a \"Let's Play\", and buy the soundtrack on the developers' Band Camp page, instead.\n\nThe game is only five dollars, but you'll regret spending even THAT much, and wish it was only a free demo.", "timestamp_created": 1671252214, "timestamp_updated": 1671252214, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128685003": {"recommendationid": "128685003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217043256", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1696810275}, "language": "english", "review": "I gave it a bad review, but after playing Finding Paradise I change my opinion", "timestamp_created": 1671225145, "timestamp_updated": 1671314814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128593281": {"recommendationid": "128593281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057108901", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1669842006}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended", "timestamp_created": 1671094332, "timestamp_updated": 1671094332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128518454": {"recommendationid": "128518454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332852848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1670980545}, "language": "english", "review": "Glad I got this heavily on sale despite the low base price.

It had an amazing story with excellent writing and dialogue along with one of my favourite soundtracks I have ever heard from a game. The only complaint I had with it was how minimal the gameplay it had was.\n\nI have to say this because this game lacks a lot of what made \"To the Moon\" so good. There is no writing at all in the game the story is told completely visually and through gameplay. This is where the issue show itself, if the gameplay you do have isn't the best, telling your story through your gameplay is not the best idea. The game consists almost entirely of just holding a single direction on your keyboard for a few minutes, watching a short event happen then you hold a new direction. It becomes a chore to get through especially at parts like the paper air-plane section that just felt never ending. There are no characters to get invested in so there feels little motivation to continue playing. The game only takes about an hour to beat, but it felt like triple that amount by the end. \n\nNow, I understand that this is an experimental short from the creator and they never planned any grand story like their other games, and we should never judge a game by the standards of something it was never attempting to do in the first place. However, this is simply a question of if I recommend this game or not, and sadly I cannot bring myself to recommend it, unless you are just starved for more content from freebird games.", "timestamp_created": 1663960423, "timestamp_updated": 1663960423, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122699670": {"recommendationid": "122699670", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972261382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1663957827}, "language": "english", "review": "A hard down-thumb for this \"game\".  I love Freebird's games, but this is not a game.  It's a movie, interspersed with brief and useless moments where you're given the choice between (A) walking in the direction you're supposed to walk, or (B) not walking in the direction you're supposed to walk.\n\nThere is no save option.  I'd give it a down-thumb just for that.  I quit nearly an hour into it, and am deleting it from my account, because I'll never suffer through those 50 minutes again just to find out what might happen next.\n\nIt's artfully told, but\n(A) It is a story so gentle and cute that it's boring.\n(B) You don't find out a single interesting thing in the first half hour of \"play\". You're just forced to walk here and there, with no idea who you are, what you should be doing, or why you should care. Nothing you do in this time has any significance.\n(C) You have NO AGENCY at all.  Whenever you get to anything mildly interesting, the computer seizes control of your character and walks it through it.\n(D) You aren't even given anything to figure out.  Even when you're doing pointless background-noise tasks, the computer tells you exactly what to do, with icons and arrows.\n\nMy guess is that the intent behind this game is for you to spend the first half-hour sympathizing with the main character because he/she has NO ONE in his/her life.  All the other children are just shadows, non-entities, and the kid's parents apparently sneak in only at night, to leave food in the refrigerator and notes on its door.  No one but this one bird.\n\nBut I DON'T sympathize with someone who has no one in his life despite having people all around him.  Maybe if I were autistic--not ASD as in \"I like to stay indoors and play videogames\", but Murderbot-Diaries-level autism--I'd sympathize with this character, and find A Bird Story a moving work of art.

I went into A Bird Story expecting to love it, which is why I was so surprised that this game just did not click with me. I think a big part of this is the lack of dialogue. To The Moon excelled in telling it's story because of how well it was written, and because the characters felt so fleshed out, and had amazing chemistry with one another. A Bird Story tells it's story with no words whatsoever. That's not to say it completely fails, it tells its story well enough, and the story IS cute and a little bit heartwarming, unfortunately it's just such a bore to sit through. A say sit through and not play through because probably 65% of this game is simply watching cutscenes. This isn't a bad thing, a lot of games I love have a lot of cutscenes, but the cutscenes in A Bird Story just aren't as effective as they could be. Characters' faces are blurred out, with most other people in the game being transparent outlines, an odd choice I think. I just didn't feel as engaged, or interested in the story this game had to offer. The little gameplay there is simply involves walking in straight lines. A Bird Story doesn't do a lot wrong, it just doesn't do a lot of things very well is all. It feels unfinished, like a rough draft of a much bigger, much more interesting game. If you liked To The Moon, and really want to try it, go ahead, it's fairly cheap and only takes an hour to play through. You might enjoy it a lot more than I did.

I have eventually decided on a thumbs up, because this was sweet and heart-warming, and I guess that's what matters most especially in this kind of game.\nStill, I think this is a far lesser experience than any other I've tried from this developer.\nBefore playing this, I played To the Moon, Quintessence, and several older tiny games from Freebird. It was some time ago but I remember loving all of it, and for some time I wanted to giva a try to this one and Finding Paradise.\n\nSo, I knew what to expect (i.e. that this is more of a \"visual novel\", \"walking sim\" and those stuff).\nWhat I really liked in the aforementioned titles was that the writing was very strong. Also, although being very linear, passive \"games\", there were some moments with at least a MILD sense of actual gameplay.\n\nIn here, however, we indeed get no more than a walking simulator. In addition, there's no writing at all, since there are no dialogues.\nWhile those are not necessarily deal breakers for me, I didn't feel it was working very well in this one, as all in all MOST of the experience was dragged and rather boring, perhaps until the very last stages of the game, and that's a shame.\n\nAt least the other aspects of the game do not fall from the quality of previous products - the graphics are neat and elegant (for an RPG Maker game) and the music is pleasant and heart touching.\n\nIn the end of the game it is suggested that this is some sort of proglogue to Finding Paradise, which I  am yet to play, so I hope that A Bird Story will at least have some context and more essence once I'd play FP.", "timestamp_created": 1652542527, "timestamp_updated": 1652542527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601683914661407471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115181020": {"recommendationid": "115181020", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013139877", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1652051484}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not bad, but I think it's a bit boring. 80% is like a short film, you just watch and don't do anything else.

It's like To The Moon, but with even less gameplay. You'll probably be disappointed if you come into this expecting gameplay that actually affects the game. It's mostly just controlling a character to get from point A to point B.  There's nothing innovative here gameplay-wise. It's all about the story. It's also pretty short. Just about an hour in my case.\n\nI think it's really important to go into this game knowing all that, since all of the negative reviews seem to come from people who were expecting something more.\n\nNow, if you're fine with that, there's a fantastic story to be experienced here. You can probably play this without playing To The Moon, but there's gonna be some minor stuff that won't make sense. This includes the story's framing device that never actually gets explained in this game.

Even though I went into A Bird Story expecting literally nothing because I bought it on sale just to get an easy 100% completion, I thought maybe it could be interesting to play. As it turns out, there is very little playing involved and I found that I was sort of forced into paying attention so I could at least try to make it through this in a decent amount of time.\n\nThat didn't bother me though! I still generally enjoy these types of games, so I tried to keep an open mind as things were getting started.\n\nUnfortunately, I felt like it was kind of boring and my playtime is only as high as it is because I needed to take so many breaks to do something else because I couldn't focus or find it in me to care. You pretty much spend most of the game meandering around to activate cut scenes and if you're [i]really[/i] lucky, you occasionally get to press the space bar!\n\nI think all of the player \"interaction\" could be removed and the game would be exactly the same, as far as the mood and how you're meant to feel about everything goes. I'm actually not even sure why there was anything added to try to get the player involved at all because it was so simple and there were zero repercussions for failing any events in the game. For example, [spoiler]when you sneak the bird into your apartment building,[/spoiler] there's some kind of 'stealth mini-game' that just pushes you off to the side if you get caught and allows you to proceed without any problems. I don't see the point of having something like that in the game if it's meaningless.\n\nThere were some things I liked about A Bird Story though. The overall plot was fine and the way certain areas would blend into others to show a transition between scenes was neat. The art (especially the backgrounds [spoiler]when you do the flying segment with the nests[/spoiler]) was nice and the music was decent enough and even sometimes enjoyable.\n\nI think the biggest flaw was that throughout the entire the game, there were no difficult choices to make (there are actually no choices at all) and there is no dialogue. I recognize this wasn't exactly meant to be a game and I know that plenty of amazing stories can be told without words, but I don't think this is one of them. \n\nThis game felt more like it had no idea what it was trying to be and the only reason I think A Bird Story gained any traction at all is because of To The Moon and if it was made by anyone else, no one would be leaving positive reviews on this.\n\nI wish that I had felt something at the end of this game, but all I could think about was how glad I was to be able to uninstall and forget that this exists.", "timestamp_created": 1642494606, "timestamp_updated": 1642494748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570081233978271484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108250713": {"recommendationid": "108250713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240866654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1642485763}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't know how, i don't know why.

The game does a great job of displaying this concern. I didn't have a problem with this story until things got a little loopy. It would have been better if it had more of a realistic touch, but I can see -that a child with imagination- is one method to cope with the reality that you don't want to recognize. \n \n[h3]Fly High[/h3]\nFor how small the game is, it demonstrates the animation in a clear pixelated picture to understand what the character is doing, and it's good-looking, too.

The hour-long game tells the story of a lonely boy who rescues an injured bird, befriends the bird, and eventually learns that if you love something, and it\u2019s a bird, your story is probably heading toward a terribly clich\u00e9d conclusion.\n\nThough it\u2019s only an hour, the hour drags. There are sweet little moments\u2014the boy suspiciously peeking out to his balcony as the bird pops in and out of a bush\u2014but most of the scenes are soporific, only superficially interactive, and only occasionally interactive at all. Everything takes far too long to play out, showing me too much to say too little; I don't need to be present as every page of a notebook is torn out, for instance.\n\nAs for control, developer Freebird Games\u2014also responsible for the much acclaimed To the Moon\u2014is honest about what A Bird Story is: \u201can interactive pixel animation with the sole purpose of telling a simple story.\u201d It is simple, and it is interactive, in that I got to pointlessly walk around and pick up items on my own for a bit. But it wrested control from me so often it had to flash the arrow keys (not remappable) every time I was supposed to do the moving, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nBeing such a hands-off experience isn\u2019t an instant negative, as holding back interactivity can enhance the moments when it\u2019s returned. It doesn\u2019t work here. Except in a couple of scenes, my interactions did little to complement the story, or foster empathy toward its characters.\n\nEven so, I was always clawing for those interactive moments, because the time spent watching was so boring and hokey that I just wanted it over. A Benny Hill chase scene and out-of-place Mario reference give you a sense of how banal it is. Perhaps those were attempts to characterize the boy as playful despite his isolation and self-absorption, but they come off more like cute gags. And when it's not being cute, the pixel art animation isn\u2019t especially fun to watch. The boy's crude walking animation, for instance, kicks in moments after his sprite starts moving, and watching him slowly plod around is tiring.\n\nFor a few minutes out of the hour, I did feel A Bird Story come close to succeeding. I appreciated the lightly surreal world, especially. Other characters are shadows of people, and locations aren\u2019t logically connected or constructed; they\u2019re more like shorthand for places, a world built out of fading memories. If A Bird Story had used its world to say something interesting about memory or the isolation of a latchkey kid, I\u2019d appreciate it a lot more. It does present some sincere childhood feelings\u2014I liked hopping in puddles, the way school drags on, and how loneliness is patched with fantasy\u2014but it just sort of looks at those feelings. And then throws a bird in.\n\nFlying over imaginary landscapes is briefly liberating, and I liked some of the pixel art, especially the grass, foliage, and floating hunks of earth. The backgrounds, however, look sloppy (in an intentional, but not attractive way), and they\u2019re all off-perspective with the foreground. They aren\u2019t animated, either, so waterfalls are frozen in time. Meanwhile, creator Kan Gao\u2019s music may be well-composed, but its neverending plunking of bells and strings is too saccharine for my tastes. All of these things could be defended as stylistic decisions, but I find little to like about them.\n\nSeveral scenes take place on this balcony, and it just isn't very attractive.\nAs a film, A Bird Story is slow, dull, and sentimental. It\u2019s the kind of mawkish story Disney can get away with in shorts such as \u2018Feast,\u2019 because Disney\u2019s shorts are A) actually short and B) beautifully crafted. And this isn't a film: it's software that seems to have no interest in being software. There are no options whatsoever. You can hit Alt-Enter to send it to windowed mode, for instance, but it always starts fullscreen.\n\nMany of these criticisms could be made of the much better To the Moon, with its identical engine and very similar style, but it\u2019s much better regardless. Clicking through dialogue choices and wandering around make me feel present in its story\u2014something A Bird Story mostly lacks\u2014and it\u2019s poignant without being too schmaltzy. It\u2019s also much funnier.\n\nTo Freebird\u2019s credit, it offers \u201cno-questions-asked\u201d refunds, even if its games just aren't \u201cyour cup of tea.\u201d I think a cup of tea might have been nicer. I don\u2019t enjoy clobbering the work of a spirited independent developer, but A Bird Story isn't a good example of the storytelling I know Freebird is capable of. I enjoyed a few moments of expressive animation and sweetness\u2014playing it wasn't a harrowing experience, just not a good one\u2014but got to the credits feeling disappointed. It ends with a teaser for the upcoming \u2018Finding Paradise,\u2019 and that\u2019s what the whole thing feels like: a very bloated teaser for another, possibly better interactive animation.

A Bird Story doesn't follow our two favourite doctors, but it does reveal a lot more back story to the next game following this - Finding Paradise.

When he finds an injured bird one day, his world brightens up with the prospect of a new friend and his reality starts to blur with his imagination as he tries to take care of it. \n\nIt's a touching little story and like the first game, it tugs at the heart strings to make you feel, and even relate, to the boy who is crying inside.

This title has been marketed as a major miniature release in the To the Moon franchise, acting as a transitionary point between the first and second entries. And yet, if I hadn\u2019t been told that, there is no way that I would have known. A Bird Story isn\u2019t quite a misfire, but nor is it experimental: it\u2019s another substandard, overly-cinematic excuse for a video game that should be looked upon as an example of what NOT to do in indie game design.\n\nYou\u2019re supposedly given the ability to move around like in TTM, but I\u2019d say the game only unlocks that about 50% of the time. The other 50% you\u2019re forced to watch mini-cutscenes of an abysmal narrative that I\u2019ll tear into in a little bit.\n\n99 percent of this movement is just basic UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, though that 1% comes up in the form of gimmicks that are too short-lived to be impactful. TTM didn\u2019t have much in the way of gameplay either, but at least the story was intriguing, and exploration was encouraged. That latter part isn\u2019t available here because you\u2019re essentially on rails: trying to go off the straightforward path will land you against a brick wall, forcing you to backtrack and go back the way the game wants you go.\n\nAesthetically, A Bird Story is a mixed bag. It reuses a lot of the assets from TTM and the RPG Maker engine, but TTM was a beautiful game, and so that was far from being a bad tactic. Unfortunately, the limited environs here (a schoolground, apartment complex, and forested area) are laced with copy/pasted models (same-sized shadow figures, same-exact trees, same-exact lamps) ad nauseam. The biggest problem, though, is this weird filter that is placed over most of the game: it\u2019s like halfway between sepia and bleach bypass. I\u2019m guessing it was Freebird\u2019s attempt at conceiving a unique \u201cold-timey\u201d feel to their storyline, but I didn\u2019t think it fit personally due to the timeline being relatively modern.\n\nAnother graphical issue is the poor depiction of verticality. This is an inherent issue with 2D sprite games, and TTM suffered from it occasionally as well. But here, I felt that the problem was a lot more prevalent in the three places, with barriers not being distinguishable enough from regular pathways. That being said, one thing A Bird Story does remarkably effectively is combine the three places in fused sets that occur as a result of memories/dates getting combined in-story; you\u2019ll see the schoolgrounds leading into forests, apartment doors opening into rainy exteriors, and so forth. Freebird also continues to demonstrate their ability to create unique facial expressions out of small sprite countenances, (though the smiling closed/curved eyelines was overused).\n\nSadly, I do have to end on a bitter note in this department, and that is regarding the constant use of white and black flashes. I get that this was done to depict time-skips and fast-forwards, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel that, half the time, it was also done because the devs didn\u2019t want to commit a huge budget to the project and so wanted to avoid animating sequences. But I fully concede that that is pure conjecture on my part. Either way, they were overused. Shortcuts were also taken like the lack of shadowmapping and no splashes (characters, in general, look like they\u2019re floating on the land).\n\nI was not a fan of the score. Gao did it himself again, yet the first half of the game incorporates these weird warble experimentations that distract rather than contribute to the scenes playing before you (the use of muted instruments, for example, or French Horns that hit notes so high they near-burst speakers). The second half is more restrained and standard, and yet that\u2019s a bad thing because it both doesn\u2019t stand out AND doesn\u2019t contribute to the images at large. Flying around in your paper airplane, for example, should\u2019ve elicited the same awe as John William\u2019s track in ET during the bike scene.\n\nThe SFX is also barren. The exact same chirp is rehashed for your avian companion, and other things like footsteps and ambient noises are nonexistent. No dialogue means no voice acting (not that TTM had any, a big fault on its part).\n\nFinally, we arrive at the story, and it\u2019s such a misfire. You remember that episode of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody where Cody adopts a baby eagle? Imagine that turned completely serious and stretched out for an entire hour+ and you have A Bird Story. It\u2019s actually worse than that: take that premise and combine it with a clich\u00e9 tale of a loser kid with estranged parents becoming extroverted via a newfound friendship and you have A Bird Story.\n\nForgive me, but at this point I\u2019m just tired of this archetypal narrative. We\u2019ve seen it done with humans and animals alike a bazillion times, and Freebird doesn\u2019t do anything different here. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t go into tearjerker territory, however there are blatant attempts at being heart-tugging and I just found it annoying. It\u2019s quite possible to tell a moving story about a relationship using just imagery and music (Up and BvS\u2019s openings are prime standards of this), but Freebird botched things here by over-relying on hackneyed tropes and story beats. The magical realism aspects aren\u2019t bad, but it doesn\u2019t amount to anything substantial or memorable courtesy of the aforestated weak OST and gameplay. Alongside, there are these odd momentary throwbacks to classic games/shows (Zelda, Spongebob, Mario, Scooby-Doo), and the comedic tones associated with them feel out-of-place with the drama elsewhere.\n\nSo yeah, it goes without saying that I wasn\u2019t a fan of A Bird Story. Every single facet of it bore a noticeable problem, with its core narrative, in particular, being flawed. I have to play Finding Paradise to see just how integral it is to understanding that game, but I have a good feeling that it won\u2019t be. It took me a little over an hour to beat the game, making the $4.00 asking price too much. Regardless, even if it was one dollar, the fact that I felt a one-hour game dragged says enough.", "timestamp_created": 1624866251, "timestamp_updated": 1696082774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495601266622543335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94561974": {"recommendationid": "94561974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267791032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1561946830}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a nice story!

I also really enjoyed Finding Paradise (FP), but unfortunately I found A Bird Story (ABS) too slow and uninteresting to recommend. I think the reason I feel the need to write this review is because it is so inferior to TTM and FP. I realise on the store page it mentions it is experimental and only 1 hour but it also says its purpose is to tell a story and i just didn't find the story to be interesting and thought the pacing was far too slow. \n\nA Bird Story (ABS) goes through an event mentioned by a character in FP but when it was mentioned in that game it wasn't something I thought \"Yeah I'd like to play through that moment in his life.\"  I bought this game prior to FP as part of a bundle, but when I heard FP was the sequel to TTM I went to play that straight away, it didn't really click with me that ABS was a mini episode between the 2 games; perhaps that my fault for not looking into it. Although It does explicitly say on the this store page that it is NOT a sequel to TTM and that it is a self contained story, so its understandable if I wasn't aware of the connection until after finishing FP. \n\nABS was clearly released to tease FP and perhaps if i had played it when it first came out I would have formed a different impression but as I have played FP first it just felt a bit redundant. It didn't really tell me more about the character in FP or feel any differently towards him. This game is only an hour but the tasks just felt mundane and the plot dragged. This was have been better as a 30 min game. \n\nI would say if you have already played FP don't go back and play this, you have to play ABS first. Maybe people who played this one first then FP enjoyed it much more and I recommend you read other reviews to ascertain if that's the case. [b]I would definitely recommend Too the Moon and Finding Paradise by this developer though,[/b] those games are excellent and have great stories. I just can't recommend this to people who have played both of them already especially not for \u00a32.79; maybe i'm just a cheapskate but \u00a32.79 for a 1 hour linear game, 75% of which is mostly scripted \"cut scenes\", with no chance to explore, just doesn't feel justified to me, especially since the story is no where near as interesting or engaging as TTM or FP.", "timestamp_created": 1624277716, "timestamp_updated": 1624277842, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485259115695953369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93974515": {"recommendationid": "93974515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050225810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1624052803}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice interactive short story with no words but packed with emotions. \n\nThe story is self-contained, you should be able to understand it without problem.

If you're not looking for an easy one-hour cheevo or anything I just said is not the type of thing you're looking for, then this isn't for you. \n\nThat out of the way, A Bird Story is a short, pixel art animated film with some interactive elements. It follows a tale as old as time - a child who has nobody to listen to him finds an injured animal (a bird in this case) in the woods and nurses it back to health, discovering confidence and friendship along the way. It ends the way you expect, it goes the way you expect. The point isn't to play a game or tell any sort of new story, the point is to experiment with the idea of an interactive film done with no words whatsoever - and this does that very, very well. It's a very sweet little story that partly takes place in the imagination of the child protagonist, with some interesting interactive segments, beautiful music, and some remarkably well done pixel animation by the team at FreeBird Games.\n\nThat's about all I can say as an outsider to the To The Moon franchise looking in. I enjoyed my time with it. It isn't gonna win any awards, it's not unique in terms of story, but it is emotional and animated very, very well. It's not easy to animate anything or tell a wordless story, but doing both is really quite phenomenal, and buying this supports the devs to make games with more meat on their bones. I think you should definitely give it a shot, especially since it's cheap at $4. Do I think it's [i]worth[/i] $4? Not really, maybe closer to $3, but that's your call friend. I do think if you like relaxed experiences this one is worth your time. If you liked FreeBird's other games, get this one. If you want an easy cheevo, get this one. If you wanna experience a cute, experimentally done film-like experience, get this one.

However, despite the lack of words, the game does a really good job of telling its story and getting emotions across to you. At the end, I couldn't believe I was crying over a pixelated bird that I knew for like, an hour.\nOn top of that, it's incredibly beautiful. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, especially when they show the moon and the stars.\nThere are some confusing bits, the developers used interesting ways to show the story, and I had a hard time understanding if certain things were really happening, or if they were metaphors. Once you get past that and just accept it as it is, then it's an enjoyable, smooth sailing ride throughout.\nI also really appreciate the little bits of varied gameplay. For the most part, it's cutscenes or you moving the boy, but every now and then, you get special actions such as jumping in puddles (my personal favorite). \nWhile everything was done well in my opinion, I think this game excelled at really taking me back to my childhood. While I can't really relate too much to any exact situations in the story, I could through the visuals, emotions, music, etc., it was all just a very innocent, carefree feeling of \"simpler days\".\nOverall, a really great little gem!

A BIRD STORY is much less profound compared to TO THE MOON and you can tell that the developer was less experienced here to be able to exploit the full potential of the RPG-Maker game engine. I had already played it through after 70 minutes, although the term playing is actually not really applicable. It's more of an interactive (pixel-) graphic novel where the interaction is limited to walking from trigger point to trigger point, through which one follows the story linearly. However, blockbuster cinema is not offered here and for art house cinema it is way to superficial. As a stand-alone game, it's not exactly overwhelming. Unfortunately, it doesn't add much value to the trilogy either. The relation to which FINDING PARADISE takes on this game is rudimentary - essential aspects were not originally present in A BIRD STORY, or have been presented more abstractly. So it's safe to say that you don't necessarily have to play this game if you've already played a sequel, but for the sake of completeness you can of course give this game a chance.\n\nIf you pick it up on sale, you are certainly not doing anything wrong, but you shouldn't expect too much from it either.", "timestamp_created": 1609933254, "timestamp_updated": 1610515046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84129026": {"recommendationid": "84129026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198974339718", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1638624079}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a cute story about a boy and a bird.\n\nachievement is bugged though.", "timestamp_created": 1609915786, "timestamp_updated": 1609915825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538709700107574463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84126035": {"recommendationid": "84126035", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995145169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1609911157}, "language": "english", "review": "Meh, stick with the other games.", "timestamp_created": 1609911131, "timestamp_updated": 1609911131, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84123664": {"recommendationid": "84123664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201613371", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 285, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1609907322}, "language": "english", "review": "Another excellent and heartwarming game by Freebird Games, I recommend you play Finding Paradise before playing A Bird Story so it will make more sense and have a bigger emotional impact, but you do you.\n\nYou play as a young boy named Colin, who struggles with his loneliness in his day-to-day life.

[/h1]\n\nFrom creators of the famous, award-winning episodic story-rich pixelart game \"To The Moon\", FreeBird games provides us with another emotional adventure, only this time it's a prequel and not really another episode. \"A Bird Story\" is the prequel to \"Finding Paradise\" as they both take you on a journey to discover the life of the same person. This game has no dialogue, but be warned, it WILL make you feel quite emotional, lost, depressed and by the end, a tad bit happy. I will not spoil the story too much (not that there is much to spoil anyways, it's a one-hour game), I'll just emphasize that the same feeling of \"To The Moon\" is present here, with figures that have no bearing or importance being again blurred out (which, in a sense, reminds me of that anime \"A Silent Voice\" that pretty much follows the same principle synonymous to how in real life we really only care about a select few people that linger in our memory long after they're lost while the rest are phasing and we can't really recollect how they looked like even if we try). This prequel will make you experience a deep sadness and longing for a resolve and by the end it's too late, you're already attached to these characters and want to know how it all ends. It doesn't though as you're invited to play \"Finding Paradise\" (the continuation of this game) to get your closure. The game will keep reminding how depressing it is to live in this harsh and brutal world and a minute later will also remind you you how nihilistic (or strong, whatever floats your boat) you have to be in order to survive.\n\nThis is 10/10 story-rich content that only a fool would pass up on and it's only one hour long.

Friends, teachers and classmates are also just shadows who communicate with him, but only appear as black shadows.\n\nOn the other hand, the bird that the boy finds injured by the roadside plays an important role. He fixes the lame wing and carries the feathered friend home.

To take me out of my busy life and negative thoughts, it reminded me of my childish mind as a kid when I didn't wanna grow up, a little child wanting to be pure and happy forever.

The story about a lonely little boy who's parents clearly too busy to take care of him. He returns home from school every day to find a note from his parents which he takes and put on the pile of notes he gets from them.\n\nThe boy has no friends, no one to spend his time with, all he does is going to school and return to study and sleep to do the same thing the next day, until he found an injured bird. I loved the friendship between the boy and the bird, it was very touching and cute at the same time. The soundtracks are really good. I wish there was more to do than just watching. Unfourtonatilly there is no steam overlay which means I can't take screenshots. \n\nPro:\n+Touching story.\n+Beautiful soundtracks.\n+Cute bird.\n+Steam achievements. (only one and you will get it once you finish the game.)\n\nCons:\n-Limited engagement in the game.\n-No steam overlay.\n\nAt the end of the game, it is mentioned this one related to their newest game [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/337340/Finding_Paradise/]Finding Paradice[/url], I got goosebumps when I saw that.

It has an excellent score, which, owing to the game's short length (an hour or less) isn't as repetitious as its predecessor's, [i]To The Moon[/i]. This score truly elevates the game and its emotional beats, and it cannot be overstated how wonderful it is. \n\nMore than anything, I admire the simplicity of [i]A Bird Story[/i]. At a time when many games can feel bloated or stretched out for no reason (another minor criticism I would level against [i]To The Moon[/i]), this game is not. It is short and focused. It tells a simple story, which truly feels drawn from the mind of a child. It is fantastically surreal, yet remains straightforward and understandable, despite the lack of text. \n\nThe story it tells may be uncomplicated, but it tells it with the mastery one would expect from the people behind [i]To The Moon[/i]. And, if you examine it deeper, it feels (ironically) almost literary with its metaphors and themes. For example, (spoilers follow) [spoiler] the faceless version of the boy represents his darker qualities of selfishness and inability to let go, which ultimately nearly spells destruction for him and his bird-friend[/spoiler]. \n\nIn the end, I felt emotionally touched by [i]A Bird Story[/i], and that is the best praise I can give it.

Even if you aren't 100% sure, but you are willing to give it a go and have some cash lying around, I definitely recommend supporting the developers of this series.\n\nUltimately, the fact that the game is short doesn't really detract from the overall experience. Freebird is known for their ability to tell a story and this game is no exception. I like to think of it like reading one of those books on zen. You can easily finish one in a few hours, but it lasts for days in terms of the thoughts and emotions it provokes.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game. It certainly isn't for everyone, but if you are in the mood for some feels I recommend anything by Freebird.", "timestamp_created": 1593746509, "timestamp_updated": 1593746509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71917272": {"recommendationid": "71917272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098108564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1593644738}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it!!

This game is full of love and friendship. If you had an animal as kid you will understand this game really good and can feel what our little friend is feeling all the time.\nWhen I was young we had a dog, a cute Rottweiler named Hook. My parents seperated when I was 10 and my mum tooked Hook with us to her new boyfriend. He was a dog trainer, not the best in the end. One day, they worked with Hook. It was this thing where the dog has to bite into this arm and he did but in the eyes of my mums boyfriend he did it wrong so he wants the arm back. Hook didn't know what he wants him to do so he grabed the arm again, sadly the hand from my mums boyfriend was there. They went to the hospital and he got stitched back together. My mum was so afraid of Hook that she doesn't feed him anymore so I did it. He was looking at me with big eyes because he doesn't know what he did wrong. I fed him for five days and walked with him. I was 11 years old. After those five days my mum went with her boyfriend, his dog and Hook to a \"trip\" and came back with only one dog left and it wasn't Hook. I didn't talked with my mum for three weeks. She gave him to another dog trainer. She always promised me, that we will visit him but we never did. After one year the man who owned Hook sold him to one in the USA. I cried for like a week. I thought I will never see him again. \nI'm 18 now. Currently living in Virginia doing an Au Pair year and wrote a message to the man who owns Hook now. \nIt still hurts after 8 years and my mum still can't see what she did wrong. I lost the love of my life because of an stupid accident. And even after all that happend I still can say that Hook would never bit me or anything like that. He protected and loved me like no one from my family. I love him and hope that I can visit him one last time. He will be 10 this year so there isn't much time left. \nSo that's the story why I love this game and why I can relate to it so much. Everyone feels different, I know. But for me those feelings are still here and everytime I think about my dog I cry because it hurts so much. \nI love you, buddy, and hope to see you soon.", "timestamp_created": 1566094884, "timestamp_updated": 1566094884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645379185676574707", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54666618": {"recommendationid": "54666618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080790580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1566028261}, "language": "english", "review": "\"To the Moon\" had its flaws but al in all it was a win. \"A Bird Story\" left me with mixed feelings.

Whimsical tunes to dreary melodies, everything about the music sets the mood.\n\nWhich is a good thing, considering there is no speaking in this game. The music kind of guides you into what's happening as scenes transition from one area to another.\n\nIt's not always about the music either. Sometimes it's about the smaller sounds. Of nature, of paperwork, of school. The sounds in general go great with this game.\n\n[h1]Navigation[/h1]\nYou can't wander around much in A Bird Story. Instead, you can follow a small, set path to where you're needed to go, or you watch as the main character interacts with the world before you're able to take initiative.\n\nNavigation was a bit rough for me while using a controller, but you can also use mouse and keyboard--which is more recommended.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nNothing stands out too much as far as the graphics go, but that doesn't make the game bad or doesn't give it a charm. I've always liked pixel art in games, because they take time to create (if not using a generator, I suppose).\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou go left, up, down, and right.\n\nThat's more-or-less the kind of gameplay you'll be dealing with. But aside from that, you'll also be interacting with objects and people.\n\nTake note that there is no words being given toward you or others. This game is all about actions that are being taken. That's where the whole story comes into play, and it's a very nice style. Words tend to get in the way, sometimes.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIn the end, A Bird Story is a very short, but very good game that features the power of friendship and caring for others, despite them being completely different from you.\n\nEveryone thinks about their dogs or cats as lifelong companions, but hey.

So, I think this game is something you should play before playing Finding Paradise, since, from my experience, this game lets you understand many attitudes that Colin (the pacient in Finding Paradise) has, and it's also a good way to understand the plot better (but you can fully understand the plot of Finding Paradise without playing this game).\n\nIf you want a bit more details about the story: A Bird Story has as the main focus the situation of Colin. Colin is a lonely child, he doesn't have many friends, and his parents are always working, so he doesn't spend a lot of time with them. So, the story starts when Colin finds a bird who can't fly. Then you can see the friendship these 2 build, and how they'll fix one another throughout the game.\n\n[h1]My thoughts[/h1]\n\nAs I said, I think you will have a much better experience with this game if you've already played To The Moon, or Finding Paradise, but it also can be a way for to be interested in those 2 games.\n\nThe story of this game is really beautiful, the soundtrack is on point, and it's a nice looking RPG Maker game.\n\nOne thing that I didn't like in this game was the fact that it hasn't any dialogues. Yes, all the story is told to you only by the \"graphics\", and so, sometimes it's hard to understand what's really hapenning in the story, and, until today, even after playing Finding Paradise, there are some parts of the story I didn't get a clean anwser to. Since you are told the story only by some scenes and interactions between the sprites, the plot can be very subjective, so you'll have to understand it in your point of view and your opinion. This is also helped by the story itseld (I won't say why, because I don't want to spoil it). Being subjective is not exactly something bad, but at some parts of the game, I would just like to know what really happened, because I hadn't a clue. I also think that the dialogues in Finding Paradise e To The Moon are one of the best things in the game, and removing them in this game was a bit disappointing.\n\nBut don't get fooled, you can easily dedute the majority of the scenes just by what's happening, and the message that this game is trying to convey is easily noticed. I don't think you'll be confused with the main aspects of the plot by the end of the game. I'm essentially talking about some details.\n\n[h1]Final Opinion[/h1]\n\nTo finish this, I recommend this game, but you should maybe buy it on sales, since it's many times on sales (like now, at the time I'm writting this), and the game is really short for 4\u20ac (although I think the game isn't that much overvalued, but you can easily get it cheaper), Finding Paradise costs 10\u20ac, and I got 6 hours of gameplay from it, but with A Bird Story I only got 84 minutes (not even an hour and an half), and I have a really slow gameplay pace.\nHowever, I don't think you'll regret buying A Bird Story, since it may remind you of your childhood times, and it will fill your heart with good feelings with its beautiful story.", "timestamp_created": 1561853765, "timestamp_updated": 1561900897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52143783": {"recommendationid": "52143783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041833612", "num_games_owned": 1318, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1467535407}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendable.", "timestamp_created": 1561835619, "timestamp_updated": 1561835619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52040099": {"recommendationid": "52040099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113173475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1561647726}, "language": "spanish", "review": "11/10 made me cry", "timestamp_created": 1561823807, "timestamp_updated": 1561823807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51893727": {"recommendationid": "51893727", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960544041", "num_games_owned": 2073, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1561808299}, "language": "english", "review": "it made me value(more) the people i still have left in my life", "timestamp_created": 1561808839, "timestamp_updated": 1561808839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67067033052444458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51862942": {"recommendationid": "51862942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036230611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1518805224}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but sweet adventure/story game.

It's sort of a trend to have simplistic, dialogue-less stories. Sometimes they work. A Bird Story takes place from a JRPG overhead perspective though, and while the characters are animated, even their faces, it is not the same as watching a movie or playing a more fleshed out game. There is no seeing big emotions or interesting actions; it's mostly just simple walking and the like.

The protagonist faces challenging situations, obstacles, and nurtures a bond with his avian companion within the loose construct of magical realism. \n\nThe limitations of the [i]RPG Maker[/i] are painfully evident: Movement, pacing, and environmental interactions are clunky.

Argumento nada original, pero s\u00ed lo es la forma en la que est\u00e1 \"contado\" y representado. \n\nSi has jugado al genial \"To the Moon\", de los mismos creadores (puedes ver mi an\u00e1lisis del juego [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/razielbpn/recommended/206440/]aqu\u00ed[/url]), este mantiene la misma est\u00e9tica y jugabilidad simple, gr\u00e1ficos 2D al estilo Pok\u00e9mon de Game Boy pero a todo color muy agradables y simp\u00e1ticos, con el mismo estilo de banda sonora con canciones de piano, pero perdiendo los geniales di\u00e1logos. Aqu\u00ed no se dice ni una sola palabra en todo el juego y aunque resulta original y est\u00e1 bien llevado, se echan de menos los comentarios de los carism\u00e1ticos personajes de \"To the Moon\".\n\nA pesar de no tener di\u00e1logos, podemos interpretar muchas cosas con las situaciones que vamos viviendo, como la soledad del ni\u00f1o, sus problemas de atenci\u00f3n en el colegio, el aburrimiento de la rutina diaria, su gran imaginaci\u00f3n, etc. M\u00e1s que un juego, se trata de un relato interactivo. \n\nViviremos muchas situaciones surrealistas, con escenarios reales mezclados con otros fant\u00e1sticos producto de los sue\u00f1os y la imaginaci\u00f3n del ni\u00f1o protagonista, algo que a veces puede resultar algo confuso. Poco m\u00e1s que comentar en una historia que no nos llevar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de una hora y media para terminarla. \n\nPara no extenderme m\u00e1s, os dejo mi lista de pros y de contras.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n\n- Una historia muy bella\n\n- La banda sonora con canciones de piano es muy bonita\n\n- Apto para ni\u00f1os y adultos\n\n- La imaginaci\u00f3n del protagonista\n\n- El amor por los animales\n\n- Puede tocar la fibra a los m\u00e1s sensiblones\n\n- Gr\u00e1ficos agradables\n\n- Algunos escenarios son muy bellos\n\n- Tiene cromos Steam\n\n- En \u00e9pocas de ofertas se puede encontrar a menos de 1\u20ac\n\n[h1]CONTRAS:[/h1]\n\n- Muy corto, en una hora y poco lo tendr\u00e1s terminado\n\n- No tiene di\u00e1logos\n\n- Ya no sorprende tanto como lo hizo \"To The Moon\"\n\n- Muy pocas posibilidades de interacci\u00f3n\n\n- Mucho m\u00e1s simple que \"To The Moon\"\n\n- No se puede acceder a la inferfaz de Steam desde el juego\n\n- Jugabilidad demasiado b\u00e1sica: nos limitamos a ver cinem\u00e1ticas y a usar las flechas para mover al personaje de un lado a otro realizando acciones simples\n\n- Deja todo demasiado a la imaginaci\u00f3n\n\n- Tremendamente lineal\n\n- Se podr\u00eda haber profundizado mucho m\u00e1s en la historia\n\n- No tiene ning\u00fan aliciente para rejugarlo\n\n- No llega a emocionar tanto como \"To The Moon\"\n\n- Solo tiene un logro\n\n- Podr\u00edan haber a\u00f1adido algo de exploraci\u00f3n, secretos, m\u00e1s logros, etc.\n\n- Final muy previsible\n\n[h1]CONCLUSI\u00d3N:[/h1] \n\nUn juego enfocado a todas las edades, con una historia muy bonita, con mensaje, con unos gr\u00e1ficos muy agradables, pero que no le llega ni a la suela del zapato al genial \"To the Moon\".

It has some asbstract fantasy elements to it which assumes not everything that occurs is actual real (or maybe it in in the boy's mind?). The whole experience takes a little over an hour to complete, pretty much a single gaming session.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed it.

Like if you litterally stop the game anytime you will have to restart from the begining again each time you load it up.

His other two titles, \"To the Moon\" and \"Finding Paradise\" are now high on my \"To Play\" list. \n\nThe art in A Bird Story is lovely, the music beautiful, and the overall vision and storytelling superb. The story is minimalist (no text or dialog), yet still rich and rewarding. There's loneliness, isolation, beauty, triumph over authority, and of course wordless friendship \u2014 and kinship. The narrative artfully blends reality and imagination, creating a surreal, dream-like experience repete with magic realism. The soundscape of Gao's gorgeous music (which to me feels very \"Chrono Cross\" in style), blended with the lovely sound effects and heaps of birdsong, bring the story to life.\n\nFrom a pure visual standpoint, something in the way Gao's creation exists on the screen feels deeply reminiscent of classic Squaresoft games like \"Chrono Trigger\" and \"Final Fantasy III (VI)\" \u2014 only with a level of artistic detail fitting of a modern presentation. Almost like I was seeing what those games looked like to me when I was first playing them all those years ago. That subtle nostalgia factor definitely contributed to my enjoyment, but if you're more recent to gaming it won't be a detriment. However, those of you who grew up with the classics will definitely know what I mean.\n\nThe only warning I'd throw out with this is that \"A Bird Story\" is nominally a game. It's more of an interactive story \u2014 or more accurately still \u2014 an interactive suite of music. But don't let that detract you.

An experiment with Stardew Valley style graphics that is neither particularly experimental nor particularly interesting. Not well thought out either for while this game searches for the dream world it consistently fails to KEEP IT REAL.\n\n'A bird story' is the story of how avian flu spread into the human population and also of how blank 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper wind up blowing through city streets; All due to inadequate parental supervision.\n\nMore seriously though, A Bird Story is a tear jerker severely hampered by its pretentious and mediocre Hallmark store esq piano music and the extreme predictability of its plot. What would be an example of good music for such a game as this? Perhaps something like The Streets of Whiterun from Skyrim would be more to my tastes. Unfortunately it is instead clear the makers of this game were terribly uninspired.\n\nStill, A Bird Story has some nice moments here and there and, when it is at its best, exists as a heartwarming story about the lengths people have to go through when stupid apartment managers don't allow pets; a situation which occurs far too often in many cities worldwide thus artificially disconnecting us even further from the benefits of the \"natural\" outdoorsiness the world.\n\nI also liked how the colors of the game world changed with the emotions of your character though this also increased the pervading sense I had of how the story's main character is a severe narcissist. Afterall, in his dreams at least, all other humans, both other kids his age and adults, appear merely as vague shadows with no faces. How unhappy would he be if one (or several) of those shades suddenly ceased to exist? Just because he keeps a pet doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a narcissist either. Serial killers have been occasionally known to keep pets too. I find this game's unintentional aspect of narcissism strongly reminiscent of the selfishness that has become so inherent to our society (U.S.A) lately. This self-absorbed narcissism is part of why mass shootings happen. To the main character of this story, other people don't particularly matter and barely exist.\n\nAnd what about the poor hungry raccoon thing that was trying to eat the injured bird in this story? What is it supposed to eat now? That raccoon is going to starve to death and it's the kid's fault. That is also nature. 'Nature is red in tooth and claw' and this game wants to downplay that but for those of us who have lived in the wild, well, that's just seems stupid and the designers of this story, being shallow thinkers, obviously didn't think about it and the audience is clearly not supposed to think about it either. Romanticist drivel. Claim to love nature and yet try not to think about how it works.\n\nFor realism's sake and for those who may wish to take care of injured little birds, it would have also been good also to show a slight increase in the messiness on the balcony. Birds tend to shit everywhere so there should have been increasing amounts of bird shit on the kid's balcony as the story progressed.

I had read really enthusiastic reviews on this game so ,y expectations were high.\n\nThis is more an animated story than a game. I say \"more\", because some interaction is still needed in order to progress at some points. To me, this is one ofthe things that doesn`t work: You need to interact but in a very pointless way, you have no real freedom and basiclly must press the same key/s. I much rather would have had the story progress by itslef than this.\n\nThe story itself, which many users have found moving was one of the points I was really looking forward to. I am a biologist by training, help out in a couple of shelters, and just like the main chracater in the story, have helped recover several birds at home (4 sparrows, 2 magpies, a seagull...) as well as other animals. And yet I did not connect with the story at all. I found the vet part confusing, both fo rthe ack of realism in what happens, as for the chasing around. I was baffled at the supposed conflict: if the boy was unable to provide first aid by himself, is he so selfish he can`t leave the bird in the hands of the vet who might be a more capable caregiver? Is the vet supposed to be wicked and jeopardise the bird`s wellbeing?\nThe relationship between the boy and the bird is nice. I could have done without all the school and lonely apartment sequences, and I did not really get the nest searching flight episode, but it was nice, albeit a bit too slow. I really can\u00b4t believe I finsihed the game in 57 minutes, it felt much longer.\nThe music I did find beautiful and I liked the overall atmosphere. But I did finish the experience feeling disconnected, not really moved and not lookingforward to playing this again.\n\nAm I saying this is a bad \"game\"? Not at all. But I think you may need to be ina  very receptive emotional state or lack much experinece in dealing with these sort of situations in real life in order to really connect with the emotional side of the story progress. I think you must also like easy challneges. I don\u00b4t, so I usually prefer either being just a spectator (as in other animated stories/novels) or actually being given some challenge or at least freedom of choice or action rather than being demanded to press one key in order to go where it is clear you must go anyway as there is no alternative.\nI really wnated to love this game as much as other users. I don\u00b4t hate it, I just feel totally neutral about it and that to me, when speaking of something which is story based, is not positive at all as it means no emotions got stirred.", "timestamp_created": 1526745776, "timestamp_updated": 1526745776, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42083245": {"recommendationid": "42083245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055041003", "num_games_owned": 1330, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1417902488}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a short, emotional story in the vein of to the moon, preparing players for Finding Paradise (which I have yet to play).

It seems not only are they willing to chase you through dark forests to try and apprehend you, but they are even willing to bring the bounty hunt to your local school arranging some sort of posse/lynch mob ending with you needing to go all Butch and Cassidy and practice your cliff jumping skills.\n\nThis is a short (1.5hr) light hearted, stand alone, minisode that\u2019s supposed to come after 'To the Moon' and a prequel to 'Finding Paradise'. The experimental story project is conveyed using visuals, music and sound with no words. It's about an unnamed boy of a single parent who has a fascination with flying. In dreams and memories we are cast back to his daily feelings of being bullied, isolated and made to feel like an outcast, only to come across a little injured bird which he can relate to since it has also been bullied by a predator.\n\nAs the boy and bird form a close bond of friendship, the matter of needing to be loved, the need to belong and the need to let go is explored. It's a colourful tale from start to finish, furnished with many liberties from a vivid childlike imagination and haphazard recollection. All brought to life with unrealistic location transitions, with nonsensical object blending like classroom lockers and trees and wild shenanigans involving giant paper planes.\n\nWhile the story is presented in a fairly streamlined manner, there is a very small trivial amount of interaction required to push the story forward. Unlike 'To the Moon' however, this was never meant to be a tear jerker or something that was to be a very deep metaphor. Hence, it is best that you blank slate such notions before proceeding. With its Mario, Link, Benny Hill, Doge and To the Moon reference hidden within, it is sure to inspire a smile and chuckle here and there while maintaining and ending with a feel good notion.\n\nWhile it got some bad wraps for being fairly whimsical, I seriously applaud the developer for his attention to small details, like the time on the clocks, the fact that only one side of the parent bed ever gets used. I also salute the variety of ways he tries to get messages across using shadows, sepia, black and white tones, zoom, movement, repetition and blur. A lot of love and care really went into the making of this.\n\nHowever the award winning toast to this production has to be chalked to its meticulously fitted and time matched soundtrack. The way the inspired and invigorating piano, strings and woodwind instruments empower the listener to emotion while they blatantly watch characters made from the rather crude RPG Maker XP.\n\nThe Canadian developer has evidently metaphor some of his own personal feelings in this game as revealed by his company name freebirdgames.com/ , but still it's left somewhat open to every birdwatcher's interpretation. While games like this which require you to sit silently and watch may not appeal to everybody, the plumage, the call, its stretched out wingspan as it takes off has proven to many that it deserves a place on this planet.\n\nPS: There is some Easter eggs in the game I do not understand such as a flying rabbit, 1764 = Cat, and Eye + Speak. If anyone understands these please feel free to explain thanks\u2026\n\nBelow the complete game by someone else...

The story makes for a great extension to fans of Finding Paradise and there's a lot of references to Finding Paradise for those who played and loved it. If you haven't played Finding Paradise, play that first. It isn't necessary, but after giving it some good thought, yes- Finding Paradise does help explain a lot of the motivations behind the Colin you see here. And also... Finding Paradise and To the Moon before it are straight up good so why haven't you played it!? Ahem* the only other thing that needs to be talked about is the music.

Five minutes into the game I looked this up because it feels like a massive step back, but yes, this game was published three years after the original. \n\nThe entire game feels like a big step backwards.  While To The Moon had problems of limited interaction and linear storytelling, it was a nice 4-5 hour affair of great graphics and a brilliant story. \n\nA Bird Story doesn\u2019t have that.  It does try something different in telling a wordless story.  Problem is it\u2019s not very interesting and pretty tame.  It\u2019s not that it\u2019s predictable, it\u2019s that there is nothing to predict really.  The game travels to surrealism quite often, but aside from that, there\u2019s not much here.  You go to locations, sometimes there\u2019s an image of things people are requesting and then you find them in the room.  \n\nNow a dialogless game sounds interesting, but the player asks \u201cWhat is he doing now.\u201d Brushing his teeth, getting food, taking off a backpack.  It\u2019s all done through 16-bit graphics.  Problem is it\u2019s not really clear what the player is doing quite often so I have to ask. This feels like how Final Fantasy especially four and six did cutscenes, but there they had words to add to the scene, or at least had more game so it wasn\u2019t reliant only on that feature.  Here, the only feature is the wordless animations.\n\nIn fact, as I played the game I often questioned \u201ccan I move\u201d as the game sometimes takes control away from you suddenly.  Luckily the game always shows the arrow keys quickly when you can move, sadly, it feels like more of the game could have been more interactive or asked more of me.   Yet at the same time, less of the game could be interactive.  If this was just an hour long animation, it probably would be as impactful.  Well\u2026 reach the same level of impact.\n\nThe thing is the game tries to be innovative, and I\u2019m not against that, but it also should try to be great, and it falls short.  The game only lasted about an hour, and I got bored of it really fast.  Where I LOVED To The Moon\u2019s story, I felt very little here.  Innovation is only good when it\u2019s successful.  No one should be applauding the guy who built an automated car that falls apart or crashes quickly.   A Bird Story isn\u2019t broken\u2026 it\u2019s just not very entertaining and both too short and too long. \n\nI remember when I played Thirty Flights of Loving and HATED the game, just loathed it.  A Bird Story is better than Thirty Flights of Loving, it has great graphics, great music, and an attempt at a powerful story.  It just falls far shorter than what I would be able to recommend.  It has all the same problems.  Expensive price for the length, and poor gameplay.\n\nHowever, A Bird Story has one more problem.  While it has great graphics.  I sit here in front of a 4k television and it tried to show me the game in a box that took up less than 40 percent of the screen when full screened.  The solution is to put it in windowed mode, but even then it\u2019s still not filling up the screen, and caused another problem with the sound.  The graphics still were small, and that kind of sucked.  According to the developer, it\u2019s a problem with RPG Maker XP.   Ok but still a decent ding against the game. \n\nI really want to see the art of the game and get entranced by the story, but it didn\u2019t happen, and at the end of the day, there are far better games out there.  I don\u2019t hate Freebird games, I loved To The Moon, I just didn\u2019t like this one.  The good news is their next game. Finding Paradise is out and that is a longer game and more like To The Moon. \n\nBut A Bird Story is just not a game I\u2019ll recommend, even to people who want just \u201cStory-based games\u201d.  It\u2019s not a broken game, but not a game worth playing.  However if you haven\u2019t played To The Moon, you should go get that instead.  That game is still brilliant. \n\nIf this review has helped you or you want to see what games I would recommend, you can find my curator page at this link.  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1518324234, "timestamp_updated": 1518324344, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508725106716156006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39986594": {"recommendationid": "39986594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989008307", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1517847446}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego muy bonito, conceptual.\n\nPor 1 euros he disfrutado de una historia po\u00e9tica, on\u00edrica, llena de encanto.\n\nPOES\u00cdA VISUAL A PRECIO DE COSTO, digo de coste ^^'\n\n(Un \u00fanico logro al final de juego que lo da como completado)\n\n8 bits: la base de la civilizaci\u00f3n", "timestamp_created": 1518296725, "timestamp_updated": 1518297367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39938876": {"recommendationid": "39938876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060234916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1637937688}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm playing Finding Paradise right now and I've come to a scene from A Bird Story and I'm like wth is going on ?!?\nI loved A Bird Story soo soo much and now that it's all connected makes me wanna scream!!11!!1!\nThis is truly amazing <3\n\nThe music is outstanding", "timestamp_created": 1518123006, "timestamp_updated": 1637937667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39898390": {"recommendationid": "39898390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083867997", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1517963168}, "language": "english", "review": "The game don't have a single word, and yet, can say so much...

It's sweet, but not overly so that you'd remember it with a goofy smile, and an \"aw-w-w\". It's sentimental, but not to the point to make you cry.

Although this is not the direct sequal to that game I was really looking forward playing this game and it did not disappoint me.\n\n\n\"[b]A Bird Story[/b]\" is a touching interactive short story made and developed by Freebird Games. You play as a lonely young boy who befriends a bird that is injured after he rescues it from a badger. He finds companionship and friendship with this bird. For the most part you're just moving your character around and only where the game let you go. You will sometimes be tasked with hitting particular directions on the arrows to perform actions on objects, but let's be honest there isnt a challenge at all. We have all heard the saying that [i]a picture is worth a thousand words [/i]and thats exactly what the game managed to do by being free of any dialogue. \n\nThe visually is stunning, the hand drawn artstyle is superb and the subtle movements in each character\u2019s face as well as the speech bubbles to let you know what everyone is thinking and feeling is a nice touch. If we are going from an audio perspective it's really nice to listen to. It was a good effect to underline the mood of the scene at the hand. By that I mean that the music becomes quite lively when something happy is going on and a bit dark during the more introspective moments.

There are no puzzles to solve or things to look for within the levels and you are quite literally guided or forced down paths. (To The Moon was linear, but there was still some poking around to be done along with simple puzzles to solve.) This makes it feel more like an interactive movie.\n\nThat said, it does focus on a mechanic we became familiar with near the end of To The Moon, which was the world changing and rearranging around the patient and the patient going on interacting with their new environment. It makes the game fascinating in certain ways.\n\nStory-wise, it starts with a young boy going through the motions of daily life. This makes the beginning feel a little tedius, but then he finds a bird with an injured wing and delights in taking care of it. It sounds cheesy (and it is), but it makes for a lovely little piece that can be finished in about an hour.\n\nPersonally, I had to be in the right mood to enjoy this game.

Calling it a game doesn't seem like a fair thing. There was a painful little amount that you could affect, but the story seems to make up for it. I had the game sitting in my library until I heard about the proper sequel to To The Moon (and A Bird Story)- Finding Paradise- had an official release date. I took a chance to play through a Bird Story, relatively blind to its ties to the new game. Perhaps my affection for Freebird games and older JRPGs color my judgement, but the game was both fun and flawed.

You don't need them to tell a good story. This is what I learnt from A bird Story. \n\n[h1][i]INTRO & GAMEPLAY. What is A Bird Story about and how does it work?[/i][/h1]\nSee it any way you want, this is the story of a child that finds a bird in distress, or the story of a hurt bird that gets found and helped by a boy. It's a sweet short story of the relationship between these two, with trips, adventures and journeys with a child's fantasy. Maybe I said too much but it is a nice story worth being followed.\nGameplay is very simple and almost limited, it has an RPGmaker aspect, so io can move around and interact with a bunch of items and go in various maps, however there are no riddles and you're guided all the time. Because the purpose is not gameplay, but the story. And interesting enough there are no dialogue, no texts, nothing. There's no need for them.\n\n[h1][i]GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.[/i][/h1]\nAs already mentioned it has an RPGMaker aspect, so it has a retro pixel art look. There are different locations you will visit, from road, to school, forest, apartment and oter places, but they're done properly.\n\n[h1][i]SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.[/i][/h1]\nSoundtrack is very light but effective, mostly piano parts, and will support the different key moments along the story.\n\n[h1][i]LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?[/i][/h1]\nNot much. You need to be interested in a short and particular story to enjoy the game but that's up to you. The only problem with the game is with its launcher's glitch. Many people reported the game to stay on black screen and a message \"script is hanging\"  will appear. Obviously the game won't start. Developer said the issue solves itself but mine didn't. And after successfully launching the game at home and with my mobile connection I got to the conclusion that limited connections (but still connections, as steam was running smoothly and online) such as universities' wifi, will prevent you from playing. For no reason appearently, because why would the game require to obtain a connection? And why wouldn't developer not know about this? \n\n[h1][i]TL;DR.

I'm not sure if \"visual novel\" is the right term, but it tells a heartwarming story without much in the way of actual decision making on the player's part, using SNES-era retro pixel graphics and a traditional JRPG format (although I wouldn't personally call it an RPG.)\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe story is pleasant, simple and touching.  Told entirely without language - only the occasional icon or animation - it has a way of engaging your interest and keeping it, because of that.  The story hearkens back to a more innocent time when we, as children, didn't worry so much about \"why\" or \"how\" and just did things because they [i]felt right[/i].\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThere's nothing I didn't like about this game.  It's pretty short, so there's not a lot of time for things to get on your nerves, and there were no obvious flaws or bugs to speak of.  I guess some people might find the \"no language\" thing confusing at parts, but I thought it was clear enough.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\n+ Heartwarming childhood tale\n+ Unique storytelling mechanic (no text)\n+ Nice music\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nIn addition to being a unique story itself, it's also an introduction to the world of the developer's other games - [i]To The Moon[/i] and [i]Finding Paradise[/i].

It takes a long time before there is any sort of drama or conflict, and then it doesn't last long. It's not the kind of story that tries to get you invested in the outcome, but rather tries to draw you in with moodiness.\n- 100% of the interactivity consists of obeying commands the game gives you, usually brief 'go fetch a thing' repeated ad nauseum. The result feels like an indie film that you passively watch but you have to do random chores to progress through.\n- As such, don't try to disobey the signposted direction the game is funneling you toward. You will slowly crawl off and eventually hit an invisible wall, and then have to endure the tedium of walking all the way back to the one and only path.\n\nIf you're okay with all that, you may enjoy this game.

Yes it worth getting, if you are looking for a very interesting story shown in a game form and with little gameplay to it.  Is it worth the price?  If you ask me, it not worth the full price.  But it worth getting, when and If you can get it in the lowest and most cheapest price ever.\n\nOther wise, i would advise waiting till it get a sale before buying it.

I'm certainly no stranger to story driven products through Steam, but A Bird Story just doesn't feel engaging. It's a linear narrative conveyed entirely through RPGMaker visuals that tells the tale of a boy who comes across an injured bird and must learn how to let go, through bizarre sequences like flying on a paper aeroplane mixed in with normal scenes like life in a classroom.\n\nWhile the premise holds value I just wasn't that interested in it. The tale woven feels lacks the depth I've come to expect from stories, and while the visuals were enough for me to gain an understanding of what was happening it sadly wasn't enough to make me want to know more. At times the pacing could be sluggish and a few instances where I felt the tone was inconsistent with the overall package. With only an hour of content to have even that amount padded out was disappointing. It's also a story that, as far as I can tell, you can't pause when the game is in one of its automatic sequences.\n\nThe player interaction is pretty limited as well. Mostly it's take boy from point A to point B, and if you try to wander off the path the game has set out it just blocks you off and forces you back. In some cases it's expecting literally one input to trigger the next thing, dressed up as player interaction.

Well, A Bird Story is actually a very nice interactive story, and I say interactive story because it really is just an interactive story which some people tend to mistake for as a game. A Bird Story has a very limited \"gameplay\" (I say gameplay because I don't know what else to call it) which just includes walking around and pressing some arrow keys in order to move on with the story. The graphics/art can either be good or bad, depending on the player's taste. It also doesn't have that much of an interesting plot/story. So why did I recommend it? I did it because of the way it tells the story, which it actually does so well I got goosebumps when it ended and it did it without a single line of dialogue. True, the story may be a bit boring, bland, or mundane (or whatever synonyms you can think of) at times, but that's actually the beauty of it (in my opinion). These boring scenes (like looking out the window during class, getting creeped out by people in the elevator, wanting to play in the rain,  etc.) are what makes A Bird Story and its main character more relatable to the player.

To The Moon got you to forgive its shortcomings while Bird Story makes them more noticeable. I'm not one to compare apples to oranges or even apples to apples, but every way To The Moon worked is where Bird Story doesn't. Moon vied for time with cutesy humor and bread crumbs towards the story while Bird Story kills time with tedium in both story and gameplay. Where Moon delivered an engaging story that culminated into something and compensated for the game engine, Bird Story delivers next to none with nothing but the expected. And whether comparisons are fair or not it just plain doesn't work like it's predecessor somehow did. Lightning did not strike twice. \n\nOn its own two legs Bird Story, without any comparisons, is a dull story. Imaginative kid finds injured bird and cares for it. No twists or anything, that is just it. When that domino of story entertainment falls every other one does too. Beyond a mildly interesting piano soundtrack for sleepy eyes? The art, particularly visuals, aren't special. Even within the confines of the RPG Maker realm. Bird Story did find one or two interesting ways to tell its story within its medium, but it was very often repetitive and painstakingly slowly delivered. And finally the gameplay, there's just next to none. And yet it is still tedious somehow. \n\nCute at times and another interesting take on RPG Maker, but dull dull dull.

And I can understand some being potentially put off by that. But for what it is in fact attempting to be and is clearly advertised as - that is, an interactive short story, rather than a game in the traditional sense - it hits the mark [i]hard.[/i]\n\n[i]A Bird Story[/i] is an experience that I'm very glad I had. It's simple, yet thought-provoking. It's down to earth, yet injected with a healthy, enchanting dose of fantasy and imagination. It's deeply emotional, yet doesn't shy away from occasional comedic moments (which, by the way, really surprised me in getting some genuine laughs out of me). It uses absolutely zero words to convey a wonderfully executed, heartfelt story of childhood, friendship, and loss. The complete lack of words of any kind (aside from the end credits) makes this equally accessible to speakers of absolutely any language and those too young or otherwise impaired in reading ability, which I think is something pretty special.\n\nAt first glance the pixel art is tiny and the animations seem like they'll be limited, but the further I got into it, the more [i]A Bird Story[/i] impressed me with how much it could do in such a small space. Being a short story gives [i]A Bird Story[/i] the freedom to have many different bespoke character sprites for each and every small moment, making it feel alive the whole way through.\n\nThe music is also incredibly deserving of praise. It swelled into emotional crescendos and faded into silence or quiet at all the right moments. It's beautiful and I am strongly considering buying the soundtrack. Calling it [i]completely[/i] devoid of gameplay also wouldn't be a hundred percent fair; a simple thing like which arrow keys to press at which moments is sometimes used in adorable and inventive ways to keep the player feeling involved.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't need absolutely everything on Steam to be gameplay-heavy, and is at all interested in just settling down for about an hour and experiencing a charming story, I would definitely recommend [i]A Bird Story[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1503957146, "timestamp_updated": 1503957182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541647851467132568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34532366": {"recommendationid": "34532366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264978259", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1503842626}, "language": "english", "review": "Before you start reading, I'd like to say that I do not hate the game. Yet, that does not mean I like it either. I like some aspects of it, but other than that, nothing.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics and colors are nice - though a bit tiny -, and the music is really good, just like To The Moon. Though I liked it, I wasn't particularily amazed by To The Moon's story - compared to many reviews I've seen that claim that the game is really, really good, really immersive and heartbreaking/warming. But, considering it may be just my taste in this, I still respect that opinion about it.\n\nHowever, it felt a bit ... empty. Some may say that it's the point of it, but, it really feels empty, in the story itself. It has a dreamy feeling about it - a good one a that, but only to tell a story we'd find in our everyday lives - and, let's be honest, a bit typical. That parallel makes it somewhat off and weird. It also keeps on guiding you here and there, without leaving much of a choice - which can be fine, if it was more intuitive. Sometimes, I was a bit clueless as to what to do at the moment. Also, whether or not you fail on some parts, the game itself fixes it. So no real challenge here, even if it's not what we'd seek in it in the first place.\n\nAnother point that left me a bit frustrated was the fact that we can't pause during the many scenes in which you can't do anything - so if you get distracted, you end up losing track of the story. It's a bit sad to get lost/be too slow in a game that not only guides you, but also is supposed to be really calm and slow...\n\nSo, in all honesty, this prequel - also, yes, the fact that it is a prequel to another game scares me about what's going to come out next ... - would've been really good, if only some parts weren't as disappointing as it is.\nStill, I hope the main game will be better.

Do you love games that stir up emotions? Have you loved To The Moon? If so... you might like this game, but there's a good chance it will leave you disappointed. It certainly didn't amaze me.\n\nRight off the top: this game is short. Hell, you can probably play through the entire thing in little more than a single hour. This doesn't give you enough time to become attached to the characters or get emotionally invested in the story.\n\nAnother thing you might not expect: no dialogue. The game goes out of its way to tell the entire story with nothing but environments and visual metaphors and it certainly has some really good ideas on how to convey it. But some of the metaphors fall short of the point into obscurity and there's a limit on how complex a story you can tell this way. I'm still at loss on what actually happened at some points in the game. I wasn't shocked or surprised or touched in a deep way by anything I saw.\n\nBut what really kills this game is the interactivity, or to be more precise, the near-complete lack of it. The game is comprised of lengthy cut-scenes connected by brief and meaningless moments of interaction. It's 100% linear, no choices ever matter and all you're ever required to do is going from point A to point B and sometimes pressing the action button. It's mundane and pointless.

IMO the biggest downside of this game is the limited amount of actual gameplay. Most of it is animations, telling the story for you. Often I asked myself aloud 'do I get to play this movie, or...?'\n\nBut, the upsides! The artstyle is cute and reminded me of Braid and the music of Spirited Away. What grabbed my attention nearly immediately was the humour. How well the surreal visual comedy was implemented caught me by surprise and made me laugh out loud multiple times.

[b]For the short review, skip to the last two headings.[/b]\n\n[h1]May the 18th, 2014[/h1]\nSnow doesn't fall where I live. If ever Brazil was known for falling snow, it was in the southernmost region of the land and nowhere else. May the 18th arrived, late and dressed in white, to be the exception. An inexplicable climate anomaly happened to one, and only one, neighborhood in the vast city of S\u00e3o Paulo: mine. \n\nI was running down the street from school, panting and freezing. It was far too cold for my usual garbs, cars were filling the streets in chaotic traffic and the various trees that surrounded me had shed their leaves in silent prayer after so long without rain \u2014 and no doubt after the strength of the falling hail hit them like rocks.\n\nOut the corner of my eye I saw it: a bird buried deep in chunks of melting ice. It struggled to free itself, its little chest heaving in a show of effort. Without thinking twice, I halted on my tracks, knelt down in the ice and leaves, and took the poor trembling thing in my hands.\n\nIt felt like holding a tiny feathered heart, one that could stop beating at any second, lest I look away for a single heartbeat.\n\nAt that point I was less than 5 minutes away from my home, but that swift time saw itself doubled once I was forced to walk in a more tactful manner in order to not jolts the poor thing around.\n\nArriving at home felt like arriving at the emergency room of a hospital with a terminal patient dying in my arms. I ushered my mother to get a shoe box, stripped my father of his newspapers, turned the house upside-down for one of those old yellow light bulbs that grow hotter with time, found bundles of cotton and put it all together in a makeshift bed I'm all too proud of despite its hastiness in coming to life.\n\nThe bird looked like it was going to die. Its wet feathers were stuck to its tiny body like a furry dog after a long bath, making it look sickly and fragile. It was trembling and didn't even flinch away from human touch so shocked it must have been. My mother then said \u2014 and this I'll never forget:\n\n\"You know he's probably going to die, right?\"\n\nWe found some recipes for home-made bird food, and fed it and watered it with a dropper. Eventually it eased its trembling under the warm light and the thermal isolation provided by the newspapers. We made holes in the shoebox and decided to leave it there overnight, with the lid closed lest the bird fly off and hit a window.

We brought the shoebox to the backyard and I remember holding my breath as I slowly lifted the lid.\n\nWitnessing it soar away was one of the happiest and warmest I've ever felt. The feeling persists.\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\n[i]A Bird Story[/i], in its tenderness, managed to resurrect in me all these fond memories. Freebird Games have a charm in executing stories that by far exceed words and, in roughly one and a half hours, [i]A Bird Story[/i] brought me to relive from good friendships I've had and lost, to the one bird I saved during that unexpected hail storm.\n\nI see no reason not to recommend this heartwarming game. Although some would argue its briefness is a weak point, I see it a strong one: Freebird Games knows for how long narrate a sweet tale without giving anyone cavities.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]A Bird Story[/i] is a short endearing story whose only major fault, according its waiting crowd, is not being as good as [i]To The Moon[/i]. Granted, it isn't, but that only goes so far as the script, in my humble opinion. The execution still sustains that signature whimsiness and tactfulness that few of us can only ever dream of achieving in any realm of our lives.", "timestamp_created": 1499875454, "timestamp_updated": 1499875454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767944693565368652", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33437434": {"recommendationid": "33437434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021811520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1499710937}, "language": "english", "review": "Tale about childhood.

I dont remember how much I paid for it, but I'm one of the fans that loves it.\n\nThe word of caution is correct, and after playing this game I see why.  Everything that could be said about the game is in the description of the game.  The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are what you'd expect from Freebird Games, the story is short and simple, and the gameplay is... rather simple as well.  But that's exactly what you should expect if you read the description.\n\nIt doesn't all make sense the first time you play.  Some parts are silly, and there are a few parts you could miss if you just rush through (though none vital to the story.  Anything vital to the story you are forced to do to move on).  However, I believe it makes a good cohesive whole, even if you'll be left with unanswered questions.\n\nAll in all I do reccomend the game, especially if you're a fan of To The Moon.  Same graphic style, same level of music quality.  I dont think its the same level of quality with the story, but I still enjoyed it anwyway.  If you're wanting a sequal to To The Moon, then this isn't it.  If all you liked in To The Moon was the story and you're expecting a very deep, thoughtful and thought provoking story from A Bird Story (like in To The Moon), then you'll be disappointed too.  If you enjoyed To The Moon because of the graphics, song, and want a short and simple story with a bit of interactivity sprinkled in, then this is the perfect game for you.\n\nI have high hopes for the actual sequal, and from this short story I can already see I'm not going to be dissapointed <3", "timestamp_created": 1499627326, "timestamp_updated": 1499627326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33399802": {"recommendationid": "33399802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044741485", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1499595016}, "language": "english", "review": "A little and cute 'teaser' for the upcoming game, Finding Paradise.

No lo recomiendo ni si quiera a los fans de la precuela, porque una cosa es experimentar y otra cosa es tomar el pelo a la gente. \u00bfY la banda sonora? Indiferente, lo \u00fanico que consigue es hacer m\u00e1s lento el juego todav\u00eda. Lo \u00fanico que saco de todo esto es que la compa\u00f1\u00eda ha hecho un buen negocio desde luego.", "timestamp_created": 1499167361, "timestamp_updated": 1499167361, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455110877752304077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33210965": {"recommendationid": "33210965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138814947", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1498791309}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice simple story, while it doesn't have any text of the sort it uses visualisation in a clever way to convey the story.

However, unlike To The Moon, there is no dialogue at all, and everything is based off of what happens. The story is nice and sweet, however it is extremely slow and can get to a point of boring. While I understand what the story is trying to get at making you feel and understand, the progression is simply way too slow. For a short game to begin with, the slowness really eats away at the content.\n\nAlthough the story progression is subpar, the music is excellent once again. A Bird Story features some extremely soothing and fitting soundtracks even thought it is super short. The visual and background design for the game is also great for an RPGMaker game.\n\nOverall, the story progression for this extremely short game is lackluster even if it has good audio and visuals, so I cannot recommend this game.

But as the store description says - this is a different style. While the RPG Game Maker graphics remain the gameplay and story telling is different. You witness a story about a boy and his pet, adventures and life decisions. What you have here is actually barely a game. It has minimal input from the player and even that is linear or irrelevant. The game tells you when you can move but takes away this ability without notifying you and that feels bad. Not a terrible experience but just really average. Honestly, I am looking forward to Finding Paradise and as such it is okay to support the devs with the purchase of this game. However, even the devs offer the refund if this is not what you were looking for. Gameplay is below 1.5 hours, maybe more if you want all 3 trading cards, so you can refund even after finishing. For me it was a short linear story but it also is a means to support someone. Because of that I do not regret my purchase. Many people might, so it depends on you, this one sits on the edge but I do recommend it in the end.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1494441270, "timestamp_updated": 1495265996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572708189487457275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31630632": {"recommendationid": "31630632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191643711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1495804072}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute, very sweet, and imaginative tale!

[/h1]\n\nThe music is pretty good, even great at times. This is probably the main reason quite some people like this game. This definitely gave the game a boost in my rating of it.\n\nThe animation isn't outstanding or anything, I mean, it's pixel-art, but even for pixel-art, this doesn't look good. The protagonist is in the middle of a tile, even during the cutscenes, so when he picks something up or gives something to someone, it looks weird, which is emplified by the fact that it's done right when he picks up his backpack. The transitions from place to place are done in a strange way, sometimes effectively, sometimes it just looks dumb. Its backgrounds are great though, mostly.\n\nIt's in the \"game\" part that this game fails; the \"game\" to this game is no more than walking from point A to point B and ocationally pressing directions to move the cutscenes along, which was pretty weird and it felt unnatural to do so. The parts where you walked around from point A to point B also just kind of plop you in like \"Hey, remember that this is a game? Good. Now roll the next cutscene.\" It felt especially weird with the arrow keys showing up on screen after every cutscene, even though I had been using my controller for the past half an hour. If this were to be a YouTube short film, I'd say this is good, but it's a game, for which you have to pay 4 dollars (or pounds or euros or whatever), which is a bit expensive for what it is. The game drags on for way too long at times, it gets really boring.\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that the times that you do walk around, your movement is very limited and stiff. First of all, you have to use either a controller or the arrow keys, not WASD, which isn't a big problem, but it sucks you can't just change that in the settings. Second of all, you're being taken down a path, and there are invisable walls sprinkled across the place for no good reason I can think of. Third of all, and most importantly, you move from tile to tile. I thought we fixed this like 10 years ago!? Why is this still a thing? You can't go diagonally and you can't input-buffer your directions. This was frustrating to sit through for a person like me.\n\nI don't know why the creators of this game decided not to add any dialog, but I find this to be an unnecessary detail. Like, it's implied that they talk, so why not just add some words and not by unnecessarily cryptic? The images in the speech bubbles were clear as day anyway, so just typing up a sentence wouldn't have made this a less complex work or whatever.\n\nOne particular thing that A: pissed me off and B: made my opinion of this game sink even deeper, was [spoiler] a flashback. We were just being chased around by the nurse lady (because \"comedy\") and should know full well that the kid should've left the bird at the hospital with her, or at least that the nurse lady wants to get the bird into the hospital, and then the boy sees that the bird can't fly, so of course, we, as the viewe- Ahem, sorry, \"player\", would think that the kid will probably bring it back to the vet. And then they throw in the flashback. Like, we know this, and if anyone reading this didn't, you weren't paying attention, or you didn't play up to that point yet. That was one of the main plot points of this story, and after just being reminded a couple of seconds ago, we apparently still need a flashback. ARGH, that pissed me off. So did the sloppy attempts at comedy by the way, but that's probably partialy due to the grumpy mood THIS GAME put me into... A-Anyway. [/spoiler]\n\nFinal thoughts:\nJust go watch a playthrough of this on YouTube if you really want to know the story, and there is no more to this than just the story. Markiplier or jacksepticeye probably played this. It's free like that anyway. That's closer to the price this is actually worth.\n\n2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1492626882, "timestamp_updated": 1492626882, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496188044548034668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31207196": {"recommendationid": "31207196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145557537", "num_games_owned": 986, "num_reviews": 240, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1543536073}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan of To the Moon, I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't recommend it.

But at 60 minutes, this game was 59 too long. There is little to no interaction, the basic storytelling is very confusing (was a character hit? Was the sound effect indicating distress? A physical action that took place?). For a story with no dialog and little interaction, oversignts and problems like that leave you completely at a loss for what to think or take away from it.\n\n The lack of dialogue is a neat idea, but without dialogue, there needs to be some form of interaction. Occasionally the game will grudgingly allow you to transport the character to the next scene or to open a door, but then it's back to absolute tedium. It is buggy as well.

Pues no, realmente no.\n\nQuiero aclarar que me encant\u00f3 el trabajo anterior de Kan Gao, \"To the Moon\". Era una experiencia realmente diferente y la profundidad de su mensaje era notoria y notable. Si no has jugado a \"To The Moon\", te lo recomiendo encarecidamente, pero \"A Bird Story\" es otra historia muy diferente.\n\nPara empezar, este experimento como su propio creador lo define no es un juego, ni siquiera es una experiencia Walking Simulator ni nada parecido. El \"juego\" dura como una hora y media m\u00e1s o menos, de la cual el 95% estar\u00e1s mirando la pantalla sin poder hacer nada. El resto del tiempo, mover\u00e1s al personaje de un punto A a uno B, y esto apenas durar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de 30 segundos en cada ocasi\u00f3n.\n\nEl personaje que \"controlas\" es un ni\u00f1o y es bastante simp\u00e1tico, y en varias ocasiones se dan situaciones divertidas pero siempre a modo de \"cinem\u00e1tica\".\n\nLuego, el argumento es realmente simpl\u00f3n. S\u00ed claro, uno puede hacerse mil pajas mentales si quiere con la relaci\u00f3n entre el p\u00e1jaro y el ni\u00f1o. Faltar\u00eda m\u00e1s. Es bien conocido por todos que muchos gamers tienen un Schopenhauer o un Nietzsche en su interior deseando salir, y m\u00e1s si al gamer a\u00fan no le han salido pelos ni en los bajos.\n\nPero lo cierto es que el \"juego\" presenta un argumento realmente b\u00e1sico, muy alejado de lo que pudimos ver en \"To the Moon\" y su profundidad espacio-tiempo. A \"A Bird Story\" le falta madurez argumentativa y le sobra infulas de grandeza.

Most of the time it's like watching silent cutscenes from a SNES RPG game. True, the scenes are often very beautiful and dreamlike (like when you exit your house or classroom and you find yourself in the middle of the forest or when you ride that paper plane) but after a while I felt rather bored than impressed. And after 1 or 2 hours you should finished it completely.\nThe bond between the boy and the bird was nice, though but not too strong or something that would be stuck in my memory anytime soon.\n\nSo: I don't know if I should recommend this game even though it's not technically bad, it just offers not much.\nIt's pretty and relaxing, short and cute but no must-have.

To this day, the profound and haunting storyline of To the Moon has stayed with me, and, it will probably always stay with me. I doubt that I will forget that game anytime soon. \n\nI consider A Bird Story to be To the Moon's less intense little cousin. Fear not, this game will still take you on a ride on the feels train. This is a bittersweet and carefree story that will no doubt resonate with the inner child within us all. Did it move me to tears? Well, I'll admit, my eyes did get watery quite a few times. I wasn't exactly bawling my eyes out like I did with To the Moon, though. However, there's nothing wrong with that at all. To the Moon was definitely designed to be way more heavy. This game was obviously designed to be much more tame and mellow.\n\nGameplay is rather short, but, it still packs an emotional punch that'll leave a melancholy and bittersweet imprint. I was also overjoyed when I found out that Freebird Games was making a new game, called Finding Paradise, which will delve into the dying mind of the man who was the little boy in A Bird Story. So, it appears that A Bird Story is the prequel to Finding Paradise. That being said, I definitely suggest that anyone who loves To the Moon or is planning to play Finding Paradise checks this out. However, even as a stand alone game, this is a very sweet and bittersweet little game that'll no doubt tug on your heartstrings regardless of whether or not you have played To the Moon or are planning to play the sequel, Finding Paradise. \n\nFreebird Games (the makers of the games I've been mentioning in this review) know how to make games that bring out raw and unadulterated emotions in people. Their games will make you cry, they will make you think about life, loss, death, and everything in between. I won't spoil the ending, so, I'll say as much as I can say without ruining the plot too much. In short, this is a story about a little boy who was lonely. Then, he made a new friend. A bird.

To the moon simply blew me away story wise and music wise and when i saw a bird story i blindly assumed it was again something that would blew me away. \n\nThe art style appealed to me. (same as for to the moon). The simple pixel art style and great soundtrack make this game nice. But nothing more than nice. Throughout the whole playtrough (roughly 1 hour) i got the feeling i was missing something. A background in the story. I was hoping that all became clear while i progressed through the game, but when it ended i still had the feeling i missed something. Actually the game left me with some serious why's. \n\nThe controls (or lack thereof) was also something that surprised me. The number of actions that you have to perform yourselve is very limited and the effect it has on the enviroment is therefore also limited. In some cases i was clicking aroung like a madman while the story was doing the actions themselves. (e.g. walking to an area and switching a light on or off). The game indicates when an user interaction is required, but does not indicate when the story takes over. \n\nPersonaly i got the feeling that this story had way more potential than  it currently has. That doesn't mean it is in overall a bad game, but it means i had different expectations of it. I still enjoyed my playthrough enough to finalize it. \nAlthough i might sound a bit negative i still am anxious to wait for the sequal (which i hope will be more like to the moon). \n\n\nThe price of the game makes this game a no brainer. You can pick it up as long as you manage your expectations a little. \n\nI give this game a 6/10 \nMusic 7/10\ngraphics 7/10\nstory 5/10\nCharacter development 5/10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482966620, "timestamp_updated": 1482966620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28768428": {"recommendationid": "28768428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023467070", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482963107}, "language": "english", "review": "!!!", "timestamp_created": 1482963199, "timestamp_updated": 1482963199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452907860279083252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28751511": {"recommendationid": "28751511", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992864121", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482931267}, "language": "english", "review": "Disappointingly shallow, especially when compared to To The Moon.", "timestamp_created": 1482931839, "timestamp_updated": 1482931839, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468027949333190918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28747935": {"recommendationid": "28747935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124220815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482923875}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played, without a single word of dialogue the game perfectly captures a multitude of emotions.

Because this game needs to become way more popular before the sequel to \"to the moon\" comes out, so every  review counts.\n\nTL:DR\n8/10. Short, not as emotional as to the moon, and kinda predictable, but it's a really good story, and fits in nicely with too the moon. But! it is a must buy if your looking forwards to the to the moon sequel.\n\nFull review:\n\nI think most people came here after playing Too the Moon (which I will now shorten to TTM) TTM is a must have game for anyone who is addicted to the \"Story Rich\" Tag. Free bird studios was successful in making a game that fits alongside Underale, LISA, The Walking Dead, Life is Strange, and countless other games with a heart-felt story, likeable characters,  a good soundtrack, and some sort of applicable moral or lesson.\n\nAnd what do people usually do after playing one of these games? well if the story was good, they'll usually think about it for one or two weeks, tell some people about it, maybe write a review, and await a sequal if the story didn't have complete closure.\n\nFor me, TTM was no different. After playing the game, and watching that final scene, I sat in my chair and thought \"Damn,  it's over, isn't it?\" But I wasn't able to shake it out of my mind. So I listened to the soundtrack, played some of the free games on Free Bird's website (Which you should really check out!) and read the comic that they made. It was finally getting some rest in the back of my mind, when one day, i saw.... that a sequal was planned.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes! It was like christmas had come early! I knew that I would have to get it. But why tell you all this? well because, and minor spoiler for Bird story here....... This game Doesn't really have much to do with TTM, but it has everything to do with it's sequel.\n\nAnd thats what people need to understand. Sure, as a standalone game, it's only an 8 out of 10, a solid B. But in context, this game provides the foundation for an amazing sequel, one that could even be better than TTM!. I can't really go into why without spoiling anything, but just know that this game will have you even more hyped for the TTM sequal.\n\nall around a great way to spend a cold winter afternoon.", "timestamp_created": 1482874598, "timestamp_updated": 1482874598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28721796": {"recommendationid": "28721796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051525781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482862114}, "language": "english", "review": "I would like to begin by saying that I wouldn't consider this game, it's basically a (slightly) interactable story, whoever, I personally liked the story altough if you're expecting a To The Moon story this is far from it, not very moving or touching. as for the graphics I liked the details and animations of the pixel art if you're into pixel art you should enjoy this game's graphics, and about the music it's very enjoyable and fits the game's story very well.\nSince the \"game\" is an hour long and has very little replay value I think that one dollar is a good price for it considering it's quality.", "timestamp_created": 1482863572, "timestamp_updated": 1482863572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28717390": {"recommendationid": "28717390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045136299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482856617}, "language": "english", "review": "A Bird Story is a /lightly/ interactive story told solely through its visuals (pixel art) and music.

I tried to come in without much expectations, and I even knew that it was mostly just a sit-back-and-watch \"game.\" I mean, the title even calls it a story.\n\nHowever, that ended up not quite true. A Bird Story does have you play, controlling the kid every so often, performing actions that are mostly super slow and tedious. The game basically just pops up with images of items and you have to walk somewhere in a room (or in an adjacent one), grab the item, and return to the original location. That was one piece that really bothered me and added arbitrary time to the story for not much reason at all, making the true length of A Bird Story even shorter.\n\nEssentially, the story is rather predictable and cliche overall, despite the art direction being unique. The child, whose name we never learn because the game has no text or dialogue at all, is a rather lonely kid. He seems to have no friends, though his parent(s) do show love to him from what little we can see. And as the name implies, the game does literally involve a bird, which he befriends.\n\nThe game takes just around an hour, maybe a little more, to go through a handful of days of his life with the bird, as far as I can tell. The display is rather surreal, which is definitely a pro. For instance, as you walk around in short bits of the game, the environment will drastically change from the kid's memory, where you'll walk out a door into the forest, and then another door suddenly appears to take you into school. Trees will even move around while you're walking in a few places, forcing you down a certain path.\n\nWhile I liked that art, as the kid's imagination and memory are all merging together for some uniqueness, those qualities of the game do not save it as a whole. As said above, almost no interaction from us was really worth it, considering the developers threw in many tedious or repetitive tasks, whereas To the Moon did not feel that way.\n\nReally, the game is just trying to get people invested into the kid and his childhood. It is a teaser for the bigger sequel to To the Moon, called Finding Paradise as of right now. That is another reason that bothers me and somewhat explains why I didn't feel like the game brought anywhere near as much of an experience.\n\nDespite the game getting some emotion from me, I think the best description of my experience is to say \"I was simultaneously happy, sad, and bored.\"", "timestamp_created": 1481933383, "timestamp_updated": 1481934430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654575228691101074", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28383703": {"recommendationid": "28383703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003142691", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1481789165}, "language": "english", "review": "When approaching writing this I went back and looked at my review for To The Moon; which was the other game by these Devs. That should have been warning enough for me to have not wasted my time on this.

Check forums for details.\n\nKan Gao's (the developer) use of the word \"experimental\" certainly describes the game well. The \"gameplay\" and interaction is minimal, even more so than his previous work, To the Moon. With so much of the game on auto pilot, it's hard to decide whether the entire thing should have just been that, and thus a video rather than game, or have more interaction to actually make the interaction meaningful. While the gameplay sometimes felt like it interrupted the narrative more than adding to it, there were more than a few sequences that were fun to control the character.\n\nIts story, both in plot and execution, is worth discussing as well. It was simple enough and exactly as it says on the tin; 'a boy who found an injured bird, told through a blur between reality and imagination'. Surreal in many instances, yet relatable and interesting most of the time. Its initial few minutes were more confusing rather than intriguing, but I was invested once the titular bird appears. To be able to express a range of emotion with sprites is a commendable feat, as well as humour without any text whatsoever.\n\nAs ever, its music is a lovely accompaniment to the game and one that I will look forward to listening to in my spare time. The art and rather creative use of assets is something I hope to see more both from Kan Gao and other developers.\n\nIn summary, would I recommend the game? The thumbs up above is an obvious yes. It does come with a qualifier however; the game is definitely not for everyone. After finishing it, I was left with mixed feelings. No regret or buyer's remorse, but rather confusion as to what I just experienced. Even with that however, I'd recommend the game to people to encourage more experimentation like A Bird Story, even if they don't always work out. That Kan Gao also understand how divisive and different the game can be, offering full refunds no questions asked, is simply icing on the cake.\n", "timestamp_created": 1481635577, "timestamp_updated": 1481635577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28339491": {"recommendationid": "28339491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279621511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1485118379}, "language": "english", "review": "With neither dialogue nor narration, this game speak volumes with an hour worth of intense emotion, alluring melody and beauteous artwork.\n\nTears fall as I am left spellbound with delight and sorrow.\nNeed I say more?\n", "timestamp_created": 1481614821, "timestamp_updated": 1498366967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599929094314575195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28322934": {"recommendationid": "28322934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082348556", "num_games_owned": 714, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1527448268}, "language": "english", "review": "ako my\u0161lienka je pekna aj  pr\u00edbech ale taketo nie\u010do tu nepatr\u00ed :D ale aj tak daval like za zabity \u010das :D", "timestamp_created": 1481526329, "timestamp_updated": 1481526329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443686008453369141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28270146": {"recommendationid": "28270146", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980993256", "num_games_owned": 3096, "num_reviews": 257, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1473853926}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A Bird Story es otra de las razones por las que To the Moon era una maravilla.

D\u00e9jame repetirlo: NO HAY NING\u00daN DI\u00c1LOGO. Todo consta en observar los escenarios y descifrar. Descifrar tampoco es tan sencillo en un jueg como \u00e9ste.

To the moon por lo menos met\u00eda puzzles con calzador, como requisito para que se sintiera que estabas jugando, pero aqu\u00ed nada..., a lo sumo es pedirte que vayas unos metros desde el punto A hasta el punto B, sin ninguna opci\u00f3n de exploraci\u00f3n ni de indagaci\u00f3n de objetos. Y si por alguna raz\u00f3n hay alg\u00fan camino secundario, el juego te hace retroceder autom\u00e1ticamente al personaje para convencerte de que vayas por el camino que \u00e9l quiere, tan al estilo \"but thou must!\".\nAs\u00ed que divi\u00e9rtete mirando escenas bobitas con un p\u00e1jaro mientras que, de vez en vez, te pide que pulses la flecha unos segundos para que el chamaco recorra unos metros m\u00e1s y entre otra condenada escenita insulsa.\n\nLo termin\u00e9 en dos horas despu\u00e9s de darme cabezazos.

The game could only be auto-saved in certain points, which is also a minor draw back.\nI do not recommmend this game if you wish to maintain the good impression you got from \"to the moon\".", "timestamp_created": 1472420364, "timestamp_updated": 1472420364, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500934898853302002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25196095": {"recommendationid": "25196095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067189801", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1472330648}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it.

Yes I have only played 19 minutes of this game and it was enough to make up my mind.

Boring tile-based level design, poor low res SEGA Genesis-style graphics, agonizingly slow camera pans, fade ins and fade outs that take forever and so on. \n\nI may be mistaken but I think the author tried to convey the feeling of loneliness and maybe to some extent alienation that all kids experience sometimes. If so, then I'm afraid he either wasn't qualified enough to fully express himself or chose the wrong engine. RPG Maker seems to be a simple tool, but it's just too restricting, especially for projects which are more ambitious than your regular j-rpg. A Bird's Story is quite ambitious, in that - as far as I can tell, which is up to 19th minute of the game - there is no text in the game, so the player fills the blanks himself/herself). I guess it belongs to Ambitious Failure category of games, as well as to Incredibly Boring one. \n\n(For the record, I played To The Moon by the very same game developer and I was quite impressed with it.
