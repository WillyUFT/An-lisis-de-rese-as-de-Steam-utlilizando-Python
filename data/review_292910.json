The games feature a large cast of creative characters as well as a variety of diverse locations, which keeps things fresh and interesting throughout.\n\nThe games\u2019 story is certainly interesting and will keep you playing, delivering twists and turns as well as a good amount of character development, but where the series really shines is with its humour. Dialogue is witty and Rufus has something to say about just about everything, with jokes often featuring dark comedy and setting the protagonist up to somehow be both likeable and a massive jerk.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the games to be classic point and click adventures, having you talk to characters, explore locations to find objects and somehow combine everything to solve light puzzles in order to progress. The Puzzles are well-explained and logical enough to be beatable by just about anyone. Should you ever get stuck, there\u2019s a highlighting feature to mark all interactable spots and the option to skip any minigame.\n\nThe drawn assets and cutscenes look great and are complemented by great voice acting (I used the original German dub.) and a fitting, memorable soundtrack. Throughout the games Deponia feels like an actual place, with many unique locations and characters giving it a lived-in atmosphere.\n\nThis collection also has some unique features not found in the individual games. You\u2019ll have access to a world map showing your progress, a quest log for even more guidance through your tasks and a developer commentary, offering insight and original songs for every single screen in the game. The first game also contains new collectibles strewn throughout it, like the sequels already offered.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThis is one of my favourite game series and I very much recommend getting it.

And while I wouldn't consider myself a great puzzle gamer, I know what i like and what puzzles I enjoy. The Deponia games I did not enjoy. \n\nDon't get me wrong, a lot of love and attention to detail has been poured into these games. The visuals, the story, the characters (despite the main character being highly annoying), and the atmosphere are all fantastic. But it's the puzzles that really let it down. They simply aren't logical. There's one puzzle that requires you to turn down the music in the settings to progress. I don't remember there being a prompt to do so, unless part of the dialogue is lost in translation. The hints towards some of these counter intuitive puzzles are so vague or easily glossed over it'll have you googling a walk-through. In fact I challenge anyone to play the English language version and complete all three games without using a guide.\n\nAnother annoyance about the puzzles for me is the strange way they're often dragged out into multiple parts. For example you might need to combine part A with part B to make something work, but combining them broke both parts and now you need to locate parts X Y and Z to fix parts A and B and then take them to another location to have them altered in some way before returning to finally use parts A and B to complete the puzzle. All the while none of this process will be obvious within the context of the game. For me, when the solution clicks and I figure it out, that's where I get my dopamine hit. In this example, locating and combining parts A and B is a puzzle enough in itself if done properly. It's where the whole point of playing a puzzle game comes from. For the game to then stick it's finger up at you and say sure you got that part right, but now that puzzle has changed and there's more for you to do, really spoils it. It feels like the over-engineering Germans are infamous for bleeding into the puzzles.

black history month? yea no try June 1448. rufus tricks a black girl to strip down into only a t shirt and dance as a monkey. there are a couple of moments to relieve the stress but the game doesn't allow you too. its kinda degrading)\n-the orphans (we don't know what happened to them ;all but one, but its likely they died. i could be wrong but the game kinda makes you believe they died.)\n-sexualizes a couple women (im a big man with lots of testosterone. i have no qualms here. pin up goal is goated and toni is ultimate waifu material and if you wouldnt let her put a leash on you and walk you around town in full leather then you my friend are weird)\n-the baby (i actually laughed then turned to stone realizing the baby just swallowed his liver weight in antidepressants.) \n-the noose (rufus for literally no reason tries to get toni to hang herself.)\n-goon (i died laughing when he ate the shoe. i pressed f to pay respects when he lost the girl.)\n-sexualizing goal ( yes this is seprate. i really like goal. shes as much of a MC as rufus, almost. shes more than just eye candy. idk just feels weird. loved pin up goal in first game. kinda felt weird to have it after the trilogy.)\n-lotti (a trans character that is WAY over the top. almost annoyingly over the top)\n-no means no (im not really sure of the context here because i skipped most of the convo but people really seemed to be annoyed about the the bar convo with rufus and goal.)\n-animal abuse (idk the robo dog brains exploding. and the platapus poisoning? idk for sure tho)\n\nnow to the review. great game. great series. very very smooth brain ending. the puzzles are good and theres alot. the items are cool and the combinations are unique. alot of the assumptions and guessing either involves getting it right the first time or getting it right after trying literally EVERYTHING. example: bees make honey? grab bees to make honey. door knob makes bannana? idk but ive literally tried everything and now im using every item i got on a doorknob. better in game example would be using tortillas as blankets for the orphans. again i really enjoy this game and series but that ending... \n", "timestamp_created": 1691628480, "timestamp_updated": 1691628480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143234600": {"recommendationid": "143234600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141837298", "num_games_owned": 813, "num_reviews": 765, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1690927066}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid Point & Click for those who like it", "timestamp_created": 1690938148, "timestamp_updated": 1690938148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143119891": {"recommendationid": "143119891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161669283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2559, "last_played": 1691292720}, "language": "spanish", "review": "U N A  V E R G A, exclusivamente el final, 40hs tiradas a la basura, es absurdo y un sin sentido", "timestamp_created": 1690768379, "timestamp_updated": 1690768379, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142691404": {"recommendationid": "142691404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867521663", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1601, "last_played": 1689882705}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me preface this by saying, I really didn't want to do this. Daedalic is (well, was) an outstanding developer of point-and-click adventures, having produced some of my most beloved games, like The Night of The Rabbit, The Whispered World, or Anna's Quest. (You should try those!) One of their most prestigious titles, the Deponia series, sadly doesn't live up to that reputation.\nI would probably rate the first installment positively, but from then on it just gets gradually worse. Let me explain:\n\n1. The Plot\nIs there even a linear plot? Sure, Rufus and Goal -> Elysium. But that mission becomes entangled in so many setbacks and plottwists that it's just a whole giant mess. I know I should stop comparing everything to monkey island, but it's just a too perfect example for a point-and-click game. The main goal there is usually separated into a smaller set of goals, (originally: find a ship, crew, and navigator to sail to monkey island!), each of those still requiring lots of tiniest puzzles to be completed. But at least you know what you're working towards, and at which stage you're progressing. Deponia in that sense is entirely unpredictable. Once you think you've acquired something, it's taken from you, or you're transported to a different environment, changing the course of action entirely. It makes the story so jumbled up that I couldn't retell it if I tried, and at the end, I had no clue what  was even happening. 3 Cletusses? Why? I'm very lost.\n\n2. Gameplay!\nSafe to say it is a decent game of its genre, in terms of mechanics. I didn't get bored playing through it, at least. Mildly frustrated at most. Some puzzles are oddly counterintuitive, and it takes some research at times. Maybe you could blame it on the chosen universe, which is entirely unknown to the player, thus causing some confusion as to how things react with each other. Again, more familiar universes, like pirates and monkey island- you have an idea of what to expect. I won't say it's a bad thing that they made up their own world with unique rules, solutions just tend to feel a bit arbitrary at times. And then the minigames- I'm usually a person who tries, but I gave up at the last part. Most of them are really just clicking around until you get lucky.\nHowever, I was lucky enough to not encounter a single bug during my playthrough, but I've heard otherwise, so be aware of that.\n\n3. The Protagonist\nI could've easily looked past the previous parts, if only the entire game weren't so flawed in its essence. I believe the whole point was to parody usual adventure games, where a girl to be rescued only serves as a 'Goal' and the protagonist will use everyone in his way to achieve this. While it might be a common trope, the way to counter this is not to write the exact same thing in a blatantly exaggerated fashion. Rufus is simply insufferable. (Even more so with his German voice, which seems to be an ongoing issue with Daedalic... just listen to Sadwick in The Whispered World... this led me to play the game in English despite being German, but I believe the jokes were transported well; it felt very natural.)\nThe game makes you play a selfish, outright cruel character, and forces you to follow his ideas. It doesn't feel like you're helping the hero on his adventure, you're just responsible for him getting his way. Point-and-click protagonists are usually snarky and careless, but not insulting in every line of dialogue. It's really unpleasant to watch, and might've been worth it had there been a change of some sorts- but no, every time you expect him to make some progress, it only gets worse, throughout the entire series. No, I don't want to kill those baby dolphins. I don't want to be a piece of shit to some orphans. But the story just goes that way, and it's not for the sake of a joke, just unnecessary. Rufus is written in a way that makes you hate him, maybe on purpose, but they didn't seem to realize that this doesn't make for an enjoyable game.\n\n4. The Big Issue\nSo, this game likes to make jokes. Some that go way too far, objectively. Quite every touchy subject one could think of is joked about here: racism, sexism, pedophilia, transsexuality, domestic abuse, suicide and mental illness, just to name a few... \nYou can make good jokes about all of those. Remember that skin color/difficulty slider in the second South Park game? Yeah, that was funny. Know what's not funny? Making a black person very literally play the monkey. I probably would've thought this is a joke had I heard about it before, it's just so blatant and wrong I don't even have words. Multiple things make it worse: it's the ONLY black character in the entire series, she is directly and explicitly addressed as a monkey, and drawn in an almost-nude, overly sexualized fashion. There's no joke to it, this is supposed to be the whole joke. It's beyond me how any company could regard this as remotely okay, even in 2013.\nThis thing connects to the entire underlying sexism the games have going on- frequently, the female leads are drawn in extremely seductive poses for no reason, and if you find collectibles in the second one, you get a literal nude drawing of Goal as a reward. I can almost see the illustrators salivating every time a female character shows up.\nThis whole display of femininity in an overly sexual way is awful to see throughout the entire series. If this was meant to be a critique of said thing- you don't make a parody by showing the exact same, but worse. Anyone remember the movie 'Cuties'? Yeah, that's what they did too, and it backfired big time.\n\nOther jokes are borderline-inappropriate but still well done. I chuckled at the rope vendor. I feel the game had some good moments, but turned increasingly unappealing. Of course it's not badly made by any means, but it leaves me wondering how some of these jokes made it to the public. I can usually look past lots of bad design choices, but the broad use of themes that are simply inexcusable prevent me from giving an overall positive review. Should you play it - sure you can, it's not terrible gameplay-wise. Just be aware of everything mentioned above; it might leave you with a bad aftertaste. Oh, and I almost forgot something: (spoilers ahead)\n\n5. The Ending\n[spoiler]Ah yes, that ending. I had read plenty about how bad it supposedly was, so it didn't shock me quite as much. I have to agree though, that was the most unsatisfying experience, given I had already subjected myself to everything mentioned above. With how cluttered that plot was, a constant up and down, it didn't even matter a whole lot to me. But from a storytelling perspective- killing off the main character for no reason, really? \nThis can be done well in a story that builds up to it, which this one didn't. It seemed like an entirely arbitrary decision, just to make things even more messy. They tried to fix that general dissatisfaction by simply providing an alternate timeline in the spin-off, but, that's part of a different review.

Point-and-click adventures, where we will experience the life of Rufus, an ambitious, crazy, and careless man who is continually searching for hope while bringing chaos as he reaches his desire to be a hero.\n[list]\n[*][h3]Positives[/h3]\nDiscussing the positives, first of all, the artistic style is unique, with an awesome soundtrack that achieves a great setting and a delightful experience. Secondly, the characters evolution is really good; everyone has their own charisma, especially Rufus, who brings us funny moments and an evolution as a character. Thirdly, the puzzles are quite challenging and thankfully give some advantages if you need them to complete the game; they are mainly new puzzles, making each of them quite defiant overall. Lastly, the story was quite criticised, but it was actually fantastic; the whole evolution of the plot and the character development were perfect; the problem is that it is not for everyone. Additionally, the Spanish dubbing was really good, and personally, I enjoyed it more than the English version.\n[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]\nDespite the positives, there were some technical flaws, one of which was that the game sometimes could be bugged because of doing some action at the wrong moment, obligating you to restart, but thanks to autosave, this was not a huge deal. Besides that, the game, despite being a collection, did not include the Spanish dubbing that was on the two first games sold separately, but you can replace some game files to get it.\n[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]\nTo sum up, it's a great game with a unique setting, good character development, and a great story that has few technical flaws. Despite that, the game is incredible and deserves an 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1687980482, "timestamp_updated": 1699457984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484101921319961548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140754790": {"recommendationid": "140754790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025522562", "num_games_owned": 1486, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 1700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1700, "last_played": 1686437517}, "language": "english", "review": "A quite charming point and click adventure with beautiful animations.

Piles of puzzles, some quite intricate, are linked into splendidly tangled webs. As a fan of point-and-click adventures, I found the production polish and the flashes of brilliance so compelling that I played through the whole thing.\n\nThat said, I can't recommend it. It's too lacking in taste, in every sense of the word. \n\nThe characters and storyline, the comedy, the dialogue, the puzzle cluing, even the music and the artwork \u2014 everything is always slightly misjudged (or worse), and it all adds up to be much less charming and engaging than it thinks. I felt mildly annoyed the whole time, and kept wondering \"Is it me?\" \"Is it because it's German?\" \"Is it because the translation isn't quite right?\" I'm still not sure, but I'm inclined to just blame the creators. The lead designer inserts himself onscreen at every chapter break, as a \"funny\" balladeer who belts out ridiculously-wordy-but-that's-the-joke lyrics about the action, in clumsy convoluted English that apparently felt playful to a German but is just exasperating for a native speaker. This is emblematic of the whole [i]Deponia[/i] experience: bombastic self-indulgent insular dorkiness. If that's your speed you might love these games. It's not my speed.\n\nThis series has taken a lot of flak for having a despicable player character, and for invoking sexist and racist stereotypes in a queasy way, and for other offenses against decency. Well yes, and it can indeed be quite off-putting. But it's important to note that all these things were done deliberately, with would-be satirical intent. The protagonist's outrageous selfishness is obviously meant as a comment on the amorality of player behavior in most adventure games; calling the female object of desire \"Goal\" and giving her a programmable brain is obviously meant as a spoof of lazy sexist tropes. Etcetera. The trouble is that the tone isn't controlled confidently or purposefully enough. I've seen jokes about all these same tropes in other games where it was much clearer what was the butt of the joke and what wasn't. [i]Deponia[/i] is so sloppy and sophomoric that it seems to want the player to laugh at the ugliness [i]and[/i] with it, at the same time. I didn't laugh much at all.\n\nIt's a shame because there are some really good bits \u2014 some genuinely inspired puzzles and setpieces that were tantalizing enough to keep me playing, despite my irritation. But it's just too big a haystack to recommend the needles. There's a lot of game here! I took 25 hours to get through the whole trilogy, but I was impatiently speed-reading the dialogue and skipping the audio; it's easily 30+ hours if you play at the intended pace. \n\nDon't!", "timestamp_created": 1686015703, "timestamp_updated": 1686034565, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492613703012466431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139426629": {"recommendationid": "139426629", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968535336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1617818200}, "language": "english", "review": "The Doomsday game is not as good as the previous games and exists as a shot across the bow to say \"accept the story you get you can't change it\" when people didn't like the original ending.

But I will try to keep them as mitigated as possible. \n\nFirstly, I will state that this game has a beautiful mixture of wit, dark humor, actual regular humor, and even puns in the writing. There was hardly ever a moment where I did not laugh in an uproar of jubilation. Whether it be from the karmic moments of things biting various characters in the bum, or the various unhinged and inane methods of illogical problem solving that Rufus was written to have.\n\nSecond, I would like to state that the music for this game is superb, even the music used for bits that are meant to be comedic are so good that you likely still hum the tunes when you finish this game series. The writers clearly understood the notion of how music can both enhance and diminish the impact of a scene.\n\nThirdly, I would like to state that the actual story of the series is superb. While it can be a bit difficult to follow at times between the constant laughter you will be going through, it is hands down up there in my list of games with monumentally well done stories. The moments of romance, tragedy, and drama are all there. And they are done to such an extent that I would personally recommend this game to any person who enjoys a rich narrative with wonderful world building.\n\nThe art style of the game is also something that I have come to greatly adore. Every scene, panel, item, and character are superbly made. Each one has their own flair of design that makes them memorable. This is both in their design and their character personalities. It is a shame that games like this are far and few between that make me enjoy the traditional story telling elements in it.\n\nOh, and before I forget, there are some jokes that are indeed lost in translation from the German version. Which I only was able to understand due to my learning the language in college. But if you do understand German, do yourself a huge favor and play it with the German audio or subtitles enabled. Because they are absolutely hilarious.\n\nFinally, I would to say that the true canon ending shows the most development for the character, and though it makes me a bit sad that it is indeed the true ending, I am also happy at the same time in some manner. While I wish things were happily ever after, true stories, like in life, are seldom ever truly happy. There are middle grounds that are seen.\n\nIn summation, I would say that I would rate the game in the following categories.\n\nMusic: 9/10 There are times that the music, even though it is superb, can be a bit hit or miss. But that is not at the fault of the game, but the listener.\n\nArt style: 10/10 It is colorful when it needs to be, and dingy when it needs to be.\n\nStory: 9/10 While I would have preferred a happier ending, I find the only true fault to the story is that between the constant laughter of situations, or the occasional frustration over some of the puzzles, it is woinderful.\n\nGame play: 7/10 Despite being a point and click game, the playing is fun, engaging and entertaining. The only issues lie in the nature of point and click games themselves. You have to adapt yourself to the thinking of the creators at times for some of their strange problem solving methods. \n\nTotal: 8.75 I would highly suggest this game to any individual who enjoys humor, world building, and overall good fun.", "timestamp_created": 1674499545, "timestamp_updated": 1674499545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131297960": {"recommendationid": "131297960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180925399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1549038362}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good but at some points of the game it's so freaking tedious to find that 1 pixel you need to click to progress.

On one hand, I did finish the three parts I got, on the other, I do not want to buy the fourth. Point and click adventures are fun because you need to think outside the box, and it's very satisfying to succeed. That is something this trilogy did well.\n\nThe background art is gorgeous, and many of the characters are very expressive, despite limited animation frames. Most of the jokes are funny, and the soundtrack is well-made.\n\nThe things I didn't like are the sexism, racism, ableism, and transphobia that are all over the game. Details (and thus light spoilers) below, you have been warned.\n\nSexism: While the men tend to have normal proportions, the women are almost all overly sexualized. Funnily, none of the women have noses while all the men have different nose shapes - guess it is cuter that way? The main character himself is massively sexist, but I suppose that is intentional because we're not supposed to like him. I think. I hope. But the overall characterization and depiction of women is... exhausting.\n\nRacism: There is a guy playing a monkey. He is black. You are at one point supposed to find a replacement for him. Of course, you ask the only black woman around, who then plays the dancing monkey, half naked.\n\nAbleism: There is an (incredibly sexualized) mentally disabled woman who plays a rather important role. Her mental disability is (presumably) due to a brain implant failure. She is consistently played as a joke, with a speech disorder and movement difficulties. She *did* get to be the head of a crime organization, so I do wonder why the rest of the game treats her like this.\n\nTransphobia: There's a trans character who follows the \"burly man in a dress\" trope. She speaks in a high pitched voice, which always cracks halfway through the sentence into a deep bass. At one point, you steal her hormones to then turn some guy into a woman.\n\nYes, yes, haha, the main character is a terrible person, hence he does terrible things and all the issues above are intentional. You can interpret it like that, and enjoy the game. I just personally found it very uncomfortable *how much* the game likes to punch down. I'm mostly satisfied with how the story wrapped up, but the forced trail of destruction I as a player had to leave behind was not super fun.\n", "timestamp_created": 1673378213, "timestamp_updated": 1673378213, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475998848676681519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130249587": {"recommendationid": "130249587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198883286370", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1817, "last_played": 1672988425}, "language": "english", "review": "really good game", "timestamp_created": 1672988683, "timestamp_updated": 1672988683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130237484": {"recommendationid": "130237484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166911988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2114, "last_played": 1515344528}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the funniest game ever written [spoiler] and even though the game quality decreases as you progress in the series, knowing that this was Poki's intentional f*ck you statement to the insatiable fans makes it even funnier.

Deponia is a game that is very well liked, and I will say that aside from a couple of problems, the adventure game mechanics are solid in the whole series. It's clear from the level of detail and quality of animations that there is a lot of care poured into this journey, and I always feel a little bad when I leave a negative review for games like this. However, I really didn't like this game, and I want to share why. So here we go.\n\nLet's start with the mechanical problems I alluded to above. The setting of Deponia is one of its strengths, being original, well thought out and functional as a critique on society. However, having a setting full of garbage means that visual clutter is an issue and the common genre problem of moon logic (i.e. contrived puzzle solutions) becomes that much worse. The solutions are in fact zany enough that it's close to impossible to figure out what to find and how to use it on your own, especially at the start of the game. A highlight button and hint system are present and does some to alleviate the situation, but it leads to a reliance on these systems that is still to the game's detriment. So, when interacting with the world becomes scaled down to pressing the highlight button and using the hint system to understand what to do (if that even helps), why have such a detailed world in the first place? Isn't the point to have players be rewarded for exploring and thinking about the world, instead of forcing them to only highlight the useful stuff?\n\nThe second problem I have is with animations. There are puzzles in this game that require you to watch long animation sequences over, and over, and over again. You can skip them, but as clues to the solution are often given in those cut scenes, you're heavily disincentivised from doing so. Compare it to something like Monkey Island, where cut scenes are given as a reward instead. In Monkey Island, that leads to memorable scenes like the manor fight-behind-the-wall that sticks with you as a unique experience; in Deponia, the same type of sequence quickly gets old because you've seen it five times over and have had to wait for it to play out every time in order to get to the part where the clue is given. To add to that, the animations can be oddly mistimed and badly paced, with several seconds passing by as a small animation plays out way slower than it should. The game simply drags, which peeled away at my motivation to play the game until only stubbornness remained.\n\nThese problems are minor, even if they are impactful, but they're not the reason why I'm giving a negative review. No, what left me thoroughly soured on the whole experience is the story and the humour of the game. Deponia sports an intentionally unlikable protagonist, Rufus, and I can understand why. It's supposed to be a parody on point-and-click games, who often have leading characters that are disruptive to society because things need to be forced to happen. So here we have a lead who pushes this to the extreme and is severely disliked for it. Cool.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why the game has to be so unpleasant to play as a result. I think that Rufus' solutions to problems are supposed to be callous by design, since he's a narcissist and all. The problem is that you, as a player, are forced to do things that aren't just callous, but cruel. All the while, it's played as if it's a joke, something that is supposed to be funny. You feed your friends urinal cakes, you blow up their homes, you cause accidents that leads to them being hurt, sometimes Rufus actively chooses to hurt them. People die in this game as a direct result of your actions, people that you've talked to and gotten to know, and it's played out as a punchline. And somehow we're still supposed to root for Rufus, because even through all the lampshading about his behaviour the game throws at you, it still defends him. He's still the hero, he's still the one who strives to save the world and who supposedly cares about the people around him. And at the end, when Rufus is supposed to prove himself to be reformed, I simply felt resentment.\n\nFurthermore, I have to question what the developers felt they could get away with because of Rufus' bad character, and what they consider funny. The jokes in Deponia seems to largely be about Rufus being the worst human possible, but the punchline is often the people who get hurt, not Rufus himself. Haha, look at that loud-singing gondolier being eaten alive by crabs, isn't it funny? Haha, Rufus killed and tortured a parrot through his incompetence, isn't that hilarious? Haha, Rufus sold the only black character as a slave, isn't it...? The rampant sexism (complete with breast jiggle animations!), the low-key racism, the disregard for people's worth (especially when they're poor), the implication that Rufus' friends just need to get over their dislike of his behaviour and accept him for who he is... Now consider this coming up in a meeting, where someone seriously said \"Let's animate one of the women being caught in the shower, that'll be good\". It's extremely sleazy and I can't help but wonder if Rufus being an unlikable character is just an excuse.\n\nI really didn't like this game. It was a chore to play through, it was uncomfortable to take part in and I wish I hadn't picked it up in the first place. While I can recognize some of the craft, the art and the effort going into Deponia, I can't recommend it. There are other adventure games that are far better, in my opinion.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, they don't mesh well with my tastes, but I still sometimes seek them because of the promise of a good story. The best of them tend to have one which makes up for what I find to be tedious gameplay overall. Of the ones I have finished, I thought these were worth my time to varying degrees:\n\nThe Blackwell series\nThe Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav (and Memoria)\nThe Dream Machine\nThe Edna & Harvey series\nFarenheit: Indigo Prophecy\nGrim Fandango\nHector: Badge of Carnage\nJolly Rover\nLandlord of the Woods\nLeisure Suit Larry 6 - Shape Up Or Slip Out\nLife is Strange\nLost Horizon\nLydia\nMacGuffin's Curse\nMidnight Scenes: The Nanny\nTo the Moon\nNight In The Woods\nThe Shivah\n\nOf the [b]Daedalic Entertainment[/b] games I have played (including the [i]Edna & Harvey[/i] series, [i]The Whispered World[/i] and [i]A New Beginning[/i]), I found the Deponia trilogy to be the least enjoyable. \n\nAs with previous Daedalic titles, the backgrounds are aesthetically pleasing (if a little too busy in some areas) and the music is mostly excellent. Some tracks evoke a sense of 'grand adventure', which I felt at times might have been a better fit for a different game altogether. It's too bad that playing through this trilogy felt more like a tired exercise than anything else.\n\nI think that it's pretty normal to expect point-and-click adventure games to involve puzzles which are not straightforward and require one to think like the designers did ('moon logic'). In the case of Deponia, this is really all that I had left to amuse myself with, as I didn't find the story interesting. It's also worth mentioning that there are some bugs which require using a downloaded save from Daedalic's website in case you are unable to progress past certain puzzles.\n\nThe main character, Rufus is selfish and mostly oblivious to the needs of others. There isn't really anything more to him, but I somehow expected this. The problem is that the other characters in this game aren't very interesting either. For example, the other major character, Goal (interesting choice of name by the way), is out of action for almost two thirds of the series for various reasons despite being on-screen and physically present in some form or another. \n\nThe other characters who accompany Rufus don't seem to serve much purpose other than to act as a foil. They were present for much of the trilogy. Despite some moments in the third game, I found them to be under-developed overall.\n\nI think that this might just be the way it is with most comedic adventure games. However, the problem here is that I didn't find the trilogy to be all that funny. For what it's worth, German voice acting and English text was enabled because I thought the voice actor for Rufus was better suited to the character. There's no doubt that some puns and such may have been lost in translation, but I think most of the humour is still easily understood because much of it involves moments of schadenfreude. \n\nSome jokes are at Rufus' expense, but I found there to be an inordinate number of situations where the developers seemed to have gone to great lengths to set me up for a laugh at someone who didn't really deserve their misery or misfortune. There seems to be thread running throughout the series: we the audience are meant to find humour in how clueless Rufus is about the consequences of his actions on others. \n\nGiven the contrivances in the setup of many puzzles, it is too much of a stretch for me to find Rufus' obliviousness plausible. Perhaps it might have worked if he had a severe mental disability, and I do mean the drooling, pants-on-head, talking-like-a-Monty-Python-Gumby variety. That would probably necessitate a total rewrite of just about everything though. Suffice it to say, humour involving uncertainty about the protagonist's awareness of what is actually going on around them was better handled in a previous Daedalic title. I think it worked better in [i]Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes[/i], due to a combination Lilli's apparent childish innocence and the narrator.\n\nDespite all of this, I forged on anyway. As I had little emotional investment in all of the characters, the ending was not very satisfying, and leaves me doubtful as to whether the fourth entry, [i]Deponia Doomsday[/i], will redeem it in my eyes (I hear it's a safe to skip that one). There seems to be a bit of a trend at [b]Daedalic Entertainment[/b]. Either it looks as though the writer wrote themselves into a corner, it ends up all being just a dream or a major character gets shafted big-time. More often than not, I don't think they manage to stick the landing in their games.\n\nThis one's probably for the hardcore point-and-click people who really like running around exhausting dialogue options and rubbing objects together.

However after encountering a game-breaking bug after seven hours of play and the only solution is to restart. I feel I have strong enough opinions to review this product. While there are three games here, they are all part of one larger story. With only getting through almost all of the first game before encountering the game-breaking bug my words are only about the first third of the product.\n\nIn addition to the mentioned game-breaking bug (for those of you who know it is a minebike puzzle where the levers don't work and entering the mine has the minebike disappear and the game will not respond to any further keyboard or mouse input), the game also has several technical issues that show a lack of polish. Clicking on objects in your inventory sometimes doesn't select them. There are typos and words that are untranslated from German. There is also one character's voice audio that is mixed terribly. It sounds like their microphone as they were shouting their hammy villain lines.\n\nEnough of the technical stuff, what kind of game is Deponia anyway? Deponia is a point and click adventure game that asks the question \"What if Monkey Island was bad?\" (Yes Monkey Island fans, I know that franchise has its black sheep but I'm speaking generally.) It's quite clear that the developers are fans of those old point and click games but fans of the genre in such a way that they uncritically copy and paste mechanics that should have stayed in the past. For example, elaborate inventory puzzles. You are given a 5x5 grid of an inventory and you are gonna be expected to make use of a lot of that space. Collect every bit of garbage you see and then spend plenty of time trying to combine two items that should go together until you realize you need a third thing in the overworld to do so. While game doesn't have the worst moon logic, there are bouts where you will be hauling around about a dozen objects trying to use each one an every other item in your inventory and every bit of the environment to drive progress forward. On the difficulty of how to do things, there's a certain point where I gave up trying to solve some of these puzzles and relied on a guide to get through some of the weirder or more finicky parts of puzzle design. There's a lot of back-and-forth between rooms and screens that feels like it was bordering on padding. A lot of the minigames also have balancing issues of either being too simple or too complex.\n\nAs for the story and characters, I feel this is where Deponia has a mixed bag. The main character, Rufus, clearly is inspired by Guybrush Threepwood from Monkey Island by being self-absorbed and being in way over his head. This is fine for the most part but becomes a problem once the main love introduced. There are some interesting character designs such as Gizmo that stand out for being creative. The planet of Deponia being comprised of trash and the city of Kuvaq are interesting settings that. Aside from a few good character designs and an interesting setting, the story and remaining characters are not very enjoyable. This might be because I'm less than one-third through the complete package so I will be a bit lighter in my criticism where appropriate regarding the plot. There is a floating ship/city thing that Rufus wants to escape to and when he finishes the prologue by making an attempt he overhears a conversation between a woman and an obviously evil authority figure. The woman plummets planetside and he chooses to save her. Pretty generic player character rescues princess plot.\n\nFrom what I know of Monkey Island there's a similarity between Elaine and Deponia's love interest in that they're both conveniently written out of the plot for most of the game and don't have to interact with the protagonist. This game does it by way of an electronic Sleeping Beauty which means Rufus is tasked with lugging a barely alive body around for a good chunk of the game. I've been referring to this character not by name and that's because the devs didn't bother giving her one. Waking her up is Rufus' goal so she is literally named Goal.\n\nTalking about Goal brings us to the issue of female representation in this game. From what I remember of my playtime there are three female characters with speaking roles and only one is any kind of decent. The first is Rufus' ex-girlfriend who he mooches off of by living in her house, eating her food, not doing any chores, and constantly annoying. She's the best of the female characters for actually having a decent bit of dialogue and out of my sympathy for her having to deal with the protagonist's antics despite breaking up. The second female character is Goal, a character so generically the damsel in distress that a plot point is that when she falls down into Kuvaq a line forms of horny desperate men who can claim her and take care of her while she is unconscious. This is in spite of the town having a doctor and at least one hospital bed. Rufus is the worst of these because he believes that because he saw her first he is entitled to be the romantic interest of some woman he has just met. It is very possessive and creepy behavior from not just our protagonist but most of the men in the town. Our third female character is the mayor's receptionist. This character has two \"gags.\" The first one is being the bureaucratic obstacle that Rufus has to overcome to advance the plot. The second \"gag\" is being trans and having the voice actor swap between speaking in falsetto and gruff shouting. It fills her lines with false starts and repetitions which means being told to wait in line takes about twice as long. It was not funny back in 2012 when the original released and has only gotten worse with time.\n\nTo summarize, while Deponia has a couple of interesting ideas, those are buried under incompetence in game design, story and character writing, translation, sound design, user interface, and coding. There are far better point and click games around and this one can be forgotten.", "timestamp_created": 1660249949, "timestamp_updated": 1660249949, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504731416702270508", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120364769": {"recommendationid": "120364769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188692051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4982, "last_played": 1660090955}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a feature-length game with a simple gameplay style, a nice story, and enjoyable to play.

The games are honestly not bad, but I can only recommend them to people who are already fans of this niche genre. Anyone else will simply be frustrated and bored by this series. The \"humor\" is often purposefully repulsive. I had to force myself to finish the games and then made the mistake of getting all the achievements. To put it bluntly, the achievements will make you hate the game if you didn't already.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] The Story [/h1]\n\nThe story is quite honestly mediocre. The main character, Rufus, is intentionally written as an insufferable, misogynist prick. The game makes a feeble attempt to play this off as part of Rufus' charm, but he really is just a sexist jerk that thinks the world revolves around him. He gets slightly better and his personality is somewhat explained in Deponia 3, but it doesn't change the fact that you have to endure his presence for the whole series.\n\nWith the exception of the ending, Deponia 1 is a complete slog to play through. I almost quit the game because of the glacial story progression and having to listen to Rufus in Deponia 1. In retrospect, I definitely should have. The story in Deponia 2 is an improvement which makes it tolerable to play despite Rufus still existing. The story in Deponia 3 is easily the best of the 3, but once again, Rufus is still Rufus (albeit slightly improved).\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is very much in line with other games of this genre. You point and click to move around, pick up items, and talk to people. There is a basic inventory where you can select items to use or combine. Numerous minigames are spread throughout the story progression and usually take the form of some kind of puzzle. The minigames are skippable, but most of them aren't too difficult. A very simple hint system gives you pointers on what to do next.\n\nThe main problem with the gameplay is that it often turns into trial and error. Progression is needlessly convoluted to make you \"think\". Even when I knew exactly what I was supposed to accomplish, I still found myself spamming every single item on every interactable object to find the right combination. There were many instances where the correct combination didn't make sense to me even after it worked. If I wanted to \"think\" and solve actual puzzles, I would just play SpaceChem (one of my all time favorite puzzle games).\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] The Achievements [/h1]\n\n[b] Please, for the love of god, IGNORE THE ACHIEVEMENTS [/b]. They do not add value to the game, you will not enjoy unlocking them, and any enjoyment you might have will be ruined by them. During Deponia 2, I noticed that I was naturally unlocking a lot of the achievements, and I decided to try to get 100% achievement completion (a huge mistake). I finished the game with around 85 of the 105 achievements, so I looked up guides to get the last 20 (an even worse mistake). What followed was a soul crushing, massive waste of time.\n\nAchievements in this game usually boil down to doing X thing Y times, finding an easter egg, doing something in a certain order, or simply progressing the story. These are the easy achievements that you will find naturally. [b] The difficult achievements will require you to strictly follow a walkthrough guide. [/b] They are not fun or satisfying to complete. An even smaller subset of these achievements will unlock bonus content, but they are not worth the time and effort. [b] It is possible to mess up and have to replay multiple chapters to try again. [/b] Seriously, just look up the content online and save yourself the trouble.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\n\u2022 Only play this game if you already enjoy old-school point and click games.\n\u2022 Yes, Rufus sucks. He only gets marginally better.\n\u2022 Sexism, transphobia, and racism are part of the \"humor\".\n\u2022 Ignore all the achievements. Attempting to get them all will ruin the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1658097636, "timestamp_updated": 1658098578, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499038726091384888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118825748": {"recommendationid": "118825748", "author": {"steamid": "76561199003317725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 970, "last_played": 1581131160}, "language": "english", "review": "\udb40\udc21\udb40\udc21", "timestamp_created": 1657842285, "timestamp_updated": 1657842285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118813354": {"recommendationid": "118813354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416345792", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1669153534}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game.", "timestamp_created": 1657824138, "timestamp_updated": 1657824138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118731699": {"recommendationid": "118731699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041004533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1688703411}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best point and click adventures I ever played.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The story on part 1 was somewhat good, part 2 was not too bad, but part 3 was just terrible. The idea of using [/spoiler] 3 Rufus to achieve 3 different goals was a new way to solve the puzzles [/spoiler], however the humor was much more dark and felt out of place, also you find much more bugs related to animation and sound, like they just want to finish the game as fast as possible.\n\nI cannot recommend this game because:\n1 - There is no plausible explanation why the protagonist is in love. Unless you count \"she is hot\" as an argument. \n2 - Rufus, the protagonist, is just terrible. Not relatable at all. At the beginning I though the story would lead us to know more about him and understand his behavior, but the little explanation on part 3 is neither here or there and leave a lot of plot holes.\n3 - The game throws some sexist jokes in part 1 and 2, but on part 3 we have a hint of pedophile, joke with suicide and when Rufus sells the only black woman in the game into slavery and then makes her dress and dance as a monkey, that was it for me. I followed a guide to get to the end as fast as I could as I wanted to review the full game (and was too late for a refund). \n\nI saw some comments from Poki on a forum about that 6 years ago, but for me what they tried to show in this scene is not clear and is on bad task.

Each time you think you've seen the worst they can throw at you, the next game starts and they ramp it waaaay up. I don't mind adult cartoons (Family Guy, Southpark, etc) that lean into this, but this was somehow juuuuust close enough to feeling like a story of redemption that I kept expecting that aspect to fade. It's also worse when, as the player, you are crossing all of these lines as much as the character you control is.\n\nI get that's the point, but that sort of discomfort isn't my thing and wouldn't appeal to most of the people I know.

I will say that the art is impressive and I acknowledge the hard work that must have gone into it.\n\nDaedalic Entertainment has made other games that I absolutely loved like Pillars of the Earth, so it's not that the developer is bad. It's just that the reason I mention Pillars of the Earth is that even though that game is also point-and-click, the things you do \"make sense.\" You use things in a logical way and do things in a logical way.\n\nIn Deponia, you basically pick up objects that do not make sense or are not even real things. Then you interact with the world in ways that are illogical and zany. So you might have to take something random in your inventory and click on something that would never seem to be related to progress in the story. The whole thing can be frustrating.\n\nAs well, I'm not a fan of voices, the silly dialogue and the protagonist in particular is fairly annoying. Perhaps this game is intended for children? But the puzzles are difficult, so perhaps not.\n\nI suppose my advice is this: If you like really zany, whacky and nonsense humour then this game might be for you.

Also, you basically sell her to the organ grinder, who acts like a pimp giving \"debts\" that the \"monkey\" needs to pay.\n- In the same place, you tell children to go with a pedophile inside a van, and, when they dont go, the objective is to make an imprint of his genitals, to show to the children, like a rorschach test.

If that's not for you then you probably won't enjoy it. That said they're not usually my cup of tea and I still appreciated it. This game series is very clearly lovingly crafted and well-rounded. It feels like a real passion project rather than just a generic game dumped out to pass the time. The puzzles are for the most part solid and fairly intuitive, even if you sometimes need a little reminding of why you're doing what you're doing.\n\nBut the main factor of whether you'll enjoy this game is the comedy, and the main character. Rufus is an egomaniacal asshole who destroys everything he touches. The game doesn't make excuses for that, but it does try to walk the line between that an a lovable rogue. Some people will not be able to reconcile the two in their minds. If not for the fact that I personally am so extraordinarily humble I might have been at risk of relating to the character. That said he is a character who creates the games' conflict all around himself and I can see why that would be frustrating for some people. The comedy itself was a mixed bag for me, with about one joke in three hitting, but when they hit they hit. \n\nThe story is pretty good and keeps you interested, even if there are a few sections which are just storyless busywork. That said, I'm going to make a few comments about the entire story from beginning to end so if you want to avoid that then don't click that spoiler. [spoiler]The ending sucks. There is no way around it. You can see what they were trying to do (particularly as they have a character appear to spell it out for the dumber members of the audience) but it just doesn't work with the plot, characters, and tone of this game. And just telling us that you're taking the artsy approach of giving Rufus a gallon of character development at the last possible moment doesn't make it a good decision. After a good few hours of enjoying the story and getting into the comedy, the ending of the third game was so poorly designed and executed that it's left a bad taste in my mouth.

But I enjoyed them because 'twas all in good fun, and my sense of humor is more than a little warped.\nIn the third episode, he's just a flat out monster of the worst type; one 'puzzle' in particular just destroyed the entire experience for me.

That's the positive stuff.\n\nThe big, glaring issue I have with Deponia is that I played through the entire game searching for any character, at all, who has a normal, healthy, positive relationship with any woman whatsoever. Not one single character could be found who met that criteria. Whether they're controlling, dismissing, lewd, or severely sexist, the entire game has a frankly not okay attitude towards anyone female. Even the developer commentary (enabled by default) comments on this in a few places, so the studio must have noticed the issue and decided that it was okay somehow. I'm not really sure how they came to that conclusion, since no one gets their comeuppance for their behavior. No one changes their view, no one improves or develops a healthy relationship; it's not even a plot point.

This game has a lot to like despite it all, even if I still wish I never played it. Everything below this bold text is unchanged from my original review.[/b]\n\nIt's really hard for me to give a rating to this game. It's been three years since I played it, and it's still very hard.\n\n[b]Deponia: The Complete Journey[/b] is a collection of the three games [b]Deponia[/b], [b]Chaos on Deponia[/b], and [b]Goodbye Deponia[/b].\nIt is a point and click adventure starring Rufus, a guy trying to reach the flying utopia Elysium. Early on he meets Goal, a girl from Elysium whom he instantly falls in love with. The goal (haha) from there on is to reach Elysium with Goal, something that is usually hindered in some way.\n\nWhy is it hard to rate this game? Because there's a lot here to like. The setting, the characters (with one important exception, elaborated on below) and the journey are all really good. The puzzles are zany, not overly difficult (with one sole exception in the second game, lol), and do not involve moon logic. The art style is great and the music is servicable.\n\nWhy then did I, in the end, decide to give it a thumbs down?\n\nThere are 3 main reasons:\n\n[b]Reason 1: Rufus[/b]\n\nRufus is an unlikeable asshole that, while sometimes entertaining, is rude to everyone he meets and doesn't even think twice before sacrificing someone for his personal gain. He has his moments, but even then it's doing something right for the wrong reasons. The game and the characters in it do not excuse him in any way, with many characters, some initially and some later, expressing their hatred of Rufus and how he's made their lives miserable. The whole reason the plot in the second game happens is because of his inability to control his selfish urges. In other words, it's not enjoyable to play as this character. Many puzzles had me sighing while I realized that the game expected me to do something outright cruel in order to advance. I understand it's supposed to be funny, but to me it was anything but.\n\n[b]Reason 2: The ending[/b]\n\nIf you've played this game and you've read this far you might be wondering why I dislike the ending. It's really hard to talk about without spoiling a whole lot, but basically the ending might be satisfying for the characters (I'd still claim it's not), but not for the player.\nI realize this sounds interesting, but with all things combined: you're forced to play as this narcissistic douchebag, to reach an ending that disappoints you.\n\n[b]Reason 3: The creator's response to the fans regarding the ending[/b]\n\nThe creator knows about the split reaction to the ending and does not care. While integrity in creative works is good, this guy went out of his way to mock people who disliked the ending by creating the sequel Deponia Doomsday. Read my review of that if you want to know more.\n\nIn summary there's a lot to like, but when I think back on this game and the time I spent with it, my only wish is that I hadn't bothered.\n\nIn the end that's the worst feeling you can give someone.

The story of Deponia is clearly its strongest point, filled with a great sense of humor reminiscent of LucasArts golden era. Narrative cleverly breaks the fourth wall, with characters sometimes realizing they are part of a game and funny moments that might get you to chuckle. There are multiple twists along the journey and it\u2019s always hard to predict what is going to happen, also thanks to Rufus unpredictable actions. As a classic point-and-click graphic adventure, the game requires you to explore different areas, talk to characters and solve puzzles, combining items and figuring out how to complete certain actions. Puzzles are generally good, but rely too much on comedic ways of solving rather than rational thinking. There are some hints you can get by talking to certain characters, but it\u2019s disappointing solving puzzles only to realize the solution didn\u2019t make any sense. Mini-games, on the contrary, are entirely different, requiring some logic. Luckily, there is a skip option if you can\u2019t solve them and only want to progress with the story, so it's very accessible to those who are new to the genre.\n\nChaos on Deponia, which is my favorite, expands the gameplay by offering a sandbox environment and open narrative. There is a great sense of progression and it feels more like you are visiting a wonderful connected world rather than solving puzzles around smaller separate areas. Puzzles seem to be easier, relying more on logic than casually combining items in the inventory looking for unexpected solutions. There are still a few ones that can be tedious to deal with, but I appreciate the general improvements on the UI and hints given by other characters. Rufus himself has gone through a major change. He still retains his humoristic traits, but now his childish and selfish attitude have been replaced with more heroic and mature values. So, instead of simply being a more of the same, Chaos on Deponia fixes almost all its prequel problems, offering a more appealing and cohesive adventure. Characters show signs of growing and the comedic tones finally reveal some sparks of drama. Puzzles have been refined and now follow logic more than absurdity.\n\nThen Goodbye Deponia arrives and destroys everything. While the story is generally good (although maybe too dark), there are undoubtedly some huge mistakes in the writing department. Whereas in the prequel Rufus was finally getting a more defined characterization leaving behind his childish nature for a more mature behavior, here he actually degrades to a clown who constantly recycles his jokes. There were some really disgusting moments where Rufus humor went pretty much over the line, such as sending children towards a pedophile to pet his \u201chairy animal\u201d (which is exactly what you think) and selling a black woman into slavery calling her a monkey. I doubt anyone could laugh at these disturbing moments; on the contrary it\u2019s highly possible feeling offended. The other serious problem is that Goodbye Deponia ending leaves an unexpected sour taste. What should have been a rewarding conclusion to the \u201ccomplete journey\u201d is rather an unsatisfying epilogue that refuses to give any answer to the player. During the ending credits you will keep wondering what happened to all those characters you encountered and loved through all the three games, hoping for a secret ending scene that will never arrive. This is greatly disappointing and will probably upset many players who can only hope for Deponia Doomsday to deliver a proper ending.\n\nWhile not perfect, I still recommend this (in)complete journey. If you love graphic adventure games and steampunk enviroments, then Deponia will be a fascinating world to explore, but keep in mind that puzzles often don't follow any logic and the ending could easily be one of the worst you've ever seen in a video game.", "timestamp_created": 1635154781, "timestamp_updated": 1635154781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484741866588592529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101566598": {"recommendationid": "101566598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231791128", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1985, "last_played": 1637970672}, "language": "english", "review": "Sehr gutes Spiel f\u00fcr Leute die auf Madencocktails stehen.

The Complete Journey is a trilogy of the three main narrative entries, being Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, and Goodbye Deponia. \n\nDeponia is a fantastic entry to the series and is honestly one of its best ones, even despite its awfully short duration. As the initial platform in which we boost ourselves off into the stratosphere, it's undoubtedly one of the most sturdy in introducing us to the wacky and wild world that Rufus - our main hero - inhabits. Great puzzle design, great character introduction, albeit short, but a very sweet game.\n\nThen along comes Chaos on Deponia, and whilst arguably, maybe not the best entry to the trilogy, its easily the most broad and expansive. Though its first act very much overstays its welcome, it eventually opens itself up to smaller sections which hit user satisfaction in greater rapidity. Intertwined and laced amongst its more boisterous and bold moments are some of the more quiet and reflective ones, and its in this episode we strike the best balance, save for the repetitive scenery we grow all too accustomed to. \n\nAnd finally, Goodbye Deponia, the greatest of all three. A true return to form very reminiscent of the classic that began it all, with a great variety of stages with a huge variety of puzzles to wrack and wrap your mind around. We're exposed to a higher production quality along with some brand new toys and mechanics to play with. \n\nAs a trio, these games are honestly excellent. The art-style is truly iconic, its some of Daedelics best work as it blends simplistic character design with intrinsic and highly detailed environments. I could argue all of Daedelics styles are fantastic, but Deponia really sets itself from the rest in just how well it all interconnects and synergises. \n\nThe humour, although admittedly childish at times, has some absolute stand out moments, with most of them being prominent in the third game. Despite this, a good deal of humour is sewn into the dialogue and cleverly helps to reflect the deep and complex personalities that populate the junk-world that was our once beloved green Earth. It's never so in your face to truly drag you out of the experience, and in fact most of it blends seamlessly into the entertaining interactions between the characters.\n\nAs for said characters, they're some of the best work these games have on display. Every single dialogue interaction is absolutely worth listening to, as the ultimately jovial and comical nature of the game draws you in effortlessly.\n\nThe puzzles are superbly laid out, granted some are absolutely mind warping, to the nth degree, but when you realise that a great deal of the puzzles solutions are finely hinted at through its narration, the way you approach the riddle changes entirely. \n\nDeponia is a masterwork of all the facets of a great puzzle-adventure game with an enjoyable and entertaining narrative to boot. I honestly could not recommend it more. Even for all its faults, such as an overly frustrating inventory - which seems to need more mouse clicks than necessary - its a game that comes shining through. Easily one of the most memorable games I have played in recent memory, and if you are a fan of the point-and-click puzzle-adventure genre, this a game that absolutely deserves to grace your collection. \n\nHuzzah - good things come in threes!", "timestamp_created": 1633622090, "timestamp_updated": 1633622090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452654361724853516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100556985": {"recommendationid": "100556985", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962288833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1548528573}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Imprescindible en aventura gr\u00e1fica.", "timestamp_created": 1633440918, "timestamp_updated": 1633440918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100357272": {"recommendationid": "100357272", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067188412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1633166362}, "language": "english", "review": "I should have read the negative reviews first but there were so many positives I didn't think to.

I've never been a huge fan of Point & Clickers so this was a stab in the dark that didn't really pay off. A lot of you have enjoyed this game and from a viewers perspective so have I, which is why I'm rating this up! \nTotal Score = 72/100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDeponia: The Complete Journey consists of three chapters, Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia, sadly the last chapter, Deponia Doomsday, is not part of this bundle.\n\nThe game's story sees players taking on the role of Rufus, an inhabitant of the junk planet Deponia, as he attempts to seek a new life on the floating city known as Elysium. However, he soon becomes embroiled with the task of helping an Elysian return to their home and uncovers a plot that threatens his home planet.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 7 / 10\nWatching someone else play this made it more fun!\n\nRECOMMEDED SPECS:\nOS: Windows 10\nProcessor: 2.5 GHz Single Core Processor\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 compatible with 512 MB RAM \nStorage: 8 GB available space", "timestamp_created": 1632403338, "timestamp_updated": 1632403445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468245476484298706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99654558": {"recommendationid": "99654558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003068947", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2481, "last_played": 1632076968}, "language": "english", "review": "It has an occasional bug and a few nonsensical puzzle solutions that you'll probably have to look up.

Rufus is an asshole, like a massive asshole. While he often saves the day in the end, he always leaves a trail of destruction on the way. The humor of Deponia comes from Rufus, whether its him acting stupid, selfish or just down right horrible, that's where it comes from. If you can't deal with playing as a character like that, then you might not be able to finish the game, you might feel just that guilty. Trust me though, the jokes are incredibly funny and the overall plot is great with an amazing ending.\n\nIn terms of game play Rufus's character works amazingly, no longer will you ask why the fuck the main character is stealing and hurting people just for the sake of some absurd puzzle, because well... it's Rufus, he has 2 brain cells what did you expect.\n \nThe game can be quite hard, but luckily has a good checklist to keep track of goals, a hint system, and the ability to skip any minigame(though I suggest playing them yourself). If you are still stuck and are ready to look up a walkthrough try this instead: https://www.nicegamehints.com/guide/deponia/\nThis hint website provides hints to push you in the right direction and will even give you full answers if the hint isn't enough.\n\nHere are guides for the next 2 games: https://www.nicegamehints.com/guide/chaos-on-deponia/ https://www.nicegamehints.com/guide/goodbye-deponia/\n\nAll in all you should definitely get this game and its well worth its price as it includes the entire trilogy.

Soooooo, to put it plainly \"my opinion is mixed\".\n\n[u][b]Review Video:[/b][/u]\nIf you don't like reading, or are curious about watching gameplay check out my video here:\nhttps://youtu.be/PBEI_yYJdws\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b]\u00a0You play as \"Rufus\", and he'll never let you forget his name, between him singing his name, and every character exclaiming his name, I'm afraid I will be associating \"Rufus\" with \"Deplorable scumbag\" for years to come.\n\nBut right now you should be wondering \"Atratzu, why are you saying such mean things about this character? Surely he wasn't that bad...?\" YOU HAVE NO IDEA *Ahem*, excuse me, you have no idea how awful he is, to the point where I desperately was looking for redeemable qualities throughout the rest of the game.\n\nHe steals [i](well, that one is on me I guess, you need items for point-and-click-games, okay?)[/i], he lies, he cheats, he uses other people as a means to an end, deceives them,\u00a0 he's only looking to further his own goals... what are his goals? To get to Elysium. You see, Rufus is stuck on a planet called \"Deponia\", and he has dreams to reach the magical city in the sky... literally, actually.\n\nSeveral unfortunately accidents later, Rufus has made a mess of things and now needs to try to fix the situation. The best example of this is the simple task \"remove dust from memory card\", How would YOU remove dust? carefully wipe it down with soft cloth, use a safe spray? What are you stupid? No, clearly the first you need use a dirty towel to make it gross, then to spit on it, brush it with a metal brush to leave permanent scratches, and then plug it back in. Did you flinch? I flinched, And that's the whole game more or less... Rufus makes bad situations worse.\n\nSo here we are again... Rufus is an interesting character. But I HATE him. Does he have any redeemable qualities? At the end of the story he makes the right choice... But the end doesn't justify the means.\n\nLet's get really philosophical for a second, If you push someone in front of a car to save a family, you've still killed someone. Rufus is worse, he'd push someone in front of a train to pick up a quarter on the ground, then search for spare change in the pockets of the disemboweled legs, and proceed to buy something from the other half of the dying person with the money from his/her own legs.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503956399\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] A \"Point and Click\" game should be simple to explain from a mechanical standpoint... It's right there in the genre title... You play this game with a mouse, you point the cursor, and click.\n\nThere is an inventory, you mouse wheel down to access it. The first rule of point and click games is: \"Pick up all the things\", the next rule is \"Talk to and inspect all the things, all chat options\".\nFrom there you ****SHOULD***** Have alllllll you need to figure out the puzzles, and know which item goes where, and figure out what you need. [i](Pro tip: hold down space bar to see all intractable objects. I couldn't have made it without you space bar!)[/i]\nDeponia: The Complete Journey even does you one more, with a sketch outline from Rufus giving you hints and reminders what your goal is, and the step you're on for reaching that goal.\n\nBut, of course Point and Click Games eventually require you to do crazy stuff... for example to open a door you might need to use a waffle with a pigeon , to make a fat pigeon which you can use with a hairbrush to make a slip stream pigeon missile that you'll shoot out of a cannon at a switch on the other side of the world.\nHow would you know the pigeon was the key? Because some character commented \"Boy I sure\u00a0 do love pigeons and would hate to know my pigeon was shot into next Monday\"... Only think more cryptically then even that. \n\nFor a real example: [spoiler]One puzzle required me to turn the music off in the game settings... WHAT?! Who does that!? But it was clever. ...also I never would have finished the first third of the first game if I hadn't looked up a guide there!! [/spoiler]\n\nI would like to highlight a couple other things before wrapping up this review: The graphics were great. The world was interesting. I cared about the love interest. I liked the side characters and was happy every time one of them popped up again. The animation is very good. The music was good. The musical narration after each chapter was my favorite part \"Huzza lets come back for more!\", there were a few mini-game-puzzles I did actually enjoy, I even chuckled at some points and references in the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2492033263\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] The question I pose to myself is this: Did I like the game? \n...I can't just give a straight \"yes\" or \"no\", there are things I liked and things I disliked. Generally I think I'd lean in the positive direction. There was a lot of work put together to make this game, I picked up my copy for free somewhere, it also regularly goes on sale...\n\nIt took me a surprising amount of time to finish the game even with the help from guides, in each section I always tried to figure out what to do on my own first until I hit a dead end and looked it up. The first part took me 7 hours, The second part took me 10 hours, The third and final part took me 10 more hours. Ending with a grand total of 27 hours.\n\nI think the worst thing a game can be is \"forgettable\". I heard that point and click games are where the unique stories in video games are at. While my opinion on Deponia: The Complete Journey is certainly mixed, I can confidently say it was an experience I won't soon forget. Some people will like this game, others will hate it.

And it left enough of an impression for me to seek it out years later.\n\nAdded after initial review: It has a nasty habit of crashing upon saving your game. This doesn't hurt anything as it does auto save, but it is rather annoying.\n\nThis game is full of slapstick comedy, usually at Rufus's expense. A lot of the problems driving the story and puzzles are just problems that Rufus caused that we now have to deal with. This gets to the point where, and I believe there is a line similar to this in the developers commentary, you find yourself relating to all the cast who are just constantly tired of Rufus more than literally anyone else. \n\nA lot of the puzzles seem like huge stretches of logic, you'll probably need a guide to get through some of them. Or to find the collectibles, those are hard to spot sometimes with a guide. But the puzzles don't hinder the actually pretty decent story that is present! In regards to game play, it is a point and click adventure. Don't expect a lot of overly complex controls or anything like that. The developers do love their mini-games though, if you hate mini games \"interrupting\" the experience, this game won't be for you. Most of them are really quick and easy, others drag on longer than they need to. \n\nThat being said! the art, voice acting, cut scenes, and other stuff like that are all phenomenal! I can't say this game is one of the best games ever, but I can say if you're willing to be patient with some parts you'll get a very memorable and very good experience.

[/h1]\n\nDeponia is a point-and-click adventure game about the world's most unlikable protagonist, Rufus, and his quest to get the hell off his Godforsaken trash planet (No, really - the entire planet is more or less a giant landfill.) and reach the fabled land of Elysium. He's selfish, self-obsessed, and completely fails to develop as a person over THREE games, and yet somehow wasn't a completely unlikable character. His saving grace, I suppose, that he occasionally helps out other people - though never without promise of reward. \n\nBut I'll stop talking about Rufus now. God knows you'll hear him talk about himself more than enough over the course of the game. Let's talk about the game itself.\n\nThe gameplay in Deponia is, as far as I can tell, fairly standard for a game of this genre. I haven't played a ton of point-and-clicks, but you sure do point, and you sure do click. The various puzzles this game offers walk a thin line between absurdly clever and extremely frustrating, but there are a number of quality of life features (I.e Options to skip minigames or highlight interactable items in a room) that make the experience notably less anger-inducing. Aside from basic combining-object puzzles, there are various minigames as well, and they're at worst inoffensive, sometimes outright fun. \n\n[h1] ...is another man's treasure [The Good] [/h1]\n\nWhat really makes Deponia shine is its world and sense of humour. I just love the artstyle - reminds me of some old French comic I can't remember the name of, and the world being essentially a run-down landfill makes for some unique locations. Most of the main characters (and even some side-characters) are pretty memorable, and you can't help liking (or at least feeling sorry for) them for having to deal with Rufus and the frustrating, ridiculous (and often deadly) situations he gets them in all the time. As with any 30-hour adventure, not every joke is a knee-slapper, but my playthrough was filled with more laughs and chortles than groans and, uh, more offended groans. Also, each chapter starts with a funny little ditty about the events of the story so far, which helps reduce tension is some more frustrating sections.\n\n[h1][i] Sometimes it's just trash, though.[/i] [The bad] [/h1]\n\n...how many times have I said frustrating now? Probably not enough. If there's any reason that you'll drop this game, it's from frustration. I'm not saying you'll need to use a guide throughout the entire game, but sometimes the items you're expected to combine, or actions you're supposed to take are so ridiculous that entire scenario feels like some piece of absurdist comedy or abstract art that can only be comprehended if you throw your brain out the window. Furthermore, there are a few glitches, though fortunately most I have encountered in my own playthrough were harmless and often amusing. One of my friends did, however, lose his entire savefile through no fault of his own - thankfully, this particular issue seems pretty rare. \n\n[h1] I've run out of trash puns [Conclusion] [/h1]\n\nI'd say I'd recommend this collection - but then again, I bought it for 90% off during a summer sale a couple years back. Maybe don't wait for that big of a sale, but don't buy it at full price either.\n\n[b] 75%, B [/b]\n\nEdit:\n...Forgot about that dang racist monkey joke. Whoever put that in there, screw you. Nearly dropped the game after that, but came back out of desire to see the end of the story. There's dark humour and then there's stuff that wouldn't even have been acceptable half a century ago. I'm not going to change the score (because if I did, I'd give this game an F on that alone) but I am leaving this edit here as a disclaimer for anyone looking at this game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1625415571, "timestamp_updated": 1625415816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457101702690124512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94950091": {"recommendationid": "94950091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010223098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1624985556}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended.\n\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u280b\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2881\u2808\u28bb\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u2840\u282d\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2880\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u2836\u2819\u28ff\u285f\u2821\u28f4\u28ff\u28fd\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28df\u28ed\u28fe\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u28f4\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u2884\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u28e9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u284f\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f9\u284b\u2818\u2837\u28e6\u28c0\u28e0\u2876\u2801\u2808\u2801\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cd\u2803\u28f4\u28f6\u2854\u2812\u2804\u28e0\u2880\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2868\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2858\u283f\u28f7\u28ff\u283f\u281f\u2803\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u2847\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2881\u28f7\u28e0\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28c0\u28e0\u28fe\u285f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2809\u2819\u283b\n\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u286f\u2893\u28f4\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u285f\u28f7\u2804\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804", "timestamp_created": 1625310058, "timestamp_updated": 1625310058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94829233": {"recommendationid": "94829233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395521476", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1627, "last_played": 1694636383}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean.. it's a good game.

This is a perfect game, but in my opinion if there was a way to make multiple endings then that would make it all more desirable.\n\nI would like to thank Poki and the rest of the team for making such a great game, I will definitely be checking out Deponia: Doomsday after this.", "timestamp_created": 1623143212, "timestamp_updated": 1623143212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93378277": {"recommendationid": "93378277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059210437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2715, "last_played": 1623079346}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun point and click, some good jokes and clever interactions.

While I think it's worth full price, it's almost perpetually on sale for 90% off, so just wait a literal week if needed.\n\nI will warn you that the game has a few issues (see below) - most notably that the first game is buggy and especially non-intuitive. I almost refunded it at one point, but had exceeded the maximum playtime (because of a literal game-breaking bug). Be sure to stick it out, as things (mostly) improve after a while.\n\nAlso, the Store page saying there's 40 hours in the game is a lie. I got probably 30 out of it (which is a lot from a P&C game), not including paused time. I probably spent 5+ hours being stuck and too stubborn to look up a guide (three times, I think) for a hint on the next step.\n\nNote that this is NOT a children's game in terms of some crude humor, language, human and animal cruelty, and a few bits of softcore pornography (if you're into women with no noses anyway...though, you're not looking at the faces, are you?).\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n+Colorful and well-animated, including cutscenes.\n\n+Good music, and comes with soundtrack to the third game.\n\n+Voice acting is great and has no translation issues (I'm looking at you, A New Beginning).\n\n+Humorous, with plenty of genuine LOLs.\n\n+Fast travel, object highlights and puzzle skips.\n\n+You can't really die, and you can try all the dialog options in nearly every conversation. This allows you to explore all the voice acting and absurd possibilities available.\n\n[h1]YMMV[/h1]\n~Your character is a bit of a (loveable) jerk for most of the game. There's some development and explanation as the game progresses, though.\n\n~Contains mostly-slapstick cruelty to animals, women, children and well, everyone, really.\n\n~Main menu music sounds like it's for another game.\n\n~Missable achievements.\n\n~The ending isn't horrible as everyone says. But, to avoid spoilers, it leaves a lot to your imagination.\n\n~For as much fun as is poked at Daedelic's [i]A New Beginning[/i] game, it was generally good at providing intuitive item descriptions and puzzle solutions. Deponia much more frequently relies on the old \"try everything with everything\" routine that wasn't fun in the 80s and 90s and isn't fun now. I'm going to suggest keeping a guide handy for when you start getting frustrated. Besides the first game, you usually know what your goal is, but the path to getting there borders on moon logic on occasion. I skipped two puzzles out of pure spite of the trial and error involved.\n\n~The game often gives you a number of major objectives, letting you tackle them in somewhat open-ended order, but also leading to some more confusion in too many choices for the \"try everything on everything\" routine.\n\n~Occasional minor textual translation and spelling issues (voices are fine).\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n-The first game (from 2016!) is still buggy: sliding characters, broken music, getting stuck in inspect mode and the pigeon puzzle occasionally is 100% broken, requiring you to download a save file from Daedelic to continue. Further, it has obtuse and guesswork puzzles. This is a really bad start to the game and I think puts a lot of people off, unfortunately.\n\n-Tooltips in menus, puzzle hints and \"map/plan\" screen only occasionally fully work.\n\n-Majority of puzzles in the third game start suddenly and don't allow you to back out. If you need to take a break at that time, you're forced to to solve or skip the puzzle, or ALT+F4 and hope you saved recently.\n\n-You won't even know about, or find the optional bonus collectibles in the second and third game without a guide to get you started.\n", "timestamp_created": 1622936969, "timestamp_updated": 1622936969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93141659": {"recommendationid": "93141659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182771745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1622857952}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego", "timestamp_created": 1622772093, "timestamp_updated": 1622772093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93120675": {"recommendationid": "93120675", "author": {"steamid": "76561199011186906", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1845, "last_played": 1698760015}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome p&c game with fun story and great characters.. has a good amount of difficulty as well", "timestamp_created": 1622743285, "timestamp_updated": 1622743285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92945213": {"recommendationid": "92945213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047522072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1622559762}, "language": "english", "review": "Buggy", "timestamp_created": 1622481443, "timestamp_updated": 1622481443, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433070838451385498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92896351": {"recommendationid": "92896351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200397607", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1646, "last_played": 1624073890}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No jugu\u00e9 a Deponia en su tiempo, sin embargo me compre esta edici\u00f3n que trae la trilog\u00eda (Haciendo falta el cuarto) y la verdad es que me engancho bastante, pondr\u00eda est\u00e1 aventura gr\u00e1fica a la altura de Monkeys Island entre otros t\u00edtulos, si tienes la oportunidad comprarlo, vale totalmente la pena, conocer el universo de Deponia, sus personajes carism\u00e1ticos e historia vale totalmente la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1622410529, "timestamp_updated": 1622410529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92884586": {"recommendationid": "92884586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155068211", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1387, "last_played": 1586249866}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed accompanying Rufus on his adventure through Deponia.

You would would think after chasing a boy 10 years of age, they would learn from their mistakes by now, but nope. In black and white they did but then their memories got reset when they entered the kalos region... Sure there were a few laughs here and there I guess, but for the majority of the show (game in this case) it was meh...\n\nAnyways, back to the game, whoever did the subtitles need to go back and fix them up! I'm not even great at spelling or grammar but for some reason felt something when the subtitles were wrong... I notice in some commentary, there were spoken audio that werent subtitled correctly or at all... Same with the voice over of the characters ingame. They also half arsed the subtitles trying to type out what what the sounds would be like if converted into letters and other times just simply generalised it with a term in astericks. \n\nSome of the background music played back in low quality for some reason whilst others weren't noticeable.\n\nThe spoken audio are also inconsistent, for example when rufus should be impersonating someone else but is instead speaking in his normal voice tone with which the other guy, for some reason, hasn't spot the odd voice tone change... Another is when a guy is suppose to sound muffled but isn't. Or isnt suppose to sound muffled but is. Although I guess the devs have acknlowdge this part in one of the commentary, but I guess too lazy to go back and re-record and fix the issues up or whatever.\n\nAlso on spoken dialog, I notice there are no pauses when there should be or have minimal pauses for saving time, like those people who edit their videos on youtube to delete fluff and shave off as much wasted blabba as possible yet still include the important bits...\n\nI notice near the end of the third game of the series, that lip syncing was an issue....like the lips would suddenly stop moving yet spoken words were heard from that character....or lips wouldn't sync correctly at all to the spoken dialog....especially true for the poki's commentary for all three games....\n\nOh yeah, forgot to bag on the animation too...hehe... I have this nag for when rufus having the default animation of flashing his hand out for whatever he does. Press a button, flashes hand out. No unique button pushing animation. Grab something. Uses the same hand animation.....kinda annoys me when the animations dont fit what his doing.\n\nOther than all of that, it was an enjoyable ride. Also this isn't exactly the complete journey, there's a 4th installment that isnt included here....which, Im guessing since ive not yet played it as of this review(but will sometime after), would probably focus on rufus' again again presumeably surviving a fall from the exosphere or whatever that layer of atmosphere is before space. Or maybe focus on the kids.... I don't believe we got a conclusion as to what happened to them(maybe they got chowed down by that slime?) but I suppose why should we care about them since this game is meant to be focused on rufus?", "timestamp_created": 1620635282, "timestamp_updated": 1620637902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91665042": {"recommendationid": "91665042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258275004", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1630378851}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego mas hilarante de la galaxia .  \nUNA CAGADERA DE RISA", "timestamp_created": 1620501999, "timestamp_updated": 1620501999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91574762": {"recommendationid": "91574762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199365998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1621889199}, "language": "english", "review": "Very, very good!", "timestamp_created": 1620376270, "timestamp_updated": 1620376270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91541547": {"recommendationid": "91541547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139536316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1368, "last_played": 1628552053}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1620319739, "timestamp_updated": 1620319739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91473019": {"recommendationid": "91473019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312690478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 2464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 397, "last_played": 1673431364}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best adventure game series ever made.

That one of the main characters best qualities (because mostly he's a douchebag) is that he will continue to hope and try no matter how bad things look. AND THEN for 4 installments makes you trip at the finish line pointlessly. You NEVER get to see the \"bad guys\" defeated, you don't get the girl, and you die. \nI get it, maybe not all games need a \"happy ending\". But this series has like 1 plot device and they beat the player over the head with it relentlessly. The forth game Doomsday, which to be fair is not included in this bundle basically sells copies on the premise that MAYBE just MAYBE you can go back and fix everything and have a different ending. Unfortunately you can't, and it basically points back to the end of game 3 that many came in thinking could be fixed. This is the Dev version of giving your fan base the middle finger.\n\nONTO GAMEPLAY\nOldschool point and click puzzle solving. Some of it is pretty fun, other parts are infuriating. Hit a couple of bugs in the first game that after spending way too much time checked a walkthrough to find the game was broke/stuck at that point. Only fix was to download a savegame past where I was stuck. This is the game companies actual suggestion...\nSome of the puzzles are so off the wall I don't know how I could have figured them out. I followed another reviewers suggestion of using a walkthrough if stuck for more than 10 mins or so. Other times even if you know basically what to do but don't do it in the exact right order, you have to start all over which can take upwards of 5 mins of reset in the worst cases. Doesn't sound THAT bad but a couple of these I had to run 5-6 times before you get the kinks all out. \n\nAll things considered, doubt I will ever play again.

Going from location to location, you really do feel like you are going on an actual journey. When you extend that journey across three whole games, you get what feels like a saga, with a large cast of characters and really interesting plot developments. Combined with a load of creative puzzles and good writing, the Deponia series still stands as one of my favorite point-and-clicks to this day.

It's great to see a relatively modern (as in, within the past 10 years) adventure game carrying on the legacy of the genre.\n\nUnfortunately, it goes too far in some of those places. As many other people complain, the main character is often just annoying. You have to learn early on not to try to relate to him or be concerned for him, because he ruins everything for everyone around him. Rufus is like a force of nature, and you have to treat him that way. Don\u2019t pray that he \u201cdoes the right thing this time\u201d\u2014he\u2019s capricious and unpredictable. Just enjoy the spectacle from afar. Even then, though, he can be REALLY annoying.\n\nIn a similar vein, it\u2019s annoying how the plot can be artificially drawn out by Rufus\u2019s shenanigans. Especially in the third game, certain long puzzle segments only exist because of problems Rufus created himself. It messes with the flow of the game; you\u2019re interested in finding out where the story is going, but then you have to spend an hour on busywork to fix something that was working just fine until Rufus broke it.\n\nSome of the puzzle solutions are funny, but the sense of \u201coh come on what am I supposed to do\u201d can rob you of the enjoyment. I highly recommend using a guide when you get stuck for more than 10 minutes, unless you\u2019re really committed to having the classic adventure game experience. The story, characters, and the environments are good parts of the game that are still fully enjoyable without spending hours being stuck because you couldn\u2019t figure out you had to combine two silly items together. Considering this is three games in one, you\u2019ll likely appreciate the faster pace that a guide brings, so that you aren\u2019t spending 100 hours on this trilogy.\n\nStill, as long as you don't let the puzzles wear you out and upset you (by using a guide when you've tried everything you can think of), and you don't try to use Rufus as a self-insert character, the good outweighs the bad. The writing, while off in places (like anything regarding Goal's attitude toward Rufus), is fun and well-paced. The English voice acting is fantastic, which is surprising given that the developers are German, and the art style, animations, cutscenes, and locales are great. Make no mistake though\u2014while the story is fun, it's not necessarily [i]good[/i]. It's mostly intentionally silly, which makes some of the serious scenes fail to elicit any response from the reader; especially when Rufus ruins them.\n\nNote: if you run the game at a refresh rate above 60 Hz (like if you have a 144 Hz monitor), you\u2019ll have trouble clicking items in your inventory\u2014most of your clicks won\u2019t register, and you\u2019ll have to click 2+ times to select an item. You can fix this by setting your monitor\u2019s refresh rate to 60 Hz.

My dad, who loves point and clicks, is enjoying it as well. So people that are new to the genre can enjoy it as well as people who've loved it for a long time. \n\nLikes: It's very reminiscent of Lucas Arts, which is a very common thought! Think Guy Brush Threepwood, but living in trash--then you've got the main character here, Rufus! The same thing where people don't really like him, but he's set out to succeed. Rufus is likable and it's easy to route for him despite his antics, plus it's genuinely funny and the animated movie-like bits are enjoyable! It's similar enough to the Lucas Arts vibe that you'll spot it in seconds, but not so much so that it feels like a rip off.\n\nDislikes: I will say that some things I would have never figured out without a walkthrough, so if you like a challenge this is certainly for you. I do wish there was a better hint system, you have to pay very close attention to what the other characters say because sometimes that's your one and only hint and most of the time it's not clear or repeatable! For sure for out of the box thinkers, I can feel smart one second and like a total idiot the next while playing Deponia.", "timestamp_created": 1609307363, "timestamp_updated": 1609307363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83496868": {"recommendationid": "83496868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343702390", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1609162957}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game, but it's just such a disappointment. The art is great, and the voice acting is pretty good - but a point and click adventure game lives and dies on the quality of its puzzles, and this just falls so desperately short. Some other reviewers mentioned the lack of logic in the puzzles, but I never expected it to be anywhere near this bad. As it is, there's absolutely no way you can figure out what you need to do to solve the puzzles, and so this game very swiftly ends up in that awful adventure game loop where you either try using every possible combination of items without rhyme or reason (because if you try to apply reason to it, you'll inevitably miss the \"correct\" answer), or you have to resort to using a walkthrough.\n\nThis game was incredibly frustrating right from the start.

However, I'll start off with the positives:\n- The art is visually appealing and unique, it's not amazing but it's still fun\n- Maybe half of the voice acting is good?\n- Some of the music is fun\n\nOkay, now to the negatives:\n- The protagonist, Rufus, is one of the most annoying characters I've ever played in a video game. He is insufferable. Almost every comment he makes is either inane or him spelling out how awful a person he is. I went through the first game and it looked like he was finally growing as a character, but then he just reverted back to being insufferable. It's not just that he's a scumbag, it's how *proud* he is too. The worst part is that playing through the second game and dealing with every moronic and scumbag comment he spouts is that you KNOW in the third game that they'll suddenly do a 180 and make him a good person, and they absolutely do exactly that very thing. The developers will defend it to the death, and that's because they're bad at their job and too prideful to admit it. At least BioWare *somewhat* acknowledged their bad ending for ME3, these guys made a 4th game and then KEPT their crap ending.\n- Many of the puzzle solutions are unbelievably poor. I regularly had to go to a walkthrough to figure out how to actually get anywhere. Most of them don't have you smacking your head because you should've known, but shaking your head at how you were expected to pick that up.\n- The writing in the game isn't good. At all. The jokes aren't funny, the story isn't intriguing, the characters aren't interesting.

And I can consider myself lucky I resorted to walkthroughs when I felt stuck, which happened every five minutes. At one point, I though maybe it would reach redemption and finally be worth a thumb up, but no, it was really going downhill most of the time, while beginning at an already low point, and failed miserably in the end.\n\nI feel like the biggest flaw of this game is the comedy. As often in the genre, the humor is pretty bad and ruins many aspects of the game. The gameplay for a start. As the solution needs to be funny, it's often unexpected, too far stretched and illogical, making you try every possible interaction until you accidentally find the right one.\n\nIt ruined the characters. In order to be \"funny\", they must have a borderline personality, and even while having their moments, they are quite unlikable. In this game it's even worse than usual, their development going mostly downhill until the end. Well, they don't really change, but they have to stay funny, supposedly meaning they have to be more lunatic. The protagonist is a straight sociopath, harming everyone in his way, including children. Hilarious. The girl in the second role is the most likable character, well most of the times, but doesn't do much apart from having unexplainable change of heart. The antagonists are straight forward and plain uninteresting.\n\nMany reviews praised the art content, but I don't get why. Yes, it's rather pleasant to the eyes, but there's nothing I could qualify as beautiful. The graphics are fine in-game, but when it comes to cinematics, it doesn't look as good and is rather badly animated. Musics are pretty standard I would say, it's okay, but rather repetitive as you spend lots of time on the same chapter. The songs are difficult to bear though, and while you can skip them, it also means skipping a bit of cinematics and leaving you feel like you missed something.\n\nWell, I already wrote too much for such a let down. Someone has got to renew the genre and offer a good gameplay, polish the story and the characters, and maybe no make it a nth comedy.

He has a plan to leave Deponia, heading for Elysium! That's because Deponia is made of literal junk, while Elysium is a mythical heaven! A long journey through Deponia awaits. Rufus meets many memorable characters along the way, visits many fantastical trashy places, and maybe evolves into a caring gentleman?? \n\n[h2]a trilogy is born [/h2]\nEarly in the development it became clear that this story is too big for one game, so it was decided to cut it into three games of average length. There are times where part of the games feel slightly stretched, but overall they did a very good job. There is almost no recycling of scenes (I can only think of small scenes at the transitions of the games). These are exactly the games [i] Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia. [/i] As a bonus, the lead developer recorded extended commentary of every scene in this game! \n\n[h2]oh Rufus... [/h2]\nRufus just isn't very likeable... At least, at start. This is a very specific type of comedy, in which you only identify with the protagonist with your very worst traits. This isn't everyone's jam. Nearly every negative review of this game has a problem with this aspect. One could simply state to 'plow through', but I think that it's better to acknowledge that we're all different. \n\n[h2]my [strike]junk[/strike] thoughts [/h2]\nThe drawings are beautiful. There is a lot of imagination in the art, sort of steampunky. It looks like chaotic junk, at the same time carefully orchestrated. The voice acting perhaps deserves even more praise! The music is okay, but at times a bit bad, so I turned it off. The opening song is really good, and it gives the game a fantastic start! Thankfully the song bridges every chapter, with appropriate lyrics. \n\nThe game is not easy, it requires some Point & Click smarts, and even then it's hard. Every game's story is about 15h long, so it totals around 45h. That's a huge amount for a P&C. This is probably not the best entry to this genre. That said, I do fully recommend playing this game.

My major complaints: obtuse puzzles,unresolved bugs and annoying and sh**ty minigames have more or less been dealt with. Puzzles are not as obtuse and imo have become less irritating while still not feeling too easy. Minigames are still annoying imo, but compared to the first part most of them are much better and unlike the first game I didn't skip most of them. While the number of minigames have increased, their quality has improved. Still I'd say they are weakest part of the game. Gameplay and puzzles honestly feel very smooth now, and I find nothing to complain about \n\nOverall I'd say the second part was the best. The Floating Black market is a prime example of  world-building done right, and how to create a sense of place. And of course Goal. Suffice to say they managed to 'develop' her character well.\n\n[spoiler] Split personality is quite a common trope,but I have to say they dealt with it quite well.Handling 3 versions of Goal was both entertaining and exhausting, and I think they managed to compensate for her being knocked out for most of the first part[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1602718976, "timestamp_updated": 1602719157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77555183": {"recommendationid": "77555183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175461795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2061, "last_played": 1637197582}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the puzzles kinda suck, but this is still one of the most fun point-click games I have played", "timestamp_created": 1602693737, "timestamp_updated": 1602693737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77467517": {"recommendationid": "77467517", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997943851", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1602535233}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a one of the greatest and fun quests that you ever seen.

It's beautifully drawn, the animation is great, I loved the voice acting and most of the puzzles were a lot of fun. I didn't encounter any major bugs AFAIK and from listening to the commentary (and I listened to ALL of it) it is obvious that it was a labor of love and it really shows throughout the game. Oh and the sound design and the music!! Both soundtrack and the sung parts, just incredible!\n\nThat being said, from an entirely subjective point of view, I can't say that I enjoyed the game all that much. Maybe I don't have the right sense of humour, but most of the jokes and even some puzzle solutions I found just downright nasty. I didn't like the protagonist and I know he was intentionally unlikable, but I was genuinely not rooting fo him at all. Goal's relationship to Rufus just made no sense to me. And the constant lamp-shading of things that were problematic or nonsensical from both the in-game dialogue and the commentary was just making it worse for me. I don't know, the whole thing just made me feel a little queazy. I must say that the ending was so twisty-turny and unpredictable, though, that it did win me over just a little bit.\n\nI do understand that those are very subjective things and that's why I will recommend the game.

However, at the same time it's really hard to recommend this game to everyone as it is definitely not made, nor marketed for every type of player. Here are a few pointers.\n\n[h1] The story [/h1]\n\n(For those who wish to skip any part of the game story (MINOR SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION), you can skip this section whatsoever). The trilogy of Deponia follows the story of Ruffus - a mad-type egoistic inventor who's main target is to get out of Deponia - a junkyard of a planet - and get to the Elysium - a spaceship that is set for utopia. Throughout the games, however, you find yourself not only trying to get onto Elysium, but you are also set with a new goal to save Deponia from destruction by joining and spreading the word of a rebellion, finding new love and even somewhat solving conflicts with your inner self. This game is really nothing to scoff about when talking about storytelling - it has a lot to offer and can pull you straight in. It's like reading an extraordinary post-apocalyptic/fantasy type of work (or watching one at that matter) - an intriguing and interesting beginning, amusing character conflicts and a culmination that lets the player's imagination decide what really happened at the end. If you're looking for a great story in a game, then this alone is a good argument to try the game out!\n\n[h1] The gameplay [/h1]\n\nAs mentioned before, this is a point and click type of game. And at first this might make the game sound boring. But on the contrary. While it's true that you'll be using your mouse alone for the entirety of the game, the puzzles and the sections of the game is where it really shines. \n\nTo get through the sections in the game, you will have to interact with various objects in the world, take them, combine them, generally speaking - use them to your advantage. The same goes with other characters (NPC's) of the game  - you have to either talk them into doing your bidding for your 'master' plan or trick them so that they would do something useful for you. At first, this all sounds quite understandable and easy, but some sections are either really long and confusing or really tricky to get a grasp of. Ruffus thinks differently than everyone else in Deponia (as he likes to call himself \u2013 being a total genius misunderstood by others). Thinking differently means that everyday tasks will have to be done in a completely different manner (one that a normal person would never think of), and the objects that usually have a use for a specific task will be used differently as well. And this is where the gameplay is vastly different from most point and click adventure type games - by using the same mechanics differently this game doesn't feel stale, the format doesn't seem overused and it actually makes you think. I love a really good puzzle, and i have to say that this game can be called a one huge puzzle that unravels beautifully as the story goes on.\n\nThe game also has some minigames - these are more focused to either get a specific object or to finish a specific task. Some of them are easy, some of them are quite hard, some - not as interesting. The good thing is that this concept is not overused by that much, which means that you don't get tired of it as easily.\n\nThe game also has a bunch of achievements. You may think 'big deal, most games do'. And you'd be right. But this game in particular has plenty of hidden achievements that are easy to miss. That either means that you have to check everything in this game, try out the most unusual combos, or just replay again the second time. In other words, this game has quite a bit to offer.\n\n[h1] The graphics [/h1]\n\nThe trilogy of Deponia looks, feels and plays out like a cartoon. You will find yourself surrounded by clustered, colourful towns, roads, alleyways, etc. The world is quite detailed, so much so that sometimes it is hard to find for what you're looking for (luckily, there's a tool that highlights with which objects and (or) NPC's you can interact). The game has a unique look - a one that you can memorize quite easily and tell apart from others. To put it simply - the world is vibrant and beautiful, gives inspiration to creating your own post-apocalyptic world.\n\nMy only concern sometimes (and this is nitpicking) is that the framerate of the animations (or perhaps - the animation itself) usually feels a bit choppy, stutter like. It's most likely a choice for design by the developers, but personally i'm used to a smoother animation experience. \n\n[h1] The sounds [/h1]\n\nThroughout the game you will hear various soundtracks, and most of them are unique to each area. Is that background music memorable? No, not really, but it does help to feel more immersed into the game.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed throughout the games were these short animated music clips where throughout a short song the narrator tells the story which you're currently exploring, followed by a chorus. The songs are wacky and sometimes do feel like they're improvised, but they're fun to listen to. Whenever you hear a \"Huzzah!\" at the end, you know that you're playing Deponia! \n\nAnd the Organon hymn that you can listen to fully in the last game (and is played as the main menu song in the first game) can really please your ears! \n\n[h1] Various bugs, glitches, etc. [/h1]\n\nNever encountered any of the sort. However, i have read in some guides and forums that some people do tend to lose their save files (or they get corrupted) if they save during a very specific event or while being in a specific location (sometimes - the combination of both). What i would suggest doing is just having a backup save in your extra save slot for 'just in case' situations.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nSo, back to the main question - is this game worth trying? Yes, absolutely! If you love adventure type point and click games with plenty of brain teasers, amazing storytelling and interesting dialogues, this game is definitely for you! The full trilogy can offer around 20+ hours of gameplay (depending on how easy you can catch onto the puzzles, if you use any sort of guides, etc.). On the other hand, if you enjoy a more action-packed and fast paced games, i would recommend skipping this title whatsoever as it is not what you're most likely looking for. This is a much more relaxing type of game that can pull you in for hours without the feel of being forced to rush.", "timestamp_created": 1597666671, "timestamp_updated": 1597666678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74452066": {"recommendationid": "74452066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120149638", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1418, "last_played": 1680579288}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes!", "timestamp_created": 1597663613, "timestamp_updated": 1597663613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491474419832229614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74361256": {"recommendationid": "74361256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869000180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1157, "last_played": 1637631014}, "language": "english", "review": "I could not understand this game Because it has a ridiculous and strange story.\nstory 0/10\nIn general, the story is about 5 people who travel with an old man, a young man, a teenager and a teenage girl, and ridiculous and tasteless things happen during the trip.\ud83d\ude11\nHis riddles are so ridiculous.\nThe game is not attractive at all and is not worth buying and it is very childish.\ud83d\ude11", "timestamp_created": 1597514833, "timestamp_updated": 1602092424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466205805540084839", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74295734": {"recommendationid": "74295734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019460163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1568126575}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like shitty puzzles with almost no logic behind them, annoying and two-dimensional characters and no originality, then get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1597415410, "timestamp_updated": 1597415410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420746535062789917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74287756": {"recommendationid": "74287756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042535807", "num_games_owned": 1034, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1597403396}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cool (series of) P&C games.

It's like they had to retcon the whole ending of the first part because they'd written themselves in a corner (in case they ended up making only one game).\n\nI also think it's impossible to solve the game without at several point trying every single item in your inventory with every other item and environment element, because some of the things you have to combine make no sense at all, and you could never logically conclude to combine.\n\nEDIT: One more thing: the achievements are pretty lame. A couple ask you to do a thing 10 times; things that give you the same dialog each time. So there's no reason you'd stumble upon this naturally unless you looked up how to achieve it (which admittedly a lot of games require you to do, but still). My reflex was to try other things 5-10 times just to see of something would happen, which was not fun, and I really shouldn't have done.", "timestamp_created": 1595176434, "timestamp_updated": 1595176857, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542913377285003662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72955361": {"recommendationid": "72955361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105178301", "num_games_owned": 786, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 2922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2896, "last_played": 1595173310}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a one of a kind experience.

As I was playing the game, I couldn't wait for the story to progress and see what will happen next. I will try to keep this review spoiler free.\n\n[b]About the game:[/b] Deponia is a 2D Point & Click adventure, that is delivered like an interactive cartoon. Puzzles range from basic, to an insane difficulty, but that's good. The game will force you to think a lot!\n\n[b]Story:[/b] Story is where this game shines. In short, it is a story of an antihero that has big dreams, and you need to help him to achieve them. The characters are really well designed and you will like most of them. Rufus, the main character, can be at first a bit annoying to an extent, but as the game progresses you will learn to like him.\nOne thing that I don't like about the story is the ending. I see that players are split into two groups, they either love the ending or hate it. I fall into later group, but I sort of understand what they wanted to achieve with it.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] The art style is beautiful! Everything in this game is all hand drawn scenery, and animations. I personally prefer 2D Point & Click adventures over 3D. 2D style will give a cartoon style, so it's more entertaining in my opinion.\n\n[b]Music:[/b] Soundtrack is also a masterpiece. Soundtrack is influenced with Hip-Hop beats, US country style music, etc. You will be presented with a Huzzah guy at every chapter of the game. I believe that all Huzzah songs are sung by one of the Daedalic members named Poki.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] This is a game that you absolutely must play, especially if you like story driven adventure games. Even if that's not your cup of tea, I highly recommend it. Game is a pure 10/10!\n\nNow I really have to praise Daedalic. Daedalic is such a talented game studio, currently my favorite game studio (or for last 8 years or so... \ud83e\udd23). I can't wait for more Point & Click games from Daedalic. They haven't released lately any, so I hope they didn't abandoned the genre.

Do not miss this master piece of Click & Point game.

If you expect something logical and serious, this is definitely not your thing. Some people found the protagonist extremely unpleasant and sexist. Which is only true the former part but not necessary the later. Cause he's an AH to everybody, no exception. [spoiler]Don't you worry, you can kill him as [b]MANY[/b] time as you like in the final part.[/spoiler]\n\n-Design-\nGame design again is brilliant. Interesting stages and scenes constructing a full face of Deponia. Lots of optional Dev's words enable you to understand the ideas and efforts behind every map. Low hardware requirement needed so you can enjoy the game smoothly with a basic laptop. Glitches rarely happen as long as you do not rely on quick save/continue. [b]DO[/b] construct a new save for the progress time to time though, for bringing you back to certain stages.\n\n-Game Play-\nProbably the best Point & Click game you can get. Paying attention to details and characters' dialogue give you enough hints to solve the puzzles most of the time. The small animations for actions/reactions are very detailed which brings the whole Deponia alive.

I wanted to like this game and  gave it a fair try with 10+ hours played.\n\n[+] Great graphics\n[+] Great (English) voice actors\n[+] Optional developer commentary\n\n[-] Sexist, racist and LGBTQ-phobic humour\n[-] Unlikable protagonist\n[-] Varying puzzle difficulty/logic\n\n[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]\nDeponia looks good and in the 11 hours I spent with it, it also played well. The difficulty for a point-and-click adventure is medium to advanced and I rarely got completely stuck. That being said, by the time I stopped playing, the riddles became more abstract and less enjoyable. The by far biggest problem in this game which eventually soured the entire experience and fun so much was not even the very unlikable character, but the strong sexist undertones in this game. I still kept playing, hoping that strong sarcasm or some other redeeming factor would eventually appear, putting everything into context, but it never happened. 11 hours in, the protagonist is just as unlikable as before and the game still gives me the impression that it was written in the 1950s. While playing, I wondered if it's just me who sees a problem here, but after doing some brief online research, it became very quickly clear that I'm by far not the only one who questions the writers' decisions.\n\nI grew up with the old classic Lucasfilm Games/LucasArts point-and-click adventure games and was more than happy to see that this game genre was coming back to life again with many new titles worth playing, like Primordia, Thimbleweed Park, The Cat Lady, Shardlight or Technobabylon, just to name a few. And no matter if we are talking about the very first games in this genre (Maniac Mansion is from 1987, Zak McKracken from 1988, Monkey Island from 1990 !) or more modern adventure games, none of them ever gave me the uncomfortable feeling that Deponia gave me.\n\nI'm familiar with anti-heroes in literature, movies or video games, and while Deponia's protagonist Rufus sometimes indeed makes a indeed a few (non-offensive) jokes that made me chuckle, his unlikable character traits always outweight these few positive moments. I enjoy dark humour and strong sarcasm (example: South Park), but the \"edgy\" jokes that Deponia apparently wants to make are just dull and lacking any sarcastic edge or criticising undertone, making it seem like the writers actually mean what they wrote and make fun of. This is often further enhanced by the protagonist's unlikable personality, which lacks any kind of self-aware sarcasm, making it seem that he actually believes in what he is saying and making fun of.\n\nMy initial impression and expectation with the game's sexist mentality and unlikable hero was that the hero's journey would be a story of character change or self-questioning. Likewise, I expected (or rather hoped) that the sexist undertones were handled in a much more sarcastic and self-aware way, highlighting that the damsel-in-distress formula has been outdated for a very long time -- and indeed, in all forms of media, this has been highlighted in clever and/or entertaining ways countless times. The main female character is not only called \"Goal\", she was during the 11 hours that played the game most of the time unconscious.\n\nI'm purposely not getting into in-depth details, as many others already wrote lengthy details about Deponia's problems, and I recommend reading them too before buying this game. The game has also rightfully been criticised for making jokes at the expense of the LGBTQ community or animal abuse. From what I have read, Deponia also adds racist jokes to its list later on.\n\nMaybe Deponia fixes the problems I mentioned down the road, yet it should not take me 11+ hours to get there. Also, based on the articles I read, the game apparently does not correct its tone and problems, but stays on its course and digs itself a deeper hole.\n\nWhile the hand-drawn graphics of Deponia will age very well, its writing and humour won't.\n\nThe team behind this game cleary put a lot of effort and time into the Deponia saga. The game indeed looks great and the English voice acting is also good. Sadly, the game's writing ruined the game for me.", "timestamp_created": 1591374201, "timestamp_updated": 1591451758, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393335223197937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70084912": {"recommendationid": "70084912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202580014", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1540, "last_played": 1550102451}, "language": "english", "review": "A seemingly well-made and well-drawn adventure turned out to be a disappointingly dull experience full of missed opportunities.\nA puzzle game with puzzles ranging from slightly amusing to unintuitive and outright nonsensical with solutions neither reasonable nor practical.\nA comedy attempting and failing to have the same offensive-edgy charm South Park has with jokes coming off as ugly and stupid instead.\nA protagonist, meant to be written as an anti-hero, at his best just being annoying and at his worst behaving like a psychopath thanks to the lack of any well-meaning and redemptive aspects of his personality.\nOn the plus side, apart from the game feeling like a waste of time, the outcome was quite satisfying: not only it was finally over, but in the end everyone got what they deserved.", "timestamp_created": 1590913770, "timestamp_updated": 1590913770, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472361832857131958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69965384": {"recommendationid": "69965384", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995466528", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1590701382}, "language": "english", "review": "Like some other people said it looks good, and starts very good, but as it moves along it becomes more and more of a chore because of weird puzzle logic, and unlikable protagonist.

I must say that at first glance you could think this could be a child game because of the graphics, but you will soon notice after playing for a bit that it is ment for older people and the difficulty compliments this very well. I do have a few points that could be better, the answeres to some puzzles and minigames were not really obvious enaugh, but that is due to the fact that the main character rufus has a weird and sick mind and it is sometimes hard to read and even think about that things he would do.

At first glance it all seem great, but you quickly realize during your adventure that the game is lacking something. It feels like a chore, not necessarly having much fun and that you're on auto pilot.\n\n[h1] So what do you actually do in Deponia: The Complete Journey?  [/h1]\n\nYou're controlling Rufus, the main protagonist, in his journey to leave Deponia, your home planet. He's a fella who's very high on himself and overall has a personality which can seem very exhausting. To achieve your objectives, Rufus usually causes distaster for others which somehow turns in his favour.\n\nIt doesn't take you long before you start despising Rufus which most likely was the goal for the devs. Good job, but it really takes away from the game when its this severe. I wasn't having fun, I was just really really annoyed throughout the playthrough.\n\nThe game devs really likes minigames so every possible minigame you could imagine will be present in Deponia. At first it's interesting, but it just gets so...overloaded with wierdness. There's not much effort nor creativity, just.. wierd.\n\n[h1] Pros & cons [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] Its a big game with alot of variety. Alot of discovery, alot of people to see and alot of challenges to be done. Sadly, theres not much entertainment value and instead alot of unecessary annoyance.\n\n    [*] The game is alot about getting connected with the characters you meet in your adventure. However, there's not much bonding if any at all. It feels very rushed.\n\n    [*] Solutions of some puzzles/ locations of items are very bizarre. It doesnt make sense untill after you've solved it. Theres this one scene I cannot get over where Sometimes you have to locate in a area you cant see. The item isn't visible AT ALL and you're expected to find it.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Conclusion. Should you buy Deponia: The Complete Journey? [/h1]\n\nIf you're a lover of point & clicks or are new to the genre and wish to explore;[b] Add it to your wishlist and waite for a sale [/b].In its current state It's just not something you play to have fun, but to kill time. There's just sadly too much different lacks for it to be a enjoyable experience.\n\nIm personaly going to finish the game because ive already gotten far, but if I knew this beforehand I would've passed it for another time.\n\nThanks for reading my review of Deponia: The Complete Journey.", "timestamp_created": 1590246874, "timestamp_updated": 1590247207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69663975": {"recommendationid": "69663975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031295960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1039, "last_played": 1668760889}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best point and click games out there.

It has easily blown all other adventure games out of the water with its beauty and wits. It calls itself \"a dramedy of error\" and I agree, it fits the narrative. The games raised my standards sky high, some of the point & clicks I used to review positively in the past got lucky that I haven't played this by then. But let's not drag it out and talk about Rufus. Admittedly, he is not a good man... which doesn't stop him from being a great character! He's a rare breed - a flawed protagonist, an anti-hero who combines certain traits of Ash Williams, Woody Woodpecker and Roger Wilco into one hell of a destructive, narcissistic, yet charming personality.\n\nMany people are unhappy with him, I think that a good portion of them hate him just because the games' NPCs do... don't be so gullible! And consider this: Deponia is a whole another world (you know, like Africa), growing up there wouldn't leave you with the same morals and attitude towards, say, death that you've got from floating through life in a bubble of our cultural civilization. Lay off, he's a crazy creature from a bizarre parallel universe, not your fucking desk neighbor. Besides, he's got some great qualities: carefree attitude, ingenuity and unwavering optimism, the things that perfectly replace mercy and common sense, at least in his world.\n\nI don't deny that Rufus is an extremely controversial individual who doesn't hesitate when it comes to 'accidentally' killing children or baby dolphins. But he likes cats and platypuses, and let's face it - he doesn't show any pity to himself either! Makes him consistent and cool enough in my eyes. He also caused a couple of other non-issues that people with obnoxiously colored hair deem sexist (a bunch of intentionally childish, in-character jokes that aren't glorifying anything) or whatever... okay, I have to admit that [spoiler]selling a black woman to a jewish looking character for her to serve as a grinder monkey[/spoiler] was kinda insensi... hey, look, a vampire platypus! You missed it. Now, where was I? Ah, I was just about to inconspicuously move on to the next subject.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nAll of this wouldn't be worth a dime if the story our protagonist resides in wasn't any good. To be honest, judging by the looks, I expected something bland and family-friendly but was very surprised to encounter a plot so captivating, thought-out, bold and action-packed that it kept me extremely intrigued all the way through. The writer(s) evidently took lessons from many sci-fi books, shows and Douglas Adams's creations in particular. The story features cleverly written, eccentric and memorable characters, cheeky humor, unpredictable twists and a good portion of slapstick comedy. The world-building is spot-on, the dialogues are witty and never too wordy, the voice-acting is as good as it gets. It felt like I was playing through a cartoon version of some best-selling comedic novel. I'm yet to see how it ends, have Doomsday ahead of me, but I'm already a fan of the dystopian setting. As a bonus, there's a strong, unobtrusive environmental message featured among other things. And if you don't like something, don't care or just want to speed things up - you can always skip ANY dialogue and ANY animation at ANY time by hitting escape. That's quality of life for you.\n\n[h3]Puzzles[/h3]\nBy the way, have you seen these games!? Of course, you did and I don't think that I need to tell you how gorgeous they look! And not only in static - the animation is also superb and got even better with each installation. So, let's skip drooling over the FANTASTIC graphics and jump straight to the puzzle design, which is even more astonishing, believe me. After the first game the developers greatly expanded the scale. The sequels take place in numerous locations at once, sometimes you even control more than one character. I usually don't like it, for it tends to make everything too convoluted, but Deponia is so smartly designed that I rarely felt lost. The games never get too overwhelming, they always give you only a moderate amount of hotspots and items that you need to deal with at once. \n\nBesides, Rufus draws schematics of his plans, so you always know your immediate goals and said schematics are also one of your hint sources, a part of the ingenious hint delivery system, which works, basically, through everything around you. Pay attention to the world, don't just click blindly through everything. In most cases, item descriptions and clues dropped by characters in dialogues are carefully set up as a joke where a puzzle's solution serves as a punchline. The puzzles use cartoon logic, yes, but it's good logic for clever puzzles supported by a clever hint system. And not a single game of fifteen so far! It means a lot to me. To top it all, there's plenty of unique reactions for optional item interactions that don't progress the game! You won't see traditional, generally accepted stuff like \"Nah\" or \"Nothing to see here\". Who does that!?\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nIt is always tempting to just cop out and make an adventure game easy. People, including myself, like to feel confident about their intellectual capabilities without a good cause and would give you gleeful reviews for free. Or you can make puzzles utterly obtuse and say \"it's oldschool, all point & clicks are like that\". But this series of games isn't easy or obtuse at all!  They managed to make it challenging and not rage-inducing at the same time. How? The only explanation I got is that these games are ingenious and people behind them are very handsome and probably smell good. The sheer effort on display here makes me shiver. No amount of love and passion could make me work as hard as these developers do, they are actually moving the genre forward. Deponia is so good it's almost obscene!\n\n\"But wait, Magerama, you old stud, you ended up sounding like a shill! Didn't you encounter at least a few flaws?\". Oh, yeah, this... I can pull a couple outta my ass if you want to... like, there was a bug, but I forgot what it was... and it turned out to be inconsequential... a couple of puzzles were not as good as other puzzles, I guess... have you noticed how different pieces of garbage fall down the screen when you roll out your inventory in the third game?

I had a lot of fun playing not well-known titles like the Reksio series. So when I had the chance to grab Deponia for free, I went for it. And what do I think of it?\n[b]Plot[/b]\nThe setting, as interesting as it is, for most of the game it's not important. The plot is mainly focused on the shenanigans of Rufus, our main character and protagonist of the series, and the people accompanying him on his journey to Goal's heart. The game is a comedy, so you can expect a lot of pop culture references and jokes, which are often amusing and well delivered. However, the humour is mostly absurd and in Monty Pythons style, so not all people will get it.\n\n[b]Sounds and Music[/b]\nThe soundtrack is mostly electronic and is quite diverse, mixing a lot of styles to fit the scenes in which it is present. Yet you can find two main themes in the soundtrack, which are metal clunking and hymnist-sounding trumpet. Apart from that, at beginning of each chapter, you get a variation of a Huzzah song from the beginning of the game, which is also quite nice.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nCartoonish and colourful, they fit perfectly the comedic tone of the game. Some of the characters may look alike, but it's not coincidental.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay is fun, yet hard. It's not due to the intelligence you have to possess to do the puzzles, it's due to their abstractness. To solve them you have to think in a way Rufus is thinking, which is chaotic and sometimes illogical. I often had to use guides to get past some of the presented puzzles.\n\nSo overall Deponia is a great comedy with some abstract puzzles and an interesting piece of media.", "timestamp_created": 1588074928, "timestamp_updated": 1657283403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68144382": {"recommendationid": "68144382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050521693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1588026797}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably an ok P&C, but the humor in it is more geared to someone much younger.", "timestamp_created": 1588027089, "timestamp_updated": 1588027089, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68130594": {"recommendationid": "68130594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370195595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2140, "last_played": 1656281284}, "language": "english", "review": "Deponia is a throwback to early sierra and lucas arts games.

[/h1]\n\nI'm not a fan of Point and Click games but this game has stuck with me long after I've finished it. Mind you this is NOT your typical \"hero is a lawful good character who sacrifices themselves for the good of others and end up dying in the end to save the universe\"... This is rather a \"play as a douchbag who runs around making his Girlfriend's life miserable, tortures animals and wrecks the shit out of his hometown to fuel his egotistic, maniacal desires\". The characters all have great voice acting that ranges from comedy-gold to serious; with the exception of the \"Organon\" which I though had no place within this game. Other than that, there isn't much to say about this game or than the game is nonsensical, comic, sarcastic and will take you for a fool. It's a point-and-click game with great puzzles, good storytelling and tons of references. Rufus also has some character development, but he's still a dick by the end of the trilogy, so not much to say about that either.\n\nIf you like this type of game you'll love Deponia, and the whole collection is practically free on sales (I got it for like a dollar). The complete edition gives you access to all three first games. This is a 8.1/10 game for lovers of Point-and-Click games, and maybe a lower score than that for me since I hate the genre. The only reason I got this is because it was awfully cheap on sale.

Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, and Goodbye Deponia. It's hard to describe the appeal of the Deponia series, but in effect, I'd say it's fans of point-and-click adventure game fans who adore the genre, don't think there are any major flaws with the usual formula, and have spent several decades wondering why, exactly, the genre lost its popularity in the mid-1990s.\n\nI'm being snarky. I apologize. What I mean to say is simply this: these are old-school point-and-click adventure games that embrace both the best and worst aspects of the genre. The story takes you from one imaginative locale to another, and drenches every NPC interaction with so much attempted humor that the narrative lacks any semblance of emotional depth or compelling stakes. It's like a saturday morning cartoon where every time you think you might be absorbed in the action, everything grinds to a halt as the mascot character turns to the camera, cracks a smile, and delivers a profoundly lame joke with incredible confidence. That's Deponia, in a nutshell.\n\nSo if you're a fan of the genre know what to expect: lots and lots of puzzles, backtracking, and snarky hit-or-miss humor. Personally I found much of the writing to be embarrassing to listen to--but it is fully voice acted, and the voice acting is pretty solid, which I suppose has to count in Deponia's favor. Many of the puzzles also seemed (surprisingly) intuitive, and while I can't exactly say I never had to consult a guide to progress, I didn't have to keep one constantly handy, which is a pleasant departure from the usual method of play for these games.\n\nAll-in-all this is a very tepid endorsement. The Deponia games are serviceable adventure games with very solid production values and puzzle design, but with very spotty writing.

With this light hearted epic, you can buzz in and out if you wish, but it's more rewarding if you stay in a while and advance the story.\nAnd I also appreciate the director's commentary. It's interesting to hear the little nuances that went on in the creative process and such.\nIt's rather Monkey Island -esque, but with enough individuality and originality to stand on its own feet.\nThis game was a gift from someone, and I'm glad they gave it to me :)", "timestamp_created": 1577324483, "timestamp_updated": 1577324483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566394925117492676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60412126": {"recommendationid": "60412126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211097128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1598197423}, "language": "english", "review": "Having only played the first part, I can confidently say this game is amazing", "timestamp_created": 1577132617, "timestamp_updated": 1577132617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60137856": {"recommendationid": "60137856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042789560", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 528, "last_played": 1650477748}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun point and click game.

The setting of the games is a world overflowing with pollution and garbage, which is fairly unique as far as video game settings go. But by no means does this make it a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Instead, the inhabitants of this world have grown accustomed to this state of life. Every aspect of their lives has adapted to these conditions, to the point that it has become a part of everyday life that everyone has accepted. Everyone except for our main protagonist, Rufus. His ultimate dream in life is to reach Elysium, a paradise where the privileged elite of society live, far above the filth of the world below. Rufus is a refreshing change of pace for video game protagonists, in that he is inherently a very flawed individual. He is snarky, egotistical, reckless, and has a habit of causing disaster wherever he goes.

I gained confidence and ability to solve game's tasks, but it took me about 3-4 hours. Sometimes you really need to give thinking out of the logic a chance. Sometimes everything makes sense.

I found the journey throughout all three of the games to be both entertaining and horrifying at times, especially near the end with what has to be done to progress. Even though Rufus, the protagonist, is the type of character I wouldn't like all that much, he still manages to make me laugh every now and then (especially when he gets beaten up for what he does), and the other characters seemed unique enough to me (Bozo was my favorite, I donno why, but he is), but I felt like Goal wasn't all that important at times, save for the fact that she's essential to Rufus making it to Elysium (which is the whole point of his adventure).\n\nWhile I enjoyed most of the game, I felt some parts clearly could have been done better. The Radio quest part of Chapter one for instance, I don't think I would have made it through in good time if I didn't have a guide for that part, and I found it was perhaps the worst part of the whole trilogy. Some other parts require you to do the same thing multiple times (usually 2-3 times) in order to progress, and sometimes, there's no clear sign that you should do that twice or more times (especially for achievements. But aside from that, some of the humor was great, like some of the random things you can do for an achievement, or going back in certain areas leads to you ending up witnessing something else entirely, or some of the dialogue between characters which often times, showcases Rufus's insufferable personality. I'd say this game's world was pretty well done (and looks well off) for a world that's pretty much all trash now, and the people are having to live in that trash.\n\nBut my complaints aside, I'd say this is a graphic adventure game worth looking into, if you don't mind playing with an egotistical fool that is your protagonist.\n\nP.S.

It sat in my game library for a while as I played other games. Today I was finally bored enough to play it.\nI started up the game and first thing I noticed was the resolution was messed up. Okay, I go to settings to fix it, find out you have to completely turn off and on the game to update the resolution, try it a few times and find that the game stayed thoroughly in the top left corner of my screen, sized to about 3/4 the total width and height of my computer. I toggle windowed and fullscreen a couple of times, no difference.\nI decided, \"Y'know what? I can play with this. No biggie.\" So I went on to play. I was greeted by a tutorial consisting of a cheesy fourth-wall breaking conversation between two random characters, one of which I assumed to be the protagonist. It introduced me to his boisterous personality, annoying character traits and terrible voice. It taught me the mechanics for a basic point-and-click adventure before the protagonist gets smashed by the machine I spent the three clicks to fix.\nI then find the protagonist in his room, acting as if nothing happened, and that colourful fat little man who taught me how to play Putt-Putt never existed. I'm then greeted with a fetch quest, which I begin, where I'm greeted with even more undesirable character traits, such as how he's a slob, he believes that nothing is his fault, and that he blames everything on who I presume is his ex girlfriend. I spend a while trying to figure out these puzzles when I notice something in the top corner.\n\"Who's this loser?\" I ask myself as I click the bearded gentleman in the top corner. Wait, now he's talking? Oh, he's the director or something? Oh look, now the protagonist is having a conversation. I click through the conversation to get it to go faster so I can continue the game. When the thing ended, no matter where my mouse was on the screen, it spawns my cursor on the \"Director Commentary\" or whatever again, so my mad clicks to get this man to shut up only launch him into another rant and another cringey conversation with the protagonist about the voice acting. \"Why is there a director's commentary here?\" and \"Why won't this go away so I can actually play this game?\" Were the first two things to come to mind.\nIt was then that I decided that I was done with this game, due to its horrid characters, technical flaws and boisterous creator.

As the title suggests you get the first 3 Deponia games all in one, which you can purchase separately if desired, and I feel like this would be the best way to experience the game since the game flow right into each other.\n\nSince this is a point and click adventure game, you're expected to click a LOT. Luckily the controls remain consistent between the three games. two click button, the scroll wheel for your inventory and middle mouse for clickable objects, easy and simple for this game. There are also a crap ton of puzzles and mini-games spread though out the game so prepare for some puzzle solving in deponia. personly I like the more relaxing tone to complete all of this, with the bunches of items and collectables to click on.\n\nSince Deponia as a series features a ton of story between its games, I won't mention exact details since it would be too long and not to spoil it. but I was very engaged all the way through, which helped me get excited to buy the 4th game not included, Deponia Doomsday.\n\nOne of Deponia's pinnacle aspects is in fact its a planet filled with trash, and how the deponians have adapted to the surrounding piles of junk. It very interesting to see all these different buildings and other businesses have be incorporated into the garbage, such as restaurants, hotels, and bars. Also I do enjoy the ost while there isn't a lot it does add some nice tunes to the game and I do enjoy the transition songs when you head to the next area.\n\nOverall, Deponia: The Complete Journey is a great collection to experience the deponia games, featuring three games of point and click adventure and which rolls into the 4th and unfortunately final game, Deponia Doomsday. Also, I got this collection for free, about 30$ worth of game for free, now isn't that a great deal?.\n\ntheres also soooo, many trading card sets for this series -w-\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1561294888, "timestamp_updated": 1561294888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531825661659240723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51399092": {"recommendationid": "51399092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242430968", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1720, "last_played": 1662061075}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game.

But it's not perfect. It's occasionally a little too obvious that the English dialogue had been translated from another language (German). Most of the translation is superb, but that just makes those occasions where it isn't really stand out. So if you speak German, you'll probably want to play it in German. The English voice cast did a perfect job, though (aside from one or two bad line readings -- like \"Why, you ARE!\" when it obviously should be \"Why, YOU are!\" -- but that's a voice direction issue).\n\nThere were a few puzzles where I had to look up the solution. That's not too surprising with a game as big as this, but I do think the puzzle design could have been better.\n\nThis game's humor is often very different from the classic LucasArts and Sierra games, but it's usually hilarious regardless. Rufus is an even bigger jerk than characters like Guybrush Threepwood and Leisure Suit Larry, but trust me, they're going somewhere with that.\n\nBut a word of warning: the game is not at all politically correct. Most of the time I'm perfectly fine with that, but I do think the transgender character Lotti may be a bit over the line. If you're sensitive about transgender humor, you may want to avoid this game. If not, fine, go to town. Either way, it's only a small part of the game; I only remember her being present in two or three scenes in the entire trilogy.\n\nBut, all in all, I consider this game a must-play. I wouldn't say it's my #1 favorite adventure game (that'd probably be The Secret of Monkey Island), but it's certainly in my top 5 at least.\n\nOh, by the way, this game has a sequel called Deponia Doomsday. Don't buy it. Just buy this.\n\n(EDIT: I hadn't played this game in a few years when I wrote this review. I'm playing through it again and I feel compelled to add that the first game of the trilogy mostly sucks. Its pacing is glacial and the humor misses more often than it hits, even though I'd forgotten most of the jokes.

The story is poorly plotted, the characters are grating, and the puzzles are poorly explained and sometimes illogical. Most significantly for this style of game, there is almost no sense that the solution of one puzzle naturally leads to the next in advancing the story.

Unfortunately, I cannot endorse this game. This is nearly a good to excellent trilogy of point-and-click adventure games. Unfortunately, it has the most sexist plot I have ever seen in a game. Also, there is one extremely ugly racist episode near the end of the third game in the series.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nThe games are set on the landfill world Deponia. The beautiful hand-drawn art depicts a world of rusted machinery, an endless supply of working parts for the DIY projects of its inhabitants. The setting evokes a a steampunk aesthetic combined with the post-apocalyptic. It provides a justification for  the inventory puzzles. The \"Rube Goldberg-esque\" contraptions required by many PAC adventures aren't  out of place here.\n\nThe main character is Rufus. He is lazy, selfish, reckless, and completely lacking in self-awareness. (He is also a kleptomaniac, which also justifies the standard behavior required in PAC adventures.) His redeeming qualities are his ambition to leave Deponia for the gleaming city in the sky Elysium (which no one else shares), and the fact that his outrageous schemes and dangerous contraptions work. While others point to Rufus's unlikability as a negative, I did not find his obnoxious personality to be a downside. He is the unsympathetic comedy protagonist, like David Brent from BBC's The Office, or Larry David on Curb Your Enthusiasm. Their unpleasant behavior deliberately create discomfort in the audience, which is supposed to be part of the fun. (The game does this well, to a point.) You control Rufus as your avatar, but you are not asked to identify with him or sympathize with him, and at several points the game acknowledges that no reasonable person would do so. Even though Rufus is lacking in self-awareness, the game isn't - the other characters call him out on his bad behavior.\n\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack. It is unlike anything I had ever heard before. I especially enjoy the piece with chiming bells, rhythmic clanking, and warm stringed bass.\n\nGameplay is peppered with a ton of mini-games and self-contained puzzles, most of which were fun. I found most of them to be appropriately challenging and genuinely interesting to do. The mini-games were properly *paced* and seldom outstayed their welcome. I can't think of another point-and-click series where the mini-games were so good.\n\nThe animation, sound design, and production are polished. It is clear a lot of care and attention went into making these games. Granted, I played a re-release compilation, which had many bug fixes from the originals.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nThe bulk of the gameplay, the inventory puzzles, can't avoid the flaws common to this genre. You spend much of your time thoroughly exploring sprawling locations, pocketing everything not nailed down, then combining said items with each other or with the environment in order to pass obstacles.\n\nIt is fun to gather items and brainstorm possible uses for them before the obstacles have been identified. The most satisfying puzzles are the ones where the elements of the obstacle, and the parts that make up the solution, contain enough clues that the answer arises organically after a bit of thought. Some of the puzzles in these games were clever without being obvious.\n\nBut inventory puzzles often devolve into \"moon logic\" that defies rational thought. Sometimes the in-game hint system gave me a nudge in the right direction, but it was not nearly robust enough given all the bizarre combinations required.\n\nThese games don't avoid requiring you to resort to brute force, combining every item with every other item in every combination, in order to figure out what works. I don't object to this per se - I imagine Tony Stark in his lab, when he gets stuck, sticking random pieces together to see what works - but these games go out of their way to make it more time consuming and more tedious.\n\nI mentioned the sprawling environments earlier. Each of the three games has a very long middle section with SO MANY locations, SO MANY items to pick up, SO MANY obstacles to overcome, and little to no guidance as to which piece belongs to which puzzle. These games were made around 2011 - I wonder if they were chasing after some sort of \"open world\" trend in game design. It does not work here. The choice to go with a open world act 2 instead of a more linear approach not only make brute forcing your way through obstacles longer and more frustrating. It is an unnecessary attempt to imply freedom in what is ultimately a linear game.\n\nSome dialogue in the game may be repeated. Other dialogue may be heard only once. Going back for achievements revealed a few instances where a non-repeatable clue is delivered in dialogue, long before the relevant obstacle has been discovered. \n\nIn several instances, interacting with an item produces a different result on the second or third attempt, yet there is no clue on your first (failed) attempt that another attempt will be any different. These are only discovered through brute force. \n\nIn several cases, red herrings not only mislead, they deliberately lie to the player. Some of the information given in clues is literally false. I don't expect to be handed answers on a silver platter, but I also do not expect to second-guess whether clues provided by the game are true or not. \n\nAll of the above are examples of fake difficulty - arbitrary decisions that only make the game longer and more frustrating. I am surprised that the quality of the inventory puzzles is so uneven. Especially since the mini-games are so good.\n\nMore bad game design - in a typical PAC adventure, you will encounter Puzzle 1, for which you will craft Solution 1. That leads to Puzzle 2, for which you put together Solution 2. Finally you face Puzzle 3, make Solution 3, and so forth. The Deponia games don't structure their puzzles in series, they put them in parallel. You face Puzzle 1, and craft Solution 1. You find it doesn't get you past the  obstacle, you are now presented with Puzzle 1.1. When you create Solution 1.1, you find you STILL haven't gotten past the obstacle. You must now get past Puzzle 1.2 with Solution 1.2.\n\nIn both cases, the designer has created the same number of puzzles and you have been tasked with the same number of solutions. But in the Deponia games, you have made so much less progress. The player feels much less rewarded, and the experience feels more tedious and frustrating.\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nThe plot of these games is deeply sexist. I am sad to say this is the most misogynistic video game I have ever played. \n\nThe female protagonist is named Goal. She literally falls out of the sky (from the floating city Elysium to the surface of Deponia). She spends most of the first game unconscious, while the men of Deponia decide her fate. In games 2 & 3, her personality is downloaded and split into 3 parts. Each part is placed on a cartridge so Rufus can manipulate her via remote control.\n\nOne would have to go out of their way to create a female protagonist with LESS agency than Disney's \"Sleeping Beauty\". Apparently the designers of Deponia went to a great effort.\n\nEven worse, late in game 3 there is a puzzle which requires Rufus to manipulate the only black woman in the game to sell herself into slavery as a literal organ grinder monkey.\n\nThe designers have denied any sexist or racist intent. I can't speak to their intent, but it is irrelevant anyway.\n\nThese games are sexist.\n\nGame 3 has a scene that is deeply racist.\n\nI bought these games in a cheap bundle, based on their reputation. I have enjoyed other Daedalic products. If not for the sexism and racism, this trilogy of games would get a Thumbs Up. As it is, I must give them a Thumbs Down.", "timestamp_created": 1558303931, "timestamp_updated": 1558303931, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421915620565414429", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50719909": {"recommendationid": "50719909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274949987", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 3276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3276, "last_played": 1660712314}, "language": "english", "review": "do not play if you treasure your eyes, ears, and brain", "timestamp_created": 1558270191, "timestamp_updated": 1558270191, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418040961027145386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50707653": {"recommendationid": "50707653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017684563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 2364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2364, "last_played": 1558206271}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Maravillosa aventura gr\u00e1fica!

Almost a flawless game. 9/10\n\n(Skip to the pros/cons section if you want just the quick summary)\n\nWhere do I even start?\nThe game looks like it was the soul of the directors, as seen from the first episode that gives players the option to hear the creators thoughts throughout episode one. At first, these were cringy and not interesting at all, but once you get into the game and kinda meet with the characters, it all falls into its own place. Also its a nice touch they invited the voice actors for the two main protagonists to help Poki (creator) come a little closer to his audience.\n\nIn the start of the game we meet our playable character, Rufus, trying out another experiment of his. We get one paper, that acts as our guide for the rest of the game,and on that paper written his only task - to leave Deponia, a literal junkyard of a `state` he lives in, and travel to Elysium, a literal paradise for those who had the `resources`.Because I do not wanna spoil anything, lets just say the game takes a weird twist followed by more and more weird stuff happening. Now, I can`t say anything else about the story itself, because everything is related, yes, EVERYTHING.\n\nSince I can`t tell you about the story itself, lets talk characters.\nEvery character is unique. There is no copy-pasta [spoiler] until you meet Hermes [/spoiler] and every character feels new and refreshing. Even tho the entire Deponia is just a big junkpile, every part you get to discover feels just great. The creators really tried hard to make every area you go through simple enough, yet detailed. \n[i] (Little tip for those who are getting into this game for the first time and getting stuck not knowing what to do, hold `space` to reveal interactable objects, I did not know this until episode 2, and lets just say it would have helped a lot if I knew sooner) [/i]. Also, every single object has a different comment made by the protagonist, that can even sometimes help you find the right combination for the puzzle, or you can try giving a wrong item to someone and watch the funny comments.\n\nSpeaking of jokes, there is no end to them here. Everything is full of easter eggs, [spoiler] platypus eggs to be `correct` [/spoiler] witty comments and actions. There is a good reason why the main character is called Rufus (Rufus-Doofus).\n\nJokes aside, game is also emotionally heavy. Cliff-hangers are made perfectly and the plot is written amazingly.\nI never played a point-and-click adventure before, because I always liked more action-packed fps-s, or story-driven rpg-s and after finishing this one...I gotta be honest I`m glad I took this road. It felt like a wonderful change of pace.\n\nNow comes the part I am sad to write, but I have to, because nothing is perfect.\n\nLets talk about some negatives.\nThe first thing is, that the game itself is not `compressed ` correctly. You might get into the game and everything will be [i] mushy [/i] like someone has drawn a picture and dropped it off on the screen, and did that 30-ish times and [i] voil\u00e0 [/i], now you have a mess. The good thing here is that they added a button that fixes it in the 2nd launcher (If you have the same problem, just go fiddle a bit with it).\nGlitches.\nYes, there is no game without them, but here they are kinda different that what you would expect. Sometimes the text on the character conversations can be wrong, sometimes there will be none at all. It also happened a few times that my character forgot how to walk. Sometimes even just refused to do something, even tho he needed to do it to proceed.\nBut, every bug here is fixed with a simple save/exit/wait for steam cloud to upload/start again.\nI encountered around 10 forceful restarts during my gameplay, but never missed a single save file and/or item.\n\nSo, lets go to the end here by summarizing my thought as I just completed the full trilogy:\n\nPros:\n+Great atmosphere and the world design\n+Basic, but also well detailed level-design\n+Diverse characters\n+Cool item combinations you can make\n+Requires you to actually think outside of the box to solve some puzzles\n+Great jokes\n+Amazing storytelling \n+Player interactable jokes\n+Poki`s guitar (you will get this one after a while)\n\nCons:\n-Forceful restarts might be required from time to time, but no data lost on doing so.\n-Music. I know music is not is not supposed to be great in games like this, but it gets way too repetitive if you get stuck.\n-Item sound effects on use are recycled from other items. Not many unique sounds.\n-Animations. There are around 10-ish animations for all characters. Sub-important characters have less then 5 poses, which makes it kinda dull to look at them in the same position all the time.Also some animations are recycled as well.\n-Lip-sync. same as animations, around 5-ish poses are there for talking animations.\n\nSo, to conclude:\nVideo- 9/10 IF the developers used a bit more time on the moving/talking animations...\nAudio- 7/10 Everything is repetitive except Poki`s guitar.\nStory- 10/10 Cool concept.\nCharacters- 10/10 Bunch of refreshments around every corner.\nWorld design- 9/10 Really good, but some episodes seem rushed when the level design is in question.\nChoices- ?/10 spoiler Do choices really matter? /spoiler\n\nOverall, an amazing 9/10 game. \nThank you Humble Bundle for this gem of a game!", "timestamp_created": 1556118057, "timestamp_updated": 1556118096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50293063": {"recommendationid": "50293063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086194938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1555993346}, "language": "english", "review": "My boyfriend bought this for me as a gift since he knows I adore the puzzle and story elements in Nancy Drew games.

It's biggest flaws in the actual gameplay department are:\n\n1.) That occasionally a very long series of puzzles hinges on a single interact-able item which blends into the background\n\n2.) For the above reason you'll often find objects that are available and seem useful, but are only used in a later puzzle which you have not even had the chance to see the layout of yet. \n\n3.) The hint system is almost entirely useless\n\nSo you might be asking: Why the negative review if the point-and-click adventure gameplay is pretty solid?\n\nWell, let's talk about the story, and the characters, and the humor...\n\nThis game seems to THINK it's a clever parody of video game and adventure game tropes, but it's little more than another example of those same reductive tropes. \n\nLet's take the main female character for example: Goal. Now the fact that they named her \"Goal\" seems like an obvious attempt to mock the way in which games have so often treated women as objects and rewards for the hero's completion of his journey. A capable dissection of that trope would go on to have their female character be an active subversion of the cliche which is lampshaded in her name, but Deponia doesn't even come close to that. Instead Goal spends the vast majority of the trilogy either asleep, kidnapped, incapacitated, or as a helpless child. She is utterly lacking in agency. On top of that, she IS treated as an object to be won by nearly every male character she encounters, from the protagonist to the dual antagonists, to the comic-relief sidekick characters. And throughout it all, she rarely, if ever, seems upset at this lack of agency. For christ's sake she even [spoiler] falls in love with the protagonist who has no redeeming qualities[/spoiler] Now the creator commentary track will assure you \"No, she's a helpless object on purpose cause that's the joke!\" But you cannot just call out a cliche and then execute it beat-for-beat the same way that any non-ironic game would and pretend that you're subverting harmful tropes and speaking truth to power. \n\nAnd that's just one example of this \"Say it's a joke, but play it straight\" attitude in Deponia.\n\nI don't hate these games, but I don't think I can really say they are worth playing when they are so complicit in shitty attitudes that pervade gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1550864636, "timestamp_updated": 1550864636, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487684726715087891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49160352": {"recommendationid": "49160352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063435736", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2411, "last_played": 1550187934}, "language": "english", "review": "I check Humble Bundle freebies on a regular basis, but this one caught my attention.\n\nTook me 40 hours to finish this game plus about 2 hours to get most of the achievements that I have missed.

What a saga.\n\nSome of the negative reviews have zoned in on the obnoxious protagonist Rufus, who is so by design. In fact, his unfiltered selfishness is a nice meta-commentary on the logic of adventure games, picking up/stealing objects and doing so much convoluted actions to complete your goal at whatever means. But for me, what works about Rufus is the interactions he has with the environment and the way he and the other characters play off each other. Rufus' flaws are the most apparent, but he is able to step in during the weak points of the other characters. Having such an extreme personality is what drives the game and amplifies so much of its offbeat, goofy but genuine spirit.\n\nThe actual puzzles and dynamics of the game keep a steady flow, which is key in adventure games; too often a puzzle can grind you to a halt, and while not totally free of frustration, the challenges and points of ease kept a balance that I definitely picked up on while playing. \n\nThere are some glitchy moments: namely the game would often change the setting for one-click inventory on its own after the end of a chapter, but it didn't take me out of the game. The voice-acting is sincere, and drives home the off-beat, almost but not-quite off the wall humor. And in spite of so many jokes and wacky hijinks, a steady vein of seriousness runs underneath everything, and carries Rufus through an arc (yes, he does come around, albeit very gradually), which is what really made this wonderfully oddball adventure game one I will remember and cherish.

I just finished chapter 11 and hooooly crap I'm in catharsis. Yes, this game is very long, maybe too long for Rufus' personality, which I didn't have problems enduring, he's quite entertaining at times and I could come to terms with the sexist, often dark or even racist humor. It has everything and makes no taboos, I like that. If we are to joke, leave nobody out of it! And it's even consistent, really. It jokes on every character, it burns its own main character (almost waaayyy too often), but then when you get a satisfying scene with praise... But why am I writing this, is because of the story. I know, I've already spoiled a bit for myself about the end, but this still got me off-guard, this last chapter I finished. There is still a chapter left, but.. that's for tomorrow.  Everything building up until that scene... It's just meant to be experienced. It was clever, maybe a considerable ass-pull for someone else, and I admit, it probably is, but what is not in this game? It's not logical, it's far from realistic and even breaks the 4th wall. So I just deny complaining about this random turn of events. And game mechanics, too. I've never liked any point-and-clicker adventure game, it's just not my cup of coffee. But this game did a good job on raising my interest in the beginning and I just kept playing out of boredom and curiosity, what this game has to offer in terms of story. I was up for a surprise, and hell... I got it.\n\nTLDR: This story is very laid back and builds up slowly, but it can hit like a train. Not like a \"Luke, I'm your father\"-level plot-twister, but for a cartoonish, point-and-click adventure game, I've definitely got my favorite. \n\nI recommend playing this game if you have the time and some money for it. One thing is for sure: don't take it too seriously, else you'll have a hard time. Also, if you get offended too easily, just skip it, like you would skip South Park. It jokes on real-life history, artists, genres and it contains LOADS of offensive humor (sexist, death-jokes, sometimes racist, and sometimes just mocks your intelligence).

In the first scene you play,  the incorrect moves cause the character to complain about how unreasonable his girlfriend is, or to boast about how great he is.   Then, when you get outside, you have two opportunities to converse with different people.  In both cases, all of your speech choices are rude.   Who wants to click five different options on telling your girlfriend you won't come back to her, even if she crawls?    If you do click on them, you get to hear her telling Rufus why he's a dead loss.   Although I'm totally on her side on this one, none of the exchanges is funny; they're just hateful.\n\nThe voice acting is in a nasal tone that I'm sure is a directorial choice, but that is harsh to listen to after the first five minutes.   The combination of the the selfish and self-important things Rufus has to say with the unpleasantly nasal voice makes every single area you click wince-worthy.\n\nI don't want to spend another minute in this guy's company.

The main character has become too irritating, and I have no interest in seeing him succeed in his endeavors. I was hoping for a build-up to a redemption story, but save (perhaps) for a literally last-minute action everything this character does is to feed his arrogant, dumb, self-centered ego at the expense of much better people. One thing would be having to watch him behave this way, but having to play as him and being [i]forced[/i] to act like a disgusting fool despite the game mockingly waving better alternatives right in front of my face is unbearable.\n\nI change my recommendation to negative. Original review follows.\n\nI wish there was a \"Meh\" button for recommendations.\n\nI have only 5+ hours into this 40+ hour game and it has already overstayed its welcome. I'm still in the first chapter of the entire series and I'm still going with the game because I think the world is interesting and I want to know a bit more about it, but I really don't feel much compelled to keep playing. I feel like I'm forcing myself to do it most of the time.\n\nThis is old school adventure gaming, with all its pros and cons. Gameplay is simple to pick up, but puzzles can range from mundanely easy to brain-meltingly preposterous. Many puzzles require you to put yourself in the mindset of the writer and try to read his mind so you can guess what he was thinking of rather than use logic to reach a solution, so when you solve them rather than have an \"A-ha!\" moment you have a \"WTF?\" one.\n\nWorst, some solutions simply don't work the first time. You have to try some things more than once for your actions to have a different outcome, and in many cases there's no indication of such a thing. Calling that \"poor design\" is being generous. And, of course, just because you realize how to solve a puzzle it doesn't mean Rufus, the character you play as, does. That means you have to make him realize how to do certain things.\n\nSpeaking of Rufus, he's really not what I'd call a likable character. He's a self-centered, egotistic prick. Once in a while he does something genuinely good, but it's mostly out of chance or for self-gain than out of goodness. His antics are rarely over-the-top enough to be funny and most of the time they come off as just mean-spirited. His personality also clashes with the puzzle system. Since he's constantly praising his own intelligence and is unable to accept his mistakes, you really can't tell if a solution isn't working because it will never work or because he hasn't figured out yet that it will.\n\nThe game also suffers from (no pun intended) lack of polish. Some subtitles are still untranslated from the original language, for instance. Animations don't always correspond with the actions and cutscenes are twitchy and feel rushed. I don't expect perfect lip-synching in a game with a different original language, but sometimes characters speak without their mouths moving at all.\n\nSound design is OK for the most part. The music isn't bad, but it isn't memorable either. Voice acting is actually pretty good, but the best part of the game is unquestionably its art, which is gorgeous. The design is beautiful and makes the world visually appealing and interesting. It's a shame the humor is hit or miss, considering it's supposedly a comedy game. Most of the time it feels forced and paint-by-numbers, being either too tame or not harsh enough.\n\nI don't feel the game is bad by any means, but it just fails to keep me engaged. I'll keep going for a while to see if it gets better, only because I like the setting, but I don't keep my hopes up. I have to recommend it at least for the art and a look at an interesting world, but be wary about the mediocre gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1549834290, "timestamp_updated": 1556882837, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532374083995819092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48911107": {"recommendationid": "48911107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198795582459", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1636, "last_played": 1549895746}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing quest, sometimes annoying but not often.

I also wanted to write a good review not just a few random words. So, let me just say - Deponia is amazing. I grew up on classic point and click adventure games, so I have high standards yet Deponia became quickly one of my all-time favorites. It\u2019s the closest game to Monkey Island that I played and in my opinion it\u2019s probably even better.\n\nThe game is beautifully drawn, has amazing soundtrack, strictly logical puzzles (well most of them), lovable characters (and SO MANY of them), phenomenal voice acting, great darkish humor (I tend to compare it to Rick and Morty, but it really is hard to describe) and one of the most controversial protagonists of all time. \n\nRufus is an idiot who ruins anything he touches but most of the time he has a good intent which kind of makes it even more frustrating. He\u2019s also the embodiment of egocentrism. I personally grew to like all his faults and stopped getting tilted after some time, but he\u2019s not your average hero and not everyone is going to like him. Decide for yourself if that\u2019s something you can get over. \n\nOther than that, I must say the game has a lot of bugs for a point and click game I don\u2019t think I ever played any other adventure game with bugs actually. There are no game-breaking ones but for example lot of people me included had to sometimes click multiple times on items in inventory for them to be selected because of some refresh rate issues. There\u2019s couple more things like that but nothing actually serious, just wanted to mention it because I\u2019ve seen couple negative reviews bashing the game for it. It might be a bit tedious from time to time, but the game is totally worth it and if I have to click couple times more for an unforgettable story, I\u2019m all in. \n\nI\u2019d love to write more because I have dozens and dozens of impressions, thoughts, ideas and topics for discussion but that by itself is frankly the greatest proof of the impact the game had on me.  95%.", "timestamp_created": 1549717605, "timestamp_updated": 1549717654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52603989839553833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48869033": {"recommendationid": "48869033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005917301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1548970405}, "language": "english", "review": "I played several Daedalic Entertainment adventures, and i can't say they are bad as art, voices and dialogues are good, but they are way too simple and boring.

(But it did help, I suppose.) This was the real deal-breaker for me. He's just an unrepentant asshat in every way humanly possible. I felt as trapped with him and as tired of him as all the other characters in the game seemed to be.\n\nThe puzzles can be very unintuitive and non-sensical. You're better off just stealing everything not nailed down and shoving it together until it clicks, despite how ridiculous and stupid it might seem ... as I expect the MC would do anyway.

To be honest it isn't actually bad and I have no strong opinion on whether to recommend purchasing it or avoiding it. If it wasn't for the fact this game has relatively positive reviews I probably would have given it a thumbs up.\n\nWith that out of the way, Deponia is your standard point and click adventure game in the vein of the LucasArts and Sierra games of the past. If you are unfamiliar with those two dinosaurs then you may be more familiar with their icon games Monkey Island and Kings Quest. Your main goal in Deponia is to pick up things and rub them on other things to create more things that can be rubbed on other things. If you are luckily after rubbing one or two things out you may trigger a sponanious reaction that advances the plot. \n\nIn between rubbing it one out you will also be tasked with random minigames puzzles that flucuate wildly in difficult and appear not to have been designed with steady difficulty progression in mind. This is partially due to the game being split into three parts (which would normally justify 3 difficulty curves for weirdos who start with the 2nd or 3rd game) but is mainly due to the games lead just doing what he wants and screw you for thinking otherwise.\n\nWhile learning the mechanics of the game you will play the protagonist asshat Rufus as he constantly strives to make his way to Elisium the paradise that floats above Rufus's home planet Deponia, a wasteland made of garbage. Early on in his struggles he meets and assults an innocent Elisian woman named Goal whom he feels responsible for and attempts to bring with him to Elisium. Along your journey you will constantly be at odds with the antagonist asshat Cletus, goals current-and-for-some-odd-reason-never-previous fiancee, and a mysterious military organization known as the Organanon. You travel through a variety of unique areas that artistically fit well together such as your home town of Kuvak, the floating blackmarket, Porta Fisto (and their sewers), and an Organon blast tower. The story contains quite a few twists, many of them seem pulled from no where and have plenty of plotholes but are interesting non the less. Overall it's a long story (which is why it was split into three parts) and feels like it is way too much for one game and could easily have been left out.\n\nOne thing I really like about this game is that it includes developers commentary that has unique dialog for almost every game screen including puzzle screens. While this is a common feature in remastered games like Monkey Island, most commentaries tend to include about 5-10 minutes of dialog that is so easy to miss you would be forgiven for not knowing it was there. I also really enjoy some of the characters you meet on the way, well one of the characters, Toni. Not to go into the story too much and give away how unnessecary many parts of it are, Toni is Rufus's ex-girlfriend and host (implying Rufus is a parasite). She has known him all his life as far as we know, and has dealt with his crap the longest. She is a very pitable character and it is grativing to watch her constantly chew Rufus out. My favorite scenes also include those where harm befall Rufus.\n\nMy least favorite thing about the game is the developers commentary. If you are actually reading this you know I like developers commentary but the main developer for this game is kind of an ass. The commentary annoyingly switches context from him commenting on the games development (which I enjoy) to pretending the games is some sort of movie and having conversations with the characters about how it felt to pretend to be themselves. These pretend dialogs are excruciating, go on forever, and only help remind you how selfabsorbed the main dev Poki is. One major problem you will quickly notice during the dialogs is that no one thought to balance the audio meaning if you want to hear them you will have to constantly adjust your volume as most of it is mumbled into the microphone before the lead dev begins shouting because he thinks it's funny. The developer will also constantly remind you how he screwed his developer team over by under paying them and purposely designing indivual large scenes that he could later split into smaller scenes when he \"suddenly realized\" they were too big. Another frequent feature is constant songs that serve no purpose other than stroking the lead devs ego as he insists on hearing his own singing voice and terrible lyrics all the time. This is also present in regular parts of the game through self insert characters such as the hobo bard (drawn to look like the main dev, and actually somewhat works) and a gondalier (also drawn to look like the main dev) who features songs with large amounts of digital static for some reason. I'm not sure why the main dev wanted to remind us how unlikable he is at all turns but he felt he needed to and that is the main reason I decided to use a walkthrough to end this game as quickly as possible.\n\nThe dialog in the game is overall not bad however one thing you may want to be aware of is that it often includes jokes meant to appeal to people the main dev personally knows or wants to play the game (such as lets players). I'm not sure why they chose to make such specific jokes but naturally they all fall flat and look stupid if you see them even if you listen to commentary which explains them.\n\nOne thing I never though I would complain about is that the game is just way too big. It's obvious the design team had a lot of ideas and wanted to do as much as possible but the game should really have been condensed into 2 entires as there was really no need for a lot of it. But for some reason the design team is obsessed with the rule of three and decided the series needed 3 games and thus needed every bit of crap they could throw in it.\n\nIf you played the previous game parts in their seperate episodes you can rest assured that the games are mostly the same. One thing I noticed was the addition of some collectables which are never introduceds and lack highlight so the only way you will probably find them (or know they exist) is if someone tells you or if you have an seizure and just start randomly clicking everything until you click the correcy rusty saw in the background full of slightly different rusty saws. The game also features enough bug fixes where you wont have to download save games from the developers website to skip broken puzzles such as the minecart in the first game. Unfortunately the game is still awkwardly split into three parts so you can't ever view all of Rufus's diagrams (one of my favorite additions to the game) without reloading 3 different saves. Oh and they also thankfully removed the single worst idea they ever had, the grogglejug option.\n\nWhile I'm also not one for *trigger warnings* I would also like to remind readers that the main developers of the game are German and lack cultural perspective from nations outside their own. While I'm not sure what will bug most people I thought I would point out a few weird things Americans will probably immediately notice. For some reason at one point in the game you need to join a cult that wears white robes and white hoods and chants about purity. I'm pretty sure it was not meant as a KKK reference, but it's pretty surprising when you see it.

It is beautiful and chaotic.\nNow i come away from this adventure with a mixed bag of feelings - i love it and i hate it. \nIn so many ways and more, Deponia is the most visceral, engaging experience i've had in a long while from a video game. The narrative is compelling and mesmerizing. The developer's molding of each segment of the journey from individual games into a single adventure is almost seemless. My attitude towards the ending is....fluid. I like it and i dislike it. \nI can understand the reasoning and the message it and the series are intended to deliver however my emotions are caught up and make it difficult to disengage from the narrative to soak up the hidden meaning. \nThat said, i know when im wrong and while i may feel challenged by the ending, i am glad it is what it is for its ability to evoke this sensation from me after spending so many hours immersed in this story.\nI love it and will return back to this as one among the few of stories i can thoroughly enjoy again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1545148896, "timestamp_updated": 1545148896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47593430": {"recommendationid": "47593430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302208299", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 6506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1352, "last_played": 1603282033}, "language": "english", "review": "Deponia: The Complete Journey contains the first three Deponia Games (Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, and Goodbye Deponia) it is NOT a separate game.  I made the mistake of thinking it was a separate individual game on it own and ended up buying all three original games PLUS The Complete Journey but luckily it was during one of STEAM's massive sales and they were all super cheap.  The good thing is that it gave me a chance to compare all three games with this collection.\n\nSince this is a collection of the first 3 games, if you actually have any of those 3 games you are probably better off just buying the other 2 individually unless you find the collection is on sale and offer a better price then it would cost to buy the other 2 games (which does happen).  If you don't have any of them I would say just buy this collection.  For the most part, there isn't anything really different between the game play on the collection vs the game play in the individual games.  Graphics are the same, sound is the same.  The biggest difference is that this collection offers \"director's commentary\" in the game.  The bard who sings the opening, cut-scene, and end scene parts is the in-game avatar for the Games director (I want to say Pokki is his name but it's been a while and now I'm neither sure of the spelling or the name itself).  With the director's commentary you see a circle in the upper corner with his image.  Every scene you are in (including mini-games... which he loves by-the-way) has that circle.  \n\nYou click on the circle and you can hear commentary about the game related to that scene.  Some of it is background on making the game, design, sounds, dialogue, etc... but occasionally it actually gives away hints as to how to complete something in that area.  Since it does occasionally give spoilers I'd recommend playing through the game at least once without listening to the commentary but if you're really stuck it might also be beneficial to listen to it since it could help you move forward.  Not every scene has spoilers in the commentary though.  I found the commentary to be funny and entertaining.  I had already played through the games (the individual versions with no commentary) so the spoilers were not an issue for me.  My biggest disappointment with this collection is that it feels like there should be an achievement for having listened to all the commentary but unfortunately there is not.\n\nThe only real difference is that some of the achievements.  In the individual games Almost all the achievements are available except Droggeljug from Deponia (1).  However, Deponia: The Complete Journey offers three additional achievements not available in the individual games: Story Time (Goodbye Deponia), Journey Completed (upon completing all three games), Junkyard King (Deponia (1)).  Also the droggeljug mode from Deponia (1) which is available only after playing the game through at least once, is not available (which is obviously why the achievement cannot be obtained either).\n\nSince that pretty much sums up all the essential differences in this collection compared to the individual games the rest of this will be review of the individual games:\n\n[u][b] DEPONIA [/b][/u]\nDeponia is the first game in the series.  I had heard many people say it was a good game especially for those like me who grew up on classic Point & Click adventures like King's Quest and Monkey Island.  To be honest the whole garbage/junkyard planet theme made it seem quite unappealing to me.  I'm not really into post apocalyptic dystopian future type stuff so for a long time I just ignored this game.  After having played it I wish I had looked past that a long time ago and picked the game up sooner.  It really is a great game.  It is a point and click adventure game and it's really fun.  It's got great graphics, great characters, great audio, great voice-over quality, etc... I have very few complaints about the game.  My only real complaint is the inventory system which is sometimes difficult.  It's supposed to be on screen and you can click it to open the inventory but sometimes it randomly disappears.  If that happens you have to push \"i\" and it will still drop down.  Besides that though I find it randomly has trouble selecting the inventory item or drops it as your trying to use it which means you sometimes have to attempt to grab and use an inventory item several times before you can actually use it.\n\nIn this Game our Main character Rufus is leaving his ex-girlfriends home (he's been living there with her for quite some time simply mooching off of her) and he's planning on traveling to Elysium which is a utopia in the sky.  He builds himself a device to transport himself there but on his journey instead finds a damsel-in distress (Goal) who he falls in love with and tries to save accidentally getting them both dumped off the cruiser to Elysium and right back where he started but now he has to try and wake her up and then get both of them to Elysium.  Rufus... is a sort of anti-hero.  He's a real jerk who generally thinks only of himself.  He's the kind of person you hate to deal with in real life but he's a sort of lovable Jerk so he's a lot of fun to play in a game.\n\n[u][b] CHAOS ON DEPONIA [/b][/u]\nChaos on Deponia is the Sequel to Deponia and picks up with Goal trying to warn Elysium that there are still people living on Deponia and Rufus is still hell-bent on getting himself to Elysium (and also reuniting with Goal).  Of course he mucks it up and causes problems.  Now he's damaged Goals implant and has to try and fix it... he makes it worse and now he's got to convince three Goal personalities to work with/like him while still working towards fixing her overall damaged implant.  I personally didn't really care for the 3-way split personality and having to change between them but the game is fun enough that it's not a huge drawback.  You get to explore new places in this game and meet new characters (including someone else very important to Rufuf's life who I won't give away here and spoil).  There's some fun references in the game like Cuthulu and there's A LOT of platypuses... or is it platypi?  Some parts of the game feel a little tedious having to walk back and forth for one thing but it's not too bad.  The inventory issue I mentioned in the previous game is still a problem though.\n\n[u][b] GOODBYE DEPONIA [/b][/u]\nGoodbye Deponia is the third (supposedly at the time, final conclusion) game of the series.  Rufus is still trying to get to Elysium and Goal is still trying to warn them that people are still on the surface.  People who like/help Rufus the most are starting to tire of him a little too much, his relationship with Goal is stronger but strained and he's struggling with being the good self-sacrificing guy vs. his usual jerk he is.  In this game we get a lot more background filled in to finally learn why he and Cletus look so similar and there are some emotional roller coasters game-wise too.  Many of the characters from previous games continue to pop-up in this third installment too.

A point & click game, it features a great setting, good art and some decent music and sound. However the main character and the puzzles within in are a nasty surprise...\n\n[b]Story - 3/10[/b]\n\nUpon starting the game you are met with a tutorial sequence...the games form of hell and it literally is. It gets repeated everytime you start a new part. It is cleverly used in the 3rd part however. From there you meet Rufus, a character who lives with his ex-girlfriend and wanting nothing more than to leave the trash heap that is Deponia and settle in the sanctuary of Elysium. Unfortunately because of Rufus' personality he ruins a whole chunk of the story and the ending is left on a cliffhanger, which of course leads into the 4th game. This ending leaves much to be desired and no one is actually satisfied with the resolution. Rufus definitely doesn't deserve to live on Elysium.\n\n[b]Characters - 2/10[/b]\n\nRufus... what an absolute d*ck. Seriously this guy's ego is so big and he literally ruins everything he touches. No wonder every character that interacts with him hates his guts including his ex girlfriend who seems like saint compared to him. How she lets him live in her house is mindblowing. He would trade his girlfriends mind for a lollipop! He makes the puzzles needlessly more complicated. He tries to redeem himself towards the end but doesn't actually. He's still the same Rufus from the start to finish.\n\nThe main heroine is either drugged, tied up or split minded. All of this is caused by Rufus! The main heroine doesn't get much to do because of this and she feels like a lackluster character for the most part.\n\nLiterally the other characters have no choice but to be reactionary to Rufus. There's one point where he basically sells off a black character into slavery as a monkey. Wtf?! That is unacceptable.\n\n[b]Gameplay - 4/10[/b]\n\nThe puzzles in this game require a guide. They are some of the most illogical puzzles ever and it really just comes down to trial and error everything in your inventory. I guess it makes sense since you are playing as Rufus and he's an absolute moron. Oh and these puzzles get extended because Rufus messes it up even if you find the solution! Some solutions to puzzles involves turning baby dolphins into canned meat... seriously messed up.\n\nI did however find some enjoyment doing these puzzles, especially the '+-+' one and 'Oh Organon' music sheet.\n\nThere's a bunch of humour to be found here, they are hit or miss. Most quite cringeworthy. \n\nThe developer commentary was good and helped you understand the world of Deponia more but sometimes it could be very long to sit and listen.\n\nI encountered a bug during my playthrough. It occurs when you are trial and error combining items. This item you combine is used later in the story and you can't uncombine it, preventing progress because you need one of the parts to be combined with something else first. \n\n[b]Art - 7/10[/b]\n\nThis is Deponia's strongest area, the art definitely makes you feel like you're in a trashy area with all the pipes and unstable platforms littered across the area. The characters are nicely designed and you can strike an easy comparison from people on deponia and elysium with the dark and light clothing.\n\n[b]Soundtrack - 6/10[/b]\n\nThe music is simple yet surprisingly fits quite well. The singing from the developer is good and short enough. The voice acting is superb for the most part including the part where Rufus tries to imitate Cletus. However the music isn't mindblowing at all, you won't really remember much of the music.\n\n[b]Overall - 4/10[/b]\n\nAs much as I enjoyed what I played, with the good art, music and sounds. The story, main character and gameplay go hand in hand and come off as a chore and a unsatisfying experience. I cannot ignore some of the despicable things the main character does. I would only play this game if it is on sale and you're looking for a point and click game to pass the time.

The game isn\u2019t the funniest around and isn\u2019t exactly among the best games in its genre in my opinion, but there isn\u2019t anything horrendous about it either.\nIf you are new to the genre and want to dip your toes into it, I\u2019d personally recommend you start elsewhere. If you are a fan (and veteran) of point-and-click adventures in general and just want another one to your list, then I\u2019d say sure pick it up. Have yourself a relaxing week or two (or more depending on your free time when you pick it up) as long as you aren\u2019t expecting to find one of the best ones out there.\n\nI\u2019ll start off by going into the negatives, because I like to end on a more positive note.\n[u]Negatives[/u]\n[b]Illogical puzzles[/b]\u2026 Now this one technically fits the context of the game, because the main character is a narcissistic madman. But it does cause some frustration, as several solutions feel more like trial and error than proper problem solving. Usually this genre does have some type of internal logic either proper logic or \u201cchild logic\u201d, (though admittedly most games have at least one extraordinarily silly solution), but Rufus is just mad\u2026 Often the solution is doing the most moronic thing possible intentionally.\nAnd that leads us into the [b]cast[/b]. Rufus is a horrible protagonist, completely devoid of any charm, which usually saves other reckless and careless protagonists from coming off as horrible and selfish human beings. His lack of even the most basic human kindness and decency coupled with the attitude of self-importance and \u201cI\u2019m too cool for this place\u201d, makes it damn near impossible to care about anything he does. Most of the rest of the characters are not much better, dull and forgettable, even if their designs make them somewhat physically interesting. I just couldn\u2019t get invested in most of them, and ended up skipping a lot of dialogue, because a lot of it seemed pointless and when they didn\u2019t interest me I just wanted to move it all along to get to where they might have me an item I needed or otherwise push me along in the puzzles.\n[b]The story[/b] just doesn\u2019t seem to fit. Saving the world, gathering friends and fighting against oppressors. Seriously? Someone who is this self-centered? How can it be that he gets friends, when he insults everyone he meets? [spoiler]Seriously he literally scratches his name into a girl\u2019s electronic brain! And refused to clean it with a small delicate brush because that was beneath him. \nHe murdered baby dolphins after being specifically told to leave them alone.\nAnd he SHATTERED his girlfriend\u2019s mind because he would rather have a lollipop than take the expensive material she needed for her brain surgery. DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WASN\u2019T THE ONE PAYING FOR IT! [/spoiler] It just really breaks any sort of immersion, even in a comedy game. Rufus isn\u2019t a really an underdog hero type, like the story-arch seems to suggest. He is more a bumbling idiot, who falls from situation to situation without any awareness. I think he would fit such a story better, one where he is an accidental hero. Even if that is a bit of a clich\u00e9, having his enemies and maybe even the common people believe he is some sort of brilliant guy, rather than having (almost) everyone know he is a complete idiot. It kinda takes the punch out of a lot of jokes, when both we and the characters knows Rufus is going something stupid\u2026 again\u2026 and again\u2026 and again. I mean no one really gets surprised by it\u2026\n\n\nThe comedy is more mixed\u2026 A bit of it works, the vast majority of it doesn\u2019t. Which is in large parts due to the main character, and the context of the story. Many jokes rely on slapstick. While seeing Rufus get hurt the first time is satisfactory, it quickly loses its punch, because he hurts everyone around him too\u2026 And he is not a dignified character, seeing a clear loser being humiliated and hurt just isn\u2019t that funny. Some jokes just aren\u2019t really set up properly to be fun. [spoiler]Like the big masculine hairy guy turns out to have been soft and girly as a kid\u2026 But by then we had already seen Rufus walk all over him at multiple occasions. We had seen him with an explosive passionate girl, who almost killed him and who was clearly more in charge in their relationship. And he generally had a kind and gentle demeanor\u2026 So the joke didn\u2019t really have any staying power, since he wasn\u2019t the ideal macho man anyway.[/spoiler] Of course some of the jokes still work, and are amusing enough that you don\u2019t give up on the game entirely. \n\n[u]Positives[/u]\nThere are two \u201ccharacters\u201d that I really enjoyed [b]Toni and Spunky Goal[/b]. [spoiler]Toni because she really mirrors my emotions towards Rufus. The horrible human-waste\u2019s ex-girlfriend, she is tired of his freeloading behavior and shitty attitude and is a rather cynical lady, who clearly has a heart of fucking gold in there since she hasn\u2019t kicked the bum out or killed him despite the horrible psychological torment he has put her and her loved ones through. I\u2019d have loved for her to be a secondary playable protagonist to balance out Rufus, but sadly that wouldn\u2019t fit the story. Still I enjoyed the brief moments with her. Spunky Goal, while just one of Goal\u2019s personalities after Rufus shattered her mind for a lollipop, is the other character I truly enjoyed. Mostly because of the contrast between her and the actual Goal, who is more of a classic damsel in distress most of the time (and a pretty pathetic one at that, when you fall for a guy like Rufus), Spunky Goal however is a really fun contrast. An over the top tough girl, ready to beat your little boy butt for looking at her funny, inside the body of such a feminine little body. I appreciated her threatening Rufus.[/spoiler]\n[b]The visuals[/b] I enjoyed the overall cartoony style of it, the background, the looks of the characters. I think that is one of the strong points of the game.\n[b]The setting and world[/b] the setting is nice and simple, a planet that is overrun with junk all around, with the humans living there having adapted to the horrible environment, and an almost dreamlike city floating above their heads, which no one can get to.

As you may know, you're buying three games here. The first and especially the last are by far the strongest in terms of story and puzzles, while the second (middle) entry is fairly weak. It's going to sound like I'm being very hard on the game, but I actually like it quite a bit. It just has some core problems in writing and game design that are never addressed, even after 3 games. I'll be talking about story flaws and game design, but it will be worded in such a way that spoilers are avoided. \n\nThe first problem is the story. The conceit of the adventure, the end goal that\u2019s always hanging over Rufus\u2019 head\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make any sense. The protagonist\u2019s only motivation is to reach to a place called Elysium. It is literally a glowing castle floating over the planet. Everyone Rufus meets tells him this is an impossible and foolish task. We never, ever learn why people think it\u2019s impossible to reach Elysium. \n\nThis problem is especially prevalent in the first 1/3 of the game because we learn there are multiple places on the planet where an ordinary cable car connects the ground to Elysium. Allegedly, the problem is that you need \u201cascension codes.\u201d This doesn\u2019t matter, of course, because there\u2019s no reason on Deponia why someone couldn\u2019t just make a second cable car. Everyone tells Rufus his goal is impossible or even acts like Elysium is a myth when there are literally cables connecting Deponia to the massive glowing castle in the sky. There is no reason given why the lower ascension station shouldn\u2019t be a thriving city, rather than an abandoned ruin. \n\nThings only get worse once we learn the Elysian\u2019s motivations. This problem is only compounded when the secondary antagonist essentially kidnaps someone to take back to Elysium, even showing off his prisoner, when it has been established on numerous occasions that the tertiary antagonist and Big Bad don\u2019t want any Elysians to know about Deponians for various reasons. It seemingly throws a big fat rusty wrench into everything the game has been trying to tell us because nothing about Elysium in the game all about reaching Elysium and dealing with Elysian politics makes any sense. \n\nThen there\u2019s the puzzles.  In practice, there are only four puzzles (not counting the diverse and interesting minigames) in the whole Deponia series. The way they are presented is generally enjoyable. Rather than gatekeeping (layered fetch quests to open next area) most of Deponia\u2019s puzzles push the story forward and have rippling consequences. That\u2019s good, but it doesn\u2019t excuse that the solutions typically are\u2026\n1.\tTrick person into doing something\n2.\tAnalyze and modify a Rube Goldberg machine \n3.\tTalk to someone until they do something for you \n4.\tRealize item won\u2019t work until its combined with another item. Then place new item in the same place. \n\nThese puzzles get complicated awfully quickly and don\u2019t always make a lot of sense. For example, you\u2019re trying to make a guy trip on a banana peel, but he doesn't slip on it correctly. So you go on an extremely lengthy and convoluted side mission to straighten a banana for no reason. The result is that nothing different happens with the banana, but a different cutscene plays. Rufus could have solved the puzzle on his own all along, but we just wasted 45 minutes doing a stupid side puzzle that has no echos on the story.  \n\nEvery puzzle has multiple, multiple steps because the protagonist, Rufus, is a blithering idiot. Rufus is so bad, the entire second part of the trilogy could be completely ignored if Rufus acted like an actual person instead of a one-note cartoon character. The problem then is that the events at the start of the second game create a butterfly effect that makes the events of the third game almost unrecognizable. \n\nMany puzzles also simply rely on repetition. It may seem you\u2019re out of options until you do the same thing over and over and over. One part forces Rufus to knock on a door three times under specific conditions to proceed. If you didn\u2019t know that, it would quickly seem you were out of options. \n\nIt\u2019s because of moments like the door puzzle and the banana puzzle that it appears the writers may have been overindulgent. Many, many times while playing this game I got up in the middle of a conversation to go to the bathroom and when I came back the characters were still talking; the dialogue box still hadn\u2019t opened. Characters, especially the soothsayer, drone on and on without saying anything of comedic or character value. Yes, we get it.  Rufus is an egomaniac. \n\nRufus\u2019 dialogue, even with familiar characters, constantly has to remind us of his single character trait over and over and over again. This is acceptable in the first chapter because they try to show Rufus has grown at the start of the second chapter. But the entire second game is caused by the fact that Rufus hasn\u2019t grown even a little bit. By the start of the third game, he\u2019s as bad as he was at the very start of the first game in spite of everything he\u2019s done over the past 10 hours. It\u2019s absolutely maddening to watch character progression that consistently takes one step forward and three steps back. \n\nMore than anything this is FRUSTRATING when it comes to Rufus speaking to the other protagonist. She constantly asks him very simple questions which you can\u2019t answer like a rational person. Rufus constantly lies about lying. He won\u2019t give a straight answer.

This game could have been so much better with improved writing and a more insightful social attitude. It\u2019s faults are painfully sad. Even though I found some humour, fun puzzles and an interesting alternative world to discover, the main character is a narcissistic leaching psychopath void of empathy. Not a fun nor sophisticated character to play. It takes away from any attempt at humour, because of the deliberate disregard he has for others. By design it\u2019s impossible to take anything away from this game. Which in turn makes playing it utterly pointless.\n\nMany games offer sophisticated humour, invoke ethical thought, critical thinking, even ambiguous ethical dilemmas. Deponia, however, is game that promotes toxic masculinity, upheaves rape culture and is unforgivably socially backwards, totally dismantling any of it\u2019s qualities. This game lacks insight, is cheap, unenlightening and a huge disappointment. It\u2019s blatantly obvious they wanted to create an adventure akin to Monkey island, but they couldn\u2019t be more off.\n\nThe female characters were particularly poorly written or made nonexistent (e.g. sleeping), degrading the storyline. Considering the game is from 2012, this lack of insight quickly became an annoyance. I\u2019ve seen more impressive and socially progressive work from the nineties. This game was such a let down. Despite the game having themes concerning subjects like dystopia, inequality, resource scarcity, callousness and lack of empathy, non of these subjects were actually addressed. Instead, commentary was left to a uninsightfull narcissist, who superficially started to feel a little bad as the game progressed. There was no depth to this story. The main female character was treated as a commodity the entire time and was constantly manipulated. All female characters were constantly being sedated/drugged if they were inconvenient, e.g. had independent wants, needs or interests of their own.\n\nIt\u2019s such a shame, because the world created could have had such potential if scripting had been better and if a higher level of social awareness would have been incorporated.\n", "timestamp_created": 1531258447, "timestamp_updated": 1531258447, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396077066659927368", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43433321": {"recommendationid": "43433321", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988857583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 566, "last_played": 1581195317}, "language": "english", "review": "A love letter to classic Point n Click Adventure games, Deponia is a fantastic story with lobable, memorable characters in a world full of character and mystery, always excited to see where I'll end up next!", "timestamp_created": 1531177671, "timestamp_updated": 1531177671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43425917": {"recommendationid": "43425917", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996424755", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1468988687}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Compra los 3 por separado", "timestamp_created": 1531152688, "timestamp_updated": 1531152688, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630538105964660645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43403884": {"recommendationid": "43403884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095713460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2056, "last_played": 1531062115}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR - great from art and sound side, but writing is extremely hit and miss. Unlikeable main character who breaks or messes up everything he takes on, his \"girlfriend\" (via Stockholm Syndrome I assume) is a driving force for plot through majority of the game while being partially incapacitated because of main character's actions, at times great but other times untasteful or straight up cringe worthy jokes and so on and so on... Get it at your own risk if you're a big fan of point and click games and think this stuff won't bother you. \n\n\nJust (at the time of writing this review) finished whole game. What can I say.... didn't actually enjoyed it that much as I anticipated I would.\n\nFor the start, Deponia's visuals are splendid. Cartoony graphics, very well animated, great music backing it up. It's pleasant to get into.\nMajority of the game are item puzzles, which is standard finding something in the enviroment (in case of problems you can hold space bar to highlight the interactable elements), using these items with something or someone or combining them together. Every now and then you'll also get a puzzle minigame which in most cases are fun to work out, but in case of frustration can be actually skipped.\n\nBut this game isn't perfect. Right off the bat we have to deal with main character's, Rufus' personality. He lives with his ex-girlfriend who for some reason allowed him to still live in her house. Despite that he's above any sort of cleaning or working, takes what he feels like and destroys everything else while trying to escape the planet because \"Deponia is a heap of junk where everyone is a trash eating idiot and an a**hole for being mean to him\". Don't know who's an a**hole here...\nGerman humour strewn here and there is hit and miss, I had a couple of laughs at times, but there were couple of times I also just cringed. Same with plot twists, some being interesting and adding to the story while other making me think \"oh ffs, just why was it nessesary here\".\nOn top of that some of the item puzzles are horrible to work out, they either require some heavily inconventional thinking, checking every possible outcome of a random mechanism because hint for it is in spot you wouldn't consider looking at, or just requiring you to combine every item in your inventory with everything that's interactable. At times they even appear out of nowhere just adding unnessesary steps, and mostly because Rufus being a doofus he is messed something up again and walks away like nothing happened. I've played last 2 chapters just reading a walkthrough constantly hardly bothering working out something myself due to how annoyed I already was by results to main character's ideas, plot twists and item puzzles. \nAnd then there's the ending, which might've had a second bottom to it, but after all was still just a huge disappointment.\n\nOverall I liked parts of this game. I liked the areas, enjoyed music, cracking through minigames and puzzles and liked some of the characters (not Rufus, at least not through first half of the game). However other parts were straight annoying like having to deal with sudden blockades most often caused by main character's incompetency, or even at times something completely outside of his control leaving you powerless and forced to work around your already worked around path.\n\nWhole game is a hit and miss in my opinion. If you feel like you might enjoy it or are hardcore point and click lover, then by all means you might get yourself into something interesting for good 30+ hours, otherwise I'd recommend something like The Dream Machine series, which has more likeable characters, less annoying c**kblocks and equally soul emptying ending.", "timestamp_created": 1531066141, "timestamp_updated": 1534335649, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461620241403579712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43387397": {"recommendationid": "43387397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165502301", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 2890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2647, "last_played": 1678838864}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the absolutely great.

On one hand you have a really great narrative, humor, soundtrack, art design. But on other hand the gameplay consists of puzzle solving. Not just puzzle solving, but very hardcore puzzle solving. Finding a solution mostly involves interacting with everything, until it moves on the plot.\n\nWell, that's pretty much all i have to say about the game. This is a 3 in 1 pack. It's definately one of my favourite adventure games, but puzzle solving element prevents me from replaying it again, unlike the newer adventure games like the ones from Telltale.\n\nI do want to add a few things though. First of all, the game is german. The original dub for this game was german. I don't know german, so I can't compare them. But i don't feel that the english dub is incomplete in any way. Personally i say, kudos to the localization team.\n\nSecond of all, the first 2 games run all animations in 12 fps. It really catches one's eye. I remember looking up why, and one of the diaries said that they only have 12 frames in their animations, made via photoshop. The 3rd game has improved on that. It even features options to downgrade animations, incase your machine is lagging.\n\nFinally (this is more directed towards the developers), i think that the 3rd game is more darker (theme wise) than the first 2. I am talking about the pedophile in the sewers chapter. Personally, i found the interaction quite disturbing. \n\nOther than that i would say that each game got more creative and creative, but they shouldn't have went there.

For me the humor normally fell flat and I only got a few chuckles. A few of the characters are likeable, but the roster is soured by the main character: Rufus. Rufus seems designed to be a dislikeable dimwit who's only in it for himself. At times the game seems quite nice or even funny, but other points bring you to a point of dropping the game. I only got through the whole thing for parts of the story, I wouldn't buy it again. For the rest of this review I'll be splitting it up into the three different sections that make up the whole game, slight story spoilers:\n\nThe first part of the game quickly situates us to how horrible our main character is. He has a history of breaking, destroying, desecrating, and killing, all for the chance to get at a utopia in the sky.  Jokes are decent and I laughed at a few, although some fail to even seem funny. A few of the choices and puzzles are a bit out of the blue, but can still be figured out with enough patience. Overall decent.\n\nThe second part starts out as decent. Rufus still hasn't changed his attitude. The game constantly tries to make Rufus's horrible attitude towards other funny, but all it did was make me more distant towards Rufus's character. Puzzles become more convoluted to a point I needed to look at a guide for a few parts. The jokes only got a few chuckles, there's just too little buildup and too little reward to them. Quite mediocre. \n\nOh boy, part three is a dumpster fire. Rufus at first seems to be learning from his mistakes (Albiet slowly), until he once again starts screwing over others. At one point in the game he ends up [spoiler] seperating a couple and then getting a black woman to play the part of a monkey. I'm not accusing the developers of being racist , but at best this comes off as a horrible choice by the developers. Rufus also ends up (accidentally) feeding multiple orphaned children into a slime monster, which ends up as pointless later in the plot. [/spoiler] To summarize without spoilers, the plot ends up taking a nose dive. Puzzles are split in a way that makes them idiotically complicated. The ending is unfuffiling for a series that was supposed to be a singular game, then a trilogy, now I don't exactly know. Terrible.\n\nThe only thing I can suggest is the first part/first game, which I can't even say was good. I would say to only get the original Deponia if it costs three dollars or less.

Together, they tell the story of Rufus' quest to leave garbage-filled surface of Deponia for the idyllic floating town of Elysium.\n\n'D:TCJ' is the best way to experience the grand scope and epic nature of Rufus' journey. The pacing of each of the three games is somewhat uneven, with overly long middle sections that seem to go nowhere. Thankfully, it is in these middle sections that we find the more interesting puzzles and fun mini games, which help you stay motivated. All three games, when played back to back in 'D:TCJ', present a clearer story and character arcs.\n\nOne of the most captivating aspects of 'D:TCJ' is the beautifully drawn characters and locales. The appealing art design, and the detail with which the characters and locations are realized, give the recent Remastered releases of LucasArts games a run for their money. The trash-covered planet of Deponia is an imaginative and visually stunning one, which was surprising to me at first given that it is covered with garbage. However, Deponia is a lot more lively and vibrant than one would imagine.\n\nThe English voice acting in 'D:TCJ' is also spot-on, adding personality to the interesting characters. Rufus is particularly unique among adventure game heroes. Whereas main characters of popular adventure games can be heroic, quirky, clumsy, or perhaps have their share of foibles, Rufus is just not (very) likeable and not even an anti-hero at all, for he is egotistic, narcissistic, and self-centred. And yet, he is captivating as a playable character, in part due to the great voice acting by Kerry Shales. Even when reasons for Rufus' faults are revealed and explained, it feels abrupt and a bit like damage control. You will definitely find divisive opinions on whether or not Rufus is a good main character in an adventure game.\n\nYou will also find divisive opinions on the jokes in 'D:TCJ'. Some people find them funny, some not. Personally, I find the game amusing -- not very funny, but entertaining enough. This could be due to the funny bits being lost in translation from the original German (and the game is very self-aware of it), or it could be simply due to what people find funny. However, I did find some scenarios, jokes and characters depiction off-putting, sexist, and culturally insensitive. Whether or not you can overlook these flaws is up to you.\n\nHowever, I can definitively say that the puzzles in this game are fun. Some are challenging, some require some form of moon logic, and some tickle your brain just enough. Despite the length of the game (I easily clocked in over 24 hours of gaming time in total despite what my stats say because I played parts of the game offline), there is a good variety of puzzles to keep gameplay fresh. The art and the puzzles are definitely highlights of 'D:TCJ', and I very much enjoyed the game in spite of the flaws I previously mentioned.\n\n'D:TCJ' is a great adventure game. It embodies both strengths and weaknesses of great adventure games that came before. Questionable quality of jokes and content aside, it definitely deserves the accolades that it received. It is a must-play for anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventure games.\n\nP.S.: For achievement seekers like I, you will find some achievements for 'D:TCJ' very difficult to get, let alone figure out what they are about. mishalunchbox wrote fantastic walkthroughs and [URL=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=875459798]achievement guides[/URL] that you should definitely consult if you are interested in getting all achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1514930525, "timestamp_updated": 1515205529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824401140213012695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38925854": {"recommendationid": "38925854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050449449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1495023246}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of people who dislike the game seem to have issues with the humor or the protagonist. I, on the other hand, didn't really have an issue with either of those. I played through the first game, which was a slog, and part of the way into the second before losing all motivation to continue and giving up on it. The only \"pro\" I can think of, looking back, is the animation is great. \n\nRoughly halfway through the first game the game I was already having issues listening to / reading all the dialogue, because it just wasn't engaging or funny and droned on and on. I'm not a stranger to story driven games or point and click adventure, but this was a bit of a red flag. My biggest beef with the game, and ultimately the reason I gave up on it, is the horrendously unintuitive puzzles. Puzzles that actually make any semblance of sense are exceptions to the rule. It most often falls back on point and click formulas of the 90s, where you try to combine everything with everything else until something works, then try to combine that with everything else, then try everything on everything until that something works... It's horrid.  The second game seemed only marginally better, with slightly more intuitive puzzles, but it quickly devolved into the same formula. You got occasional hints from dialogue, but few and far between. \n\nThe story is not engaging enough for me to recommend wasting all the time necessary to go through the motions of combining everything with everything until something works, then using that on everything until, again, something works. Nor was it engaging enough for me to recommend a walkthrough, seeing as I found myself bored halfway through the first game.

The premise of this story is simple: a young man Rufus wants to leave his home world Deponia. That is understandable, because Deponia is a junkyard of planetary proportions. There is, however, one twist to the classical hero's journey. Apparently, our 'hero' is a s--tstain on humanity! Surprising? Maybe. But let's have a little thought experiment. Say, you've encountered one of the three playable characters of the LucasArts classic \"Day of the Tentacle\" in person. What would you say about them? Right, they are utter maniacs! Dangerous, unpredictable, with tendency to pilfer every object that isn't screwed tight to the surface it rests upon. And if it is screwed tight, they will just come back with a screwdriver. Then they will recombine the stolen commodities in bizarre ways and you better run when they put their mccguyvering to use.\n\nOur protagonist Rufus is the logical conclusion to this line of thinking. Rufus doesn't pretend to be a good guy. Everything in the world will serve his goal to leave his garbage-riddled home Deponia and reach almost mythical Elysium. Rufus will leave nothing but chaos and destruction behind, and you, the player, will guide him through the challenges. But perhaps exactly because Rufus is so unabashedly self-absorbed, in the crucial moment when he does something indisputably selfless, you will be truly touched. So be reckless, blast your way through the junkyard that is Deponia, enjoy the story loaded with witty, sarcastic, and sometimes even dark humour, and in the end Rufus may pleasantly surprise you.\n\n10/10, I love fixing junkyard presses.", "timestamp_created": 1511820285, "timestamp_updated": 1511820285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37825172": {"recommendationid": "37825172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118550497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1504216333}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game that made me fall in love with puzzle and point-and-click adventure games, literally.

The first game immediately impressed me with its art direction, voice acting, and humor. Some of the puzzle solutions were a bit harder for me to solve since I had difficulty finding which items could be interacted with or picked up. I think readability is an issue that's present in all three games as there is a dedicated button to show you all of the interaction points in a given scene, which, in my opinion, shouldn't exist in a game where what you click on is supposed to be relatively easy to find?\n\nI had high hopes for the main character having some sort of arc but as I went on playing, I grew tired of him and his egotistical and rather insulting personality. It's fine to have an unlikeable character as a protagonist but when they experience no growth whatsoever, even after being reprimanded and unbelievably forgiven by some who were deeply wronged by him, it starts to feel a little irreverent. Most times he doesn't even suffer consequences for his actions which made less and less sense the more the story went on. \n\nThere's also some characters, most of them women and minorities, which are handled poorly throughout the games. I rolled my eyes at some of the tropes used like an Asian character being given a \"mystical\" background and funny accent to a trans woman in the process of transitioning being a source of humor but some of the later game's humor are worse. [spoiler]There's the fact that in the third game you strip a black character down until she has nothing and is forced to become a slave monkey as well as an actual pedophile that the main character encourages children to go visit at one point. This just comes across as either really tone deaf or they didn't think about the implications of these encounters at all...Also the main character's love interest is named Goal which... seems a little too on the nose for me? It doesn't help she's treated as an object in the first game and then her personality splits arbitrarily into three, making her less of a character and more like quirky characteristics mashed into one person. And she inexplicably falls in love with the main character even after everything?? That's what really grinds my gears about her but ANYWAY [/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, if you really want to play this trilogy i liked the first and second games but I definitely wished I skipped the third game.

You talk to characters to learn about the story and figure out what you need to do to progress, as well as pick-up, combine, and use items to solve problems. The series also features mini-games, though if that isn't your thing or you just get frustrated with them, there is the Skip option which auto-solves them for you so you can continue. \n\nDesign-wise the game looks great, with its animated style. The characters are quirky and interesting, and the voice-acting is good as well. It's a funny game that had me laughing out loud more than once. There were a few occasions where the solutions for puzzles were a bit out of left-field, but they are, for the most part, fairly solid. The only actual gameplay issue I had was the fact that, for some reason, it didn't always like to let me select items in my inventory. For whatever reason, I would sometimes need to click an item multiple times to select it. Thankfully, that was only an issue for the earlier parts of the series. \n\nHere's the basic premise of the story:\nDeponia is a planet whose inhabitants generated so much garbage over time that the world is literally covered in it. Things are so bad for Deponia that finding clean water is like striking oil or discovering a gold mine. At some point in Deponia's history, the upper-crust elite built Elysium for themselves, an idylic city floating way above the trash-heaps, and conected to Deponia only by a single tether, which is guarded and patrolled by their military servants known as the Organon. Rufus, a citizen of Deponia, has long dreamed of escaping their garbage-heap of a planet and living in the lap of luxury in Elysium. Unfortunately for him, and everyone around him, Rufus, while remarkably clever in his own crazy way, is too lazy and conceited to bother with such things like considering the potential consequences of his actions or myriad ways in which his inane schemes could go wrong. As a result, he's known as a walking disaster, and is a social pariah. (Not that his ego would let him consider that he's anything but the greatest person on Deponia.) Things, however, take a different turn when Rufus comes across an Elysian woman named Goal, and realizes that helping her return to Elysium may be his own ticket in. Thus begins his adventure.\n\nOne of the more interesting things about Deponia is Rufus himself. Unlike most \"heroes\" he is only tolerated at best, and with good reason. He's careless, egotistical, and his main motivation is \"how will this help ME?\" This fact is often lampshaded by his friends as they groan in exasperation and wonder what spectacular way he'll screw things up this time. However, as terrible as Rufus can be, it also helps to highlight his good points. He may be an egotistical, self-serving jerkass, but that doesn't mean he doesn't care. In fact, there are several points where his zany schemes may actually have worked out if he hadn't sabotaged them himself to save his friends. (Of course, they wouldn't have been in danger if not for him, but still...) Rufus is a flawed character, a BADLY flawed character, but one can't help but root for him in the end. \n\nThe rest of the other characters, both major and minor, play pretty well off the ego-centric Rufus, and the overall story and progression of the games is interesting, exciting, and amusing. If you're looking for a wacky point-and-click adventure that's laugh-out-loud funny, intriguing, and more than a little insane, I'd highly recommend Deponia.", "timestamp_created": 1507588838, "timestamp_updated": 1507588838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64088892936706543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35578412": {"recommendationid": "35578412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016299180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1597, "last_played": 1507469344}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has pretty good puzzles, voice acting, music, and story line.

Surprisingly engaging story and characters. Most of the logic puzzles are intuitive and fairly challenging. Art style of the game is unique and whimsicle, squeezing a substancial amount of creative juice from the trash planet motif.\n\nCons: Most of the designated puzzles (switch puzzles, slider puzzles and whatnot) distract from the flow of the game rather than enhance it and the game would be stronger without them. Some technical issues (Once I was forced to download and install a save game file in order to progress due to a crash glitch). Characters will break character at times to keep the narrative going or in an attempt to shock the player with a plot twist (Goal in particular tends to suffer from this trend a lot). Game's treatment of women in general might cause consternation and seems less ironic and more unintended (Your first clue being that the female costar is named Goal).\n\nWould recommend to: Monkey Island fans specifically or fans of LucasArts or Sierra adventure games in general, who don't mind having to google up a working save file.

It is full of humour but actually manages to be touching as well. You may hate Rufus (the protagonist) but if you do then you're in good company, almost all the other characters hate him too :P [spoiler]I am really not okay with some of the things he did in the sewer during Goodbye Deponia.

It really depends on how you want to play, and you can always replay it for the commentary if that's what you want.\n\nThere are a few little bugs here and there, but I found nothing that broke the game or hurt my enjoyment of it.\n\nOh, and I guess the puzzles are pretty good too :P\n\n[spoiler]I do wish I hadn't known about Deponia Doomsday before playing this though - I would have definitely cried at the ending if I didn't already know that Rufus survives (or is cloned again I guess although with Hermes dead I'm not sure who would do that) and that he has the chance to find Goal and head for Elysium again.

It's Brilliant\n2.) Hilarious\n3.) Challenging \n\nIt's very engaging although there have been times where i got bored trying so hard to figure out what item i was missing or whatever solution i had to think up for a particular problem. When i could no longer wait for a eureka moment, i had to consult a guide and when i did, it wasn't at all that frustrating to find out what i was missing. My reaction was more like, \"The people that made this have brilliant imaginations\" and it felt like consulting a guide was sort of justifiable due to the... \"difficulty\" of the problem. And i call myself an overthinker.... this definitely proved me wrong at some degree. \n\nThe humor was really good for me. Some scenes really made me laugh out loud. So much that the laughing probably kept me awake, which made me realize i've been sleeping at a later time than i usually do. It was amusing.\n\nOn my first playthrough, i had to skip a few minigames. The variety was refreshing which made the game more engaging where i'd always have to be ready for the next puzzle. Some minigames required good timing and quick wit while others required a well-planned strategy. Some minigames have \"reset\" buttons which were useful when i needed the pieces back at their initial places. \n\nWhen i reached the ending, i was honestly waiting for another part of the story then i realized then that there'd be no time rewinding, revivals, or any other second chances. While i was still halfway in the story, i had more than once wanted to reach the ending when once i got there, i had hoped it wasn't really the end of the story. It caught me off guard, that's for sure. Makes me wanna re-play everything from the very beginning. Hence, points to the replay value of this game. \n\n(Huzzah -  let's all play again.... )\n\nAck, those chorus guys are really messing with my head.

And the ending feels a bit incomplete.\nAs with the puzzles they are a bit on the difficult side exactly because of the humor that makes you try all sort of absurd things instead of trying what logically makes sense. And a couple of puzzles are just... too absurd or too out of the box.\nFor a puzzle game it is actually long.

This game was extremely worth the money (then again, I got it when it was on sale for about \u00a35) and gave me a good chunk of playtime since it's technically 3 games in one. The transition songs are a nice touch and the comedy is surprisingly good, but relies heavily on sexual jokes (so if that makes you uncomfortable, this ain't for you lol). The music is pretty good although it's a shame so much of it is recycled. The art style is a matter of preference, but it's quite good for a point and click game since the contrasts between objects are very clear (making objects easier to find). The design of the game is okay; there's a wide variety of puzzles that makes it enjoyable and challenging, but then there's that classic point-and-click aspect where some solutions are just too far fetched and you cannot help but check a walkthrough, although this was to a far lesser extent than with the Night of the Rabbit.

I had to erase my other games and only had this one to play so i could finish it once and for all, motivating myself several days before attempting to open it <--- This is the most precise example of how a game shouldn\u00b4t be made.\n\nIn the end, i think the devs wanted to pass on the idea of \"life sucks, nothing you do matters, and suck it\"  (come to think of it, i think the devs need a therapist or need to stop making these kind of games, because it\u00b4s bad for their health)\nMan, i would recommend this game for those people out there that are sadists, like to live with low self esteem and drag other people with them, and have something wrong in their head, i am sure they would defend this game by heart.\n\nEDIT:\ntl:dr\nEvery ending of every episode were awful and the final ending was the worst.

A few of its puzzles can be a bit frustrating though\n\nFull Version:\nThe Complete Journey collects together the first three Deponia games into one package with bonus features like Dev commentary and a quest log for example. Deponia is a pretty standard point and click game with a zany off the wall and occasionally dark humour.\n\nThe main character Rufus is a massive loser who creates chaos and destruction wherever he goes. However his ego is so overinflated he still thinks he's a great guy.That sounds like an awful choice for a main character but I found Rufus to be quit likeable despite his flaws and he's a great character. The rest of Deponias cast of characters are all wild and wacky enough to make the game entertaining. \n\nAs I said above the gameplay is the standard point and click variety. Pick up items and either combine or use them on other stuff to progress through the game, with the occasional mini game popping up. \n\nGood points:\n- the complete version collects the first 3 games together with bonus features as icing on the cake. So you get more bang for you buck than you would by buying the games seperately\n- Rufus despite being an awful person becomes quite a likeable and entertaining protaganist. The rest of the games cast features loads of strange and entertaining characters as well that add to the games charm\n- I like the fact that this game is more aimed at adults with a more crude and dark humour than your typical point and click game.\n\nBad points:\n- a few of the games puzzles are quite frustrating and at times very obtuse or over complicated. For example, without spoiling anything, there was a puzzle that you could only solve by going into the settings and turning off the music. The game only gives you a very vague hint about this and while I'm sure the Devs thought it was a clever and unique solution it felt so out of the box that it was a bit of a pisstake.

A real self centered, egotistical bastard, whose antics would make an SJW's balls recede into its body and come out the butthole. But that's what makes him likeable and unique from other cookie-cut 'good' main characters. And your opinion of him will most likely get better anyway as his character develops, which is par for the course as the story progresses. \n\nSecond: Like most point and click adventure games, the nature of its interaction mechanics and stuff crafting will present you with problems whose solutions follow some dumb frustrating logic. There were many times where I got stuck on a screen because I didn't point this one specific thing to this other specific inconspicuous thing that no one would think would go together in the first place.\n\nSo Third: Save yourself some time and go look at a walkthrough once you see that no option you'd thought of would progress the game. If you thought that you've exhausted all possible combinations of all the crap in your inventory and environment, there's no point in being stubborn and keep clicking the same things over and over when the solution's something minor you probably simply overlooked. Sure you would have found it eventually, but you would have also wasted your time.\n\nLastly: Don't take it too seriously, and enjoy! Every character is quirky, the world is interesting, and it's got a ton of fun minigames. It's got a lot of really funny ridiculous moments, and some really dark moments and mature themes too.
