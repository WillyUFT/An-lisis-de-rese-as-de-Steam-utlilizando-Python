Now, I understand that cute can be charming and endearing in the right context, but Rakuen takes it to a whole new level.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Rakuen, however, is its gameplay. The game heavily relies on tedious fetch quests, which quickly turned what should have been a heartwarming experience into a mind-numbing chore. It felt like I was endlessly shuttling back and forth between characters, collecting items, and solving mundane puzzles just to progress. This not only made the game feel monotonous but also detracted from the emotional impact of the story.\n\nI went into Rakuen hoping for a unique and emotionally engaging experience, but what I got was an overdose of repetitive gameplay. It's not a game for everyone, especially if you prefer more depth and substance in your gaming experiences.

Don't be like me and realise at the end you're missing one item that you can't go back for. \n\nAll in all, I liked this game. It has a pretty strong story, amazing art style and good music.\n\nYou learn about people in the hospital and their personal stories. There is an alternate fantasy world which is beautiful and super cute! The characters there are my favourite, especially the cave/sky buds.\n\nBut I wasn't expecting there to be sections where things take a darker turn. In a few \"flashbacks\" there is a creepy atmosphere and music. For example, red writing appears on the wall; footsteps can be heard off screen. I can't call it scary, but it did put me on edge a bit (yes, I'm a wuss). I had to blast some Lionel Richie because I couldn't stand to hear the creepy droning any longer.\n\nIt dampened my enjoyment of the game a bit because there was too much contrast between the cutesy elements and the creepy elements. It felt odd, like who is this game geared towards?\nAnd when I say cutesy, I mean very cutesy - bordering on corny sometimes with the song lyrics (and I'm not saying that as an insult). Personally, I like to play games to relax, so I will take corny over creepy any day!\n\nLuckily, these dark sections are not there for every character. I was relieved. Even towards the end, it was better balanced in its design; there were dark parts to the story but it wasn't trying to be a horror game.\n\nThose personal preferences aside, the stories were touching and there was a satisfying closure in the finale. Everything came together.\n\nI've seen some complaints about the slow walking speed and the constant back-and-forth when completing tasks, but I didn't really have an issue with that. There was only one time I can think of where the back-and-forth was a bit of a nuisance. Other than that, I was okay with walking around the areas. \n\nRakuen was an interesting experience and I'm glad I played it. I think the story, characters and style will give a lasting memory for whoever plays it.\n\nNow to do it all over again to get the damn achievements I missed.", "timestamp_created": 1682115046, "timestamp_updated": 1682115046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137051229": {"recommendationid": "137051229", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177880961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 884, "last_played": 1682079992}, "language": "english", "review": "Make sure you read all the notes all over the game for extra context.

Super cute sprites and character designs. Puzzles are just the right amount of challenging - though I'll admit I got stuck in the house a couple times and had to look up what to do.\n\nThe plot is where Rakuen really shines. Of the 5 plotlines, there's likely to be at least one or two that will mess you up properly. Everyone can relate to the very human stories told in Rakuen, despite them being explored through a fantasy world lens. There are tie-ins to real-world events that ground this story in reality. And often, I didn't realize the implications of what I observed earlier in the game until much later on. Rakuen is a game that lets you connect a lot of the dots on your own before revealing its story, which lets you connect with it on a much deeper, more personal level.\n\nCouple small frustrations in terms of the early game being a pain to navigate. Found myself often wanting a run button, especially with all the backtracking required. Navigation gets substantially easier after you acquire tools and fast travel spots, but yeah - kind of a drag early on, which is a total shame because the mid to late game is really where it's at.\n\nAnother minor complaint is that since some items are only collectible in the areas you can only access once, I missed out on my collection hunter achievement T_T perhaps on a replay, though, if I can steel myself enough to run through this emotional rollercoaster again.\n\n10/10.

With his mother, he wants to ask Morizora, the guardian of the forest, for a wish. On their adventure, he travels back and forth between the two worlds, helping the patients and visitors of the hospital: Gemma, a woman who has been in a coma for a long time and whose husband Winston never leaves her side. Tony, a grumpy old man with a broken music box that he protects with his life, and whose family is torn apart. Kisaburo, a man who is losing his mind and often sneaks out of the hospital to dig in the ground. And Sue, a little girl who has a large marble collection, but has never been able to say goodbye to her best friend. \n\nThe game is divided into five sections and in each one you help one of the patients in the hospital. The characters are all thought out with a lot of love and it's a wonderful experience to have their story told in the hospital and the fantasy world in different ways because each character also exists as a magical being in Morizora's forest. This makes a point of why I think the story is so incredibly beautifully crafted. All of them have something that is bothering them during their stay in the hospital and those situations can often occur in daily life, which is why you can put yourself in their situations really well. This has led to the fact that I often started crying and for a few minutes I was not able to continue the game. Especially because now and then you could only realize and process certain details and story connections of the characters later. Even though the game is incredibly emotional, there were moments when I laughed as well because situations and dialogues were just hilarious, but still fit into the world. The only thing that bothered me about the characters and the story was that certain things were not developed enough in my opinion. For example, Sue's story was relatively short compared to the others, raised an unanswered question, and consisted mostly of cutscenes. This was very rarely the case, but there could have been a bit more depth. \n\nThe adventure is designed in such a way that you not only travel between the two worlds, but often have to solve puzzles as well. The puzzles are relatively easy, but still require more thought from time to time. You often have to explore your beautiful surrounding to get clues and progress. Additionally, not only do you find important items for the story, but also pets and other items that you can collect for a community room in the hospital to fill over time. \n\nAs already mentioned, Morizora's forest is fantastically designed. The world really looks like a small forest with the most diverse creatures you can only dream of: the Leebles, various plants, bears, sirens and more. The atmosphere is often very relaxing and it's just fun to walk around the areas and look at everything. Whereby a point of criticism would be that I would have liked an option to run faster. Every now and then it was a bit annoying to run back and forth between places at snail's pace. But back to the atmosphere: The game also takes place in the hospital and in retrospective memories and I'll be honest, some sections were creepy from time to time. The game is definitely not a horror game, but darkness and loud clock ticking for example can create tension. A lot is also brought out by the music in the game and I love the music in this game. Laura Shigihara not only created the game, but also composed the music and sang the songs. Especially the songs that are meant for the individual characters are so incredibly touching and even made my crying worse. \n\nIn summary, I can recommend Rakuen to anyone who likes small RPGs, puzzles and emotional stories. Especially the emotional aspect is something to be prepared for. I can assure you that if you buy the game, you should also buy a box of tissues. Rakuen is a game where I wish I could forget everything and play it again without any knowledge.

The story is absolutely amazing and emotional, though most of it is delivered through text dialogue, so be prepared to do lots of reading! The soundtrack is equally brilliant! \n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, too, though it might not be everyone's cup of tea as it is in essence a puzzle game. More specifically, it gives off point & click adventure game vibes, with most of the puzzles being 'inventory-style', with some pure logic puzzles here and there, except you control your character's movement using directional keys instead of the mouse, with a few of the puzzles making use of this type of movement. In addition, unlike point & click games where collectable items are scattered all over the screen, items in this game are hidden in containers such chests/ cabinets/ drawers, with the exception of some natural materials which can be found in plain sight all over the forest. You also don't need to choose which items to use from your inventory. Once you've collected the required item, just interact with the right character/ object and the option to use said item should be available, with the exception of keys which are used automatically. \n\nAs a huge fan of puzzle games, I found the puzzles very enjoyable to solve. They lean toward the easy side, though those who have little experience with puzzles might still get stuck at points. Nevertheless, the story is so good that I think it's worth playing through the game even if you don't like puzzles.\n\nMy only complaint is that the default walk speed is very slow, and considering how much you have to walk back and forth from area to area, walking can get pretty tedious, which is why I HIGHLY recommend you download AlexanderNorup's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1358605227] Sprinting Patch [/url].

This might be one of the best hidden gems I have ever played.\n\nImagine if your favorite childhood book was in fact real and can be accessed through that door over there. That's exactly what happens in Rakuen. The boy's favorite book, read to him every night by his mom, is real and can be accessed from his hospital room. There, the world is lively and colorful, which contrasts the drab environment of the hospital. It's what any child could wish for.\n\nThe boy seeks out Morizora, the keeper of the forest, so he can be granted one wish. However, before his wish can be granted, he has to complete a series of tasks. This is where the gameplay gets most interesting. This world directly parallels the hospital, and the characters in the world directly parallel the patients, guests, and staff in the hospital. What happens in one world will impact the other.\n\nLearning about the hospital patients is critical to completing the tasks at hand. At first glance, the hospital patients seem cold and distant. After all, they're in the hospital, which isn't the most cheerful of places. However, a first impression isn't everything. The late Anthony Bourdain once said \"If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. Walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food. It's a plus for everybody.\" It is in learning about the patients where the gameplay gets most critical. I got to walk a mile in their shoes by exploring their backstories, complete with wholesome moments, heartwrenching experiences, and everything in between. I connected with them in unexpected ways and felt sympathy for them. At the end of the day, they and I felt more satisfied and fulfilled than before.\n\nAt the same time, the game doesn't hold back from touching upon sensitive subjects. Racism, feuding, guilt, insanity, and bullying are all addressed in the game. Even in a paradise such as Morizora's forest, the worst of human nature is still prevalent. However, even in the worst of moments did I still get to see the best in the characters. In parallel to the real world, sure human nature can be ugly, but it can be beautiful as well. The game certainly presents that well.\n\nI would like to thank Laura Shigihara for making this game possible.

As someone who enjoys games that are heavily plot based, I'm so glad I played this game.

These themes do become fairly predominant throughout the game and are explored in a fairly light-hearted manner but just something to bear in mind.\n\nBeing an RPGmaker game, it was an easy game to manoeuvre but it was also very beautiful to look at in terms of scenery and art style. It does sometimes fluctuate from being a very relaxing, casual play to suddenly becoming quite unsettling. I usually don't enjoy that feeling however, it added so much depth to this game that I just can't be mad at the creepy parts. I also really loved the random little side quests you would stumble upon like the mushrooms and the sign posts. It just added to the cute appeal of the game. \n\nFinally, I cannot write a review about this game without touching on how beaaauutiful the music was. Props to the composers of the music and the voices who were featured. It really was the ribbon that wrapped this into a beautiful experience.

The puzzles are really nice and nothing feels dragged too long. There's a change of pace about halfway through the game where it turns more into a cinematic/musical experience and less about actual gameplay. I didn't hate that per se because the narrative elements were still good and the emotional upbeats got higher, but I could also understand it if some players wouldn't find that change troublesome. The story is a 9/10 for me, simply because there are so many characters that are relevant and you only control less than a third of them and the ones that you do, aside for the main character, feel kind of arbitrary all things considered. I think that fact complicated the storytelling unnecessarily: either we should have been able to play with everyone or just let us control the main character until the end.

It got annoying instead of eliciting an emotional response. The actual background music in the game was always great and varied though. \n\nPerhaps too much influence from games like Undertale made the ending feel way too familiar and not all that creative or up to the actual game play leading up to it.

So I\u2019m meanwhile feeling heavily obliged to give at least a positive rating here, even if just for the record. I know, everything already has been said in other reviews, so to make it short, definitely one of the best RPGMaker games out there, on par with To the Moon and such classic top titles. Highly emotional, brilliant storytelling, good length (though as a general warning, also a bit melancholic because it\u2019s dealing a LOT with loss and hope). And what\u2019s more (as mentioned above), it even features an awesome soundtrack including vocal tracks that reminds you a lot of classic JRPGs like FF. Just don\u2019t expect too complex gameplay (like some other reviews criticized), this one is of course again all for the journey, but that\u2019s actually good in my opinion ;) Enough said. If you like soul-touching, unconventional games just try it out, sale prices are low for the price-sensitive people, so all in all I can\u2019t really think of anything that speaks against this precious hidden gem.

I'd heard about it back in '16 or '17 when it was still in development, but I didn't even have a Steam account back then.  I heard that supershigi was looking for people to stream it during the 5th anniversary week (May 5-12, '22), so I went ahead and bought the game.  Now this is not a game designed for people looking for ultramodern 3D graphics, or a game designed for people looking for combat, or anything like that.  This is a game that explores a story of loss, of grief, and making the best of what would otherwise be a terrible situation.  You will cry when you play this...I don't care what kind of stone or metal you claim your heart is made of, you will shed tears, and you'll be grateful for shedding every last tear.  I've played full many NES-, SNES-, and PS1-era RPGs, and this one (despite its complete lack of a combat system, extremely unusual for an RPG, though this falls a bit more towards a sort of playable visual novel) stacks up VERY well with the VERY best of them.\n\nStory:  10/10 - Without spoiling too much, it's a beautifully well-written story.  You play mostly as a boy (named Boy, no relation to Kratos) who is in a hospital in Sendai.  This hospital is dealing with the fallout from the Great Tohoku Earthquake, its associated tsunami, and the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster (though these aren't listed by name, it's rather easy to put two and two together based on certain in-game elements).  The story is broken up into 5 chapters, each one dealing with a different character, and centers around a book called Rakuen, that details a fantasy forest, but is a sort of reflection of the real world.\n\nGameplay:  9.5/10 - It's an RPG without one of the most critical elements of an RPG...a combat system.  While a good bit of the game is fairly linear in design, there are some sidequests and other side content that can easily be overlooked...it would take a very astute and thorough player to find absolutely everything the first time through, though it can be done.\n\nGraphics/sound:  10/10 - The artwork is fantastic...Emmy Toyonaga and crew did an exceptional job with the various sprites and storyboard character designs.  The music...if you've never heard of Laura Shigihara before, look her up on YouTube...she's been on there for more than 10 years, and has been making music for close to 20.  The music she put together for Rakuen is among her very best.  I couldn't help but try to sing along on various parts.\n\nFun factor:  10/10 - I found the game to be rather heavy on its theme, but some parts of the game aren't meant to be taken seriously.  These parts of the game really shine through, and serve as a welcome foil to the sadder parts of the story.\n\nOverall:  10/10 - As I said, this game will make you cry.  A lot.  And you'll be happy you did.   This is a game for people that have experienced loss, and the grief coming from it, and serves as a reminder that we really are all in this together, no matter our backgrounds, no matter what we believe, and that there are certain ways we can understand each other and help each other heal through sharing these things.", "timestamp_created": 1652335716, "timestamp_updated": 1652335716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115330270": {"recommendationid": "115330270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010579982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1652329797}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely beautiful game, which I won't go into depth explaining here but I will leave a few points to note:\n\n1. Music is central to the game, particularly the handful of songs that include vocals which add emotional punch to the game. I found myself pulling out my guitar and trying to play a long with a few tracks, namely Morizora's Cave. \n2. While this game is beautiful... it is very sad. It by no means has a bleak outlook, but it is undoubtedly a sad game... That's just a word of warning.\n3. Game is short (took me <8 hours) and all the actions you take feel very logical and straightforward. However, you move at a fairly slow walking speed and you cannot run so it can at times feel like your on a massive virtual hike.\n4. The art is cute but quite straightforward when compared to similar titles, however, the game more than makes up for this with the soundtrack so it was no problem for me.  \n\nWith that stuff listed I'll finish with a little tidbit of self reflection no one asked for:\nEmotional games have, in the past, made me choke up or perhaps shed a single or a few tears, but as it happens it's usually a fairly controlled situation... The last 5 or so minutes of this game made me CRY, not choke up, not shed a tear or two... I was on the brink of bawling my eyes out. This game hit me in a very personal place, and it felt very earned. Without spoiling anything or giving too much personal information all I can say is: \n\nI can do nothing but recommend this game.

Meeting the other residents at the hospital, and then learning all of their backstories... Let's just say this game will give you MAJOR FEELS.\n\nMy only complaint (which is partially my fault anyway) is that I missed a SINGLE collectible pet in an area I was not able to return to, which barred me from two achievements that I'll most likely play through again to get (because the story is worth it). I was pretty good at observing every object and corner of the map, so that ended up being the only thing I didn't collect.

It really helped make the world feel alive.\n\nGameplay was simple but VERY effective. It was very straightforward, but the little puzzles where very interactive and fun to solve so it didn\u2019t simply feel like a cutscene just to get to the next plot line. It was such a cool idea, too, swapping between two worlds that were connected to each other, it complimented the experience so well!\n\nThis was some of THE BEST storytelling I\u2019ve ever seen. Throughout the game the dialogue is engaging and interesting making me want to learn more about all these characters. I loved the little environmental details scattered throughout the real world and how interconnected everything was with the plot. The story itself was truly phenomenal and heartwarming with a fantastic blend of heartbreak and horror elements.\n\nLastly, the music. THE MUSIC!!! OH MY GOD THE MUSIC!!! EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. They\u2019re all like candy to my ears. Nice and sweet. The ones with lyrics have beautiful vocals and messages of encouragement or endearment and I just love all of them!\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU to everyone who helped make this game! I had such a great experience! This was probably the best 13 hours I\u2019ve spent in a long while and the best $19 I\u2019ve spent buying the collector\u2019s edition. (Sue is my favorite character btw, I just adore how she goes on and on about her tiny planets, such a big imagination!)\n\nI\u2019ve also recently started exploring Ms. Shigihara\u2019s works which is how I came across this game and I just keep getting surprise after surprise!

Mostly because of how much I love the character of Sue, her story is amazing and very well written.\n\nSadly I can't say the same for the rest of the game.\n\nThe game play of Gakuen involves you checking every object in a room to find a key which you use to unlock a door. And behind that door is another room where you will check more objects, sometimes you need to pull a lever.\n\nI would find myself wandering a building for 15 minutes checking every object over and over until I found the one I missed, it was extremely tedious.\n\nPerhaps if the story was great it would make up for the bad gameplay, but sadly that is not the case. \n\nI think the story is you helping the fantasy alter egos of hospital patients and that will somehow help them in the real world, but if that is the case you never see it. No one in the hospital is ever changed by your actions in any obvious way. \n\nI made the whole story feel empty to me, I didn\u2019t understand why I was doing all these lame \u201cpuzzles\u201d if it wasn\u2019t helping anyone.\n\nThe only thing that kept me going was Sue, whenever I found one of her marbles I went to see her as soon as possible.

This here game is one of those cases. I got it right for most of the characters' individual tales ('scept Tony and Uma, those two hid the twists of their tales rather well). That is a simple thing to do after more than two decades of reading books, watching anime and playing games. And just looking a the art of the Boy and his Mom together makes it obvious to me what kind of story I'm getting into when I play it.\n\nNow, while it may sound like I'm complaining, that is certainly not the case. Just because I know with a high level of certainty what is to happen in a tale, that does not mean I will do the uncouth thing of saying \"meh, I've seen in already, I'll pass\". No Sir!\n\nYou see, Rakuen is not a tale that is asking you to be shocked, or awed, or surprised, or thrilled, or elated, or any other of those things we gamers seek on our RPGs, J or otherwise. This is, after all, a tale of inevitabilities. A tale of \u201cseizing the moment\u201d. A tale about the simple, often mundane and common things that weight us down and lift our spirits, seen from the eyes of a child.\n\nI\u2019m honestly impressed at the seamless way in which Laura Shigahara and her team put together the fantastic and realistic side of the kind of tales we know by heart because they are so common, so everyday as the fight against sickness, guilt, aging, loneliness and fear. How they elevated all that from common to inspiring. And all with that gorgeous OST, complete with thematic songs for each of its mayor chapters\u2026 Simply beautiful.\n\nRauken has earned a place among those honest, simple games that are not about great things, but about the little things often forgotten in the shadow of more flashy, epic tales. Together with OneShot, Journey, Gris, and the like.\n\nThis is a game that the more hardcore will let pass for obvious reasons. But this is the kind of tale that, to those who found it, like one of those lil\u2019 doors that pop around in Rakuen\u2019s world, will lead to a memorable experience.\n\nThink whatever you will about non-violent games like this, but keep them in mind.

The music is beautiful, the art (especially the character art) is really solid, and the story... is interesting. \n\nIn Rakuen you're tasked with traveling to a fantasy world (of sorts) in which you help the fantasy counterparts of the real world overcome certain personal issues. The stories surrounding the patients are reasonably well-crafted, and can definitely get a little raw at parts. The themes tackled are pretty heavy, given the hospital setting in the real world, so expect to see lots of themes of isolation, grief, despair, parental abandonment, and even racism. At the conclusion of each story, one of the characters sings a heartfelt song, and the player moves on to their next task. There's plenty of entertaining gameplay to break up the crushing emotional weight of the small stories, although if you're not familiar with RPGmaker games you might not be a fan of the constant backtracking and fetch quests. \n\nI think Rakuen does a good job of creating an emotional tale, but where it really struggles is in maintaining a good pace. At the end of the short stories, after you've completed your song and gotten what you needed, the characters in that story are essentially cured of whatever was afflicting them. It's such a wild 180 from the major themes of loss and grief that are present in Rakuen. It's like the game is saying \"here's an emotionally devastating tale about how someone's mental illness has torn a family apart but they've learned to accept it, now let's magically cure that illness and get a happy ending!\" Especially given the ending of the main storyline in Rakuen, the fairytale endings of these sidequests feels a little tone deaf, to be frank. \n\nSpeaking of the main storyline, Rakuen's main storyline frequently gets drowned out by the side stories present in the game. These side stories do advance the game's plot, but during the last 10-20 minutes of the game it really seems like the developers just ran out of time to develop the main story and rushed things straight to the conclusion. It's not a bad ending by any means, but the game suddenly seems in a hurry to wrap things up, and in my opinion it lessens the emotional impact of a game that is designed to create an emotionally impactful story. \n\nThe music, art, gameplay and level design of Rakuen are fantastic, and the story itself is unique and emotional.

It honestly feels like they created the walking sim part of the game first, then figured it's too short so they decreased the character speed to that of a snail, and added these dumb interactive \"puzzle\" elements where you have to trade an item that NPC A gives you with NPC B who is a solid 5 minute walk away on the other side of the dungeon. \n\nSo anyways, maybe the story is good, maybe it's not, I dunno, I dropped this game somewhere around when I went into the dream world and got to the first story which was basically just a \"racism is le BAD!\" animal allegory for all of 30 seconds before more tedious gameplay was shoved in my face. Yeah, thanks but no thanks. If this is the caliber of stories present in this anthology, I think I'll pass on the rest. I wish one day a story would surprise me and tell me about how racism saved their lives; at least it would be somewhat original. Oh and because this is an RPG maker game, of course le spooky stuff has to randomly happen with no rhyme or reason, which the game never comments on. Anyways this game just got really tiring so I dropped it halfway.", "timestamp_created": 1646820513, "timestamp_updated": 1667281152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.127280950546264648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111804524": {"recommendationid": "111804524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995459456", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 454, "last_played": 1646747365}, "language": "english", "review": "Tried this game thinking it's like To the Moon, but it's actually a full adventure game with puzzles (unlike TtM where you don't really need to solve any puzzle).

It really is quite a sad story but is also very charming and thoughtful too.\n\nOn a side note; I studied Japanese language at university, so there were a few small bits included in the story that I picked up on that I thought were a really nice little touch.

Didn't know what to expect and didn't believe other reviews, but I'll reinforce the remarks on this game.\n\nGetting the quick stuff out of the way.  The graphics are good, portraits and tile-sets mainly, a couple human character sprites could have been more distinct and/or expressive, as it would take me a second or two to recall who someone was when seen outside their usual location.  Controls are acceptable and quite simple.  I switched between keyboard and mouse, the mouse lets you click things to see if they\u2019re interactable before you traverse the room, the keyboard only required 2 keys aside from arrow keys.  The only complaint would be the lack of running which makes exploration tedious and pads playtime by an hour or two.  There is a sprint patch, but that unbalances some areas that shouldn't allow sprinting, it would have been better had the game integrated it so it could be controlled when appropriate.\n\nNow the reasons to play the game; music is great, if I were to knock anything is since the designer and musician were one in the same, the game appears like it was first and foremost a music portfolio piece, as the music in certain places don't match the scene completely.  It's as if the development was mentally divided, or the music was made first, then the best fit track was placed where required.  I came to like the track \"These Grey Walls\" which you will hear often, but the area it plays on doesn't fit the mood initially.\n\nThe story and characters were predictable, unless they were not; weird I know, but due to tropes, heavy foreshadowing, or some thought, a lot of stuff was no surprise.  I did miss the mark on a few things, so it wasn't 100% transparent.  In terms of dividing the story into chapters, they get shorter over time, as if there was a rush to finish the game off before the motivation ran out.  Lengthening later story arcs would have lessened the impact of the story, instead cutting drawn-out content in exchange for more time spent delving into characters before the primary objectives would have benefited.  Getting into content, gameplay elements also start giving way to story, making the first half and later half feel different.\n\nOnly a few characters really get development, some don\u2019t matter after 15 minutes.  I have seen someone unaware one character had minor development after their arc, which is easy to miss due to not expecting anything more.  More time spent fleshing out some background characters, and getting to interact with critical characters more would have helped out; perhaps even removing the focus being on one character at a time.  Speaking of background characters, one character briefly mentioned at the beginning isn't shown until far later, some scenes spent building up that character would have clarified the ending just a bit more.  This is perhaps part of that rushing to finish, there is no side story to distract or remind you, or developed from beginning to end linearly without a solid plan to reinforce the background.\n\nDespite the weaknesses, it is a greatly written game.  The world building is top notch and design is fantastic,  Some things are unclear and were purposefully left vague by developer admission.

This game is cute, funny, touching, heartbreaking, inspiring.\n\nLaura Shigihara has blended together fantasy, Japanese culture, stunning songs, adorable art and tea to create a perfect game.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/fayestrawberry/] Faye Strawberry Curator [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1633356443, "timestamp_updated": 1672245009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100408289": {"recommendationid": "100408289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041965885", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 835, "last_played": 1633232186}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful game <3", "timestamp_created": 1633227731, "timestamp_updated": 1633227731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100367112": {"recommendationid": "100367112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080372072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 901, "last_played": 1633179197}, "language": "english", "review": "I cried so many times, this game is a definition what a game with great story is!", "timestamp_created": 1633179614, "timestamp_updated": 1633179614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100182284": {"recommendationid": "100182284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348883744", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1632945435}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La historia es preciosa, de los poqu\u00edsimos juegos con los que he llorado. \nRecomendad\u00edsimo", "timestamp_created": 1632945661, "timestamp_updated": 1632945661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100181766": {"recommendationid": "100181766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071249237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1632937768}, "language": "english", "review": "It takes something really special to give a person an intense emotional reaction, whether it be happy, sad, angry, competitive, etc. This game made me smile, made me giggle, made me think, and in the end, made me cry.

The gameplay is mostly fetch quests, talking, and simple puzzles.\n\nThe early game is slow in terms of the plot and the dialogue is a bit weak. Fortunately both get better around 2-3 hours in. The stories are the best part, predictable in some areas, unpredictable in others. It's imaginative and goes back and forth between reality/fantasy. Characters are mostly decent. There are a few you'll be invested in and a few who you won't really care much about. The dialogue isn't anything special, but it doesn't detract from the story. Unfortunately, there's other stuff that does detract from the game.\n\nTo start with, the game is way longer than it should be. It's a 4-7 hour game that takes around 10 hours. It never gets tiresome, but it drags at times and outstays its welcome.\n\nI mentioned the stories as a positive, but they're also a negative as well. The stories within simply don't make much sense when examined which leads to a bunch of plot holes. These plot holes are basically ignored by the creator and simply left to you to use your imagination. My job isn't to fill in holes in your story, that was your job. The plot holes aren't a huge deal based on what this is going for, but repeated plot holes are a result of poor writing.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly lackluster. It could be ignored if there wasn't so much of it, but there's a lot of it. Walk around at a really slow pace talking to people, checking a whole lot of objects, and collecting stuff for fetch quests. There's a lot of backtracking as well, which means you get to plod along the same areas over and over and over. There are a few puzzles but they're mostly very simple. The game almost always tells you the answer to the puzzles anyways as though the game was designed for the mentally retarded. If you get stumped on them, it might be a good sign you have some brain damage.\n\nRakuen is an above average game due to its story elements. The length, plot holes, and gameplay elements keep it from being better than that though. A few fixes, especially the ability to run, would've gone a long way to making the overall experience more palatable.\n\nA quote from part of another review about this game that made me laugh since I did it: \u201cIf you want, you can take a perverse pleasure in lifting up toilet seat lids and filling up sinks and leaving them like that.

The hospital becomes his new home, its dwellers his new neighbours.\n\nThe game is a bit of an oddball. It feels as though it mixes new and old technology. It could very well be a limitation of its engine, RPG Maker XP, but I'm not familiar with it and cannot say. The resolution is fairly low and 4:3, and it has to be played fullscreen. Perhaps due to this, it is not possible to see the Steam overlay, nor achievement pop-ups, while playing. These things did not bother me, however. I didn't even notice the lower resolution until I looked at screenshots I'd taken from the game (these are not stretched, after all, unlike the game window).\n\nRakuen is fraught with symbolism and fantastic elements, making it very enjoyable on more levels than one. It's not only thrilling to explore the boy's mind and fantasies, but to also discover all the symbolism throughout the game and how thorough it is. It is a game that gives you lots to think about, which makes it all the more enjoyable to play it through. Knowing a bit of Japanese and/or about Japanese culture and history adds another layer to the enjoyment of the game. Character names and the like take on another meaning with this knowledge, like the first character you meet, Yami, meaning [i]darkness[/i], or the song you are piecing together, Mori no Kokoro, meaning [i]heart of the forest[/i]. The same goes with signs and the like that you can see in-game.\n\nThe music is memorable, the art gorgeous, the characters likable, the world building well done and sufficient enough to arouse one's curiosity, and although narratively, the game offers little new, it is still well crafted to the point that getting invested in and enjoying the story and its characters is relatively easy.\n\nIf I were to give a tip for a first-time playthrough: pay attention to people's names.\n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] 7+/10", "timestamp_created": 1628869521, "timestamp_updated": 1642162387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97466654": {"recommendationid": "97466654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129919221", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1628835985}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a really chill game with a beautiful story.

Make no mistake, while there are definitely a solid number of happy moments, and even parts that may make you laugh a bit, this narrative will test your ability to handle tragedy many times over, and it won't let you off the ride once it starts.\n\nThat said, I still recommend this game. Yeah, yeah, it's an RPG Maker game, and the gameplay style itself might be tired, but Laura Shigihara works with what she has and does something wonderful with it. The graphics are beautiful, the story is well put-together, the puzzles are thought-provoking without being too difficult, and the characters are memorable, even after you've completed the game.\n\nI will say, the vocals are a little jarring at first, as they aren't frequent and they mostly take the form of song. Stick with it until the end though, and you'll see why Shigihara has decided to go for the occasional audible parts. The payoff is definitely worth it.\n\nOh, and if you buy it, one spoiler-free tip for you: explore everything, and if you find a sidequest-type item, drop what you're doing and follow through with it. And always follow through with the ending of a main quest before starting the next part. I didn't do that with one aspect of the game and I am kicking myself for it.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD: When I say what I do for the tip, what I mean is [spoiler] check on the girl with the marbles frequently, and do so especially right after you've finished her quest, the one with the dog.

At its core Rakuen is based on the simple premise of the main character wanting to get a wish from the forest Guardian Morizora. The complexity of this game is shown in full force in the 5 trials the boy must complete in order to receive his wish. Each trial is a heat wrenching story about those who reside in the hospital. One of the biggest reasons this game is so great is due to how relatable each story is. At the end of each respective arc you the player end up empathizing with the characters story and feel you were able to help them as if you helped a friend. If you love games that tug your heat strings, and like to feel raw emotions, then this is the game for you.

Fans of Freebird Games will feel right at home with its quirky writing, endearing characters and charming music (of which I will complain, briefly, below). The sum of these parts forms an incredibly hopeful, awfully depressing tale about love and loss. If this sounds like your idea of a fun time (or maybe you just enjoy crying, I can get behind that), then I'd encourage you to pick it up and have a go at it. You will not be disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its faults. None of these are deal breakers and, honestly, most of my complaints are very minor. What's more, they likely will only resonate with those who have previously played the game, but nevertheless I feel I must relate them here on the off chance that Super Shigi herself reads these and wants to make better on game number two. Proceed at your own risk any potential future players, lest ye be spoiled:\n[list]\n[*]Sometimes, the music doesn't land. Specifically, most of the times that a song [spoiler]with lyrics[/spoiler] began, it almost immediately took me out of the game. The first time it happened, [spoiler]it caught me so off-guard that I believe I audibly laughed. I went from a somber sadness to laughter immediately.[/spoiler] It actually got to the point where I was not sure if this was intentional or not - without these moments of reprieve, the full weight of emotional impact would surely have crippled me. I think the main issue is that these particular tracks are never subtly placed in with the rest of the score - they're always brought front and center. You can immediately tell when one of these songs is coming up because, well, it's almost announced in how the audio is mixed. (The exceptions being [spoiler]Sue's song about building worlds together, which is subtly brought in as part of what amounts to a cinematic, and Mom's song to Yami at the end of the game [i]prior[/i] to having the rest of the cast chime in.[/spoiler])\n[*]The story doesn't give itself time to breathe. Specifically, there are many story beats that had more time been given to the player to sit and reflect on the magnitude of what was happening, a truly deep and heartfelt sadness would have taken hold and been difficult to shake. To me, the most prominent and unfortunate of such moments was [spoiler]with the Alzheimer's sufferer and his saddened wife. The excellent scene of them holding one another in the field of flowers that he had planted for reasons unknown to his deteriorating mind is sweet and hopeful, tinged with a sadness that comes from the sheer relatability and reality of it.[/spoiler] Instead of sitting in that moment, though, the game quickly whisks you away to the next flight of whimsy. It doesn't really feel rushed so much as it feels excited to show you the next grand/sad thing. This could be to reflect the perspective of the main character (youth [i]is[/i] hasty, after all), or it could be, as I supposed in my earlier point, to spare the player the burden of an overwhelming sadness.\n[/list]\n\nThere are other complaints to be made about the more game-y portions of Rakuen - the poor menuing springs to mind immediately - but that's so very obviously not what the game is about that it feels unfair to call attention or make note of them...so I won't do so here. The game's pros far outweigh the cons, and literally every other consideration of narrative, presentation and music I would champion as masterclass - with the exception of the two above points. \n\nUltimately, Rakuen is a great gem of grief, a diamond of depression, and a nuanced narrative. It's masterfully crafted and well-told besides. A fantastic first effort by Laura Shigihara and a well-spun yarn, this is an easy purchase for any fan of narrative video gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1625028960, "timestamp_updated": 1625029139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59156191349029541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94675631": {"recommendationid": "94675631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393339000", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 767, "last_played": 1673136228}, "language": "english", "review": "i can't explain my love for this game. i got attached to it within a very short amount of time. everything about it is amazing, the thoughtful story, the beautiful music, the unique art style. it has definitely made me tear up several times. i'm really glad i made this purchase! \n\nmy only note is that if you're going for all the achievements, make sure to look into the achievements guide asap.  it's very easy to miss certain things that are required for the achievement called \"Towel Cape Hero\". i'd have to play again to get all of the achievements, which i don't mind \u02d9\u02da\u029a(\u00b4\u25e1`)\u025e\u02da\u02d9", "timestamp_created": 1624990412, "timestamp_updated": 1624990453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606047511100769043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94613948": {"recommendationid": "94613948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807110127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 528, "last_played": 1624918170}, "language": "english", "review": "It was an amazing journey.", "timestamp_created": 1624918286, "timestamp_updated": 1624918286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481159001588821411", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94589948": {"recommendationid": "94589948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882375984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 573, "last_played": 1625416663}, "language": "english", "review": "wonderful game", "timestamp_created": 1624894391, "timestamp_updated": 1624894391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481159001588821411", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94535713": {"recommendationid": "94535713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240583024", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1656297549}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome story game", "timestamp_created": 1624829077, "timestamp_updated": 1624829077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478723406791687012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94464859": {"recommendationid": "94464859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452848763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 530, "last_played": 1624741966}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, relaxing gameplay with puzzles that are just challenging enough to be interesting, but not to the point of frustration.

It is a game that took me a few years to actually finish and appreciate, and is a game that has contributed to my newfound respect for games built in a similar way to many RPG Maker titles. In the past, I have tended to find these game a bit dull and generic, with simplistic stories that tend to tug at the heartstrings or focus on pure horror and puzzles that are either braindead simple or smothered in moon logic. Thankfully, [b] Rakuen [/b] breaks through these conventions not only to bring forth a great video game, but for many this might be one of the best titles of its genre ever made.\n\nI'll start by going over the visuals, music, and sound, since it is what you will encounter first. The visuals in this game are stunning, with colorful environments and detailed, original characters everywhere you travel. It feels as if nearly no color is left underrepresented, and various lights and darks are showcased in impressive fashion. The stunning art is paired quite well with a great soundtrack and some quirky sound design. The music fits many situations and amplifies the personality of every location and character that you encounter. The sound design fits well here as well, with various bumps, sound effects, and short melodies adding richness to each encounter and dialogue interaction. It is truly a great mix of art and sound design, with only one flaw that I personally have - the theme songs that play throughout the campaign. These songs were structured well and made great sense with the overall plot, but I just felt they were a bit too \"cheesy\" at times for me to fully enjoy them. Each voice actor has a bit too much crispness in their singing, and it feels a bit \"off\" when listening to it. I may be in the minority here, but I felt it reduced the impact that some of the songs were aiming to make on the player. Still, besides this minor flaw, [b] Rakuen [/b] shines on an appearance and auditory level. Yet how does it fare once you peek under the hood and listen a bit closer to its message?\n\nThe main selling point of this title is the story, and it is pretty damn good here. The plot revolves around a young boy needing to assist various characters around a hospital with their personal issues, all of which involve a mix of personal strife and medical complication. The boy's goal is to help everyone in order to get  chance to wake up and talk with a great and powerful forest god named Morizora, who will grant him a single wish upon his completion of his journey. The plot throws many original backstories and interactions at the player, and many bits and pieces of the main character, various side characters, and the world are introduced as you progress. There is a lot of emotion in this one, so have some tissues ready if you tend to react a bit more strongly to emotional titles. The plot wraps up pretty nice, but I also have an issue with a bit of the pacing. I felt that there could have been one less story out of the four or five you encounter, and it would have helped with the length and pacing of the game a lot more. I sank a bit over 12 hours into this one, and if it were to have ended around the 10 hour mark I would have had a bit less fatigue with the game as a whole. The plot is still great at the end of the day, and it is likely the primary reason you would play and enjoy this title.\n\nNext up, gameplay. If I had to pick a part of the game to label the weakest, it would likely be the gameplay portions. The gameplay is by no means poor in any way - however, it could have used with some more interactivity, minigames, side quests, and puzzles to shake things up over time. The puzzles in this title were a bit less than what I was expecting, and they never ended up being too tricky besides the occasional one or two. Since most of the game is spent walking around and talking to characters, it also would have been nice to have some more minigames/activities to do during these encounters. The gameplay seems to show everything its got by the 3-4 hour mark, and while it never becomes horribly dull, I feel that they missed a huge opportunity here to add a bit more life to the title. This is the weakest aspect of [b] Rakuen [/b], and while traditional RPGMaker fans may not be bothered too much by this aspect of the title, other players may find it to become a bit repetitive.\n\nAs for other aspects of the game, I will cover them in this section. The UI is fairly simple and clean, with not too much involved from the jump. The lack of voice acting is a smart choice overall, though it does become a bit jarring to hear a character's voice in a song if you had never heard it in any other context beforehand (which may be the reason I was so put off by it from the start). The game is very theme-heavy, with each character representing a specific emotion, lifestyle, or character trait. Lastly, some background details may require the player to put two and two together, as it delivers information in a bit of an ambiguous yet intriguing fashion.\n\nOverall, I found [b] Rakuen [/b] to be a delightful game. The story, characters, art, and music made it such an enjoyable experience to partake in, and I'll likely remember my run through the game for a long, long time. I played this title with my girlfriend, and it was a memorable way to bond, talk about complex topics, and get emotional together. The shortcomings in gameplay, some aspects of the music, and the overall length/pacing brought this title down a bit more than I expected, but I still thought the overall experience was something extremely valuable and artistic. I can easily [b] Recommend [/b] this title to those looking for an emotional story with some albeit simple gameplay, all wrapped up in an attractive visual and auditory package. [b] Rakuen [/b] is one of the best RPGMaker-style titles I have ever played, and one that should not go under the radar for fans of indie titles.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 (Great) [/h2]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my curator page for my thoughts on a variety of other games!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/37542043-ADHD-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1623286727, "timestamp_updated": 1623286906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93448759": {"recommendationid": "93448759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387282058", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1623278360}, "language": "english", "review": "JUST PLAY AND FEEL.

The story is profoundly moving, and without getting into spoilers I will openly admit my eyes watered multiple times. Admittedly there are quite a few characters for a relatively short game, but you get to know them well throughout the game.

Y no es sencillo llegar a esa meta. Pero precisamente por eso es m\u00e1s emocionante. La historia general se divide en 2 mundos, un mundo real en un hospital donde todo es bastante dificil, y el mundo fant\u00e1stico con el que el prota est\u00e1 conectado. \nTen\u00e9s que hacer misiones para obtener items que te sirven para otras cosas (o bien abrirte paso o para poder cumplir misiones para otros personajes, para a su vez poder cumplir la misi\u00f3n principal.) En muchos, (si no es que en la mayor\u00eda) ten\u00e9s que resolver puzzles para seguir avanzando y durante toda la trama, podr\u00eda decir que actuas como si fueras un detective). \nLa m\u00fasica (como era de esperarse) juega un papel muy importante y adem\u00e1s es una excelente compa\u00f1\u00eda que da ambiente y resalta la emotividad de las historias.  \u00bfDije historias? Si, LAS en plural.\nRakuen es un juego con una l\u00ednea argumental principal de la cual se desprenden muchas ramas. (Las historias de los otros personajes del juego, lo cual me recuerda otro plus: Aunq los personajes secundarios no sean tantos, hasta los extras tienen su personalidad bien marcada y algo para decir) \nA mi parecer la historia principal y las historias de los personajes secundarios funcionan de manera simbi\u00f3tica, ya que tanto el prota (o sea vos jugando a traves de \u00e9l) como los personajes a los que ayudas, se benefician mutuamente con las acciones que desencadenas.  \nSi es que hay algun punto flojo, dir\u00eda que hay algunos momentos donde me estanqu\u00e9, Y como en el juego hay partes que si no resolv\u00e9s el misterio o el puzzle completo de la sala no te permite salir. Eso... me frustr\u00f3 un poquito. Pero creo q puede ser una prueba de perseverancia.  La verdad son muy poquitas ocasiones y no alcanzan para desestimar el juego, ni mucho menos la historia. \nTal vez se me quede algo en el tintero, asi que puede que haga una rese\u00f1a m\u00e1s extensa en video para yt\nPor lo pronto les dir\u00e9 que Rakuen es una obra de arte inolvidable y se los mega recomiendo.\nhasta la pr\u00f3xima\nKiaris ^^", "timestamp_created": 1619974123, "timestamp_updated": 1619974123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654471516609191895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91283435": {"recommendationid": "91283435", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043608276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1619976693}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want depression...here ya go enjoy! :))", "timestamp_created": 1619951455, "timestamp_updated": 1619951455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645288169384002686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91108746": {"recommendationid": "91108746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008631136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1116, "last_played": 1665292895}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an emotional rollercoaster ride from start to finish. It's a beautifully designed game that will keep you breathless till the end. \n\nThe game starts relatively cheery even though you are a little boy stuck in a hospital as you search for a missing book and meet the residents of your floor. From there you discover a beautiful parallel world filled with little creatures called Leebles as you adventure to wake the guardian of the forest, Morizora, in order to have him fulfill a wish for you. Once you are halfway through the game, I'd recommend having a box of tissues nearby as the game starts tugging on your heartstrings. It gets heavy and emotional, but always trying to look at the brighter side. \n\nThe music is well thought out with the right types at the right time. With a beautiful melody you put together and a comical rap meets rock group called NO HOLDS BARD, the music is simply stunning.\n\nThis short little game is so beautifully designed, it can be hard to believe it's an RPG maker game. Laura Shigihara and her group did a fantastic job. \n\nSo if you're looking for a short game (I played it through twice and have gotten all the achievements on the second run), with beautiful design that is a touching and heartfelt story, then look no further than Rakuen.\n\nThanks Laura!\n\nyou can find her on twitch developing new music and playing music on stream under \"supershigi\". \nGive her some love, she deserves it.", "timestamp_created": 1619707316, "timestamp_updated": 1619707316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771032094955444336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91082335": {"recommendationid": "91082335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044031558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1590561149}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels bad man", "timestamp_created": 1619658909, "timestamp_updated": 1619658909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571405887603759766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90973003": {"recommendationid": "90973003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412644791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1876, "last_played": 1551835348}, "language": "english", "review": "get to know this from To the Moon", "timestamp_created": 1619471328, "timestamp_updated": 1619471328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492105245590209961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90925913": {"recommendationid": "90925913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369026442", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1619394494}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful storyline!

What a great game.\n\nThis game surely gladdened my heart, messed with my mind and brought tears to my eyes.\n\nWhat gladdened my heart: The mapping, the character art and charsets, the music and graphics are all just lovely. You can tell a lot of love has gone into this game. There is so many details to explore, there is actual songs in the game, and the stories are genuine and touching.\n\nWhat messed with my mind: How the game seemingly doesn't want to tell you what in it is supposed to be reality and what is a dream or something similar of the main character. Also, the game is made up of parts that seem not to fit together. You often didn't know what the game would serve you next. Casual storytelling, tragedy, comedy, horror, serious topics and childlikeness ... but it just boldly stiches all of these things together anyway. And it works. Somehow. That's part of what makes this game so unique. Maybe the transition of e.g. horror to childlike fantasy world and back made me experience each more deeply, actually. I found the horror scenes terrible, just wanting to get out of there, maybe precisely because they contrasted with such fluffly happy fantasy world scenes. I was relieved to get back to the fluffly fantasy world exactly because it was such a relief to get away from the sad or frightening hospital. Just like a person actually stuck in a hospital might feel, wanting to escape, but also having to face their inner sadness and fear.\n\nWhat brought tears to my eyes: The sadness in the story arcs. You would think that part of the game taking place in a hospital unit with [spoiler]terminally ill[/spoiler] patients would be enough to make it a sad story, but they all have their backstories as well. Still, often by working through the darkness, new hope is found.\n\nOther comments: 1. The game seems to support a worldview that everyone goes to a good place after they die. 2. The pacing seemed a little off sometimes. Also when going through Rakuen doors, sometimes you end up in a hallway, sometimes in a new scene, sometimes first in one then in the other, it's confusing. But one can overlook that due to the many strengths of the game. 3. Again, the mapping is just so, so good and lovely, including all the custom graphics. Wow!

This makes the game very accessible. \n+There are very few segments that require speed and you can retry them without any penalties, because you don't have any punishments for 'passing out' during this game.\n+A potato can run this.\n-Sometimes the game runs slowly, not sure why as my computer is far beyond a potato... But as a result sometimes the movements are a lil bit delayed and I'd be unsure if they were stopping for a delayed scene or because the controls were being janky.\n\n**VISUALS**\n+Adorable pixel RPG/anime style visuals, with beautiful backgrounds. The designs of the worlds is unique, varied, imaginative and full of childlike wonder. You could never get bored with the creatures and visuals of this game!\n-During changes between locations there is often a bright white page effect which is jarring and uncomfortable (I'm light sensitive and have chronic migraines). Because the game runs slowly for me, it often would just linger on this section for too long as well.\n-Sometimes segments have really dark, limited visuals, where you have to be fast. I'm unsure how some of these segments worked for colourblindness either. I could navigate them if I turned up the brightness personally but I'm not sure how widely accessible it was.\n-The screen shakes in one scene I believe, this only happens once but you're expected to move about quickly during it, and this triggered my vertigo! It'd be nice to be able to disable that kind of effect or have it it at the beginning of the scene but not during the whole actionable part of it. There could be other ways to signal movement I imagine.\n\n**SOUND**\n+Sound is great, with a variety of nice songs and BG music, and the odd sound effect; none were too jarring (besides phones ringing occasionally).\n+You have subtitles for everything, including the singing.\n\n**SAVING**\n+You can save at any point except during cut scenes. \n-In fact you can't even *pause* during cut scenes! Although usually you need to click to continue each segment of dialogue, it doesn't replace the need for pausing. In my case, I pass out randomly, and being able to pause when I feel it coming on can save my laptop heating up over nothing, or making my loose my place when my cat decides she wants to continue the game while I'm out! \n-Also the last cut scene continues without your pressing anything, which... I mean, I was in the middle of crying my eyes out so I actually missed some of the ending content because of that lol!\n\nExtra points because the game handles disabilities for a variety of ages, both physical and mental, without resorting to inspiration p*rn.\n\nI fully recommend this game.\n\n**What could make it better?**\n\n*Ability to pause or quit during cut scenes, especially during the ending so we don't miss parts of it!\n*An ability to opt in or out of additionally immersive features such as shaking screen, bright white light fade outs/ins, might be helpful.\n\n\nOverall, I fully recommend this game. I feel it's pretty accessible, and handles its subjects sensitively and with respect, while being child friendly and heart warming.

On the outside, it looks like your typical JRPG, but Rakuen is so much more than that. The narrative guides you into this collection of deeply interwoven stories all taking place in a small hospital wing as you take the role of a young boy with his own difficulties to face. Going through each character's story is a journey of emotion and it truly shines light on  subjects that can be very close to the heart, such as the values of family, morality,  integrity, and common decency. \n\nIn a nutshell, it's wholesome.

Each of the character arcs is beautifully crafted and the world that the devs have built is both stunning and captivating.  Rakuen uses the lens of childhood wonderment and curiosity to explore many grown-up themes.  This unique point of view makes these tough topics more approachable & accessible in a tasteful way that all ages are sure to enjoy.\n\n[h1]Timeless & unique design[/h1]\nRakuen may have been released nearly 4 years ago, but it is arguably even more pertinent to the world today than it was upon release.  The story hinges on an eccentric, fantastical duality of parallel worlds, akin to the whimsical manner that Miyazaki films often do.  By the same token, Rakuen both capitalizes on and redelivers the nostalgia of many retro JRPGs.  The game utilizes conventions pulled from these games from our childhoods in a way that I believe it would feel seamless for anyone to pick up.  Additionally, Rakuen introduces some one-of-a-kind mechanics of its own, such as talking to mom.  Unlike many JRPGs, however, there is no combat in the game;  Personally, this is one of the aspects I love most about this game, especially since Rakuen is such a well-written story that this decision truly allows for the narrative to take the front seat and drive the game forward.\n\n[h1]The most impressive game to utilize the RPGMaker engine to date[/h1]\nWhile it often seems to me as though the engine can be quite limiting for many devs and their visions, Rakuen utilized these at-times-restricting parameters in a way that is creatively advantageous and blows the platform out of the water.  With almost entirely custom assets, the portrait art & pixel sprites are beautifully executed\u2014both cohesive in style and aesthetically exquisite.  As I mentioned, the character arcs are insanely well-crafted.  The plot includes excellent uses of foreshadowing without sacrificing unexpected plot twists.  The sound design and musical composition are at the level of masterpieces:  a true display of artistry and talent.  Both carry the story forward, and particularly the composition parallels how the storyline and characters build on one another in a very clever manner.\n\n[h1]Other bits worth mentioning[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]I spent 14 hours straight playing this game because I became so enveloped in the world of Rakuen that I simply could not bring myself to put it down \n    [*]I played using a Bluetooth DualShock controller, which integrated seamlessly and was a breeze to set up using the built-in controller set-up that is included in Steam\n    [*]There were one or two times in the main area of the Leeble Forest where the game was a little laggy, which I believe was caused by the sunbeams & lighting effects overlays, but it was not enough to detract from my experience and this seems to be more of a personal symptom of my machine specs than the game itself, but I thought it might be worth noting\n    [*]As this game is very simple yet incredibly effective, I\u2019m certain this game could run on virtually any hardware\n[/list]\n[h1]If I had to pick one game out of the entire steam store, it would be this one.[/h1]\nWords cannot describe how much love I hold for this game.

The game draws you in with colorful environments, fun characters, and an \"everyone has a story for you to uncover\" narrative. On its surface, it's a game filled with hopes, dreams, and childlike wonder, but this is a vibrant coat of paint layered on top of of a deeper narrative about tragedy, loss, regret, and making the most of the time we have. Beneath its colorful cheery veneer lies a foundation of dulled colors and somber tones as you literally traverse the sad memories of your fellow patients. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and its characters, and shed tears more than once.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Rakuen is mostly about walking around and talking to people or looking at things and hoping to find something that will help you progress. The gameplay is strongest in its middle third as you explore the two most fleshed out memory segments. You'll search for keys, read notes, and solve some visual and sound-based puzzles. Nothing too difficult, but assembled well enough to be interesting. The first third of the game is fine enough, but the last third of the game the story is broken up mostly by you walking around and talking to people or collecting materials lying on the ground around Morizora's forest in lieu of the more mysterious memory dungeons. This section of the game is servicable, and you meet and interact with fun interesting characters. If that was the entire game I would still certainly enjoy it, but the first two memory dungeons write a check that the rest of the game fails to cash and it is a little disappointing. Gameplay is definitely the weakest point of Rakuen, and honestly it probably could have done with less- I'll stand by the two memory dungeons being positive examples of gameplay, but even in those segments that I thought stood out the slow pace of the character's walking made them drag on quite a bit. Most of the gameplay feels in the way of the story instead of in service of it.\n\nThe music is incredible, I bought the game because Laura Shigihara is one of my favorite composers. I found myself dancing to a few of the zone tunes on more than one occasion, and the songs with vocals are all fantasic.\n\nIf you're looking for a heartwarming story and you're fine with a game hitting you right in the feels when you least expect it, Rakuen is an experience I wholeheartedly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1611526905, "timestamp_updated": 1611527830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85236380": {"recommendationid": "85236380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025366259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1611448942}, "language": "english", "review": "Great!

And wow, was it worth it. So, the story is about a hospitalized boy and his mother who go on an adventure to a magical land in order for him to ask the Guardian of the Forest for a wish. In the process, he also learns more about the other people hospitalized in the same hospital.\n\nSo, usually when playing different games that I know I will review later, I tend to write on a document the things that I like, am mixed about, and dislike as I play along with the game. For this game, however, I didn't think to do it, so I am just going to be naming off some things off the top of my mind.\n\nAlright, so let's start with the things I liked:\n1. The story: So, the story from the beginning i found pretty interesting (though I feel going to a whole other world can be a bit cliche), but what really compensated for that was the twists and turns the story took. Like, I love how it was divided into 5 segments, one for each character that you were trying to help out. And well, despite how it made me cry, the story combined incredibly well and it felt really wholesome and complete by the end of it.\n2. The characters: I just love how there are two different variations of each character (One in each world), and how creative the designs were for the fantasy world characters, and how they mixed in with something that the character in the real life loved.\n3. The music: Something tells me I am going to end up repeating the music of the game, to listen to all the time. It was very soothing, most of the times. But felt more fast paced and stressful in dangerous situations, which is a plus.\n\nSooo, those are the things I can think of on the top of my head.\nNow, for the thing I didn't like about the game which was:\nHow slow it felt sometimes.\nLike, I am not against searching for things, it's actually pretty interesting. But there were some points (especially in the cave) that I just started feeling like it was getting a bit tedious. Though, once I pushed past that, I felt it was pretty nice, so I would say it's not superr bad.\n\nBut anyway, that's what I have to say. Shorter than my usual reviews, but yeah.\nOverall, I would say I really enjoyed playing this game and would recommend this to anybody who wants some adventure with some touching stories too.", "timestamp_created": 1610498500, "timestamp_updated": 1610498500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84483494": {"recommendationid": "84483494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048880399", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1603623543}, "language": "english", "review": "Very charming game with a moving story and beautiful soundtrack.

The end I had seen coming for a while and when I got there I just went \"as expected\" and I didn't really feel much to it since, to be honest everything was just too vague, (without giving away spoilers) I get that it's trying to be metaphorical and let you make your own story out of it but that only goes so far, a lot of what happens just doesn't make sense to me at least.\n\nSo if you are looking for something to play that's an OK story and you spend most of you're time just walking around, watching animations happen and being left with a feeling of \"well that was alright\" then you probably want to play this.

(Please disregard my total playtime; I left the game running for a couple of hours while I went out to go grocery shopping!)\n\nPros:\n-The art style is very polished and clean, particularly the character portraits.\n-The instrumental music is very nice and fits the atmosphere.\n-It's nice that the mom is such an important character. \n-Sue's story was nice.\n-You can 100% the achievements in the game in one playthrough.\n\nCons:\n-At times it can be a chore to play (particularly the \"dark\" sections). Some sections of the game were so tedious I debated just giving up, but some part of me insisted on seeing the story through to its end (more on that later). I would not call a good majority of this game fun.\n-As other reviews have mentioned, some of the songs have rather cheesy lyrics to the point they were kind of awkward to listen to. \n-The story itself is very easy to predict, so all of the \"big reveals\" can be seen coming far in advance. Might just be that I'm very familiar with a lot of the story beats from playing other games, but when I guessed what direction the ending was going to take within the first half-hour of playing, it made the journey to reach said ending rather lackluster since I already knew what was going to happen. \n-As a whole, the game felt like it was aimed at a lot younger target audience, but the subject matter and puzzle difficulty doesn't match this. As another review mentioned, the game might be enjoyable to play with a young child as your \"co-pilot,\" given they're mature enough to understand the concept of death (which is kind of funny considering the two main characters of the game).\n-Walking speed was awfully slow (though I believe another player has created a patch that lets you run). Normally for a game made in this engine it would be easy to ignore but with the amount of backtracking and fetch quests, this does not help alleviate the tedium.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it's not a particularly noteworthy game either.

It might be a visual novel as well (not that im against them), in fact it should have suit the game better, since all gameplay is simply go there, go there, return there, now go there... It cripples the story, tedious, slow and uninspiring. Now i understand very well why gameplay of the \"to the moon\" (which i adore) was so basic, it never got in the way of the story. I mean it is like reading a book and when you try to turn the page someone sits on your neck and forces you for a hundred push-ups to continue. And dont even make me start about the childish puzzles... all garbage. What a waste.\n- Story. Besides the gameplay, this is my main problem with it. Story isnt that grand either to make me endure the disgusting gameplay it has. Story is pretentious, everything is too obvious, characters are bland and 2-dimensional, plot holes there and there, forced emotions... Congratulations for putting every writing mistake in a story. Zero engagement. What i find interesting is, majority of people who loved \"To The Moon\" also loved this game... How?... Really, how?.. You have one sci-fi/drama masterpiece in one hand, and one pretentious/amateurish/uninspired common fantasy story going nowhere on the other hand... How did you manage to love them both, congrats...\n- Visual representation. Since it so forcibly tries to emulate to be a story-telling medium, instead of graphics, ill inspect it as a visual representation of a story. Well, it is uninspired (if you are not making it a book, just give me something i didnt see before right?). Has no specific style or uniqueness. Just plain charm of some neat pixel art. This is another thing with the game: mediocrity, i mean everywhere...\n\n[b] Final: [/b]\n2/10 Boring, uninspired, bland.

I will be posting a more detailed review here shortly since there isn't enough characters, but this is a rough idea of it all.\n\nI had initially thought that this game would take place solely in a fantasy world, so I was surprised when I learned it would take place both in the hospital and in the fantasy world (though I should have seen that coming given the game description).  Even though it was very different than what I thought it was going to be initially, I still thought this was a very, very good game.\n\n[u]ART:[/u]\nI have always loved RPG/JRPG games and they have a special place in my heart, and this one is no different.  The art is absolutely beautiful and I love the designs for everything.  The color scheme and designs for Morizora's forest were created very well.  The environment was green and blooming, the grey sky (while not too dark) gave off the feeling that a storm had passed/a storm was coming (as the story goes into detail with later).  It was also a very good change in comparison to the hospital setting.  There wasn't a lot of color outside of the plants that were randomly placed throughout.  However, hospitals sometimes give off a feeling of being uncomfortable or distressing, and this particular setting didn't feel so.  It, of course, felt busy because of all the hospital personnel bustling around everywhere, but for the most part it felt like just another day (of which it was for the Boy who essentially lived in the hospital).\n\n[u]CHARACTERS:[/u]\nEvery character design and their background was lovingly made.  Even though a lot of the characters had much different designs than they did in Morizora's forest, you could absolutely recognize who everyone was and represented.  All the Leebles and support characters (especially the Envoy) were definitely very cool design choices and characters, so well done on their creation!! \n\n[u]SOUNDTRACK:[/u]\nThe soundtrack was absolutely beautiful and there was a lot of love put into the music made.  All the music was different for the different locations, and you could tell how the game was going based on the tune.  I was absolutely terrified for the first chapter of the game because of how often the scary music was played.  It was certainly good though and I give props to the team that made all the music, especially the vocals!!  I absolutely loved it and will be listening to it in the future.\n\n[u]ENDING:[/u]\nThere is honestly so much to say there that I don't have the space for it (so maybe I'll post a separate discussion on my interpretation of the endings).  Everything was done so well, and everything fits in with the information given.  As many people have already said, it is absolutely a cry fest so be prepared for a flurry of emotions.  \n\nOverall, this is an absolutely fantastic game and I am so glad I got the chance to play it.  I wasn't ready for all the emotions, but this is definitely a very special game that I would play again.

Rakuen has a wonderful (if not incredibly sad) story, one that I would recommend experiencing.Some people may be a bit turned off by the fact that this is a RPG Maker game, and I myself had a few problems with the game (in terms of lack of graphical settings etc.). However if you can get past that aspect the game is great. One of the best parts of the game (aside from the story) is the music, and it does a great job of pulling you into the world of Rakuen and setting the mood.In the end, I would recommend getting Rakuen.", "timestamp_created": 1600228387, "timestamp_updated": 1600228387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75967026": {"recommendationid": "75967026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331539737", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1600099334}, "language": "english", "review": "Rakuen (paradise, in Japanese), is a game about the journey of a mother and her son.\n\n[spoiler] This game takes place in Japan after a certain historical tragedy, that most of us were probably alive during and know, of left Japan devastated. The game does not really outright say what it was but the gameplay and notes leave strong hints about it and give you insight to the lore. [/spoiler]\n^not a huge spoiler, just a bit of premise and setting, but if you want to try to discover everything for yourself than I suggest not reading.\n\n\nHumor - from helping tree feet to drinking tea with flowers, this game had me laughing so hard I cried. The characters all have something to say and it is worth talking to each and every one of them. 10/10\n\nPuzzles - the puzzles were challenging, but never impossible. Most puzzles were easy, but usually in a way that made me feel smart and clever. There were some that stumped me but I was able to figure them out after a bit of time and thought. This game does not rely on cheap mechanics like hiding things where you would never look. There is a clue for everything and the clues are never too obscure or vague. 10/10\n\nMusic - the music was the big mood-setter for the game. It guided your emotions for every scene. Sometimes it would be somber and pretty, other times it was upbeat and fun. Loved all of the singing as well. 10/10\n\nCharacters - the characters are deep and real. I do not mean that they are people who actually exist. I mean that their situations are very real and that they convey those situations perfectly. For example, Kisaburo reminds me a bit of what my grandpa is going through. All the characters have humor, motives, and stories that I think you will enjoy. 10/10\n\nAnimation - although almost everything is pixelated and it is not the amazing realistic graphics that we have grown used to at this point in time, it is still beautiful. I remember the stars, the forests, the ponds. It was all beautiful. Which is why I say this is some of the best pixelated animation of all time. 10/10\n\nWriting - if I have any complaint with the game, it would be in the writing. No, I do not mean the overall writing of the plot. I mean the actual writing when someone is speaking and my only complaint is that one time mom said \"prolly\" and i thought that was strange. Overall, I did not even notice any typos or weird grammar. It all flowed very well and the plot writing is near perfection. 10/10\n\nIn conclusion, this game had me laughing, fully invested, and motivated to help everyone. Not because I'm a good person or anything, but because the game made me fall in love with the characters. And I'll leave it at this as to not spoil anything: I most certainly lost the \"try not to cry\" challenge...", "timestamp_created": 1600102148, "timestamp_updated": 1600102227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75926131": {"recommendationid": "75926131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039119157", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1600027190}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego 10/10 S\u00faper recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1600027321, "timestamp_updated": 1600027321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75884564": {"recommendationid": "75884564", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004238052", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 798, "last_played": 1599887736}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Rakuen is a indie rpg game, at firt it looks like a simple adventure game, but more than it, Rakuen intend to be a satisfying emotional adventure,\n with a rich story and full of memorable moments,providing to its players a memorable experience.[/i]\n                                                                            UwU\n\nRakuen was created in 2017 by Laura shigihara and it was built using the rpg-maker-xp engine.\n \n\nI had a good experience with this game,\n it was some kind of relaxing to me at the same time it was some kind of \"sad\"\n\n(  [strike]ok, i admit that i almost cryied one time...or two...[/strike] )\n\nwith no doubouts it was a memorable game to me, i give it the [b]7/10[/b] score,and recommend to\n                     people that like that kind of game.TwT", "timestamp_created": 1599966536, "timestamp_updated": 1599966536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75840858": {"recommendationid": "75840858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120079272", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 697, "last_played": 1599902753}, "language": "english", "review": "I ended up thinking about many things.", "timestamp_created": 1599903138, "timestamp_updated": 1599903138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75753897": {"recommendationid": "75753897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022470433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1599755260}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally recommended for the story.", "timestamp_created": 1599754561, "timestamp_updated": 1599754561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75630223": {"recommendationid": "75630223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085823076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1599593972}, "language": "english", "review": "Soooo Sweet!

First of all, the story of Rakuen is beautiful, imaginative and emotional. I love the story, especially the ending which was very emotional. Regarding the game play, I find Rakuen has a stronger emphasis on \"game\" than To The Moon and Finding Paradise. TTM and FP are like interactive stories while Rakuen is more like a game, with more time exploring around, talking to different NPCs, collecting items and completing tasks. I find TTM style more enjoyable but this is just personal preference. In the middle of Rakuen game play I was a bit bored by the game play mechanism where I have to go around and collect items or help out NPCs who are not on the main story line on somewhat trivial tasks. One example is the task of serving tea and finding the thief at Skybud mansion. All I want to do is bring the tea sample to Monsieur and find out what happens next on  Kisaburo story line. Personally I find this kind of chore-like tasks to be a distraction from the main story, and I might enjoy the story better with less of them. Still, all the chores are worth it to go through for the end of the story. The part after Star Night Festival night was truly amazing. Overall, I really like this game and thank you Laura for creating it.\n\nP.S. I'm not sure why Steam counted 111 hours on the game. Maybe I once left the game running while I was away.

If you go in thinking of it as a game, you may be disappointed. It is more like a visual novel, with the controls and appearance of an old-school JRPG (it was made using RPG Maker - though unlike many games made with that software, the assets seem largely original, and have a great deal of charm). \n\nSet between a hospital in the \"real\" world and the \"imaginary\" world of Morizora's Forest, the game follows a boy, a patient at the hospital, as he seeks to earn a wish from a legendary spirit - a character from the story book his mother often reads to him. The \"gameplay\", such as is, involves talking to characters, collecting items and solving basic puzzles. The story is roughly divided into 4-5 sections focused on different characters at the hospital, all struggling with different problems. These character-focused sections are very linear, while the parts in between offer a little more freedom to explore.\n\n My favourite aspects of Rakuen are the ways the real and imaginary worlds intersect, to the point where it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. I like how the creator didn't insist on spelling out the nature of reality in the game, instead leaving it open to interpretation. I also think the game earns it own tears, in a way that To The Moon, to which it is often compared (both are made in RPG Maker, and Rakuen's creator did some music for To The Moon) doesn't, in my opinion. \n\nOn the downside, I felt that the limitations of RPG Maker showed in the depictions of the various stories. The characters are all dealing with issues that are very familiar to anyone who's watched network TV over the last 20 years. That's not to say that those issues are too worn-out for use, but the limited scope for depiction in a 2D game with limited animation, relying mainly on written dialogue to convey the story, makes them all feel a little staid. \n\nAlso, as I mentioned before, there isn't much \"game\" to this game. The story is worthwhile, but I feel like I would have had a more enjoyable experience reading this as a picture book (I say picture book, as the art deserves to be seen). While there are some puzzles in the early game, by about midway through, they essentially disappear. The earlier flashback sequences have a few puzzles, but the latter ones purely involve talking to the right character or interacting with the right object to advance the story. I think if you put something in game format, it should at minimum have fun gameplay, or give the player choice in how to approach things, and Rakuen doesn't really try to do either. I also have issues with the ending, but I don't want to leave any spoilers here. \n\nIf gameplay is less important to you than plot, and you like emotion-filled stories and whimsical characters, then I recommend Rakuen. If you're looking for a fun gaming experience, rather than a story book in game form, you should probably look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1598542272, "timestamp_updated": 1664429796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540069699287414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74933759": {"recommendationid": "74933759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198415698961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1603299211}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!\nIt has no battles and you have to find keys and items to unlock new areas and progress the story. \nthe difficulty of the 'puzzles' is quite low, but that allows the story to be the centrepiece !\ni am 3 h in, and i would say, i have at least 6h-10h left (hard to say before finishing it)", "timestamp_created": 1598436403, "timestamp_updated": 1598436403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74921779": {"recommendationid": "74921779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119453763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1598412130}, "language": "english", "review": "owchi me heart", "timestamp_created": 1598412236, "timestamp_updated": 1598412236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74921426": {"recommendationid": "74921426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450106521", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 180, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 649, "last_played": 1622868094}, "language": "spanish", "review": "yo sabia que Caillou tenia cancer", "timestamp_created": 1598411551, "timestamp_updated": 1598411551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507614254951477051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74916749": {"recommendationid": "74916749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127892524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1598401799}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Quiero abrazar a mi mam\u00e1.", "timestamp_created": 1598402939, "timestamp_updated": 1598402939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74901482": {"recommendationid": "74901482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214156617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1598765124}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermosa historia, bellisimo arte y banda sonora, altamente recomendable si te gustan los juegos de exploraci\u00f3n y puzzles.

MAJOR spoilers discussed below.\n\nI'm trying to give it some slack because it is, after all, an indie game, and I do massively respect what Ms. Shigihara and team accomplished here. It's an incredibly charming game with loads of heart\u2014it tries very hard to present the emotions within as honestly and directly as it can, and the result is very real, very human characters. I feel invested in what their fates will be, and whether or not they'll be okay (this is why I liked the mini-dungeons associated with each patient so much, and why I was disappointed they petered out after the first two song quests!)\n\nI must point out, however, that the game sometimes relies too heavily on its emotionality, often leaving the story pace floundering. How is a player to know Kisaburo has died after his quest, when he is simply nowhere to be found afterwards and no one makes mention of this? How did Puchi make her way back to Sue in the hospital, when she was only found in the other world? And, most important to me, why did the boy choose to move on to Rakuen rather than cure his illness, and stay with his mother? What was the point of his journey and everything he learned if he can no longer apply it by the end? Perhaps this latter issue is just me missing the point\u2014I imagine the game is trying to make a point about healing, resting, moving on, etc. But I can't help but notice the little snags in the logistics; they stick out to me like painful little barbs, keeping me from enjoying the game in the emotional way it wants me to\u2014and that I would like.\n\nStill, I'm glad it exists.

I would say, the experiment was more than successful. To get the basics out of the way, much like [i]To the Moon[/i] before it, [i]Rakuen[/i] is ultimately a 16-bit styled RPG-Maker game. It is rather light on gameplay and instead focuses very much on telling not just one, but several interconnected stories.\nThe gameplay is where I would see flaws, as it did at times seem rather disruptive to the experience, when you go from enjoying heavy narrative focus to collecting items and solving switch puzzles to progress towards the next part of the plot. In this sense, the game did at times seem a bit confused as to what it wants to be, a more traditional game or a vehicle for player-driven narrative. This does not actually mar it all that much, but the impression nevertheless stayed with me.\nAs for more technical aspects, the graphics are certainly more than fine. Beautiful portraits for dialogue await, as well as some truly nice animations during the game. And whilst this is certainly aiding the game greatly, the most amazing aspect aside from the plot is the music. And as it should be in this kind of game, the soundtrack is a deeply emotional rollercoaster, written with narrative in mind, which might stay with you long after you are done.\nThis brings us to the actual narrative. A story set in a hospital ward, where the player character is a little boy visited by his mother is not unlikely to have its disheartening moments, no matter the eventual outcome. Without giving away too much, it is a story about finding closure and coming to terms with things, most importantly dealing with loss. A state of loss in one way or another is given for most characters and as you learn more and more about the circumstances of both the current state of the diegetic world, as well as the individual people\u2019s backgrounds and problems you can try to understand and maybe even improve their situation. In this sense it is a very \u201chuman\u201d story, empty as it may sound, a story of empathy and comfort. What makes it interesting for me are the various perspectives, as we constantly switch from a more child-like perspective to adult ones. In addition, the concept of the two worlds, real and fantasy, adds another layer to it all, juxtaposing a real-world version opposed by metaphor-laden fantasy. Or [i]is[/i] it fantasy at all? There is a certain profoundness to be found in the game\u2019s themes and the stories it has to tell.\nBy the way, although by no means required, it is a nice bonus to know a little something of both the Japanese language, as well as Japanese history. I could certainly appreciate the inter-cultural aspects of it all.", "timestamp_created": 1595289404, "timestamp_updated": 1595289404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515987932682037354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72918589": {"recommendationid": "72918589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080490080", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1595111761}, "language": "english", "review": "Rakuen is a game that drew me in with its simplicity and wow'd me with its story.

Not a lot of people knows about this game but i really hope my review could get some people attention. Short story for this game: i bought this game back then at 2017 cuz it looks cool but throughout the story progression it gets way more better. at the end i cried. And now it's how me and my girlfriend get close together, she used to watch me playing this game until i finish it. this game touched her heart and she really enjoyed watching me play, we even cried together at the ending hehe.\n\n[b] Warning might contain spoilers, i will censor the spoiler parts so proceed with your own caution[/b]\n\n[h1] Things i like: [/h1]\n- The Soundtrack:\nIf i'm not mistaken Laura Shigihara is the Music producer for this game, along side with her friends too. But as we all know about Laura, every song that she creates always fits with the game so i'm telling y'all [b] the song is a banger and also very emotional [/b]\n\n- The Characters:\nAs we Progress into the Story we wont just be seeing more humans, we will meet some creatures like it's shown on the Trailer, Leebles. Personally i love them, they look cute. But the main thing is the Character development throughout the story is very impressive.\n\n- The Art:\nI was quite surprised that even a 2D-ish like game would look this beautiful. The Sprites that this game has to offer looks very great too.\n\n- The Story: [b] Warning, Might contain spoiler! [/b]\n[spoiler] The Story,, It's very goddamn Incredible, Emotional, Magnificent. I might be the only one who's overreacting but the amount of deaths in this game is insanely high yet saddening (in a good way). It's not a combat game but the backstory for every each NPC (including your character) has almost at least 1 death,, at the very second right now i could cry remembering what happened to Sue... [/spoiler]\n\n- The Morals From The Game:\nNow i don't want to spoil much with this but if you play the game, you'd understand.\n\n[h1] The Things I dislike: [/h1]\n- The Options Settings:\nIt would be nice to have a small update just for settings, It'd really nice to have an option to lower the in-game volume OR choosing the game resolution! :) \n\n- The Keybinds:\nThe default keybinds are the arrow for movement and for interaction is,, uhh,, i can't remember but it's quite okay. But it'd be if we are able to change the keybinds, especially for the movement parts. Games lately do use W, A, S, D as their movement keys.\n\n- THE SCARINESS AT THE 1st CHAPTER:\nPLS OMG DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT, THE 1st AND 2nd CHAPTER WAS VERY SCARY IF YOU DON'T GET WHAT'S GOING ON AJSDJAHJDS. But i love it nonetheless.\n\n[h1] Rating: [/h1]\nUnfortunately there is nothing that is flawless in this world, every creation has flaws. I love this game the most, It's infact the 1st game that manages to make me cry so i respect you all devs. I rate this game [b] 9.6 [/b]!!!\n\n[b] P.S: [/b] Hi Guys i'd like to thank all of you who takes your time to read this Review this game makes alot of differences on my life, as i said there's always flaw so i sincerely apologize if i made some mistake in this review :). When you do get the game  please do write more reviews and suggest it to other people too! not a lotta people knows about this game.

And having fully experienced/played this game, it definitely shows.\n\nWhat can I say? The gameplay is nice, character designs are great & cute, story arcs are so compelling that some, if not, many people may find themselves relate to in real life. And did I mention the music? Absolutely beautiful, never fails to please me.\n\nAll in all, \"Rakuen\" is such a wonderful game, definitely recommended. If you're into these kinds of stories wherein they have wholesome and emotional substances, then this game is for you. Here's a thought: why not play this game with your family? Would make up for a lovely experience.\n\nBecause of this game, the line \"Keep shining your light.\" has struck on me, such an uplifting message/motto. To be honest, discovering about this game has helped me see the positive outlook of life better. And I just want to say, thank you Laura Shigihara and co. for making and bringing this excellent masterpiece to everyone. Keep up the good work and good luck on future endeavors/projects.

It takes several things i love in a game put them into (what I think is) an absolute masterpiece in storytelling.\nI won't spoil anything, but i'm going to say that if you like playing games for the story, with a little bit of patience (Yes, the puzzles are kinda hard if you like rushing through for the story like me), this game is perfect. Characters are adorable, the art is great (both pixelated and the drawn out characters when they speak). I bought this for around $3, but i would easily say this is worth $10 or more just because of how incredible the games tells you heartbreaking stories for so many characters. Certain ones i think hit harder that others...but man..it's rough, but worth playing. I spent roughly 10 hours of gameplay on this, and im so happy i made the decision to buy this. It's great if you;re not a fan of combat, and there's a dev made walkthrough too which is super helpful, (thank u dev team!!!!) Love this game, go and buy it.

My opinion below is purely subjective, and I believe each person might have a different set of standards: the game is pretty well-made for me.\n\nFor the first couple of minutes, I do admit to not feeling entertained much by the plot. However, as the story progresses, the tipping point being my being introduced to the world of Rakuen, I can't help but be sucked in by the fantastic and magical visual and auditory experience presented in front. I kept on exploring locations, unlocking new collectibles and hours upon hours just pass by without my notice.\n\nStory-wise, as a casual gamer, I feel like the story is good enough to seal the deal. Not spectacular, but it is in no way bad or average even. There are certain moments that pull my heartstrings, though most of the game is just quite chill which is also another thing I like about Rakuen. Suspense is present but only in some portions, and I actually prefer it more that they keep it at a low.\n\nOne con I can think of is that stuttering might frequently occur in parts where a dialogue appears above a character instead of the normal screen-wide box with a character illustration. But it might just be my potato acting up so it's negligible. Another con would be lack of game settings like full screen vs window mode, key re-binding,...

As the composer, Shigi really did a masterful work with the music in this game and the songs will hit your feelings hard and make you weep. This game really shows you how much artistry and mastery can be done with RPG Maker and it really pushed the boundaries of what kind of storytelling can be achieved using the engine.

Combat and party-management of traditional RPGs aren\u2019t found here, however there are puzzles and mini-games well integrated into the story that allow for an enjoyable experience.\n\nStory: \nA boy\u2019s hospital stay soon becomes a journey through a magical parallel world, where he discovers the experiences of his fellow patients and new residents alike, while embracing his own path. \n\nRakuen doesn\u2019t hold its punches when presenting thought provoking themes, some being downright darker than the main premise. Yet each scenario is written beautifully to give the characters, as well as the player, a sense of hope. \n\nMusic: \nTop tier. Incredibly crafted pieces that exert a plethora of emotions--joy, uneasiness, sadness, peace. From atmospheric to heart wrenching. Each piece is seemingly written specifically for each scene to convey the emotions of those moments. Vocally performed songs within scenes absolutely take the cake. \n\nTechnical:\nThe game runs in 640x480 resolution, which can be expanded to full screen with alt+enter. Unfortunately, there are no other means of resizing when in windowed mode. There\u2019s also a lack of an options menu to adjust in-game audio. Lack of d-pad usage while playing with a controller. Joystick inputs can be all over the place. (No run feature, but may have affected pacing)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nPersonally, I recommend new players to go into Rakuen with as little information as possible. If you enjoy story-driven games, you\u2019ll probably enjoy it. (A reason why the story section is short)\n\nI happened to stumble upon one of Laura\u2019s streams several months ago, and the performances had me smiling from ear to ear. Little did I know she composed a number of musical pieces for hit games, such as Plants vs. Zombies, World of Warcraft, To The Moon, and Deltarune. What made me stick around were the various music pieces she performed from her game along with the characters that appeared on screen (Leebles, Saitou-san, Sue/Puchi, and Bud emotes). I knew at some point I had to play Rakuen.\n\nStory rich and filled with character development. Game is relatively simple, but some puzzles require big brain skills. \n\nThis game is a rollercoaster of emotions. It\u2019s got humor, quirky moments, cute characters, dark themes, hit-me-right-in-the-feels feels, atmospheric vibes, spooks.\n\nI can\u2019t say that I related to every story, but there was one word that I found myself steering towards as I reached the game\u2019s conclusion: empathy. I was able to understand each character\u2019s tale as it was presented and take on those emotions secondhand.\n\nOther moments hit me like a brick. \n\nAs someone that was introduced to the characters and music of Rakuen before playing the game, it was a joy to discover their origin. I probably can\u2019t listen to \u201cBuild a Little World with Me\u201d without getting emotional now\u2026\n\nOverall, I loved my experience with Rakuen. Thank you, Laura and co.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1591257567, "timestamp_updated": 1591257567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70266942": {"recommendationid": "70266942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126897866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1121, "last_played": 1591240330}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to miss this game.

You can't fast travel and there is no option to make it easier for the player to travel somewhere they need to go. This becomes a problem because there are so many places available for you, yet you have to slow-walk everywhere. Especially when a lot of the rooms are made to have the longest road possible.\n- You can't skip the scenes. It could be added as an option after finishing the first playthrough, at least.\n- Not being able to skip is one thing, but you also can't let the scenes play themselves while you watch or do something else. It depends on you to keep the conversations going. This was the most annoying part for me at my 2nd playthrough.\n- Mom's tips aren't much helpful in my opinion. She just repeats what you need to do which you can already see in your journal, but not how you need to do it. There are well-written guides so that's not much of a problem.\n\nThe art is so beautiful, the creatures are adorable, the worlds are creatively made, the story is sad but cute, some characters are really fun(ny) to talk to.

Even though I've only played the first ten or so minutes, and I spent most of that time wandering around talking to people, I still feel like I accomplished a lot in that time.\n\nThe game is lovingly-crafted, with so much detail put into making the world as vibrant as possble. Almost everything is interactable, with the few things you can't interact with having an in-story reason, and I must admit that I spent one or two minutes in the main character's hospital bathroom just after the first cutscene where all I was doing was opening and shutting the toilet seat lid  (purely because I was so pleasantly surprised it was actually a thing I could do).\n\nThis is one of the most genuinely beautiful, well-made, well-composed, games that I have played for years and I think it's a game that everyone should play.\n\nBuy Rakuen. Buy the soundtrack. You won't regret it, I promise.\n\nEdit 19/06/20:\nSo... After having completed the game, I can honestly say it is one of the most beautiful, well-done, games I have ever played. Every character is nuanced and has their own unique backstory with their own problems, there's enough hints about the hospital's history that you can figure out what's going on without it being directly stated, and the bittersweet ending is just... god, it's perfect.\nEverything from Sue's backstory on had me audibly breaking down in tears, and I couldn't be happier about that.\nCopy-pasting from a comment I left on Twitter the day I finished: \"Rakuen's ending is so poignant and bittersweet, while still hopeful, and the game's story as a whole is a welcome departure from more recent games where everyone gets a happy ending. You can't save everyone in the real life, and some tragedies are just inevitable. Relationships are messy, illnesses can devastate. But Rakuen will always be beautiful. Thank you, Laura.

Because of this, I expected I would enjoy a game she developed. I also expected an emotional experience, much like listening to her perform. However, I was not truly prepared for Rakuen.\n\nFrom the art, to the music, to the story - this game is a masterpiece. It has impacted me in ways very few stories have. I completed the game a week ago, and I can still feel it. Since then I have watched other people play parts of the game. I have tried to describe it to a family member. I have listened to the soundtrack. Each time, without fail, tears well up. I just cannot get over this game.\n\nRakuen is an emotional experience. However, it is not tears from start to finish. Many parts are joyful or downright hilarious. The game has a quirky sense of humor that had me rolling at times, and incredible characters that will stay with you. You learn to care about these characters and what happens to them, which of course is the key to why the emotional parts are so powerful. Some people may be able to guess what will happen, but many plot points genuinely surprised me. Even for the times where I could correctly predict generally where the story was going, reaching that point was a beautiful journey - and never as clear cut as I expected.\n\nThis game deals with themes of loneliness, loss, and regret. As in life, not everything will turn out the way you may want. However, though loss and regret are themes throughout, I would not describe Rakuen as a tragedy. Rakuen is truly a story of love. Of redemption. And of hope.\n\nI finished the story one week ago.

There were times early in Rakuen where subtle details made me think, \"...Chrono Trigger?\" and it was gratifying to find other details later that made smile and say, \"Chrono Trigger. :)\"  \n\nTo be sure, Rakuen is very much its own game, but its style and presentation feel like a loving tribute to the games that likely inspired a younger Laura to want to make games herself one day.  \n\nAnd in a way, this beautifully exemplifies the core theme of Rakuen \u2013 finding inspiration and hope in the people who love us, and passing those on to others so they can do the same.\n\n---\n\nthemes:\n\nRakuen might be described as \"sad\" or \"a tear-jerker,\" but everything is balanced.  The story, music, character dialogue, and humor all come together to make Rakuen feel like a friend who wants you to see the best in yourself.\n\nIt's a cold night, but Rakuen keeps you company, holding your hand and telling you a story for 10 hours until the sun comes back up.  You can feel it gently squeeze back, as though to say, \"it's okay to be scared; I'm a little scared too, but we're gonna make it through this.\"\n\nReading the description of \"Jump\" from Rakuen's OST on Laura's bandcamp page, going backwards through multiple years of devlogs posts on projectrakuen \u2013 Rakuen becomes less of a game and more an extension of the person who created it.\n\n---\n\nRakuen and me:\n\nRakuen is the realization of every RPG Maker game I'd wanted to make between 2005 and 2011 when I was active on forums of that time.  \n\nRMXP is the reason I started tinkering with programming and dabbling in arranging music, so it was heartwarming to see familiar names in the credits, and truly inspiring to understand that someone had the perseverance to see this kind of game through to completion.\n\nPromotional art in an October 2013 news post on projectrakuen shows that the characters, story, and world were already quite developed by then, which makes the implied effort leading to the eventual May 2017 release all the more palpable.\n\nBy late 2006, I'd been hanging out at creationasylum long enough to see too many projects organize and make progress, only to fall apart within months. The creeping insight into *how much work would be needed* to make a game was discouraging. Seeing project after project drift apart was discouraging.\n\nI'd proposed making a \"short story game\" that would last \"no more than two hours\" and started at least three. Each fell apart; none saw release.  It turns out that games are really difficult and consuming to make. :)\n\nSo, in a way, it's relieving to read Laura write in 2016:\n\n\"Rakuen went through 3 iterations\u2026 at first it was a crafting game, then it became a jrpg, and now it\u2019s an adventure game with point-and-click/room escape style puzzles, Zelda-like dungeons, and some mysteries that revolve around having to talk with the characters.\"\n\nPlaying it, experiencing it, learning more about it \u2013 Rakuen is a triumph.  It tells a story about how we can find hope in others, and then leads by example, suggesting to me that it *is* possible to make a game that tells a story from the heart.\n\nThank you, Laura, for having the passion to see Rakuen through to release.", "timestamp_created": 1589352115, "timestamp_updated": 1589528103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69048702": {"recommendationid": "69048702", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974290515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1496314394}, "language": "english", "review": "(I played through from an earlier build, so my time played isn't accurate.)

The target audience was not readily apparent from the store description.\n\nIf it wasn't meant for children... Oh boy.\n\nNow, it DOES get better. But the first half of the game is a TREMENDOUS slog through mind-numbingly boring gameplay and ham-fisted exposition bombs. It has all the bearings of someone without any experience or skill in either game design or writing. Everything is explained to the minutest detail, and repeated - over, and OVER, again! \n\nThe \"adventuring\" is strictly linear, with zones beyond one or two blocked off by plot markers.\nThe \"puzzles\" can't be really called such, as none of them require any thought whatsoever, with the solutions easily visible either in the very same room(!) or the one right next to it. Be ready for a lot of \"pick up item\" -> \"use item.\"\nThe \"story\" gets delivered as a pile of human interest stories that beg for your empathy, yet delivered in such a flat, superficial way, that it is extremely hard to get attached to any of the characters. There's a complete lack of subtext, suspense, or mystery. Everything is right there on the tin. \n\nAs said, it gets better towards the end, but part of why is less than flattering - it's because the game kind of forgets it's a game. Instead it showers you with extensive in-game cutscenes, with even the illusion of interactivity gone. And this section of the game was a passable story I could listen to while sipping on my tea. But gamewise, there was nothing there.\n\nAll in all, the whole story might've been better presented in a visual novel format, unburdened with the trite and uninspired, even forced, \"game\" elements. Even then, the writing would have required some heavy work to hold my interest, and patience. When the writer stops to explain even their puns - then it's either a game for children, or by one.", "timestamp_created": 1588968725, "timestamp_updated": 1588968725, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482579082250595093", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68797477": {"recommendationid": "68797477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121219133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 954, "last_played": 1588904324}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game so much.

The wholesome approach makes it easy to connect with the characters and their lives, but when it gets down to the important parts, there are enough heart-wrenching moments to put this up with the saddest rpg maker games out there.

I think the singing just makes things awkward and the game would've been fine without it, but characters only do it a few times.

I feel like Kisaburo and Sue got a little cheated in that respect. I think if the long puzzle sections of Gemma and Tony were paired down a bit, then Sue and Kisaburo's stories could be expanded upon.

The game is still non-combat and story-driven, but has  puzzles, hidden areas, and additional secrets that reward your exploration. And while you might not fight monsters head-on, you certainly have to handle dangerous situations at times. It's definitely a game and not just clicking through the text. I really enjoyed that and had a good time finding all the secrets and unlocking extra achievements. \n\nI don't want to spoil any of the story, but needless to say, it is meaningful and poignant. It is a journey worth taking. \n\nAnd as a final note, the music is fantastic! I highly recommend bundling in the soundtrack if you pick up the game.

This comes as no surprise given the creator's involvement in To The Moon, one of the best and most depressing RPG Maker games in history. The only issues I have with Rakuen are some pacing and tonal issues, which are admittedly more profound in the game's first half. If you can get past that (and a few frustrating puzzle sections), the game grows into a much more human and touching narrative. \n\nThe fantasy world is well done and very cutesy. There are lots of memorable characters and moments throughout. For me, the game started to drag a little around the 2nd and 3rd chapter, although the tone and atmosphere did help carry these slower and less interesting story bits. It picks up again in the 4th and 5th chapter and will probably evoke emotions in all but the least-feeling of people. \n\nRakuen is a story about loss and coping, and it's a potent one at that. It suffers from some intermittent \"game problems\" such as pacing, tone and weak puzzles but it's Shigihara's first title and those teething issues can be expected, especially given RPG Maker's limitations.

With a design that is both simple and profound, this combat-free story-driven RPG delivers a beautiful, heart-breaking, and life-affirming experience.\n\nGAMEPLAY/STORY (spoiler-free): The gameplay is designed around the narrative. In general, it's a top-down RPG, but there is no combat system, experience, or party management. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely conflict in-game, but it is masterfully woven in through the story itself and the minigames and puzzles scattered throughout. While the puzzles are relatively simple, they feel right in the game, and there were only a couple very minor moments where I felt lost or wasn't sure how they related to the game as a whole.\n\nThe game world is full of detail, and there are lots of hints alluding to missing pieces in the game environment that are later revealed more clearly throughout the game. Definitely pay attention to the little things here! In my playthrough there were a few key moments where those pieces just fit together and I had realizations, often chilling ones, into what may be happening next. The timing of these hints seemed to fit well with the general plot discovery timeline. The observant may figure out some key plot points, but not so far ahead of the actual reveals that they feel like heavy-handed foreshadowing or take away from the payoff. Even if you do see a few twists coming, there are still plenty of key surprises around the actual characters and the reveals of their experiences. I found the storyline satisfying and complete overall. It left me with the right amount of resolution, questions, and feelings, to make Rakuen something I am unlikely to ever forget. Many people will be able to relate to the tragedy and the hope in their own ways. Despite not sharing the exact experiences of the characters there were a few very emotional moments that hit me due to personal experiences, and I imagine many if not most players have similar stories. I also felt connected to the protagonists and did feel enough of a sense of agency despite the linear nature of the story.\n\nWithout delving into any spoilers, the game is separated into a handful of scenarios around helping different characters in a hospital, going between 'our world' and a vibrant, fanciful parallel world. Throughout this you learn about the characters' pasts, as well as what has happened recently in the world around you. There is a tension between what the twin protagonists (the boy and his mother) know of the recent past and what you as the player don't know. As this resolves, it feeds into the overall storyline, leading to a stunning finish. While overall Rakuen is a rather linear game, this seemed appropriate to the subject material and the storytelling, and helped to drive the pacing. There are additional achievements and side quests in-game that add additional fun and flavor, but are not required to get the impact of the core storyline. As I was livestreaming this, I did not complete all the side material in my first playthrough. I do plan on going back and 100%ing Rakuen on my own because I want to see all the little gems that I might have missed.\n\nMUSIC: Being a game by Laura Shigihara, the music is of course S-tier. There are several vocally performed songs in-game during cutscenes, and motifs throughout the background music. \"Build A Little World With Me\" is an unforgettable track.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n I was fortunate enough to be able to livestream this on Twitch with Laura Shigihara in chat seeing large portions of the playthrough. (However, I was not in any way compelled or compensated to play the game or to write a review.) She exemplifies how much love was poured into the creation of this game, especially through her involvement with the gaming community playing Rakuen. She takes genuine joy of seeing peoples' unique reactions to the game, and I was also able to get many unique tidbits about the development and the game in general. This is the kind of community-building that exemplifies what can be done with indie games. Between Rakuen, Laura's vast catalog of game music, her music stream on Twitch, and her genuine care for the gaming community, I'm definitely going to be looking forward enthusiastically to anything she releases next.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful story-driven RPG that will make you laugh, cry, and think. The only thing I would change about it would be to add a steam achievement around filling up every sink in the game. ;) If you are looking for a deeply emotional experience that overflows with magic and hope even while diving head-on into the gritty and heart-breaking challenges of life and loss, play Rakuen.

'Nuff said.\n\nBut seriously though, this is one of those kinds of games that I consider as an \"experience\". If you know and love the anime \"Violet Evergarden\", then you should be pretty familiar with Rakuen and it's style of storytelling. Rakuen really shines in its various vignettes with the patients of the hospital, who are really great characters in it of themselves. The stories feel natural in the ways they're told (apart from a few plot holes I've noticed but that's more of a nitpick lol), and they really did a good job in making you sympathize with them, no matter if you've had a personal experience with hospitals, diseases, and the like.\n\nThough I do understand that this is probably not for everyone. There is ABSOLUTELY no combat here. The most stressful times gameplay-wise are the timed sequences and obstacle-dodging events that are pretty standard in many RPG Maker works. There is no in-game Settings so you're stuck with some pretty awkward controls (Arrowkeys for movement, esc for opening the menu, no option for WASD movement x.x) but you'll get used to it. \n\nOverall, this is a really important game for us to experience. This game just shows the power of kindness and love in the face of hopelessness and despair, and I believe that's an important message that we need to see for ourselves in our world today.\n\nAnd you get to play as a dog. tenouttaten", "timestamp_created": 1572654798, "timestamp_updated": 1572654844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56098768": {"recommendationid": "56098768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315483653", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113, "last_played": 1573255212}, "language": "english", "review": "I've not completed the game yet, but what I've seen I've really loved.

But the more I played the less that my first opinion stood firm. While the beginning seems a bit childish, the rest of the game-while still cute-has a very ominous and. at some points, creepy tone.  Even when you are talking to cute NPCs and doing friendly quests for the townsfolk, there is this 'what if' feeling hovering over your head. Even though I am not even close to finishing, I can't shake the feeling that the ending won't be all that happy. This just makes the game even more addicting, and I want to be proven wrong so bad. The game also does a really good job with addressing real life issues, which is something I wasn't expecting but really like.

That's what I took from the puzzle elements that unlock new tools, gifts, memories, & doors for exploration & closure. \n\nWhat may be overlooked is the significance of tragedy stemming from real-world events such as the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, tsunami, & Fukushima nuclear plant disaster. The narrative not only cares for the spiritual wellness of the characters, but also of the natural & structural environments, which are highly interconnected. I do wish this connection was made more explicit in the \"real\" world rather than only in Morizora's fantasy realm. While the game plays into some tropes about maintaining \"hope\" & resisting submersion in anger/grief, I think there's some redemption in treating suffering on both individual & systemic levels. \n\nDefinitely worth your time if you're patient to appreciate the enchanting atmosphere, become intimate with characters, remain thoughtful about the story that isn't always straightforward/single-note, & get deep into bittersweet feels.", "timestamp_created": 1569189780, "timestamp_updated": 1569189780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538043498992919922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55225305": {"recommendationid": "55225305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220030719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1569124384}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game. \nLoved every second of it. \nTeared up a bit, but that's ok. \n\n200/10 would experience salt in my eyes again.", "timestamp_created": 1569124590, "timestamp_updated": 1575063972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55220856": {"recommendationid": "55220856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440324245", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1569096608}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really a masterpiece for me.

It is simple in that most of the puzzle/challenge comes from figuring out where to go to do certain things. I didn't feel that this detracts from the gameplay since the game is more focused on the characters and the mood than challenge. I view the other world as either taking place place inside the boy's mind or at least as a metaphor for his outlook on the world, so it fits that it would be challenging on a kid's level. The gameplay is simple, but the story is layered. As I said, it is a depiction of the boy's mind and pieces each character's backstory/situation together as you go. Parts of it have to be interrupted rather than being stated directly, which I found fitting since, again you are seeing things from the boy's perspective even in these memories. It is emotional. I read reviews that mentioned crying over this game before I started, so I kept waiting for it to happen. After the first character arc, I was thinking \"okay, I can see why you might cry but I probably won't.\" Well then I was this close to tearing up at the second character arc.Then at the final last hour stretch I cried 4 times. Of course, the game throws humor in there as well. I love Sugar Baby. Speaking of creatures, they are so silly, cute, and original.

With a story so rich in depth and a setting so vast in scope, I am sure this will be the best game I will ever play. I don't mean that it is as thrilling as, say, an FPS game or a horror RPG, or that the production quality will blow your screen and speakers away. It is not that kind of game. It offers what most entertaining games do not: a sincere story told with love and detail, and you can feel it in every pixel from the beginning. If I have to summarize the game, it is like a great Disney movie in the form of an interactive visual novel.\n\nThere is so much effort put into the art of the game that even after I explored most of the maps, I still managed to feel lost because no two maps have the same layout, and that is a good thing. With so much detail put into the design of the maps and the vast amount of NPCs and interactive objects, it made me feel like I was there, living in that world. The design and colours are so surreal that it brings a whole new level of beauty to 2D pixel art. Many times I could not believe the level of detail that went into the map designs. I could go on and on, but nothing anyone can say will be better than experiencing it for real. \n\nThe elevating element of the game is the MUSIC. Oh boy. The music of 'Rakuen' cannot be simply referred to as BGM. It is so beautifully composed and well crafted that it transcends the barrier of in-game music to a legitimate listening experience. Many game soundtracks really sound like a game soundtrack (with heavy/suspenseful beats signifying an intense moment, or a repetitive tune that is really just a background filler), but this game's soundtrack sounds like it was created for an album release possibly titled 'Relaxing Music from Nature and Beyond' and then licensed for use in this game. The music is so rich with so many elements that it just BEGS to be experienced in the highest quality possible, and even better, in 5.1 surround (it doesn't exist, sadly). \n\nMy only real issue with the gameplay (which is really only just a trifle), is that many of the puzzles/challenges are not necessarily related to the story. They appear to be present as mere obstacles rather than to provide additional context or thematic enhancements to the story. However, one has to be reminded that they are playing this game (mostly) through the eyes of a child on an adventure and without spoiling anything, I would say let your imagination provide context to where there seem none and it will be a lot more fun. And also, I wish the character could move just a little bit faster because some maps are really huge and it felt like quite a chore at times to move from place to place.\n\nDo not let my issues as stated above prevent you from experiencing this unbelievably wholesome game. Its sincere depiction of feelings and truth separates it from the bulk, and its never-ending creativity in character designs and stories make it an experience impossible to forget. It is heartwarming and tear-jerking even for some (or most). The main characters are extremely lovable as well as some of the side characters. The game developers deserve every praise for the extra mile taken to provide an extremely meaningful experience that is 'Rakuen', and what a rakuen (paradise) it is!", "timestamp_created": 1565984068, "timestamp_updated": 1565984740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54641014": {"recommendationid": "54641014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143619354", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 787, "last_played": 1565922668}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible game with charming characters that will melt your heart and a storyline that's going to break you and make you cry like a baby, i loved every minute of this game, very straightfoward with good puzzles and an amazing soundtrack the music makes it even greater.

Ya boi cried real good. So let's start this review.\n\nThere is no combat and I think it worked great for the game. All it is is walking around and talking to people and interacting with objects and solving puzzles. There's a lot you have to interact with to solve some of the puzzles which was annoying at first, but I began to enjoy it as every character you talked to was fun, and you found out things about the world through interacting with other objects. The soundtrack is also great. I know Laura Shigihara did songs for the game \"To The Moon\" and also the \"Plants vs Zombies\" soundtrack. I had just coincidentally played plants vs zombies very recently before playing this and in some of the songs you can see the similarity in the sound since they're both done by Laura. So that being said it hit all the playful and emotional spots it needed to hit. There are songs with vocals as well that are just so cute and heart warming. As said before all the characters are a lot of fun as well. I really really liked the art. It was very bright and the characters full of personality and life along with nice high quality portraits of important characters when you talk to them like the boy or his mom. Who are both amazing characters.\n\nNow onto the story. Hot dang it made me feel some things. I'm not sure if anyone will relate to this feeling, but after watching a really good slice of anime even though you cried, which I'll reiterate that I definitly cried, you still feel really good after like you've been cleansed. After playing I just sorta floated around my house thinking about it cause it gave me such a light and really happy feeling like I wanted to help people, since that's what you do the entire game. It made me feel sympathy and compassion for others and an overall warm feeling. I've discussed this feeling with a friend about feeling like that after a really good slice of life anime and they know what I'm talking about so if you do I hope this part at least sells it. Anywho, the story is you're a kid in a hospital who opens a door to a different world that takes place in his favorite book, Rakuen, and he's trying to get the guardian of the forest to grant him a wish. You go through a journey of seeing the stories of others and helping them. Covers lots of themes like racism and parenting and just a lot of love. I'm not one for forced positivity, but I accepted the childish aura of the game and that made me enjoy it a lot.\n\nI've rambled enough. In summary, buy the game. It's fun, great story, great characters, great art, great soundtrack, will make you cry and feel emotions. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1562521261, "timestamp_updated": 1562521261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57132798433303833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53928296": {"recommendationid": "53928296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019338009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 556, "last_played": 1562511506}, "language": "english", "review": "What a game to experience.
