The combat allows you to find creative solutions to difficult packs of enemies. Planning battles and beating difficult enemies feels rewarding. There are tons of interesting and memorable characters.\n\nSome nitpicks I have with it. I find the banter between companions to be annoying. There are menial side-quests that belong in MMOs and not a game like this.

I played it again not too long ago and still loved it, but when it came out I was truly in awe. Add to this the difficulty and map building was spot on.  The acting and characters really took this to heights I doubt we will ever see again. \n\nBack when this came out my grandpa got me this game, I was young and never understood it and it was too hard for me to complete. It took almost 4 years before I beat the story, it was somber but I felt I did what was right, it made me cry but I felt like I had accomplished something and made my grandpa proud.\n\nThis was the first game that I found truly immersive. I was a bit sad when the game ended, not because of the story, but because I missed the characters and the relationships the game built / let me build. Morrigan to me is easily in the top characters of all time in terms of voice acting and back story. Wish we could have another masterpiece like this again.\n\nEvery time I replay this game I find something new that makes the game even more fun and while terrible gaming skills have never allowed me to play anything other than easy mode... I will get there one day. There is so much replayability value I think I\u2019ve beat Origins like 6 times if not more now.\n\nOrigins follows a main story that builds off of the various areas you explore. The areas you go into each have their own plot going on, with usually certain aspects of lore or world-related issues that are really engaging. Plus a lot of the sidequests are related to the story of the area and that really gives a feeling that at all times you're engaging with the story directly instead of doing quests for quests' sake.\n\nDAO might be lacking in graphics and gameplay mechanics nowadays, especially the combat, but makes up for it significantly through the narrative. It feels like every choice you make has effects on the story you play, and depending on which origin you choose while creating your character, certain points in the story will have much more impact on you than others. \n\nThe story it\u2019s way darker in the social aspects of this world and the brutality of it. DAO explores more heavy themes like rape, racism and etc. Themes that got diluted in later games for more epic adventure things. The story had a lot of impact on me, especially with the way it's connected to your character's past as there's a lot of roleplay ability and nuance to your main character.\n\nI thought for sure this game was going to redefine the genre and usher in a new era. But alas all we got was one game. It was supposed to be the return of Bioware\u2019s Golden Era. After Origins, they had everything they needed to make a bigger, better sequel. A modern Baldur\u2019s Gate 2, only in 3D! Such a shame all that potential was squandered.\n\nDAO is very much an old school RPG, If you want a narrative driven RPG with choices that further impact choices, with secret ways around conflicts you never knew about, with asstons of content, dragon age is the game for you. Sure, the game hasn't aged perfectly in ALL aspects, but the story, the characters and the relationships between those characters is absolutely solid and still worth your time.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1700488993, "timestamp_updated": 1700488993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668306827545166016", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150467257": {"recommendationid": "150467257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163289026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1250, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1700676222}, "language": "english", "review": "this is whats missing to today's rpg story-rich games (except bg3).", "timestamp_created": 1700446284, "timestamp_updated": 1700446284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150466068": {"recommendationid": "150466068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034667293", "num_games_owned": 2754, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1700444393}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Estaria bueno sino se crasheara, tal vez sea por w11 o por grafica amd.", "timestamp_created": 1700444430, "timestamp_updated": 1700444430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512499988079071045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150455534": {"recommendationid": "150455534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014586771", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 481, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1700432594}, "language": "english", "review": "\nGame crashes constantly.

That's all just one big multifaceted thing, but it counts for a lot; some 80% of my reason for playing this game fits within that one sentence.  \n\nThe game's flaws are legion, but most of them are effectively nitpicks, like the fact that there are a bunch of background-detail objects rendered in the game which only ever serve as decorations, when many of them logically could have been usable.  The significant flaws include an overly complected combat system, where many of the numerous abilities that you have to micromanage for optimal performance are rather petty adjustments to an inherently uninteresting swords-and-bows melee default; only mage characters are terribly enjoyable to play, and these are often just stuck healing the \"tank\" who prevents them from being stabbed, up until they gain access to the big high-level spells which allow them to utterly trivialize the frontline combatants, while possibly also killing them with friendly fire.  \n\nThe other big flaw is that inventory management is a fairly punishing process, with characters constantly unable to pick up loot unless they discard previously collected items, because you go for long periods of time not being able to find anyone you can sell your useless junk to, and are only allowed to carry a fairly tiny quantity of gear despite constantly being flooded with marginally-useful trinkets.  (The Ultimate Edition kind of adds to that problem by flooding you with Feastday Gifts and a few promo items, which are irreplaceable if sold, but onerous to haul around and impossible to store - the game badly needed an equivalent to Diablo's \"stash\" concept).\n\nBut for all that it has a ton of problems, some of which are big ones, DAO nonetheless remains an absolutely amazing interactive story, whose unnecessarily difficult combat limits your ability to progress efficiently through the plot, but also really makes you feel the apocalyptic impact of the fearsome events your characters are undergoing.  While certainly not light and fluffy \"popcorn\" entertainment, which you can use to decompress after a long day at work, Dragon Age remains an experience which every fan of the Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and other such fantasy epics MUST experience at least one time in their life.  Set the difficulty to easy, save your game often, and use a walkthrough if necessary, so you don't struggle too much...but live the Grey Warden's journey once or thrice or six times, so you can appreciate the magnificent setting this work's writers not only gave birth to, but realized in such depth and fullness that only Peter Jackson can boast of having done a better job.",

That is, the ones who:\n- played and enjoyed similar party-based RPGs of that era like Baldur's Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Drakensang: The Dark Eye;\n- never played DA:O but are still considering it because everyone around keeps telling them that it was the best of the series.\n\nFirst of all, you might want to install a mod called \"FtG UI Mod\". This was literally the first thing I went looking for after playing the game for 15 minutes. The reasons:\n- someone decided to put cutscene/dialogue subtitles on top of the screen while keeping the dialogue choices at the bottom;\n- most fonts are way too small for my bad eyesight.\n\n[b]The Good[/b]\n\n- [b]Character Backgrounds aka Origin Stories.[/b] This is one of the greatest unique features of DA:O. When you create your main character before the game, you choose a background matching your class and race. Unlike so many other games, which only use this for flavor and stat bonuses, DA:O gives you a completely unique playable prologue (solid 2-3 hours of gameplay if you don't rush). It establishes your place in the game world and relations with other characters which you'll meet later in the story. There are 6 \"origins\", and almost all are done extremely well. I took the time to play through all of them after finishing the game, and was very satisfied with most. I only consider the Dalish Elf origin \"weak\".\n\n- [b]Main Story.[/b] Technically it is a standard \"save the world from evil\" fantasy. However, it is executed extremely well. Most of the game consists of doing 4 \"big main quests\" - but you can do them in any order (or mix and match). Each of these 4 directions is an \"epic story\" in its own right, complete with secrets and settings very different from the others. A couple of them intersect, so you might have to interrupt a quest to finish the other one if you want the \"best\" solution (but there is nothing to stop you from going for another one).\n\n- [b]Cutscenes.[/b] This was one of the first Bioware games (right after the first Mass Effect) to invest a lot in the \"cinematic\" feeling for everything that happens. While most of this game's 3D visuals definitely didn't age well, the characters still look great. Facial animations may be weak by today's standards (to the point of being completely unnoticable in so many places where you'd expect them), but the narrative delivery as a whole is top-notch.\n\n- [b]Companions.[/b] Just as one would expect from a Bioware game after BG2, your party will have  good number of unique and memorable characters with extensive dialogues, opinions on things you do (some may attack or leave if you do something they can't tolerate), lots of banter between each other and, of course, romance. There's also a relationship system which is a bit awkward/shallow because it is more affected by gifts rather than by your deeds and words. Also, one of the DLCs included in the Ultimate Edition provides you with a ton of FREE companion-specific gifts with insanely huge bonuses, meaning that you can start and, ahem, \"complete\" a romance on your very first camping night in the game, complete with the dialogue implying that you know each other for a long time already... Anyway, companions in DA:O are awesome. Some also take on major roles in the story.\n\n- [b]Combat.[/b] It is a classic RTWP party game. DA:O uses a custom system with quite a lot of spells and talents to choose from for each character class (+ unlockable specializations). All that you learn is available at the same time (no \"spell slots\" like in D&D, just plain cooldowns) and there are things like \"sustained abilities\" (togglable passives which cost you a portion of you max mana/stamina). There is also an innovation called \"tactics\", which is a skill allowing you to set up your own AI rules for each character. It's a bit hard to get into at first (especially if you don't really want to), not as flexible as I'd like it to be, but it's good enough to automate common actions like healing or stacking debuffs on a boss. This is the first RTWP game which I played without disabling party AI completely, and it was very enjoyable. I just wish some newer RTWP RPGs would take a hint and expand on this idea.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\n- [b]Side quests.[/b] I am frankly not sure how Bioware got away with it, but 100% of non-story side quests in the base game are either dumb fetch/kill missions, or errands requiring you to find and click something in a 5-6 different locations (thus taking most of the game to complete, but providing no fun or challenge whatsoever). What's worse, they are all given by generic stationary \"mission board\" NPCs.\n\n- [b]Premium cut content.[/b] It's not that relevant now that Ultimate Edition has it all, but I recall some release-day controversy over the cut content sold separately by putting \"bait\" NPCs in the base game, nagging you to buy a DLC. In fact, the only \"proper\" side quests in the game are part of such DLCs, and it feels weird even when no one is nagging to buy them.\n\n- [b]Crafting.[/b] Herbalism, poison-making, trap-making skills are dull, unnecessary and, worst of all, designed to be money sinks, not \"enablers\". Any \"advanced\" ingredients can only be bought and they are EXPENSIVE (as are the recipes). Crafting a potion in DA:O costs more than buying it from a vendor; it's just that the ready-made potions are limited in stock, while ingredients aren't. However, there's enough of everything in the loot, so you are better off saving your gold for some unique items instead. You might occasionally want to craft the weakest 2 levels of healing/mana potions, but that's it.\n\n- [b]Difficulty.[/b] I played on \"hard\", which is in fact \"normal\" for any RPG veteran. That much is obvious from its description, since \"hard\" is the first level with full friendly fire (cheese your way through the game by spamming fireballs/infernos without hurting your own party? no thanks). Only a few boss fights provided a decent challenge for me. In the Awakening expansion (which adds a lot of cool new talents and skills), it went even further to feeling like \"easy\": most of the fights barely needed any pausing or ability management, even the \"boss\" enemies simply died in seconds). Perhaps I should have tried \"nightmare\"... However, there's one specific DLC campaign - Golems of Angarrak - which is so damn hardcore (mostly due to awful party composition) that I actually had to resort to disabling friendly fire just to finish the final battle.\n\n- [b]Inventory limit.[/b] You inventory is shared by all party (individual characters only have equipment slots), and is very limited, considering amount of unique items in game which you don't want to just sell. The limit can be expanded several times by buying backpacks, but that's it. Worst part: there is no storage in the base game! You can get a chest from one of the \"premium\" quests, and even that will be located in a remote location instead of your camp. There's another chest in Awakening, but it also has a limit - and it does NOT share contents with the old one, so you'll lose everything that wasn't on you at the end of the base story.\n\n- [b]Glitches and crashes.[/b] This game is pretty old and its tech didn't age well. I've had a lot of crashes. Most went away when I lowered the texture quality, but they still happened, so save often. Sometimes the glitches are persistent and keep crashing you in the same place or even on load. Multiple restarts and setting changes usually help, though.\n\n[b]Conclusions[/b]\n\nThis is one of the best classic RPGs worth playing if you never did. I don't feel that it's Bioware's best - it's not a \"milestone\" like BG2 was, and it will certainly be hard to enjoy if you've already seen Larian's BG3 (I played DA:O right before that, which probably \"saved\" me). Still, it is a great (if somewhat flawed) game which still has something to teach the today's developers.", "timestamp_created": 1699709533, "timestamp_updated": 1700262481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149923624": {"recommendationid": "149923624", "author": {"steamid": "76561199030981071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1126, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1700155440}, "language": "english", "review": "good so far", "timestamp_created": 1699697602, "timestamp_updated": 1699697602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149918108": {"recommendationid": "149918108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378098108", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1749, "last_played": 1615596209}, "language": "english", "review": "Great!", "timestamp_created": 1699688974, "timestamp_updated": 1699688974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149915103": {"recommendationid": "149915103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004430344", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1392492982}, "language": "english", "review": "The game that started the trust issues with mages in feathered/furred shoulder pads.\n\nENCHANTMENT!", "timestamp_created": 1699684080, "timestamp_updated": 1699684080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149896381": {"recommendationid": "149896381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052613104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 282, "playtime_at_review": 9268, "last_played": 1699784077}, "language": "english", "review": "A true classic by now, still holds true all these years later.", "timestamp_created": 1699656115, "timestamp_updated": 1699656115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149853828": {"recommendationid": "149853828", "author": {"steamid": "76561199145060287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3963, "last_played": 1699242886}, "language": "english", "review": "ever since i played Dragon age & Mass effect trilogy i have been in love with games that are similar to both of these amazing franchises. i am very grateful to have experienced such story's.", "timestamp_created": 1699600516, "timestamp_updated": 1699600516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149851120": {"recommendationid": "149851120", "author": {"steamid": "76561199019520691", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1486, "playtime_at_review": 3653, "last_played": 1700790909}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're up for a challenging, strategy-based game with action, then this game is for you.

Better described as one of Bioware\u2019s Best.\nIn typical old fashion, the Player will be lead through a giant and very detailed Gameworld to explore, to interact and to experience Adventures while making decisions that affect various Elements and the Outcome of the Story.\n\nRight at the beginning there is a choice to be made that also has an effect on how the Game will start and how the Player Character gets treated during the Playthrough and furthermore, which Skills a Player can obtain by leveling up after earning EXP in a lot of Combats against Hords of Enemies.\nAnd to fight them, the Game also offers Companions to recruit, to equip, to command during the Adventures and to have dialogues with to learn more about them and their Backstories.\n\nThe Game\u2019s absolute strength is definitely on how well it delivers on the Roleplay department and while it surely has a Main-Story the Player has to follow it is still up to them on how to handle the Situation and to be who they want to be. To build their own Character instead of having to *help a specific Person* on their Journey.\nAlso the Combat is a huge Plus for it to let Players control an entire Team of Companions, but also to set them up so they can act on their own as well if preferred.\nAnd also to mention the huge Fantasy-World that is filled with lots of Story-Elements to explore.\n\nSadly there are also some weak Spots to mention for this Game and in Dragon Age\u2019s Case its the Moments where the Main-Story has Points of no Return that aren\u2019t so well pointed out during the Adventure. What sometimes can leave the bitter Taste of having to revert back to an older Safe to complete Side-Quests that otherwise would have gone lost.\nAlso there are some Balancing-Problems with specific Areas and Enemies from Time to Time that can lead to instant-Deaths of Characters in Combats when an Enemy all of a sudden grabs a Party member to kill them via Animation.\n\nI recommend this Game to Players who like a good Fantasy RPG and who also want to explore a huge Gameworld.\n---------------------------------\n[h3]Points i give this Game (average Points 8,46 / 10):[/h3]\n8,2 / 10 Graphic (Old, but for the Time of Release very well made)\n8 / 10 Art-Style (Different Locations are well detailed to give a unique vibe to them and have a lot of Assets to be explored)\n7,3 / 10 Atmosphere (Major Locations have the perfect Atmosphere for the Story, some Side-Locations tho feel generic)\n8,5 / 10 Gameplay (Easy to learn Gameplay. Gives Players a lots of Ways to handle Things, including Combat and the choice of Companions)\n9,2 / 10 Main-Story (Definitly the strongest Part of the Game that drives the Motivation over all)\n9 / 10 Side-Story (Lots of Side-Stories to explore as well, but some sadly don\u2019t feel so impactfull as others and at some Points of Main-Story progress could get lost if not finished first)\n8 / 10 Characters (Many Unique Characters to meet and talk to that really fit perfectly into the Stories)\n9,5 / 10 Soundtracks (Well implemented Soundtracks. Soundtracks should always be used to support the Atmosphere of scenes in Games.)\n\n*Info (Ultimate Edition): The exact same Thing as the regular Edition with all DLCs).

As the difficulty progresses your party becomes stronger and you more skilled. Theres the dynamic of using who's right in your party, and maintaining relationships with your party (even romantic ones). \n\nTheres so many playstyles you could choose for your character. Just one class has 4 different sword styles, and 4 specializations. I havent played Rogue or Mage yet but they have a lot of unique stuff too. Theres also different races and circumstances you could be born into, and within that a lot of choices that could differentiate even similar made characters. \n\nTheres a complex world full of everything you could want.

I did originally play it on PlayStation and it did leave such an impression that I find myself coming back to it today. In terms of graphics there is no way it could compete with modern titles but I think there is something special/charming about style and the slight chunkiness in animation. The story is straightforward and isn't ground breaking by any means but it is handled with a fineness and care that make it a really enjoyable experience. The companions that accompany you on your journey are well fleshed out and there is a wide enough range of personalities that compliment different types of play throughs and just as a warning I will say the romance sex scenes are really awkward. The combat I found can become quite repetitive, especially on higher difficulties as engagements often require similar tactics to win but winning an engagement on nightmare difficulty is rewarding enough to make the repetition worth it.

Yes, you can all grab the torches and pitchforks now. But it is what it is.\n\nThe side-missions are as BORING as they could ever be. The combat, although interesting, has not aged well in any single way and is really frustrating to play at the current day and age. It's serviceable, but supbar. It's not as \"deep\" and \"tactical\" as some people say. Far from it, even on Nightmare the game is not challenging in a tactical way. There are a bazillion enemies in each area and it is just clunky, cumbersome and janky to fight hordes. The \"difficulty\" comes from the damage modifiers and such. \n\nWITH ALL THAT SAID, I still recommend this game strongly. Even with the aforementioned flaws and others not cited here, this game is really fun, has a nice story and the followers are spectacular. Having Morrigan and Alistair on the party is always amazing, their banter is really funny. The world building and the lore is absolutely top notch, for those who like to read codex entries and learn more about the setting, this is a prime example of lorebuilding in a game. The world and lore are nice, the characters are good and the story is enjoyable - for an RPG these are necessary things to succeed, and DA:O hits the spot on all of them.\n\nPlaying this game again after a long while is being hella fun.

The third-person combat felt responsive and impactful like Gears of War, yet the Sci-fi epic also provided a heavy dose of atmosphere, world-class acting performances, and emotion which pushed the critically acclaimed sequel into \u2018best ever\u2019 discussions. DA:O, a spiritual successor to Baldur\u2019s Gate, therefore had some streamlining to do. While the concept of a tactical, point-and-click cRPG still retained a diehard audience, if Bioware were to capitalise on their opportunity to become a truly mainstream developer, they would need to find a compromise.\n\nThe idea of modernising a title\u2019s systems to adjust well to a console audience has always carried significant baggage. Duds like Deus Ex: Invisible War (2003) still plagued people\u2019s minds, but I think in 2023 we\u2019re more open to the positive benefits this can bring. Writing can be rich in lore and detail, but with tact and editing, can still be direct enough to be comprehensible to new players. I\u2019ve always been a child of Star Wars over Lord of The Rings, and so when I picked up DA:O on 360 I was the game\u2019s precise target demographic. Someone who needed a bit of quality-of-life features, an accessible UI, and perhaps some rough edges polished. \n\nDA:O represents an extraordinarily successful transition to this new audience. The fantasy world requires no additional explanation or experience with tabletop board games; there\u2019s a healthy dose of Game of Thrones-style sex and violence to liven things up, and trailers adorned with Marilyn Manson music. In most areas, this is a runaway improvement: DA:O features high-quality actors and actresses to narrate the adventure, and players can\u2019t unforgivingly soft-lock themselves into underpowered builds.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate and Planescape Torment credited themselves with hundreds of potential consequences for every action taken by the player. DA:O is more limited in scope, but provides full voice acting for every character. My favourite is the Grand Oak, a walking tree who speaks solely in rhyme and explores some of the forest\u2019s lore:\n\n[i] \u201cElves planted the seeds, raised the forest, saw to its needs\u201d [/i]\n\nDA:O\u2019s combat initially served me some humble pie. My Rogue character was repeatedly slaughtered during the first main story beat outside the prologue, causing me to completely re-think my approach. The game prefers you put all your eggs in one basket for each party member, and focus on two skill trees per companion. For example: a basic setup I found to work included one heavily armoured tank to absorb hits and distract the enemy; two mages to dish out damage; and a rogue to set traps, unlock chests and pass speech checks. From this setup, all companions served their use \u2013 however the rogue did feel noticeably less useful outside of dialogue.\n\nThe biggest drawback I found with DA:O was extensive performance and stability issues on PC. Out the box, Dragon Age limits itself to 4GB of RAM which causes frequent crashing as its systems overload itself. This is most apparent in the dense city of Denerim, but can occur in larger dungeons all the same. Fixes can be found in external launchers and patchers, but I still experienced issues. The game also requires tweaking for 1440p, not only to prevent cutting off UI elements, but also to make text legible. For this, I used the \u2018FtG UI Mod - More Readable Fonts and UI\u2019 plugin which fixed all these issues.\n\nTechnical issues aside, Dragon Age: Origins is a high-quality, well-acted and beautifully crafted world. I didn\u2019t find it quite as compelling as Mass Effect, but it did provide a bigger sandbox and more content (and mod support!). If you\u2019re looking to get into point-and-click cRPGs, this is a solid stepping stone before plunging into the older, more inaccessible classics of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1697209848, "timestamp_updated": 1697209848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148131950": {"recommendationid": "148131950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197615742", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 15306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15253, "last_played": 1697475376}, "language": "english", "review": "To this day still one of my favorite games of all time.\n Only problem with the pc version is you def want to get one of the fix mods that people have made or else it might ruin your experience but I never had any issues when I played on 360.\nOtherwise yes this is one of the greats.", "timestamp_created": 1697203744, "timestamp_updated": 1697203744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148106034": {"recommendationid": "148106034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144811717", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4032, "last_played": 1698823053}, "language": "english", "review": "To peace, vigilance; to war, victory; to death, sacrifice!", "timestamp_created": 1697156161, "timestamp_updated": 1697156161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148077724": {"recommendationid": "148077724", "author": {"steamid": "76561199183508366", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3408, "last_played": 1697126373}, "language": "english", "review": "Best DA game in the entire series.

The DLC's were pretty weak to me, but they are short and linear and add a little bit of worldbuilding. except for the secondary campaign, which is more like the main campaign, but way less expansive, much weaker dialogue and story, but still enjoyable and some nice touches that reflect your choices from the main campaign.\nThe main campaign can easily give you 60 to 80 hours of enjoyment, depending on how much you talk to others and read quest related codices.\n\n[h2]Combat[/h2]\nI don't have much to say on combat, I really liked it, but its mostly going to be personal preference I think.\nthe system is pretty deep, and can feel clunky if you don't try to understand it, but once you start to get the hang of it, it can feel very rewarding (experiment with the tactics system).\n\nDespite having to mod it and weaker DLC (also Fuck EA). It seems like a pretty good deal to me when the game sells at 15% of the price during sales.\n\n[h3]mods[/h3]\nI first followed the steps in this video, it has 2 download links for stuff you need\nhttps://youtu.be/yRopnU5efZY?list=LL\n\nI won't post links, you can find them all on nexusmods [b]REMEMBER TO READ THE DESCRIPTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL THEM AND CHECK FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER MODS[/b]:\n- DAO-Modmanager\n- Qwinn's Ultimate DAO Fixpack v3.52 (massive bug fix pack)\n- Awakening Fixes and Tweaks (same but for DLC)\n- FtG UI Mod - More Readable Fonts and UI (if you play on higher resolutions)\n- Theta HD (fixes a ton of textures that get stretched out on higher resolutions while remaining vanilla)\n- white teeth (unless you like brown teeth)\n- No Helmet Hack (only if you want to see your characters faces. helmets automatically disappear during dialogue and cutscenes, this mod also disables helmets during normal play)\n\nthese next mods were not active during my first run. however I intend to replay it with these mods active\n- Dialogue Tweaks\n- ZDF Dialog Fix\nfrom my understanding, they restore a lot of missing voice lines and reactions from your companions", "timestamp_created": 1696506107, "timestamp_updated": 1696506865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147659432": {"recommendationid": "147659432", "author": {"steamid": "76561199061148390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1696476172}, "language": "spanish", "review": "god", "timestamp_created": 1696476207, "timestamp_updated": 1696476207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147658293": {"recommendationid": "147658293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093832733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5624, "last_played": 1696642013}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVE IT", "timestamp_created": 1696474144, "timestamp_updated": 1696474144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147652607": {"recommendationid": "147652607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272445380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1696885155}, "language": "english", "review": "only issue is the the dlc does not work", "timestamp_created": 1696464038, "timestamp_updated": 1696464038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147645356": {"recommendationid": "147645356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261676952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3578, "last_played": 1696450479}, "language": "english", "review": "Great storyline with actual meaningful choices.

However let`s review some its problems and how to tackle them IF you buy the game. \n\nThe first thing you need is patience and a good quick save finger.\n\nGet ready for some annoying crashes = save often and do new saves instead of saving over old ones. It crashes in the base game more often than in the dlc`s, and the really problematic area is Denerim. The game might crash as you enter the tavern or a back alley, and the saves you make can be corrupt often. The best i could do was to clear all possible missions before i went to Denerim, then clear all available missions left on one go and hope it does not crash when i leave the city. If that happens, your best bet is a saved game near the situation you played. Denerim saves mid-story are always volatile to crash. The endgame in Denerim is different; i suffered no crashes there.\n\nYou will recognize the probability of a crash ( not always guaranteed though ) when you see meshes distorting ( armors of the people you talk to, blood puddles under enemies you have slain.  In Denerim area this happens more often than anywhere else, but also other areas are affected by the bug sometimes.\n\nOther than Denerim, there are some issues with the Witch Hunt and Darkspawn Chronicles DLC`s. The Golems of Amgarrak, Lelianas Song, and the Awakening pretty much worked without crashes, although the usual bugs occurred ( blood pool mesh squares and the such ).\n\nIn WItch Hunt, frequent crashes and bugs in overall graphics, such as flickering of meshes and disappeared mission trackers. \n\nIn Darkspawn Chronicles i cannot touch the recruit i am supposed to have in my army to continue the quest, so the DLC is pretty much useless. This same bug is in the base game in the downloaded content of Warden`s Keep, where in the end (SPOILER ALERT ! )you are supposed to fight a bunch of enemies that a cooperating mage  lets in to the room after you speak with him. When you do this, the mage just walks a few steps to the side and the quest does not continue at all. Nothing you can do.\n\nAll in all the game has a lot of content and if you can keep you interest despite these bugs then buy it. Otherwise i would suggest not to touch the steam version, but to get it on console or try the Origin version ( unsure if it has the same bugs ).", "timestamp_created": 1696329053, "timestamp_updated": 1696329053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469639480113983154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147542907": {"recommendationid": "147542907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091188225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1696530005}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es un clasico y muy entretenido si te gustan los juegos de rol con opciones multiple de dialgo y peleas coordinadas!", "timestamp_created": 1696306042, "timestamp_updated": 1696306042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147539454": {"recommendationid": "147539454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030334811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3072, "last_played": 1698008711}, "language": "english", "review": "Dragon Age: Origins is one of the greatest games ever made.

For example if you play a human noble, the main will get free dog companion. So if you set it to use the HOWL skill when party member is flanked/clustered by said number of enemies as per option it will crash due to loop. Same if you set anyone to use range weapons on medium or long range. The loop will happen until you manually move them away from the enemy. Then it will function as intended. \n\nHowever most of these anomaly can be rectified once encountered. As I state good game. Not great but not bad either. 6/10 for me.

Also recommend the patches the community have made, for bug and cut content. \n\nOne of the reasons that there is still a community for a 13 year old game is due to the world , characters, lore and love that those involved had making it. The sequels don't reach quite the magic as this one.  \n\nI usually play a female noble and I do enjoy the content that comes with that origin. \n\nI flipping hate the fade and encourage the skip the fade mod, it gets boring quickly. As much as I love the game there are still bugs, sometimes the dialogue is off.\n\nI adore the characters and the way they are written. Be on the watch for some of the missable companions. The world does feel alive. You are the most important character overall yet with the NPC's in particular make it feel like the world is bigger that you. They have their own priorities. It is strangely charming. \n\nThis is one of multiple copies I own. It is a \"cozy\" game for me and something I keep going back to. Though there is only a finite amount of materials  I can still find something new after all these years. \n\nWhile the sequels are lackluster in comparison, this is something you won't regret having in your collection. \n\n(Also from seeing some things from other people this has the same feel as Baldur's Gate and will probably be the closest thing to a remake us DA:O fans will have for a long time. But on the flip side if you want something like BG3 this is a great choice to scratch your itch.)", "timestamp_created": 1695926277, "timestamp_updated": 1695926277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147223485": {"recommendationid": "147223485", "author": {"steamid": "76561199028577578", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 458, "last_played": 1698096081}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

[/url]\n\nThe only problem I had with this beautiful game is that the game constantly crashed on start-up or when i got into the character creator. Upon looking up the problem, it needed a fix because of memory leak issues. After that fix, the game worked 100%.\n\nNow that you can play the game, we get on to the [u]REAL[/u] review.\n\n[b]Dragon Age: Origins[/b] is one of the best medieval RPGs I've ever played. As soon as you hit it off with Alistair, You can already tell you're going to have a great time. It's a setting of great despair and chaos, so it's nice to have a friendly face around. That is, until Morrigan comes along. Quite unfriendly..., [i]but she's hot so who cares?[/i] Soon after, we have a band of plucky companions who will have conversations with each other. Depending on your relationships, they may grow to love you, or hate you. Should you choose to even romance a companion, someone may get jealous. Yeah, It gets real spicy in this magical world. \n\nAs for the combat, if you've ever played anything like Runescape or World of Warcraft, you'll feel right at home. I chose a mage character, and turned out being an absolute force of destruction. Combining spells to make a magic tornado was not on my bingo card. In other games, Mages feel kind of boring or weak, but here they are essential to your team.

I haven't had any crashes since, though I did have two or three moments where I could literally see the game's grid somehow. \n\nBecause of these severe issues I can only recommend this game if you're either using an old system (eg old hardware and OS (you shouldn't have an old OS, though) or if you can get the game with a nice discount.

LOL\nBioware changed my views on what an RPG should be. I have a standards when in RPGs based upon this game. \n\nPros - \nGameplay/Combat - Dark Fantasy RPG - Strategy or Action combat (depending on platform)\nCompanions - You can choose to Romance companions and they have reactions according to what you say and choose. They also talk amongst themselves frequently (more with mods) \nModding - This game has a ton of mods, don't come at me with the whole \"This old piece of crap has too many bugs\" The modding community is very much alive and thriving for Dragon Age Origins because of the amount of people that remember it fondly as I do. \n\n\nCons - \nSlow - Sometimes, it takes a while to go from point a to point b, you don't just get to skip stuff (without mods) Sometimes we like to do a lot of talking, and less killing stuff. \n'spensive - In game items are kind of pricey at first. It gets better but it feels like everything in Ostagar is like 1G+ at third level. it's rough. \n\n\n\n\nThis was the first game I played from 9pm-9am when I was twelve years old. This game was my everything, it was the start to me becoming a Fantasy Novelist. It might not look it, but it can be one of the best RTS or TBS. (depending on how you play) \n\nNot enough action for you? Grab the PS3 or 360 Version (Game Pass) This makes pressing A your attack command, so it almost forces you to take a more \"player-centrist\" feel of the game. \n\nPlaying on PC will make this game feel more like a strategy game within the realm of Dungeons and Dragons, you could even use a party game like WoW to build a party that works well.

I cannot express just how much I adore this game and all the content it brings to the table. From the moment I embarked on my epic journey in Thedas, I was utterly captivated by the rich storytelling, immersive world-building, and the sheer depth of gameplay this edition offers.\nFirst and foremost, the storytelling in Dragon Age Origins is nothing short of phenomenal. The intricate and morally complex plot is full of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your adventure. The characters are beautifully crafted, with their unique backgrounds, motivations, and personalities. Whether forming alliances with Alistair, sharing secrets with Morrigan, or engaging in witty banter with Varric, you'll find yourself deeply invested in the companions you meet.\nThe Ultimate Edition takes the already fantastic base game and elevates it to another level by including all of the DLC and expansions. This means even more hours of gameplay, more character development, and epic quests to undertake. The \"Awakening\" expansion alone is worth the price of admission, introducing a brand-new storyline and an array of fresh challenges to conquer.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Dragon Age Origins is its freedom in shaping your character and the world around you. Your choices genuinely matter, affecting your immediate surroundings and the overarching narrative. Whether deciding the fate of entire civilizations, forging alliances, or making heart-wrenching sacrifices, every decision you make feels significant and has consequences that ripple throughout the game.\nThe graphics, while not the most cutting-edge by today's standards, are still gorgeous and capture the dark, gritty, and enchanting world of Thedas perfectly. The music is hauntingly beautiful and adds an extra layer of immersion to the overall experience.\nWhat truly sets Dragon Age Origins - Ultimate Edition apart, though, is its replay ability. With the myriad of character classes and origins to choose from, the various paths your character can take, and the multitude of choices and outcomes, you'll find yourself returning to this game repeatedly, each time with a different experience.\nIn conclusion, Dragon Age Origins - Ultimate Edition is a timeless masterpiece in the RPG genre. It's a game that provides hundreds of hours of gameplay and delivers a deep and emotionally engaging story that stays with you long after you've put down the controller. If you haven't had the pleasure of experiencing this gem yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the world of Thedas \u2013 you won't be disappointed!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694138714, "timestamp_updated": 1694138714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145882334": {"recommendationid": "145882334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053164763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1694129937}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great and I really want to play it, but it crashes randomly.

More so then i thought actually. But there is a lot that is messed up with the game. Its an old game, you expect it to have challenges and there's nothing you can do but just push through it. \n\nI will say this tho. If they remastered this game today with a full overhaul of everything and not just visual wise, this would be a hot seller hands down. But i doubt they will any time soon or ever really. The terrible tactics mechanic is one thing if any would be the focus point for me to change in the game. Its not as complicated but ffs is it a mess when it comes to the AI. You tell them what to do and they don't do it. There is no auto attack feature here so you have to constantly manage them for every task. Some like that sure, but if all i could get was a working tactics menu and have them auto attack when in battle unless told otherwise, it would have been a great playthrough. \n\nStory is good and i loved and hated the characters. Leliana is muh favorute and i would gut the maker open if it meant saving her lol. It sucks that it doesn't have enough oomf for me to replay really. I want to try other classes but man do the talents sucks. 99% of them are \"sustained\" talents, meaning you press it and it stays on like an aura that uses mana or stamina. I reverted to a healer/support because i don't have a lot of activated spells for damage casting. It was just easier to have my companions do all the work while i kept them alive and even that was a chore with the yucky AI and Tactics system. \n\nIs it worth it? If this is your style game, yes. Im sure you've played even older games that were a headache to play so this won't change anything. But for new people to the genre? I can't say yes.

This game oozes wanting to be the best game ever.\nTruthfully, when I first picked this game up, it was on a console. The controls felt clunky and I had difficulty getting into the game's combat system. I picked it back up on pc a few years later and slow downed to learn the combat system.\nLuckily the combat system isn't a complicated mess. I often find myself getting a headache trying to learn how a game plays these days, but after you scratch the surface in DOA, it's pretty easy. However, spells and actions stack, so you can get complex and craft your hero and party the way you'd like.\n\nOne thing that stands above all for me is that your decisions and actions in the game, completely change many aspects of the world you live in. Without getting into spoilers, if you kill some uppity guy because he annoyed you, he may have been the only thing that was keeping a mass invasion from happening to your kingdom. Honestly, I have never seen anything like it, even in the Mass Effect franchise that comes close to this. As stated early, DAO is the best in the Dragon Age Franchise. DAO2 is flat out boring and resembles nothing like the other games. And DAI tries to capture the essence of DAO, but doesn't compare. However, it is still superior to DAO2.\n\nBuy the game, play it, you won't regret it", "timestamp_created": 1693348675, "timestamp_updated": 1693348675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145235229": {"recommendationid": "145235229", "author": {"steamid": "76561199438791975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2334, "last_played": 1699365311}, "language": "english", "review": "i love it and you would too", "timestamp_created": 1693278413, "timestamp_updated": 1693278413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145219243": {"recommendationid": "145219243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106365704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 6773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6773, "last_played": 1528716540}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1693253883, "timestamp_updated": 1693253883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145218728": {"recommendationid": "145218728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027354174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1625, "last_played": 1693253136}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to go back to this series and have a playthrough.\n\nImpossible.\n\nIt's so bugged that I just crash to dektop avery few minutes, sometimes I can get 20-30 min before another crash.\n\nThan, all the graphics are bugged as well, textures going crazy...\n\nIt's just unplayable.

While I'm one of the seemingly few people that enjoyed Dragon Age 2, and found Inquisition to be a good game in its own right neither of them really captured the same feeling that Origins had.\n\nTo start off I will admit that on todays machines, it is not a stable game. I've had many crashes when I've tried to play it on PC and at times had saves become corrupted. I haven't really looked around but I'm sure there are mods that fix these issues but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nBesides that the game itself is phenomenal, immediately upon getting to the main menu of the game you're greeted with a beautiful melody of a woman singing, which quickly transitions into a foreboding, almost warlike drums and horns before flowing right back into that almost hopeful and magical singing and then right back into the dark and heavy drums. The menu alone sets the tone of the game excellently with the music. A dark fantasy tale that still has glimmers of hope for a better future within the game itself.\n\nIt certainly doesn't disappoint either, as after you're done with the character creator you're brought into a world that has been carefully crafted by a Bioware that was still at their peak. World building that I personally feel none of the other Dragon Age games matched, as simply going through the game you can feel so much history that's been built into the world even with it being the first within the series. Tensions between different peoples, prejudices from centuries of war and hate between peoples that can't ever see eye to eye and a world that itself feels almost real and lived in.\n\nGameplay wise it might feel dated to some, and it is when compared to the later games within the same series. Though that doesn't mean that it's lackluster in any way, just that it's a more methodical and tactical game and slower paced without the refinements they made later in the series. It also bears similarities to the combat they had in Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, which are legendary games in their own right.\n\nIf you're able to bear through a somewhat unstable game, or willing to mod the game until it is stable, you'll find yourself playing an honestly enchanting game that I don't think Bioware has been able to match. With the only franchise of theirs that meets or beats it being Mass Effect or Baldur's Gate 1 and 2.

A few minor complaints with DAO: Movement speed should be more, battles should have more variety. NPCs should express some kind of interest in the areas that they want to go to so that it's slightly more obvious that there's a companion quest there. Alistair does that to some extent for example but Leliana surely doesn't. Or maybe Leliana just talks a lot and I wasn't paying attention. All the classes are fun to play but rogues and warriors end up having too many talent points and aren't customizable enough. All of these are minor things however.

Estos no siempre son tan entretenidos de leer, pero suman al transfondo del asunto.\nLa experiencia de juego de Dragon Age Origins es lo que lo vuelve tan especial, porque no es s\u00f3lamente derrotar villanos. Existe toda una serie de dialogos que permiten tomar el rumbo de la situaci\u00f3n dependiendo de las preferencias del jugador, y esto lo cambia todo. Llegando a existir pr\u00e1cticamente 2 formas de jugar: Hablar o matar.\nAs\u00ed tambien esto de los dialogos se complementa con el c\u00f3dice, y de pronto se pueden escuchar historias sobre los propios aliados, quienes vienen de vidas muy distintas y cada uno logra aportar lo suyo.\nSobre los personajes aliados, compa\u00f1eros de esta Ruina, me encanta entablar conversaciones con ellos y ver que tienen algo interesante que decirme. Quizas sea sobre su pasado, quiz\u00e1s s\u00f3lo sea alguna molestia. La naturalidad con la que se desenvuelven las cosas simplemente me encanta.\nEntre las charlas por querer conocer m\u00e1s a cada uno de estos aliados, descubr\u00ed que Wynne, la mujer mayor, era m\u00e1s personaje de lo que pensaba. Y entre todos los personajes, quizas fue con la cu\u00e1l m\u00e1s empatic\u00e9 esta vez que lo jugu\u00e9.\nBrevemente, Wynne es lo m\u00e1s parecido a una madre que se puede encontrar. Sus consejos representan gran parte de lo que ella es, as\u00ed como todos sus di\u00e1logos.\nAunque como dije, todos los personajes tienen su punto interesante y car\u00e1cteristico.\nAlistar. el chico torpe pero noble. Morrigan, la chica tsundere. Leliana, la elegante y atractica chica de Orlais. Sten, el siempre fr\u00edo y certero. Oghren, tu t\u00edo cuando se emborracha. Zevran, el elfo de los Antivan. Shale, la enana convertida en Golem.\nCada uno con su pasado por descubir. Pero no es tan simple llegar a conocerlo. Para lograr que cuenten su pasado es necesario primero haber charlado previamente. De modo que conocer m\u00e1s sobre cada personaje s\u00f3lo se hace posible en la medida que estos lo permitan, c\u00f3mo quien conoce a una persona de verdad.\nTambi\u00e9n existen ciertas rivalidades de grupos como la de \"La Capilla de Andraste\" (quien ser\u00eda como la iglesia Cristiana) contra \"El circulo de los magos\". Esta rivalidad en realidad est\u00e1 infundada por el poder que poseen los magos, generando tensi\u00f3n entre ambos. Y lo llamativo aqu\u00ed es que esta discusi\u00f3n que de pronto se vuelve algo moral, se discute durante el videojuego en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n y que, como no pod\u00eda ser de otra forma, uno como protagonista toma el rumbo a lo que le parezca m\u00e1s correcto.\nFinalmente decir que me parece un videojuego increible, incluso m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os despues lo sigo revisitando y asombrandome por todo lo que tiene para ofrecer.\nQue pena me da ver lo que le han hecho a los dem\u00e1s juegos de la franquis\u00eda. Ninguno presenta tal profundidad como esta primera entrega de la saga.\n", "timestamp_created": 1691985612, "timestamp_updated": 1691985612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144141280": {"recommendationid": "144141280", "author": {"steamid": "76561199537391206", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1400, "last_played": 1691980398}, "language": "english", "review": "constant crashes i have 8gb ram everything is all updated tried different launchers still crashes console version harder to play but crashes way less", "timestamp_created": 1691979675, "timestamp_updated": 1691979675, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144135070": {"recommendationid": "144135070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041960312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1695807159}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una verg\u00fcenza que este JUEGAZO sea imposible de jugar hoy d\u00eda.

I will however play again and not skip it next time, haha!\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game if you are thinking about buying it, I think you're going to have a blast!", "timestamp_created": 1691933928, "timestamp_updated": 1691933928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53947371244430542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144091398": {"recommendationid": "144091398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350161723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2556, "last_played": 1692393592}, "language": "english", "review": "YES\n\u2880\u2874\u2811\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2838\u2847\u2800\u283f\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u2874\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2884\u28e0\u283e\u2801\u28c0\u28c4\u2848\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2840\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u281b\u2802\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u287f\u28bf\u28c6\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u287e\u28c1\u28c0\u2800\u2834\u2802\u2819\u28d7\u2840\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u282d\u28a4\u28f4\u28e6\u28e4\u28f9\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28b4\u28f6\u28c6 \n\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ee\u28fd\u28fe\u28ff\u28e5\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2882\u2814\u289a\u287f\u28bf\u28ff\u28e6\u28f4\u28fe\u2801\u2838\u28fc\u287f \n\u2800\u2880\u285e\u2801\u2819\u283b\u283f\u281f\u2809\u2800\u281b\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cc\u28a4\u28fc\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u285f\u2809\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u28fe\u28f7\u28f6\u2807\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28c4\u28c0\u2840\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2809\u2808\u2809\u2800\u2800\u28a6\u2848\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u28fd\u2879\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2832\u28fd\u287b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28dc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ee\u28ed\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281f\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u281b\u283b\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u281b\u2809", "timestamp_created": 1691932776, "timestamp_updated": 1691932776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144084782": {"recommendationid": "144084782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077693844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3909, "last_played": 1691951458}, "language": "english", "review": "There is not many things to say. 2023 and i reinstaled it so i can replay it.

I loved all the characters and party banter, all the character customization and story choices that really mattered and the gameplay and tactics that let you switch between any of the characters and even let you program their AI to cast certain spells at certain times exactly the way you want them to.\n\nThis can be played from the overhead view or third person view, you can solely focus on your main character if you want or micro manage every aspect of your companions to create the perfect party. This was BioWare at it's peak, they don't make many RPG's like this anymore.\n\nI only had 1 issue with the Steam version of this game, because of it's age the game will sometimes crash when you play on max settings. This is due to the exe file only using 3gb of ram which worked better on older machines with lower resolution monitors.

Our class, race and origin story change how we interact with multiple npc's and how certain story events are played.\n\nThis type of decision-making directly changes how the game evolves. To the point of not having a complete party in the endgame. Death, betrayal, romances and entire quest lines are different in each run.\n\nThe gameplay may feel a bit clunky by today's standards, but the tactic approach to combat gets more satisfying with time. Skill trees uniqueness makes builds feel diverse (at least for the mage) and the spell combination system is much better than the sequels.\n\nI will not speak about the lore, in-game story/lore.

I'd recommend adding onto this in all future games - it is quite a draw to the story line also, and adds a LOT to wanting to replay the game. \n-The ability to save and sometimes explore other options...and satisfy the player's curiosity of \"how could that have gone differently?\"\n-Personalization of the character in appearance, playing style, skills options (with many skills trees), use of different characters\n-Impressive teamwork engine with use of combat tactics to set behaviors in combat, allowing the player to focus on what he or she likes to do\n-Fully Immersive Choice Outcomes: Choices affect conversations, with very very identifiable areas of odd conversation\n-Options for more than just trope sub stories; some options allow the player to explore many roads not often traveled\n-Most of the quests do have a point or add in some subtle way to the understanding of the characters involved; very few are purely \"play fetch\" quests...and when they are there, they are a welcome change of pace \n\nDislikes:\n-No game is ever without a bug or a glitch that doesn't at some point interfere with game play to a degree. \n-Wish there was more to the romance stories - at some point, they plateau into repetitive scenes that no longer draw the player in further, and even limit the player at times with some options\n-Some choices are not very intuitive, with little gain or even high penalty when facing a lack of information. This can be a little frustrating at times, and either lead to looking things up, some anxiety when playing, or distancing the player from the game at times.\n -Some moral conflicts are just plain annoying. The choice of character self-sacrifice vs crappy-other-options just seems a little artificial...and most people do not want to walk away from a game feel unsatisfied...this usually does not engender a desire to play another game requiring a lot of time and effort to finish. Players have lives too, and walking away from a game feeling satisfied overall is key to wanting more!\n-Last point having  been said, I will probably play more of Dragon Age games because this was the first of its canon after all, and I've heard the later games are better about this issue...and as such, this game is a welcome part of an **epic** series.\n\nOVERALL, WELL DONE (SAID WITH GRATITUDE, APPRECIATION, & ADMIRATION TO GAME DEVELOPERS AND STEAM FOR CONTINUING TO CARRY THIS GAME). \n\nTo anyone who has not played this game, I do recommend playing this on PC...it is clearly a work of love and art, well worth the long amount of time and effort you will put into this highly immersive, story/combat/RPG game.", "timestamp_created": 1689390306, "timestamp_updated": 1689390306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142096757": {"recommendationid": "142096757", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199346451", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2397, "last_played": 1692630831}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game played it multiple times with each different backgrounds.

In the case that you read this and want to play it yourself i'd definitely recommend modding the game and getting at the very least the 4GB patch, otherwise the game crashes very frequently due to running out of memory.", "timestamp_created": 1688747686, "timestamp_updated": 1688747686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141533016": {"recommendationid": "141533016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137279941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 930, "last_played": 1688755591}, "language": "english", "review": "Morrigan sure is something eh?", "timestamp_created": 1688745999, "timestamp_updated": 1688745999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141515473": {"recommendationid": "141515473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065256957", "num_games_owned": 1282, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5575, "last_played": 1689806652}, "language": "english", "review": "IF YOU LOOK LIKE MORRIGAN HMU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1688728442, "timestamp_updated": 1688728442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141503728": {"recommendationid": "141503728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054485242", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7724, "last_played": 1688711849}, "language": "english", "review": "Any fans of choice-matters and story-rich RPGs NEEDS to play the Dragon Age series; or, at the very least, this installment.

I already know what a generic fantasy religion is. \n\nThe story is the worst part. It's generic. It plays hard into all the tropes without any skill, deconstruction, or self-awareness. The edgy possessed toddler boss fight was so cringy. It caused me psychic damage. I'll be kind of nice and admit the tutorial for human mage was a little interesting with a fun twist and some Bioware-tier moral quandaries, but as the tutorial is not very long, I still cannot scrounge together a full hour of entertainment from this AAA, mass-marketed game. \n\nSomeone told me this was as good as Mass Effect but in a fantasy setting. No! Garrus and Tali are such complex and endearing characters.

Took a while to learn the controls and mechanics as I prefer consoles, but I quickly fell in love with it. I'm now in the middle of inquisition, yet this still is my favorite because of the intriguing story, lovable characters and replay ability. If they ever remaster this I'd definitely buy it again. \n\nOnly negative I could give, is that this game crashes often for me. Re-configuring my computer for it only seemed to help a little bit. And none of the other games of this franchise or other higher quality games crashed, if ever as much as this game. I saved constantly so I wouldn't have to do any difficult fight over and over again after I already beat it. \n\nWhile graphic are usually a deal breaker for me since I can't look at something for so long that is harsh to stare at for hours on end, this game really shines in giving you a great experience as you play as the Warden. I've found the other games a bit lacking when it comes to being drawn into the world and characters. This one has more choices to make for situations and didn't lead you around towards an event where your choices felt useless at the end of it. Didn't have 50 useless side quests per area to lessen the main story or terrible allies that make you regret accepting them in your party. While a few side quests were very optional, they still felt useful in giving you money to buy health/lyrium or gear you needed. \n\nSo if you like fantasy rpg games with a fighting aspect to it, I'd seriously recommend this one. Even if you aren't that good at the tactical parts of it, just play it on casual and don't worry about figuring anything out all that much. And if you're suck at a part, look up that particular fight or situation for advice, a lot of it I found pretty helpful for winning against a more difficult boss.", "timestamp_created": 1687989096, "timestamp_updated": 1687989096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140835099": {"recommendationid": "140835099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027358364", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2422, "last_played": 1687937839}, "language": "english", "review": "Disable ANY overlays to play without crashing, then it's great, a nice trip down nostalgia lane.", "timestamp_created": 1687938359, "timestamp_updated": 1687938359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517045438289642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140825838": {"recommendationid": "140825838", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033304280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13079, "last_played": 1698975459}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant game, perfect for anyone in the mood for an epic fantasy RPG.

But I'm thankful that I didn't because this is one of the few RPGs I've played where you can get both a) some interesting characters and b) use a real diversity of spells in practice.\n\nPros:\n\n- As a mage, you are not punished for using a diversity of spells. In fact, it's encouraged! Spells don't gain extra power by using them or by class so you're free to use other spells and spell classes. This is such a breath of fresh air compared to so many RPGs that reward you for spamming the same spell throughout the whole thing. To me this basically makes it worth playing.\n- There are a lot of different ways to control things (close up 3rd person view, sky view, paused, live-time, controlling one party member at a time, controlling all party members at the same time) which each have their purpose. Once you learn to use them well you may think, \"wow, why haven't other games done it this way?\"\n- Several characters are fun to talk to.\n- The overall story isn't too bad.\n- I highly suggest making your character's face as ugly as possible in the creation stage. I giggle every time there's a close up during a dialogue or cut scene. Particularly when suitors are calling my character beautiful.\n\nCons:\n\n- Getting started is rough. The start area (at least for mages) is pretty dull and you're also thrown into the large amount of ways to control things (talked about in the pros). There's a lot of \"Oh, that's what this thing is\" because of a lack of explanation.\n- The controls can be confusing. I recommend never using the overhead view unless you've paused the game and need to cast an AOE spell or something like that. On rare occasions it can also help navigating to a particular area.\n- It crashes fairly often (about once every half hour for me and sometimes when it's loading a save). Save pretty often. If you're getting crashes a lot, lower the graphics settings.\n- This game is very sexist. There's only one body type per gender and a LOT of the women are basically topless. I guess the sexist part is kind of on theme but the topless part is a bit bizarre.\n- The dialogue is audio-only until it completes, making reading quickly through it impossible. I have no idea why they did this (maybe to make it more cinematic?). I end up skipping most of the dialogue and trying to reason through what they said based on my answer choices to save time. Though this does lead me to miss some cutscenes because the difference between a cut scene and a dialogue is not always clear, which is a shame.\n- It's impossible to open locked chests if you're not a rogue. Apparently the loot in them is bad anyway? I'm not sure why they were included in the game...\n- After completing the main quest line in a city you gain access to the quest board. All of those quests are terrible, you can skip them.\n- There's a bug that happens to nearly everyone during the Soldier's Peak DLC/quest. I recommend reading the guides/fixes before doing that quest. The only way I was able to complete it was to come back much later and force the NPC to move using fireballs because you can't learn it early on.\n\nOnce you get started and used to the controls, this is a great game.\n\nI have meandered between main and side quests, but 10 hours in I estimate I'm probably ~20-30% of the way through the game.\n\nSome gameplay tips:\n- I recommend getting your primary party members to really like you. You can do this through dialogue and particular gifts that give you big (+50) likeability points (that's my name for them, not official) but the easiest way is to just buy \"Thoughtful gifts\" from the trader in your campsite.

Like the mass effect series, you will be making decisions that will shape the world and its future. You have multiple different classes to start with, abilities to learn, etc. Levels and leveling up feels rather impactful. Example, when I made an arcane mage, originally it wasn't great at all. In 7-8 more levels, I was a full fledged melee unit that was even tankier than my tanks without even using the shield which was another buff giving me 60 armor and magic resistance. Unlike in other games, you are allowed to actually kick people out of your party as well.  If you don't like someone you can quite literally, kick them to the curb. The DLCs were pretty good especially awakening which was practically half of a game.\n\nCombat is pretty decent as well. It's a top down combat style (think diablo) but you can change the view to be more first person if you choose to do so. You  can pause the game at any point and time to issue commands to your party members and each class/specialization has a clearly defined role. This game has a great replay value, a good story, and actually gives you meaningful decisions to make that will impact your relationship with those within the world and how the war with the darkspawn occurs.\n\nThe older mods also still work, definitely worth stopping over to the nexus to pick up a few mods to see what you would like added to the game as well.", "timestamp_created": 1687645135, "timestamp_updated": 1687645135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467289716005325317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140633212": {"recommendationid": "140633212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087652791", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4935, "last_played": 1687683916}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sencillamente el mejor juego que he jugado en mi vida.

"language": "english", "review": "i review games on steam after i 100% complete them! check out my reviews to see all the games i have completed!\n\ndragon age: origins - ultimate edition is a RPG developed by bioware and published by EA. the base game was released in late-2009, with the awakening expansion releasing in march of 2010. the ultimate edition which included everything in one package was finally released in october 2010. it was supposed to originally serve as bioware's spiritual successor to the likes of the baldur's gate and neverwinter nights. they decided to use the subtitle 'origins' for several reasons. one, the game was the beginning of  a new IP/franchise, two, the game features six different origin stories depending on your race/class, and finally (and most notably in my opinion), it serves as bioware's return to pc RPGs with the fantasy setting being bioware's bread and butter (or at least that's how they felt internally). \n\nDA:O is a hybrid of old-school and new-school RPGs. it implements old-school rpg mechanics from classics like baldurs gate, while also incorporating mechanics from more modern, action-oriented RPGs like KOTOR, fable, or morrowind/oblivion. for example, do you know the life path mechanics from cyberpunk? three backstories that change how your character starts the game and subsequently how they're viewed in the world around them throughout the entire game? well DA:O has six of them, and they are way more fleshed out here than they are in cyberpunk, a game made a decade later. there are many more examples of how they had really good ideas and implemented them well here despite development of the game taking place throughout the 2000s.\n\nyou play as a human, elf, or dwarf, and then choose either the warrior, rogue, or mage class. then from there you are eligible for one or two of the six origin stories that you begin the game as. all six eventually lead to the same place early in the story (joining the grey wardens) and all characters soon after have the game map \"open up\" for them and you can go anywhere you want. it's still cool how mid or late game, you still have things affects by/people responding to you based on your backstory. if you're a noble as one race, your family is all dead, but if your a noble for another race, your family is instead huge part of a main quest line. it is extraordinarily done and expands the game's longevity and replay-ability by a lot. \n\nsome people may feel the combat is clunky or outdated, but i like the pausing and real-time tactical strategy. i wasn't into it at first, but i stuck it out and eventually it all connected for me as i got more familiar with the systems. you can switch in-between overhead/isometric camera view and third person action-adventure game camera view which is very useful in different scenarios. it can get repetitive, but it's still fun to micromanage everything and it's pretty challenging, even on the easiest difficulty. there are tons of little nuances with all the mechanics that actually make it extremely deep, to the point where they reportedly had to scale back the combat in future iterations. you definitely need to pay a lot of attention during combat at any difficulty, which for some can be tiresome but for me personally, i loved it. one small thing: i genuinely love how OP the mage class is, it makes you really feel the danger they represent and why people in-game want them to be locked up. \ni genuinely enjoy the story as well, with the mechanics of going to several different areas and then each area having a key plot point that you make a major decision in was a fun way to play through and it made it more fun on my subsequent playthroughs when i found that having different companions in different conversations in different settings will result in different outcomes and possibilities and just new and interesting dialogue. the story and characters are definitely the best parts of the game, as the companions and choices in the main plot lines, as well as side quest content are deep and immersive.\n\nthe best part of the game is (of course) the writing and characters/companions courtesy of bioware themselves. there's many different major plot points throughout the game and you can make many different decisions for each of them, and your companions will react to each of these decisions, with some of them even provoking them to attack you. there can be a lot of generic dialogue, but there is still a ton of unique and impactful dialogue you can have, a majority of which come from chatting with companions or major characters. the setting is pretty traditional even for a high-fantasy setting but there are unique bioware touches all throughout the world.\n\none awesome thing in this game is a specific background. it\u2019s the only one of the six where your gender affects the storyline, in this particular background you\u2019re getting married, and a noble ends up stealing your bride away if you are a male, but he ends up stealing you if you are a female instead. then what happens is you either try to break your lover out of jail or you break out yourself. not only is that in itself cool, but later you come across the kidnapper as he\u2019s locked up and he tries to get you to let him go. well i hadn\u2019t played this specific backstory until after like 3-4 other ones and i had encountered him in my main playthrough and thought little of it, only to find out he\u2019s a key part in a different origin story. there is a ton of that kind of stuff in this game and it\u2019s so satisfying finding little connections across playthroughs. \n\nanother cool thing about this game is that it follows the footsteps of the witcher series in that you can transfer their choices from origins into dragon age II and dragon age: inquisition so that decisions made are referenced and may impact the narrative. a very cool feature that i didn't know about until well intto a second playthrough of origins. i have yet to ever even play the other games in the sereis, although that will hopefully change very soon now that i've completed origins. \n\ni have seen people say that the release of DA:O marked a point in which western RPGs became more mainstream, with eurogamer stating in a 2020 article titled \"remembering dragon age origins\" that \"the success of origins probed that a hardcore, older-fashioned game can still find a devoted audience\", and that it \"established a new baseline for the genre in the same way that the original baldur's gate did back in 1998\".\n\noverall, this is a classic and amazing RPG that i sadly hadn't even played for the first time until 2023. i would easily pay the full price of $30 but you can routinely find this for somewhere between 75-85% off, making it anywhere from $7.50 to as low as $4.50, which is the price i bought it for. i definitely recommend waiting for a sale as spending well under $10, for not only an AMAZING RPG, but all nine DLC packs included AND the awakening expansion, is an incredible deal. some final notes: there's also great music, and great tactical combat. if you've ever played other bioware games, know that this is one of their best and you can not go wrong playing this, even by 2023 standards. there's easily 50+ hours of combat even if you

From its engaging story to its lovable companions, this game exemplifies the pinnacle of RPG excellence.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The companions in Dragon Age: Origins are some of the most memorable and well-developed characters in the RPG genre. Alistair, Wynne, Leliana, and Morrigan bring the game to life with their iconic moments and deep personal stories. The game's main story is exceptionally well-written and ranks among the best in any RPG. It keeps you engaged and invested throughout your journey.\n\nFurthermore, Dragon Age: Origins offers an abundance of quality content, including side quests and DLC expansions. You'll find yourself immersed in a rich and expansive world with countless hours of gameplay. The voice acting is also top-notch, adding a layer of impeccable authenticity to the characters and dialogue.\n\nHowever, the combat mechanics in Dragon Age: Origins leave something to be desired. The real-time-with-pause (RTWP) system can feel clunky and awkward, especially if you're not a fan of this particular combat style. Additionally, the AI controlling your teammates can be frustratingly unreliable at times, often failing to respond to your commands properly.\n\nAnother downside is the game's performance, considering its age. Despite performance patches and bug fix mods, Dragon Age: Origins can suffer from memory leaks at least throughout my playthrough, resulting in suboptimal performance. This issue can detract from the overall experience.\n\nLastly, be prepared for some difficulty spikes that may feel unfair and frustrating. Coupled with the aforementioned combat issues, these spikes can dampen an otherwise fairly enjoyable combat system.\n\nDespite its flaws, Dragon Age: Origins is a must-play for true RPG fans. Bioware's masterpiece stands the test of time with its captivating story, immersive world, and lovable companions. If you can overlook the combat imperfections and occasional technical issues, you'll be rewarded with an unforgettable journey that will stay with you long after the game is over.", "timestamp_created": 1686903717, "timestamp_updated": 1686903767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140143811": {"recommendationid": "140143811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106486587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1112, "last_played": 1524365946}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing classic", "timestamp_created": 1686898669, "timestamp_updated": 1686898669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140133455": {"recommendationid": "140133455", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034552314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4383, "last_played": 1690842243}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game ong, though the gameplay is a teeny tiny bit dated", "timestamp_created": 1686878304, "timestamp_updated": 1686878304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140129346": {"recommendationid": "140129346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333423812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1687148507}, "language": "english", "review": "So, I'm re-posting this review because I did finally get the game working but I'm not going to lie its incredibly frustrating.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451 If you do buy this I highly recommend following this as it allowed me to not only stop crashing but also fix a lot of visual issues and let me run it on actually good settings without fear of completely breaking the game.\n\nBesides the very frustrating technical issues because this game is way too old and bio ware made no attempt to either fix it or future proof it; Dragon Age Origins is unapologetically one of my favourite role playing games.

Gives you many choices to pick from, and every choice you make can affect the game in a good or bad way. And remember: it has better character customization than Elder Scroll: Oblivion...God those faces freaked me out. Game has romance routes too, but if you're just wanting to immerse yourself in the lore then I wouldn't do it, that's what I did. Maybe do that stuff after you get a good handle on the lore from your first play through since you'll have gotten used to the games mechanics and how dialogue can affect how certain characters think of you. And for people that want to be a blood mage, once you unlock it during one play through, you can use it every game. Might be useless information but I had no idea about that when I first started, so it might help. Another good bit of information is during the DLC 'Warden's Keep,' you can interact with a potion on a table. Drink it if you decided to be a rogue. It gives you a skill that can be handy if you're stuck in a bad situation and need to deal more damage, but only activate it if you are certain you'll have enough health, because it does drain your HP quite a bit, but like I said use it if you want to quickly get through low ranked mobs since it does double the damage your regular dagger would do.\n\nAlso, if you do choose to be a rogue, then if you do the 'Return to Ostagar' DLC make sure to pick up... well, your mentors sword and King Dumbo's sword. Trying to not spoil stuff here. Pick up the armor that King Dumbo had worn by defeating the darkspawn commanders, since if you don't have enough gold to get Alistair or another heavy-hitter on your team better armor, the Kings armor does a pretty good job keeping you or your teammate protected in fights.\n\nNow the game itself is amazing, and still in my opinion the graphics are pretty great considering at what time it was released. So since everyone is rating it 1-10, I'll give this a......\n\n...9/10.\n\nWhen I first played it, I loved the plot and lore, but during the next couple of play-throughs, I thought that they could have added more dialogue options for some of the side characters, like adding a few more stories for them to tell. For example, I wished we could have heard more stories about Morrigan's childhood. From what I heard, it all sounded funny and sad, but felt like there was more that could've been added to help flesh out Morrigan's character more. Still feel like people give her unnecessary hate. And yes, I know she did some messed up crap, but in all honestly I think she tried her best to help her friends whilst also incorporating some way to benefit from it or make herself useful in someway so that she wouldn't get betrayed. Plus, I wanted to hear more about Alistairs life at the chantry and maybe more dialogue between him and Leliana talking about how the chantry operates. I know there was that one talk between the two whenever you would walk around, but I wanted there to be a bit more conflict between the two since the chantry did have a big impact on Alistair and how he joined the Grey Wardens. Leliana is one of my favorite characters because of how she had stories to tell that helped you wrap your head around the lore of the chantry. I wish I could have heard more from her since she was such an interesting character: a sister who's an ex-bandit/assassin. Thought there could have been more dialogue about their past, but maybe I'm just being nit-picky here. I love this game because of how interesting the characters stories were, including all the lore stories Leliana would tell about Andraste and the war going on with the elves and humans. Kinda thought she made the game more enjoyable because of her stories.\n\nAnd if you chose an evil route, I felt like people weren't as hateful towards you as they should have been if you were so 'evil,' especially from your teammates. They felt more so annoyed rather than \"You are such a TERRIBLE person! I will KILL you!\" or \"I hope you rot. Your heart is as evil and cold as a darkspawn's, and you will pay for all you've committed.\" The teammates felt more compliant with the Grey Warden's decisions then they should have been, and if you upset them or get their friendship level low, then they just leave the group. I could be wrong since I've never really tried to be incredibly evil in DAO.\n\nBut other than that I love this game and I hope people can continue giving it attention because it's story is very good and immersive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd please, don't let Morrigan do THAT to you-know-who.

First of all: \nGRAB THE 4GB PATCH. IT WILL SOLVE MOST OF YOUR CRASHES! -> https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5368\n\nNow, as for the game itself:\n\nIt is an old game. Even at its release it was technically limited in both graphics, performance, and gameplay.\nIn spite of it all, I am still left stunned beyond words by just how great Dragon Age: Origins is.\n\nIf you know anything about Bioware games, you'll know that what truly sells them is the cast of characters. DAO is no different. You become truly invested in these fictional characters and their stories and struggles, and as your connection to them deepens, so does their connection to you.\n(Granted you can cheese the approval system with gifts)\n(pls don't do that btw)\n\nI won't spoil anything about the story, as I believe it is best experienced going blind. Just know that it's good. Really good.\nIt will take you accross abandoned underground roads of a fallen empire inhabited by a tainted race of mindless creatures (or are they? Play Awakening and find out!), forests filled with cursed beasts and rhyming trees, cities and prisons of men. There is no lacking variety for DAO's maps.\n\nThe lore is magnific. When you start exploring and learning about it, there is no turning back.\nIt takes RPG standards like elves and dwarves and gives them its own spin, making Dragon Age a truly unique gem.\n\nI won't tell you this game has no flaws. It has many. A LOT. I spent a lot of time fixing a lot of stuff in my own modlist, from bad graphics fidelity to poor designs; of both characters, models and items.\nNo matter how much you try to optimize it, there's no running away from its memory leak and occasional crashes. You get used to the leak and learn to avoid the crashes, though.\n\nIf you're a fan of roleplaying open world-ish games with great characters and lore, DA Origins is a game you will most likely adore, and one of my favorite games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1686076084, "timestamp_updated": 1686076084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798529505729675293", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139629551": {"recommendationid": "139629551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062221617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1820, "last_played": 1686549336}, "language": "english", "review": "More like Crash Origins", "timestamp_created": 1686041997, "timestamp_updated": 1686041997, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589030086994171143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139619986": {"recommendationid": "139619986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408800518", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 12718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10148, "last_played": 1689735684}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the Greatest rpgs of all time.

To take a bite at the story's replay value if you are planning on buying this game, know that some plot points within your first dozen hour might become slow to you especially during some of the (taking this from another comment) labyrinth dungeons or your not so fast walking speed when you look at the rest of the map. If there is ever a remake of this game, please to be so holy templars add a sprint key. \nOther than bearing down on crash/freezing problems, (if you are not going to install mods) do not mind on the quality of life issues that you will not find in modern titles, and have a fondness over fantasy games then give this game a try.", "timestamp_created": 1685313766, "timestamp_updated": 1685313766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139172389": {"recommendationid": "139172389", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963802553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 6464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6464, "last_played": 1685300826}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

Despite the outdated graphics and archaic mechanics, for me Dragon Age: Origins is still one of the best games of this genre. Lore of this franchise is the most unique of all I had a chance to dive into. Music in the game is really beautiful, especially main soundtrack in the menu... I'm getting chills each time i hear it. There are many amazingly written companions that do not deserve to be missed. Each one of them has its own unique story and character, which makes them question our decisions, argue with us or even rise against us if we take a step too far. The combat may be a bit uninviting at first glance. It's a weird mix of action, real time strategy and party based combat system. I personally liked it but I guess it's a matter of taste. Once you familiarize with the mechanics it gets easier but the movement stays a bit clunky. Even if you don't like the combat i think it's worth to get through it for the main plot and companions because that is the foundation of the BioWare's RPGs like Dragon Age and Mass Effect.\n\nIf you are looking for a role-playing game where the choices of our heroes really matter and affect the fate of the world in a short or long-term way.. this is the perfect game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1684871116, "timestamp_updated": 1684871116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138830590": {"recommendationid": "138830590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799343649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1470, "last_played": 1686340610}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el mejor rpg de la historia", "timestamp_created": 1684841602, "timestamp_updated": 1684841602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616724729537963867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138824485": {"recommendationid": "138824485", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150122787", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1689, "last_played": 1686199463}, "language": "english", "review": "fav. game", "timestamp_created": 1684834335, "timestamp_updated": 1684834335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513108611106872559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138823300": {"recommendationid": "138823300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032190337", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1685278125}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games ever. \n\nUnfortunately it's incredibly unstable and crashes constantly.\n\nBut if you can get it working, it's worth it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1684832840, "timestamp_updated": 1684832840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138820589": {"recommendationid": "138820589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198955480404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1688360195}, "language": "english", "review": "I never played RPGs that much, the most I play are the Fallout games and I guess Elder Scrolls, but barely, but this game is amazing, the RPG elements are fun and I enjoy the gameplay as well, the world is interesting so 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1684829080, "timestamp_updated": 1684829080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138814819": {"recommendationid": "138814819", "author": {"steamid": "76561199047175844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1699547058}, "language": "english", "review": "This game holds a special place in my heart as one of the first games I ever played.

And again this is a 2010 game. Really really really well done.\n\n[+] [b] Easily moddable.[/b]  There is plenty of custom content to download on Nexus Mod, possibly creating new replay value. I am just at the beginning.\n\n[h2] NEUTRAL: [/h2]\n\n[+] [b]Graphics are fine.[/b] It's an old game and it offers in other fields.\n\nBesides it fits.\n\n[h2] CONS: [/h2]\n\n[-] [b]I found the GUI to be small and the text were hard to read.[/b] The subtitles are shown to the top of the screen for whatever reason. This was easily fixed with a mod and the game became much better for me.\n\n[-] [b]Dialogues can be too fast and new information can result to be too much to understand what's going on.[/b]\n\nThere is a chatlog in the game, however, I would have appreciated a click-to-proceed mechanic for the dialogues. (I am not english native, so I need to read texts without being in a rush to understand what's going on)\nAFAIK, there is no mod for this. \n\n[---] [b]The game could crash.[/b]\nI bought the game full knowing this could happen, and sadly it did. I found a way to fix the crashing issue by following a guide after a few attempts doing stuff I found online.\n\nEven this fix suddenly stopped working for me and the game would keep crashing no matter what, but somehow it fixed itself.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451", "timestamp_created": 1684241468, "timestamp_updated": 1700350786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691285908222198486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138375568": {"recommendationid": "138375568", "author": {"steamid": "76561199245455797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1684301715}, "language": "english", "review": "Shit doesn't open pass Dragon Age Origins Configure Utility.

The characters have backstory and it's told very well. A fantasy RPG with the story of a book lots of dialog and it's spoken. DLCs are meh but they are stories not just cosmetics like modern DLC. Bioware used it's full budget on this one and it shows in the development and story. Yes the graphics are aged but it's the story NOT the combat that makes this and most Bioware games stand apart from the mindless go her do this click, click, click, of modern games.

It has a decent character builder, and most impressevely, many different character origin stories - a sort of a prequel to the main story - which will vary according to the class - 3 available, each with their own set of subclasses - and race chosen.\n\nThe best part of the game is the well-written story and the fluidity of it - throughout the game, there are lots of ingame side quests, conversations and decisions that can be taken, that can have a very deep impact on the gameplay at hand. They can affect the plot, how other party members see the main character - eventually leading to friendships or even romances, or mutiny instead - and even the story of the subsequent sequels.\n\nARTWORK:\n\nVisuals were very solid for the time, and are still pleasing to look at today. Many mods available online to further enhance that.\n\nSound track for combat scenes is awesome; however, the game is eeringly quiet much of the time in non-combat mode. Voice acting is superb.\n\nCRASHES:\n\nUnfortunately, the game has deep stability issues that make it very susceptible to random crashes. \n\nScreenshots either cannot be taken or will crash the game. Saves on a specific level may instant crash upon loading.\n\nThe key is to save often - basically at every new level, possibly more often. \n\nIf a restart does not work, some troubleshooting may be in order, such as loading an older save in another map, and then trying to reload the newer save, using different characters in your party, avoiding specific spells, and so on.\n\nIn the end, I did manage to complete the base game and the DLCs come with this version, but obviously these issues seriously detract from the gameplay.\n\nFINAL WORDS:\n\nI also own and have completed the PS3 version as well. The game is that good. \n\nA true epic that is unfortunately hampered by constant crashes. \n\nI still recommend the Steam version as long as you are willing to spend time dealing with the crashes that are sure to occur. 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1683675445, "timestamp_updated": 1683675445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731445848941802979", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138068627": {"recommendationid": "138068627", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121565500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 2150, "last_played": 1699925424}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game", "timestamp_created": 1683673124, "timestamp_updated": 1683673124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138063162": {"recommendationid": "138063162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042903516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1682269049}, "language": "english", "review": "It really pains me to give this game a thumbs down because it's a real masterpiece.

Another flaw being the very few ever persisting quest bugs but none are game breaking or obtuse. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.

The game is a masterpiece of storytelling, role-playing, and world-building that immerses players in a rich and complex universe full of memorable characters, intricate plotlines, and epic battles.\n\nOne of the things that makes Dragon Age Origins so special is its ability to make players feel like they are part of the game's world. The game's attention to detail, from its intricate political intrigue to its numerous side quests, ensures that there is always something to discover, explore, or engage with. Every choice you make in the game has consequences that affect the world around you, making it feel like a living, breathing entity that you are helping to shape.\n\nAnother standout feature of Dragon Age Origins is its cast of characters, each of whom is fully fleshed out and memorable in their own right. From the gruff and stoic Alistair to the wily and cunning Morrigan, every member of your party has their own personality, backstory, and motivations that make them feel like real people rather than mere game characters. The interactions between party members are some of the most enjoyable moments in the game, and the game's dialogue system allows you to build relationships with them over time.\n\nOf course, no review of Dragon Age Origins would be complete without mentioning its combat system. The game's combat is strategic and challenging, requiring players to carefully manage their party members' abilities and equipment in order to overcome increasingly difficult foes. Whether you prefer to play as a warrior, rogue, or mage, there is a playstyle for everyone, and the game's diverse selection of spells, weapons, and armor ensures that there is always something new to try.\n\nIn summary, Dragon Age Origins is a masterpiece of gaming that has stood the test of time. Its world-building, characters, and combat are all top-notch, and it's no wonder that you love it so much.

Moreover, this build mechanism gets an upgrade in Awakening DLC and allows you to OP your character if you use it wisely. no matter which class you use. Combat tactics are also designed well, you can give command to all your party member during the fights. You can also set their own combat style as you wish. Meaning that you don't have to use Alistair as a tank just bc he comes to your party as a tank. He may continue as an archer, dual wielder or 2 handed as you wish.

Even created a couple mods over the years. I play on a new computer that is far above minimum specs. This review is based on the unmodded PC version of DA:O Ultimate.\n\nPros: Very good story, with just a few annoying holes and problems in dialog programming. Good, neutral and evil options in many dialogs. Excellent voice acting. Interesting NPCs with lots of banter and dialog. Detailed and useful journal. Graphics are decent for such an old game. Party inventory is a great innovation. Lots of control over the camera. \n\nCons: Limited character creation options; you have more control over your looks than over your race, class and stats. Poor maps -- hard to navigate, toons get stuck on meshes, only one quest marker (which might not be on your current map), can't select travel points from the map, can only fast travel from certain maps (resulting in numerous mindless treks through completed map areas). Horrendously complicated and onerous combat AI that can't be turned off. Overly tactical combat. Survival requires constant pausing and micromanagement of skills, position and inventory. This is often true even on the \"easy\" setting (contrary to the in-game description). Of the games mentioned at the beginning of this review, DA:O provides the worst combat experience. If you fail to do quests in a particular order (read blogs for the order because the game won't tell you), you won't be able to complete some of them. Not enough inventory slots and no bags of holding. Also, you can't drop or store inventory anywhere but your stash -- you have to sell or destroy what you no longer want to carry. Locks can only be opened by rogues, so keep that in mind when assembling a party. Occasionally, an NPC is required for a quest and rather than making the quest unavailable without the NPC, the game finds far more awful ways to handle the situation. For example, NPCs that aren't in your party will suddenly appear and talk, like they had been there the whole time. Or an NPC you might want to keep in the party (like a rogue) will be auto-booted and replaced by the required NPC (this may happen mid-dungeon, leaving your party seriously hampered).

Each member of your party is fleshed out with their own unique backstory, personality, and motivations. They feel like real people with real feelings and make you care about their struggles and triumphs throughout the game.\n\nThe music in Dragon Age Origins is also top-notch. The score is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly captures the mood of each scene. It's one of those soundtracks that you can listen to outside of the game and still feel emotionally moved.\n\nThe story is epic and engrossing, filled with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. It's clear that the developers put a lot of time and effort into crafting a world with a rich history and complex political landscape.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of flaws that hold the game back from being perfect. Firstly, the dungeon design can be a bit repetitive and lackluster. Many of the areas you explore feel like they were copied and pasted from other areas with minor variations. This can make exploring feel a bit tedious at times.\n\nAdditionally, the game balance can be a bit wonky, with some battles feeling too easy while others feel frustratingly difficult. It can be hard to find the right level of challenge, and the game doesn't do a great job of providing enough information to help you make informed decisions about your party's abilities and equipment.\n\nDespite these flaws, Dragon Age Origins is a must-play for anyone who loves RPGs. The characters, music, and story are all exceptional, and it's a game that will stick with you long after you've finished it.", "timestamp_created": 1680918422, "timestamp_updated": 1680918422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648938298225402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136309919": {"recommendationid": "136309919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068838508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6673, "last_played": 1680926129}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.", "timestamp_created": 1680918047, "timestamp_updated": 1680918047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136309785": {"recommendationid": "136309785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847510813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 6592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1690144104}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to like this game thats why i played 10 hours, but the game keep crashing about 2 times in an hour.

The decisions you make throughout the game have real consequences on the story and the world around you, giving you a sense of agency and investment in the game's outcome. Additionally, the game boasts an impressive amount of replay value, as the various character origin stories, party compositions, and dialogue choices allow for multiple playthroughs with vastly different outcomes.\n\nAnother highlight of Dragon Age: Origins is its characters. The party members you recruit are all unique and fully-realized individuals with their own motivations and backstories. They have their own opinions on the events unfolding around them, and their interactions with each other and the player character are both entertaining and insightful. The game also allows for romantic relationships to develop between the player character and certain party members, adding another layer of depth to the characters and the overall story.\n\nIn terms of gameplay. The combat system is well-balanced and challenging, with a variety of spells and abilities to master for each class. \n\nOverall, Dragon Age: Origins is a must-play for any fan of RPGs.

However, it is incredible and its positive aspects absolutely outweigh the bad. If you are looking for an immersive RPG with an engaging story, enjoyable dialogue that actually feels meaningful, and tactical combat, this is it. Your intro/background chapter is completely different depending on your race/class. For me, it added a lot to the experience. It really made me invested in my character's story and how they ended up where they did.I love the dialogue the NPCs have with each other. Pairing different people up in your party creates some amusing dynamics. Your choices matter sometimes, and sometimes they don't. But it still makes every moment meaningful because you don't know what ripple effect will come from it. I love tabletop games, and the way combat and leveling is structured is quite reminiscent of that. Don't spend too much time trying to min-max or hyper-focus on making the right choices all the time. There is a lot that goes into the mechanics and you'll kill yourself trying to optimize a, frankly, sub-optimal system. I play for the story and the fantasy, not because I'm looking for the most streamlined combat system in existence. If the latter is what you're after, you may not get the right level of fun out of this. If you choose a path and either play as you wish or how you feel your character would act, you'll have an amazing time and find yourself sinking hours in equal to some of the greatest RPGs.

There are choices that actually have an effect on what happens in the game. Most games today just give the illusion of choice or the choices given don't really affect anything overall. That's not what happens here. Certain choices will make your party members like you, hate you, stay with or leave you. Some will even attack you. \n\nThe conversations and banter between the companions is one of my favorite things. The music is great, as is the voice acting. The story and lore are interesting and is very well written with balanced humor and sadness. This is definitely a game I will replay.\n\nI noticed in some reviews that some were upset they couldn't romance certain characters and that the game is buggy.

Where as Mass Effect is a relatively fast paced cover shooter that is very easy to get into and enjoy (or at the very least tolerate), the combat of Dragon Age is far more slow and strategic which could potentially be a turn off. \nThis is especially true for Dragon Age Origins.\n\nWhen I got the game last year and started playing, it took a while for me to understand the combat and what the ideal way of playing was. I actually had to watch a guide and I still didn't fully get it. \nI think if you are into methodical combat where you really have to think about positioning then you will get a ton of enjoyment out of the game. If not, then I recommend you play the game anyway, just on easy difficulty where its much more forgiving.\n\nThe reason I think this game should be experienced by all is because of the incredible story.\nThe entire story is a joy to go through from start to finish, presenting fun and intriguing moral dillemas and choices. It has a very interesting villain in the form of Teyrn Loghain and the Darkspawn are also a great storytelling tool as well as an intimidating foe.\n\nBy far the best part of the game is the companions. Each and every one of them are cool, interesting and very well written. Each one has their own little separate storyline that you experince through their dialogue and their personal quest. (Except for the Dog, who unfortunately doesn't have his own quest.)\n\nDespite the complicated combat that could potentially shy people away, I absolutely recommend this game. The story is amazing, the companions are even better and if you really don't like the combat, you can always just turn on easy mode.", "timestamp_created": 1678353746, "timestamp_updated": 1678353746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134324104": {"recommendationid": "134324104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410158270", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1867, "last_played": 1691800880}, "language": "english", "review": "Game takes 20-30 hours of play time to finish just the main story.

I know that there are thousands of reviews that will tell you such, but it is simply that praiseworthy.

I also love the beginning segments for each background, and that they all tie in to the Warden leaving for Ostagar very well. I wish that they brought this back for Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I'm crossing my fingers that they will bring it to the fourth installment in Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, but only time will tell. If more linear real-time combat is what you enjoy, this game is a bit outdated in that regard, but excels in the tactical aspect and thus is great for top-down turn style gameplay. The companions are all quite intriguing and tie into the story well, and the romances are very sweet as well. My favorite companion was Zevran because he was the funniest and most charismatic, and my favorite romance was Alistair because it tied into the story well, and he had a certain awkwardness which was endearing.

I uninstalled and reinstalled this game so many times. But the more energy and time I spent on it, especially reading lore, the more I felt committed to it, and finally I grew to like this game, care for this game. In the end I am so happy that I didn't give up.\n\nNow I understand why this game is called one of the greatest rpgs of all time. The choices matter in a way that you see few in modern rpgs. The endearing companion members are so entertaining, making banter and telling their interesting backgrounds. You don't really want to make wrong decisions for them. It took me a long time to get hooked to the story, but once I did, I was at the edge of my seat the rest of the time.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend this game to everyone, not especially to modern gamers because It will feel very dated for them. When I say \"dated\", it includes the clunky gameplay, repetitive combat, exhaustingly long dungeons and tedious lines of enemies ready to come at you. Those elements make this game feel unnecessarily slow and it wouldn't convince me to replay for a different path. Alas, this game has a wonderful replay value. To add to that, this game uses the tactical combat mechanics that might be a drawback to those who like intuitive gameplay.\n\nMy point is this game could use a remake. For this reason I don't confidently recommend this game, but if you are PATIENT and love BioWare games, go for it.

Origins is a fantastical masterpiece that immerses players in a rich and compelling world full of intricate lore, captivating characters, and thrilling gameplay. This game, which was released over a decade ago, has stood the test of time and remains a shining example of what a truly great RPG can be.\n\nThe storyline is nothing short of epic, taking players on a journey through a land plagued by political intrigue, religious conflict, and demonic forces that threaten to consume everything in their path. The game is as much a political thriller as it is a fantasy adventure, with players being forced to navigate complex webs of allegiances and betrayals in order to save the world from destruction.\n\nOne of the standout features of Dragon Age Origins is its diverse cast of characters, each with their own distinct personalities, backstories, and motivations. From the brooding mage Morrigan to the noble warrior Alistair, each companion is a fully-realized individual with their own strengths and weaknesses. The player's interactions with these characters, whether through dialogue or combat, help to shape the course of the story and ultimately determine the fate of the world.\n\nThe gameplay itself is both challenging and rewarding, with players having to make strategic decisions about party composition, equipment, and tactics in order to overcome the game's many challenges. The combat system is dynamic and engaging, with players being able to pause the action at any time to issue commands to their party members. This allows for a level of strategy and control that is rarely seen in RPGs.\n\nOverall, Dragon Age Origins is a true gem of a game, one that stands as a testament to the power of great storytelling and immersive gameplay. It is a game that rewards exploration, encourages player agency, and offers countless hours of entertainment for anyone who is willing to delve into its intricacies. If you are a fan of RPGs or simply enjoy a great story, then Dragon Age Origins is an absolute must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1677627658, "timestamp_updated": 1677627658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133828165": {"recommendationid": "133828165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281098116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1677725568}, "language": "english", "review": "Me like good video game.

This has the classic charming clunkiness of older games that haven't been streamlined to make an easy experience, meaning you  have to focus on every character in combat and spec your character to a specific strength early on, making party cohesion crucial. The cutscenes and story moments were genuinely cool and Orzammar might be my favorite hub/combat area ever (I'm a sucker for the classic Dwarven aesthetics and environments.) After a while of playing, combat can be a slog, but the story and side content were interesting enough to be well worth the time spent; not to mention the characters. Each party member (aside from the dog) have their own stories that are very much worth the time invested which made this game one of the most memorable party-focused RPG's I've ever played. Not for everyone, but if you like old-school game difficulty and don't mind committing a lot of time to playing, it's worth a buy.

Things to note, this is an older title. The graphics and gameplay are reflective on this but neither of which bother me. If you ask old fans, origins is the best game in the series and the games slowly got worse overtime. With newer fans, inquisition is the favorite for its looks, open world, and sheer amount of things to do. I started the series with origins and I do believe it is the best game in the series and you will never get the same feeling with 2 and inquisition. There is so much character and choice and wonder that I could make another character today and still have a lot of fun experiencing the story in a slightly different way. What makes this game the most fun for me is that I feel the characters were the most interesting and entertaining compared to the other games. \nDragon age 2 will always hold a special place in my heart because for the only time in the series, you aren't the fabled chosen one to save the land like you are in origins and inquisition. You're pretty much just a normal person trying to make something for yourself in an already crowded city where they don't want you there in the first place. By the time you do, there are challenges building up around the city that you can try your best to conquer or diffuse but in the end, you can't do much but experience the crumbling of society around you.\nDragon age inquisition is by no means a bad game, in fact its quite refreshing to explore the growing world of dragon age with far less restriction and feel the good you are doing for this land. The combat is the most fluid in this game whether you like it or not. Some people like the more rigidness of the first as you have more time to plan out each character's attack with combos and whatnot. \nSomething interesting to note is that while this game is a series, each game is its own. What I mean is in a series like Mass Effect where it more or less seems like you're picking up where you left off, in Dragon age you start somewhere different and always have to make a new character. Also if you plan on playing the whole series, make sure you transfer saves over so you can actually see different events in the next game based upon what you did in the previous. \nI'll end with this: Dragon Age will always hold a special place in my heart and opened my eyes to the whole rpg genre. I used to mostly play shooters growing up but now I take chances on rpgs I'm not sure I'll like as I did with dragon age. It's what led me to the Witcher series which is quite similar in progression to Dragon age. In both series, the first game had the oldest feeling combat system that quickly changed in the second installment. The third was more of an evolution of the new combat introduced in the second and felt more refined. Where these games differ in combat, was the Witcher evolved into a more hack and slash that was quite fun to play and Dragon age became a more real time rpg with no turn base or grid system. The Witcher 3 has gotten high praise over the years where Dragon age inquisition has more or less faded into the background. I very much look forward to Dragon age 4 but I have no expectations of the game reminding me of Origins.

one of those RPGs you can't help but repeatedly replay on multiple platforms.

Frankly, those bugs didn't disturb me, so I finished without problems. I'm in love with the characters and music, shame that the Grey Warden doesn't have a voice actor since I played Dragon Age 2 first, but you're getting used to it. I love the plot and adore the world of Thedas. Bioware's creative Team is so good that I bought all novels about Dragon Age Universe. And you know what - they are great! Even liked them much more than the Mass Effects novels. I'm an absolute fan; that's why I can't wait for Bioware's next creations. It'll be a great success if they are filled with live characters, rich lore, and an exciting plot. Don't make huge maps with blank spaces or nothing to do. I'm having flashbacks from the Anthem, which is beautiful, but so not catchy, so empty that you don't remember a thing.

So I thought hey, it's on sale so might as well get it on Steam. I was scared that I wasn't gonna like it that much anymore but it still holds up so well in 2023 (especially with a couple of texture mods). \n\nLet's start at the beginning - despite its age, DA:O still offers a lot of choices regarding character creation. From the most hideous make-up you've ever seen (in a good but also funny way) to quite a lot of customization options regarding the shape of your face, your hair, etc., it has not everything but a lot to satisfy the cravings to create a cool (or uncool) character. Unfortunately your voice doesn't matter much as DA:O's player character obviously has dialogue but no voice. A bit sad but a minor flaw. \n\nThe game's start is very unique as you can choose one of six origins (thus, the name) all depending on your race, your class and your social standing. All of these origins merge into the actual game that starts quite quickly before slowing down to carefully build up one of my favorite video-game worlds of all time. That world-building goes hand in hand with the main quest which makes you seek out the major races in the game. Plenty of serious main quests, goofy side quests and interesting companion quests await. And companions is where DA:O really shines. A lot of different people will join you on your mission to save the world and honestly, all of them are worth spending time on/with. While there are certainly stereotypes like the drunk stinky dwarf or the \"witch\" whose intentions aren't quite clear, these characters are one of the main reason that makes the game shine. When it comes to the story, the characters and the dialogue, this is probably one of Bioware's all time best games. And hey, all of the romances are definitely worth a shot. No pun intended. \n\nDA:Origins' combat is where the game might fall flat for a couple of people. It is very slow and can feel heavy and awkward since it is quite outdated. If you want to play on a higher difficulty, simply bashing through it is also not the wisest idea. Tactics are a thing and definitely need to be used on anything above Normal. The skill trees offer quite a bit of variety and while some things may look goofy (looking at you, mages), it still holds up for the most part. \n\nThe playtime with all DLCs is probably about 40-60 hours, depending how thorough you are. The correct order is Leliana\u2019s Song > Awakening > Golems of Amgarrak > Witch Hunt, although the first and the third one aren't as important lore-wise in my opinion. One last thing about Dragon Age is probably the thing I love the most about this series - choices do matter. A LOT. Especially main quest ones, but also side quest choices. And honestly? I'm all in for that. \n\nTL;DR. Absolutely fantastic world building and a unique story makes up for slow combat. Funny dialogue, important choices and endearing yet at times questionable companions make DA:Origins a very solid 9.5/10 for me, even after 10 years.", "timestamp_created": 1676300650, "timestamp_updated": 1676300650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132764607": {"recommendationid": "132764607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039084174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4895, "last_played": 1676281010}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10 even in 2023 and holds up well enough.

It helped me tremendously and I wish I found it sooner:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL1oFoOaNwk&ab_channel=JustCallMeFrosty\n\nAfter having this game on my backlog for over a decade I finally decided to go back and complete it. I'm someone that is a sl*t for graphics these days but I was able to put that in the back of my mind with how incredible this game is with it's storytelling. It's not the prettiest game ever but it doesn't look bad either, Bioware just doesn't know how to do hairstyles to save their life! Dragon Age is arguably my second most favorite series of all time so I had already played Dragon Age 2 & Inquisition prior to playing Origins. It's hard not to have been spoiled on what all happened in Origins due to all the callbacks in the sequels so I knew some things coming in but didn't mind, I love the lore regardless. But now I finally get to fully understand the history and why the Hero of Ferelden and the companions were so beloved as well as the game itself. I'm a sucker for the romance focus in these games but overall I really, really enjoyed it.\n\n-To start with praises:\nMy Rogue City Elf (Probably the most fun class in the game alongside mages imo, always pick an elf) got to set the tone for the rest of the series as I play through them once more before DreadWolf comes. This game has a lot of depth and surprised me with the amount of effect your choices have on the world. You can easily get distracted for hours on interesting side quests. One of my favorite things were the fact that you can talk to a random person on the street without any sort of marker above their head and they might have a full set of dialogue about current events and etc. The companions are a blast, I enjoyed Zevran and Alistair in particular the most. The tactics system was okay and helped with not having to micromanage but tedious to set up if you're like me and enjoy using every companion now and then. \nMy favorite thing is probably the origin story you can select at the start of character creation, your race, which origin you select, it feels like a tag that sticks with you throughout the game and not one of those things you pick in other games and it doesn't matter for the rest of the time you're playing. Not to mention you get an entirely unique opening to the game based on what class and origin you selected, that makes this game in the series stand out quite a bit.\n(Curse them for making me play a human in DA2)\n\n-Nitpicks:\nNot a big fan of the combat and the way you have to maneuver around in it. It obviously feels a bit aged and much different from most games these days. To be fair I am used to more modern gameplay and prefer the combat to DA2 & Inquisition. And without the respec mod, I would have had a major headache setting up my class right the first go around. Blame that on me if you like. There is also only TWO recruitable mages in the base game, so if you don't make friends with one of those, you might as well say goodbye to your party's healer. Using the respec mod on Morrigan for example allowed me to make her my party's healer early on. That mod alone made the game far more enjoyable.\nI also have never particularly enjoyed the Deep Roads in any of the games, this one is no different for me, but others might love them! The game also has certain sounds that will absolutely deafen you sometimes but I grew used to it after awhile. Overall I feel the positives outweighed the negatives.\n\nSome mods i'd personally like to recommend:\n-Extra Dog Slot\n-Respecialization\n-No Helmet Hack\n-Forced Deathblows\n-Morrigan Restoration Patch (For those Morrigan lovers out there like me)\n\n-Also if you are entirely new to the series, i recommend using Dragon Age Keep to save your decisions throughout the series. Beware though, sometimes the site can spoil you on certain events if you click on them before playing through it in the game.

I'd heard good things about DAI, so I decided to do a play through of the entire series. I use Linux, and I had some difficulty getting DAO running. I almost gave up, but I'm glad I didn't. After I got it working, it ran flawlessly (maybe better than Windows if some of the reviews are accurate? Thank you Valve!).\n\nIn my opinion, the story is fantastic, and there was always something to keep me interested. At no point did I feel like it was dragging on. Building relationships with the characters was rewarding, and learning their stories was too. There was some tough decisions along the way, and sometimes someone I had grown close to broke away and ended the relationship. This genuinely upset me, and had I been smarter with saves, I would have gone back and made different choices. Still, this game seems to reward your choices with meaningful consequences, and the \"Origins system\" does a great job at making how you start out meaningful.\n\n The world building was great, and I can't wait to explore more of Thedas in the remaining games (\"Mountains, Gandalf! I want to see mountains!\").\n\nCombat and character progression is rewarding too, and not overwhelming. I always felt like I knew what to do with my characters stats and levels, something I sometimes struggle with in other games.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, but I was surprised at how well they've held up (although graphics don't make or break a game for me). There are some areas that are still beautiful.\n\nBut, the [i]music[/i] is incredible. I could loop the music from the title screen for a long time. I was also surprised to see that 30 Seconds to Mars wrote and sang a song that plays during the credits! And it's great!

I then decided a few years ago to do a similar thing, again to no avail. As one of my final games of 2022, I decided to mod this thing up once and for all and attempt to delve deep into Ferelden in hopes of finding an experience truly worth the game's epic namesake. I have to say that after all of this time waiting, I've been disappointed again (surprise, surprise).\n\nMaybe this game would have been better had I played it more around its release (or, you know, just was older in general), but I found so much of this game to feel far more dated than some of the other \"great\" games from 2009. Yes, the game's writing is solid enough \"character-wise\", and yes, the game contains impressively rich lore as per BioWare's typical offerings, but I just couldn't really harness any more fun out of this one outside of those aspects.\n\nThe combat is incredibly stiff and unsatisfying to me. This may have to do with the game's unimpresive animation at times, but I've seen people bring up that this system is mechanically deep (which I wouldn't argue with). Yet, I never found it *fun* to interact with. Attacks were automated and rigid, the mana/stamina systems felt overly restrictive, and in-game tactics required a constant hampering of combat pacing. For my experience in any RPG with combat, I still need to feel like I'm \"taking part\" in a battle AND have a direct way of influencing it. It's kind of the point of having diversity in builds and whatnot. In [b] Dragon Age: Origins [/b], it feels more like you come across enemies and slowly slap them around a bit with some uninteresting abilities until one side fully dies. Well, unless you're a mage that is.\n\nSee, [b] DA: Origins [/b] is absolutely clear with its intentions - in the world of Ferelden, magic is power, and everything else is just secondary. This applies both to the actual power levels of each class as well as the number of interesting things you can do with them. As a Warrior or Rogue, most skills revolve around drawing attention/distracting enemies and stunning or charging up powerful attacks. Typical stuff, but it's limited to this for a nearly fifty hour main campaign (even disregarding side content). The thing is, once you choose a class, you're stuck with them. Sorry! Better luck next time. (Unless you utilize a mod to change this, but it wouldn't really prove as a smooth transition to suddenly go from lumbering, beast warrior to fragile, reclusive mage)\n\nIf you are smart enough to play as a mage though, well, you're in for a treat. [b] Origins [/b] provides a slew of fun tools to play around with, ranging from necromancy to divination, even spells covering the whole classic catalog of fire, air, ice, electricity, etc. As a mage, you actually FEEL powerful, or at least feel like you have potential to become so. This is massive flaw since none of the other classes feel this way, and this is evident when you start to interact with the party system. Mages are awesome...except for that they're built like actual twigs, snapping at any moment of exposure to direct combat.\n\nNow, I chose my character to be a warrior. Boo-hoo, bad choice, I guess, but at least he was a damage tank. However, in [b] Origins [/b] you can pretty much control another character in everything except direct dialogue, meaning you can have your character be the \"Frodo\" to someone else's \"Sam\" (there are still debates on who the main character is in \"LOTR\"). I can switch to being a mage, or rogue, or fricking GOLEM mid-combat! It's actually a cool concept for a game to have...until you realize most other characters aren't that fun to play as.\n\nWhile magic provides for interesting tools to play around with, the actual act of playing with them is very stripped back. You click a button, see an extended animation, and watch your character send their attack towards an enemy...only to miss? This game utilizes a random attack succession system and lord does it fail to make combat feel \"realistic\", nonetheless \"fun\". The game starts to feel more like a battle management simulator, and this is far different than a direct-control RPG in many elements. One of the things that suffers the most from this in my opinion is the game's immersion.\n\n[/b] Origins [/b] does not have a strong plot. It's simple and it works for sure, but it boils down quickly to \"recruit allies, fight evil, save the world\". It is not very subtle with this either, thus much of the game's true narrative is actual within character interactions. These are very solid, hell some of the better characters I've seen in interactive fiction. Yet, the \"Alistair's\", \"Morrigan's\", and \"Zevran's\" of gaming can't fully shine without immersion, and I constantly found mine broken through the rugged simplicity of the plot and the bland combat.\n\nWhat also ruined my experience was how slow the game felt. I try to be patient with games but forgive me if I don't want to spend a few hours exploring a mine for a small relic for a section of one main mission. This type of mission made the game DRAG for some many hours, and by the time I got to \"Orzammar\" and the \"Deep Roads\" I just had enough. I couldn't do any more quests like \"The Fade\" stuff either (though I'm pretty sure that was undoubtedly the worst part of the game).\n\nTo add on top of this, the Darkspawn NEVER feel like a true threat, and there's no sense of pressure through gameplay or writing that indicates this. It's only characters \"talking\" about how bad they are, but besides the early sections of the game, you can go almost to the very end without being SHOWN their tenacity. They're literally just \"evil monsters\" and that's it.\n\nThere's no doubt that [b] Origins [/b] was made with love and care, especially for the theme, genre, and lore throughout. There's an absolute truckload of material to read through in this game, and lore nerds would find much to love from the way BioWare unravels this universe. However, the game is just not very fun to play outside of dialogue interactions. Movement is cumbersome and clunky, combat lacks proper feedback and is restrictive to a key class, and the overall plot struggles with pacing and tension - one of the most important aspects of any RPG story. [b] Mass Effect [/b] may be less mechanically deep than [b] Origins [/b], but it was more fun because of its pacing.\n\nLook, if you enjoy this game, good for you. I'm late to this party like most people, but I never really got behind the \"real-time combat\" genre. You could call me \"impatient\" (I played fifty hours, so f*ck me right?), but I think games should be a \"bit\" stronger with getting things moving along UNLESS they have a strong gameplay loop. Plus, my reviews aren't factual - look at the average review to see how people who play it feel about their experience. My experience, however, was pretty middling, so seeing people call it a masterpiece sort of causes me to scoff. Different strokes, I guess. [b] Dragon Age: Origins [/b] is, frankly, not one of those games.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 5/10 (Average) [/h2]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my curator page for my thoughts on a variety of other games!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/37542043-ADHD-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1674764350, "timestamp_updated": 1675486976, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482359856367111206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131605705": {"recommendationid": "131605705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176490923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1522351033}, "language": "english", "review": "Still a masterpiece!", "timestamp_created": 1674760572, "timestamp_updated": 1674760572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131601180": {"recommendationid": "131601180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078879888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1188, "last_played": 1674844567}, "language": "english", "review": "Morrigan", "timestamp_created": 1674755470, "timestamp_updated": 1674755470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131601123": {"recommendationid": "131601123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087662905", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 55374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46991, "last_played": 1686434565}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1674755406, "timestamp_updated": 1674755406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131569984": {"recommendationid": "131569984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857679304", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3886, "last_played": 1660176025}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

Considering when DA originally dropped I had put over 100 hours into this amazing game I'm going back in, doing a different playthrough with a diff character and am looking forward to this game all over again. \n\nI will say this. While the world of DA: Origins has held up very nicely with the musical score, the stories, the characters, etc, the graphics not so much. While it still looks like a PS3 game it's still very much an epic story worth experiencing again and again.

A lot. I ended up beating the original campaign four times and the prologue of five of the six origins. I also played Awakening twice and my last playthrough from beginning to end. What really makes it stand out as a CRPG is it's origin system which is incredibly unique and ambitious. Minor characters like a shopkeeper in one playthrough could have a whole backstory in another. It truly gives a lot of different ways of roleplaying your character. For multiple playthroughs I highly recommend some mods to skip some parts of the game such as Ostagar, the Fade and the Deep Roads as it makes the replaying less of a chore. Don't worry, these mods keep you the option to still play the content but skip some of these parts if you prefer which get a bit long in the tooth in my mind.\n\nThe world and lore of Thedas is also quite interesting and well thought out and makes me excited to think of all the factions and kingdoms we can explore in later entries in the series. What truly makes or breaks a party based RPG like this are its companions and this came pulls no punches, having some of the best ensemble in the genre. While you make like some companions over others, they all have their interesting moments whether through battle or banter. Through different playthroughs I found myself surprised how certain characters I wrote of ended up growing on me depending on the origin I was playing. The intimacy of talking to your companions when you set up camp always brings a cozy vibe and are among the best parts in the game. The quieter moments before the dungeon crawl. There's also romances, which can be sweet minus the bizarre janky animations in the love scenes.\n\nAs for combat it's overall pretty good though it definitely shows its age, and this is someone who loves older school games. Combat flows a lot better than the KOTOR games and the amount of abilities and spells at your disposal are quite incredible. The combat is a bit on the slower, tactical side which works in its favor. That doesn't mean there aren't problems, sometimes characters will have a hard time 'locking on' to an enemy in melee. \n\nThe skill trees I also have a mixed feelings over as some skills feel like repeats (the shield skills have multiple variations of a shield bash ability for example). Or in order to unlock a skill you want like the spell Mana Clash which is excellent for shutting down spellcasters you'd have to spend precious skill points on some underwhelming abilities you'll probably never use at all. I understand sometimes putting points in abilities to unlock the 'good stuff' but it doesn't always feel great in this game. The class specializations are also very fun such as the Blood Mage, and since you can have more than one specialization it really gives lots of options\n\nThere is a lot of content and DLC to keep you playing for a long time. There's a lot to love. It sits in a weird spot in gaming.

If you find yourself able to work passed the jank of it crashing occasionally, I quicksave constantly, then I promise you'll have an unforgettable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1674167465, "timestamp_updated": 1674167465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131171437": {"recommendationid": "131171437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198194758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8569, "last_played": 1677934482}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1674166967, "timestamp_updated": 1674166967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131142797": {"recommendationid": "131142797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023308769", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 5776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5776, "last_played": 1485706134}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Dragon Age game", "timestamp_created": 1674131517, "timestamp_updated": 1674131517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131128237": {"recommendationid": "131128237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101378194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 23169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20893, "last_played": 1690424936}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played a lot of single-player RPG's, and this is hands down the best I've ever played.\n\nIf you like character-driven, dialogue heavy games, you will love this. This is peak Bioware.\nEvery character is written in a way that makes them complex and compelling; you will spend hours getting to know them and exploring their sprawling dialogue trees. \n\nThe story is fantastic. A classic tale of good vs. evil, with just enough plot twists and surprises to keep you interested. You may have thought the medieval fantasy genre had exhausted itself, but you would be wrong. The sheer creativity in the writing has crafted a world so fleshed out and lived-in, you'll feel transported.\n\nThe combat may feel dated to some, but I honestly find this system more interesting and engaging than in newer Dragon Age games. I love the tactical pausing-based strategy system. This type of gameplay is especially fun if you play as a mage; you have the freedom to be endlessly creative with wild spell combos.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can't find anything major to complain about here.

The icon. The one that started it all\nI do not know if anyone is still in need of the review for this game, but if there is a soul out there akin to little me who started with the DA spiral with DAII and took very long time to get conviced to play the Origins, maybe this review will help the all three of you out there.\n\nFirst of all- does it hold up? The answer is a resounding yes! I would say that the experince is on par with newer games in the franchise, at times even exceeding the rest. The combat system is easy to grasp, graphics look suprisingly well and the world while not the most spacious or inviting feels quite fitting for the mood of the story.\n\nThere are few things that one may consider annoying however- one of them being lack of clear directionts through most of the quests. This may be a benefit to ones who feel annoyed with much more hand-holdy approach of later instalments but for the ones who dislike having to stumble through the questline and just take guesses what they should do next, this may get a bit annoying at times. Often  it's left entirely up to player what they feel like doing next and while I can imagine many will welcmoe the freedom- while there are no wrong choices there definitely are ones that will make you wish to just let 2 hours of gameplay go to waste and start over with a diffrent route,  Quests are often vague and require you to go throug mechanics that aren't always all that intuitive. Similar thing can be said about romance mechanics- as someone very much used to the clearly marked dialogue options I was suprised just how easy it is to accidentaly stumble into romatic relationship with someone in this game. I can again imagine this being a benefit to some who wish for a more immersive experince, but I do also recognize some people play DA with a very clear idea of how they want the events to play out and having to turn down Zevran may have not been part of this vision. All around be prepared for a lot more running around, and figuring things out as you go for better or worse.\n\nAlso I think it goes without saying- the game has bugs and gliches. Lots of them. From ones as innocent as characters and animals changing colors as you walk by them to quest NPCs just disappearing making it impossible to finish said quest. WhIch is then just left in that journal. Taunting you, Forever.\nSo as always rememberto save often- autosave is as per usual unreliable.\n\nNow to the good stuff- the characters, worldbuilding and questlines are at their peak. Almost every part of the story is investing, almost all the characters will make you feel some type of way. There is a reason why Morrigan and Alistair remain fan favourites to this day. Admitably some get more development and quakity writing then others but in general I see no dead weight pulled around here and despite the lack of Warden's voiceacting, Origins manages to get in some of the most fun banter I've got in any game.\nThe plot goes to dark places but still often manages to give satysfing conclusions. Some of the choices should honestly give player a pause.\nI also would like to take a moment to praise Shale specifically- despite being a DLC character, she seldom feels like an add-on. She is involved in the story, feels like unique and fun adittion to the party, her questline is not completely detached from the main plot and I can have a dialogue with her without  constant  urge to facepalm... looking at you Sebastian, the blandest piece of man-shaped pixels to ever grace a computer screen.\n\nAll in all avery solid, worthwhile if quite long experience.

Maybe it's because I was an Arcane Warrior Blood Mage though. \nAlso, the entire Orzammar section was awful, I really couldn't stand it, nothing about it was fun or engaging.\n\nThe graphics are still amazing, even after all this time.

I personally fell in love with this game since 2012 when I was but a small lad trying my hand at RPGs, if my memory doesn't fail me now this was my first ever played RPG.

What do I mean by such words? The world building, the characters and nearly the entire setting down to the details of the armor make it actually pretty neat to explore. I wish they added a bit more content and didn't resort to simply to copy pasting sometimes but alas such is the world of gaming development.\n\nExploring this behemoth of a game was a joy to ride along and see and read about the world at large, see the various outcome of the quests and seeing the areas I missed along the way in the first play.\nThis game is surely worth playing for the story alone but some people might find it about clunky and old and I don't blame them, this is after all, a old game that maintain its charm but didn't hold up well in another zones though I still enjoy every aspect of this old ghost of the past.\n\nA truly sad day when we didn't see the old glory of Bioware's writing and game building in later games alas, they started to slowly and rapidly fade out with DA 2 then become a hit or miss type of deal with DA Inquisition, let's pray Dreadwolf at least bring up some of that magic that Origins had.\n\nConclusion, get this game and enjoy yourself one of the last great Bioware titles before EA corrupted them.", "timestamp_created": 1673525499, "timestamp_updated": 1673525730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130680588": {"recommendationid": "130680588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260405908", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 7947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7947, "last_played": 1649404297}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.

And what can I say..?\n\nAll that people.. they were right. It's been ages since I don't play a game like this , a game that has soul , you can see how whoever worked in this game loved it. Although I'm not finished yet I'm very much liking the story and what I've played so far , companions are so well writen...\n\nEven if from 2010 , slap a couple of mods to it! hehe.\n\nThis game made me a fan of the whole saga. I very much recommend it to any RPG lover.
