With the convenience of online distribution, developers have transitioned these former staples into digital formats, if the game even comes with one. Those who grew up playing the fifth generation of consoles understand that manuals are essential to enriching one\u2019s experience. Many provide lore and backstory while teaching you how to play. In an age where they are a dying breed, Tunic takes the manual to the next level and incorporates it directly into the game, encouraging players to pay attention and use its clues to decipher puzzles. Ironic, considering that players control an illiterate fox. \n\nTunic combines Legend of Zelda gameplay with Souls-like combat to create an exploration focused adventure. This is a game that absolutely refuses to hold your hand. Getting lost is common but don\u2019t be discouraged. Unless you are attempting to 100%, most of the puzzles are reasonable. It\u2019s only when you are attempting a completionist run that the game rears an ugly head. Some puzzles, including the one needed for the True End, are so obscure they border on perplexing. The manual also sorely lacks a way to bookmark pages for quick access. Rifling through just to return to the overworld map gets tedious fast. \n\nDespite these complaints, Tunic is a brilliant experience that comes off both nostalgic and fresh. It\u2019s a meticulously crafted time capsule that\u2019ll take you back to the days where you wrote down secret codes and inputs, where every discovery felt like uncovering ancient treasure the devs buried, and piecing together clues made you feel every bit as smart as those grown-ups.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1700395464, "timestamp_updated": 1700395464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642857134342193604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150411631": {"recommendationid": "150411631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043311290", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 555, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1700378373}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunate that the game focuses so much on combat despite being its only bad aspect.", "timestamp_created": 1700380250, "timestamp_updated": 1700380250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150410181": {"recommendationid": "150410181", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057548721", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1698635466}, "language": "english", "review": "I get it.

Great music. Great graphics. I love the guide book being a part of the game. It's all excellent. \n\nUntil you actually have to do it.

The game really seems to want to target something 30 feet away that isn't going to attack me over the large hulking monstrosity that's 4 feet in front of me an actively trying to kill me. The game also auto targets... sometimes. Not all the time. Just sometimes.

You see, we're a tiny little fox with a tiny little sword and tiny little legs. We are not fast. We do not have range. We can't reach anything. But just about half the enemies in the game including bosses, move like cheetahs, get in, wreck your face, and get out before you can reach them. So you either spend most of your time chasing after enemies - bosses or not - or trying to block/evade without getting yourself too far away to actually hit the damned thing. \n\nIt really is a shame that it's such a good game and so not fun to play. I've played other games with similar styles and they eventually grew on me and I was able to enjoy it. Tunic, unfortunately, isn't doing that.

However, it's so, so much not for me, and I want to explore why.\n\nDo you know the stories of when Kojima worked at Konami and that he was so weird with his gameplay ideas that there was always some dude watching over him and occasionally saying \"Kojima, for the love of GOD, dial it down a notch\"? I'm a game developer myself, experienced seeing such people as well. Tunic was made as if it never had such a dude at all.\n\nI cannot comprehend who on earth would think that the first NES Zelda is a decent game. I also think this way about Dark Souls, but that's a more of a personal thing for me, as I know lots of people enjoy it. This game just smells of this idea \"hey wouldn't it be cool if we crossed the first zelda with dark souls?\". The whole manual-collecting thing is a cool concept, but it wants to play so hard into the mystery that the game has its own language to obfuscate info. But, oh gosh, QA figured out that this way nothing can be understood by some people, so some important text is still in English, making this obfuscation automatically artsy-fartsy pretentious.\n\nTons of the game also relies on unmarked secrets for progression, leading to getting stuck and being like doomguy hugging every wall in the original doom, only there it was for bonuses and was not vital. Some mechanics, although were explained in the manual (I think), could not be reliably executed, roll->attack for example, leading me to question if the game gaslights me with insufficient info, or if it's just a janky bugfest.\n\nOh, and the whole DS stuff. \"Ha-ha, anything kills you in 1-2 hits, ha-ha!\". I personally very much dislike this design and consider it cheap. It's not at all how zelda games play out, not even the latest, harder BOTW and TOTK. I could enable the relaxed difficulty in the accessibility settings, but I don't trust the game already! What'll it do behind my back with this option? Will it force me onto an automatic bad ending? Lock me out from it altogether? I'm paranoid already! The game made me paranoid!\n\nThe production of it is so, so great though, with genuinely great soundtrack, sound design and cleverly realized artistic rendering features. It's a joy experiencing it. For that reason alone I wanted to finish it, but the entire gimmick of it and the gameplay drive me nuts.\n\nThe developers clearly wanted to invite you and explore its every nook and cranny, and it has secrets in spades, even leading up to ARG content for the most dedicated ones, and that's great. However, in the end, at least for me, it doesn't become cryptic or mysterious, it becomes outright pretentiously hostile due to a portion of these secrets being obscenely mandatory and cryptic. I didn't enjoy solving them and battling against the mechanics of the game when I just wanted to move on.

Es raro, porque como tal los Zelda cl\u00e1sicos no es que presenten nada que a priori sea dif\u00edcil de copiar, pero no ser\u00e1 tan f\u00e1cil de hacer cuando tantos lo intentan y casi ninguno lo consigue.\n\nTunic bebe mucho de los Zeldas originales, especialmente del primero de NES y de \u201cA Link to the Past\u201d, y aunque no es un Zelda como tal, ya que ni siquiera hay poblados ni interacci\u00f3n alguna con otros personajes digna de menci\u00f3n, s\u00ed que se siente esa vibra tan magn\u00edfica que tiene esa gran saga. Esto tiene sus matices, pero digamos que consigue en buena medida presentar una aventura con un aire totalmente cl\u00e1sico, realmente entretenido y muy desafiante en algunos momentos.\n\n[h1]Cripticismo por bandera[/h1]\nSi hay algo que vas a experimentar constantemente en Tunic es no saber qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 pasando, sobre todo al principio. Esto puede desanimar a algunos, ya que no a todo el mundo le gusta lanzarse a la aventura sin tener al menos un sost\u00e9n argumentativo al que agarrarse, pero Tunic es as\u00ed. De todos modos, lo mejor es marchar hacia adelante y ya veremos qu\u00e9 va pasando mientras avanzamos.\n\nEsto no quiere decir que nos vayamos a perder y no saber qu\u00e9 hacer en absoluto. El juego est\u00e1 muy bien planteado para que no podamos acceder a determinados sitios si no poseemos un arma, un objeto o una habilidad en particular, as\u00ed que la sensaci\u00f3n de estar perdidos existe, pero nunca lo estaremos de tal modo que no encontremos c\u00f3mo progresar en la aventura.\n\nEl juego es cr\u00edptico desde el primer momento hasta bien llegada su parte final, pero mientras m\u00e1s vayamos avanzando mejor iremos comprendiendo ese mundo, aunque use un lenguaje inventado que no podemos descifrar salvo por palabras sueltas escritas en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nYa de hecho nada m\u00e1s comenzar lo haremos tirados en una playa, y sin arma o protecci\u00f3n alguna. Pero nada temas, pues nuestro zorrete tendr\u00e1 su primera arma en una casa muy cerca de donde est\u00e1: un magn\u00edfico palo de madera. No es que nos quedara muy claro lo que indicaba el cartel que le\u00edmos antes de entrar en esa casa, ya que, como he dicho, el idioma es inventado. Pero es un palo, y seguro que todo el mundo sabe c\u00f3mo usarlo, incluido nuestro zorrete.\n\nM\u00e1s adelante, encontraremos una p\u00e1gina suelta tirada en el suelo, y al leerla veremos que hemos encontrado el mejor tesoro que posee este juego: el manual.\n\n[h1]\u00a1Mi reino por un manual completo![/h1]\nSin duda, es extraordinariamente original meter dentro de un juego el manual del mismo juego desperdigando sus p\u00e1ginas por los diferentes lugares que visitaremos. Es una manera brutal de romper la cuarta pared, ya que cuando lo consultamos, lo cual haremos bastante a menudo una vez conseguidas las p\u00e1ginas de los mapas y mazmorras, el juego har\u00e1 un efecto de zum alejado de tal modo que la pantalla del juego se convertir\u00e1 en una televisi\u00f3n de las antiguas de tubo, con el manual en primer plano. \n\nDe todos modos, no hay que emocionarse en exceso, porque el manual es casi tan cr\u00edptico como los carteles o las pocas \u201cconversaciones\u201d que podamos ver dentro del juego. La diferencia es que tendr\u00e1 palabras sueltas en espa\u00f1ol aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1, y as\u00ed se podr\u00e1 deducir qu\u00e9 es o qu\u00e9 hace tal o cual objeto, o por d\u00f3nde tenemos que tirar en esa mazmorra que nos tiene un tanto perdidos.\n\nYo no hab\u00eda visto una cosa igual llevada a tal extremo, y solo puedo definirlo como una aut\u00e9ntica genialidad. Al final, querr\u00e1s ir recogiendo m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s hojas, para enterarte de m\u00e1s cosas sobre el argumento central del juego y qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 haciendo el zorrete, qu\u00e9 pasa en ese mundo y cu\u00e1l es nuestro papel en \u00e9l. En este aspecto, no encontrar\u00e1s nada ni remotamente parecido en otro juego. Sublime podr\u00eda ser una palabra bastante acertada para definirlo.\n\n[h1]Combate, exploraci\u00f3n y mazmorras[/h1]\nDicho esto, el juego no se basa en ir recogiendo hojas de un manual, eso es un a\u00f1adido fundamental, pero no su n\u00facleo jugable. El juego es b\u00e1sicamente un Zelda cl\u00e1sico en su vertiente de acci\u00f3n, donde tendremos que explorar el entorno, visitar diferentes biomas, entrar en mazmorras e ir descubriendo poco a poco sus secretos mientras nos hacemos con nuevas armas, objetos y habilidades.\n\nEl combate es bastante b\u00e1sico, basado principalmente en el ataque, la esquiva y el uso del escudo una vez obtenido, pero funciona de maravilla. Es tremendamente din\u00e1mico y muy entretenido. En mi opini\u00f3n no es nada dif\u00edcil, sino que su dificultad es perfecta para ser un reto, pero sin llegar a frustrar. Ya sabes, de esos combates tipo: \u201cMe han dejado el ojal como un bebedero de patos, pero s\u00e9 que puedo pasarlo si me concentro\u201d. Bueno, esto solo pasar\u00e1 con algunos jefes finales realmente, y el \u00faltimo combate s\u00ed puede llegar a ser bastante frustrante, pero nada imposible tampoco. \n\nEn s\u00ed, el combate cumple a la perfecci\u00f3n, pero no es el punto donde reside su dificultad. Su dificultad reside m\u00e1s en la resoluci\u00f3n de puzles, y m\u00e1s a\u00fan si quieres descubrirlo todo.\n\n[h1]Puzles que te har\u00e1n pensar[/h1]\nNo es que los puzles en general sean una locura en su dificultad, pero s\u00ed que te obligan a fijarte en el entorno. B\u00e1sicamente, casi todos los puzles se basan en tirar de palancas, presionar placas para abrir nuevos caminos, utilizar determinados objetos y ese tipo de cosas. De hecho, no dista mucho de lo que puede verse en \u201cA Link to the Past\u201d, pero algunos tienen un a\u00f1adido realmente sorprendente: tu propio mando.\n\nAntiguamente, era com\u00fan meter combinaciones de pulsaciones en un juego para obtener alg\u00fan tipo de beneficio como desbloquear personajes, m\u00e1s vida y ese tipo de cosas. Era una especie de truco que generalmente se utilizaba en el men\u00fa principal y conllevaba pulsar diferentes patrones de arriba, abajo, izquierda dos veces y este tipo de cosas. Tunic hace uso de eso, pero directamente aplicado en el juego, y te \u201cchiva\u201d lo que tienes que hacer bien sea en un muro de piedra o directamente en el manual con anotaciones hechas con boli. Tremendamente original esto \u00faltimo.\n\nPor ejemplo, si estamos delante de una puerta o una pared y vemos un patr\u00f3n, igual te da por presionar el pad en esas direcciones que se indica en el dibujo y suena una musiquilla indicando que eres tope listo, y te sientes genial. A m\u00ed me pas\u00f3, y he de admitir que me pareci\u00f3 incre\u00edble que funcionara. Lo hice por hacerlo, por hacer la tonter\u00eda, pero no lo era en absoluto, sino justamente lo que ten\u00eda que hacer.\n\nDe todos modos, tienes que tener claro que este tipo de puzles de pulsaciones solo son en su mayor\u00eda para conseguirlo todo, y no se abusa demasiado de esto para terminar la aventura y se suele indicar en el manual \u201cclaramente\u201d lo que hay que hacer en esos casos, as\u00ed que no desesperes.\n\nAunque es cierto que a los desarrolladores se les fue la mano con algunos coleccionables, y es verdad que las instrucciones est\u00e1n en el manual, pero deducirlo hasta ese nivel en algunas ocasiones ya es un tanto \u201cporque patata\u201d. De todos modos, esto \u00faltimo no es necesario para acabar el juego como he dicho.\n\n[h1]Conclusiones[/h1]\nCada cierto tiempo sale al mercado un juego que es pura originalidad se mire por donde se mire. Tunic es uno de esos juegos. Tiene la virtud de ofrecer un planteamiento cl\u00e1sico y adem\u00e1s llegar en su planteamiento jugable a donde ning\u00fan otro juego ha llegado.

No real tutorial, and it works great (mostly)\n\n(=) A lot of the gameplay is typical zelda/metroidvania stuff. Not terrible, but a bit rote as a core gameplay loop (i.e. you see heavy bushes, you know you need to unlock some item and come back later to go down that path).\n\n(-) I did not enjoy the combat all that much, and its a major part of the game.

The game gives the information in very clever ways for you to piece together the solution to the world's mysteries. \nIt has perspective puzzles, some cool eureka moments, a full cypher language to translate (optional) and more. Unlike the combat part, it's clear that the devs knew what they were doing. It's very well crafted to great detail. My only gripe is that it relies too much on perspective gimmicks, which forces you to try to constantly wiggle your character in obscured areas in search for secret doors. \n\nIn summary very hard for me to rate this game since it has a half that I love and a half that I hate. The whole also suffers because of the stylistic clash of the chill/mellow mystery solving and the harsh/unpolished/hostile action segments.  \n      \nIf you love puzzle games and can tolerate some (a lot) of senseless souls-esque BS, give it a try on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1697076244, "timestamp_updated": 1697896459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513684213161468506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148049761": {"recommendationid": "148049761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024787669", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1177, "last_played": 1697230347}, "language": "english", "review": "I read before playing that this game is like old Zelda meets Dark Souls 1 meets Outer Wilds and it's completely right.

That being said, I'm using this review to vent my autistic nitpicks with certain aspects of the game. Despite everything I'm about to say, the game is still a 9 or 10 out of 10 for all the reasons stated in other reviews.\n\n[spoiler]\nThe worst part about the combat system in this game is the incredibly short iframe window on the dodgeroll, and how long it takes to execute. This really comes apparent once you reach the final portion of the game and unlock the teleportation crown. The final boss is significantly more fun than every other boss that came before it purely because there is more engaging gameplay that can be done around the improved dash. I unironically believe that if the dash had been that way from the start (obviously minus the ability to teleport across gaps) and the game was balanced accordingly, the combat as a whole would be much more fun. The distance could even be shortened until the crown is acquired later.\n\nConsumables in this game outside the blastbomb and the fire bomb are completely useless. The frost bomb is a neat idea but is completely overshadowed by a magic item that does the exact same thing you will acquire very early in the game. The ivy and hot pepper both do not provide noticeable enough stat increases to warrant consistent usage. At most, you may use them a few times before a boss, but ultimately they really don't have much of an effect. The lure, as far as I can tell, is only useful for speedruns or specific challenge runs and had basically no application in my first playthrough. The fruits are only helpful in very select circumstances when your flask charges are completely empty AND you aren't in combat. Which brings me to the main problem with the consumable system: the hotbar. Only three items can be equipped to it, and many of them are not worth a slot that could otherwise be devoted to a precious magic item. I'm not sure how exactly the developers could've addressed this--my only thought would be a system similar to Dark Souls with a slot in the hotbar that can be cycled between consumables.\n\nContinuing the hotbar discussion, it's unfortunate that for much of your exploration one of your hotbar slots must always be relegated to the magic orb for grapples. I think it might have been best to allow you to grapple over to a hook with a certain button whenever focusing on that hook.\n\nFor the most part, the endgame puzzle solving in this game is absolutely genius and incredibly fun to play through. That being said, I have a few nitpicks of a few puzzles that felt flatly unfair. My beliefs in these criticisms are not nearly as substantial as the previously mentioned ones, and it's entirely possible that I'm missing something with the puzzles. If so, please correct me.\n\n-Fairy 8 requires the player to go to a certain location in the Eastern Forest at nighttime and follow the movements of a phantom fox to solve the puzzle. The issue is that there is absolutely no indication you should visit here at night. In fact, the area is seemingly completely blocked off during nighttime and can only be reached through a secret path up to the fox. I would be fine with this if there was any clue at all that hinted at returning at night, but as far as I can tell there is absolutely none.\n\nThe Eastern Fortress is one of my favorite areas in the game in terms of design, but unfortunately my experience with it and its boss was weighed down because I began it after already completing the quarry and ruined atoll. I'm not sure if this is true of whichever of these three zones you tackle last, but I steamrolled through most of the enemies with little difficulty which was a bit of an underwhelming way to end the second act of the game. \n\n-Fairy 15: Much like the previous fairy, the issue with this one is not the puzzle itself but rather the means of accessing it. To reach the puzzle, you must use a bomb to blow a hole in the wall the fairies lead you to. Again, however, there is no indication that this would make sense to do, and (at least as far as I can tell) you never blow up a wall at any other point in the game.\n\n-Fairy 20: I adore this fairy conceptually, but again, the issue is actually gathering together the pieces of the puzzle. The game relies on you either having an incredible memory and returning to all the locations with golden obelisk fragments OR you being willing to run throughout the entire map trying to find every last piece of the obelisk. This would be acceptable if there was some indication on the map of where golden obelisk fragments are, but only some are actually given this.\n\n-Golden Path Page 8: My only issue here is that the first time I exited to the pause screen, the secret save was not there. I assume this is a bug, but it's something I've seen talked about online as well and would expect to be fixed a year after release.\n[/spoiler]\n\nAs I mentioned at the start, this game is a must-play for basically anyone.

Gotta manipulate the enemies with swords to cut down trees so you can get the sword.\nWant the shield? You gotta fight an enemy that you're meant to fight with the shield to get the shield.\nOh but don't you worry since the parry is completely useless, your parry has a ton of wind up frames building up to the action AND enemies have little to NO wind up frames, which makes for an infuriating experience- BUT WAIT it gets better because at certain points they throw enemies who's proper way to deal with them is PARRYING, which lead to me spamming dynamite instead. \nParry is too slow, pulling off the strike-esc lunge attack requires you to suddenly stop moving and push the stick and use the combo of buttons, in a game were constantly moving is paramount to combat's flow, to pull it off consistently, can't dodge out of a swing, etc. It's like Dark Souls levels of \"commitment\" in a game where the enemies do not also have to \"commit\" to their moves.\nThe world is cute, the exploring is fun, the \"Leveling up\" mechanic is unique, but the amount of money required to do so ramps up far too quickly imo.\nI have experienced 0 genuine puzzles so far, unless you consider \"Oh my! the forced isometric perspective that gives me no right stick control to (But I can use the lock on button to slightly shift my perspective up) do anything and so I missed this thing that was impossible to see!\"\nI would not recommend this game solely because its focus is on the combat, and the combat is bad.

Remakes and rereleases of old games which clean up the gameplay make it less and less likely for people to be remotely familiar with the oldest tropes, but Tunic sets out to remedy that. This game recreates the experience of playing a game in a language you don't really know and whose mechanics are never explained in-game anyway, with nothing but guess-and-check to guide you through and relying on others to fill in the gaps. It's impossible to replicate exactly, of course; many of the most distinct aspects of these early games (secrets scattered around a map haphazardly, dumbass useless NPCs, legitimately inscrutable gameplay mechanics) were due to time constraints or incompetence or both. Here, since they all have intention behind them, they're much gentler; secrets are hard, but deliberate, and there's no major quality of life issues with the gameplay. The NPCs are hilariously useless (and don't type in English), but if you translate them a few of them are actually useful and don't just sit around saying \"GO TO THE NEXT ROOM\" or whatever. The combat is probably the furthest away from older design out of anything in the game, and feels mostly modern though I think it works very well. \n\nThe game shines in its design philosophy; the vast majority of progress in the game rewards you with knowledge, and not tangible checkpoints. When you reach a new area, you find out that there was a ladder to the beginning all along; when you pass a crucial point you find out how to use overworld objects that were available and functional for the entire game. It's not items, but knowledge, that shapes your journey, and if you have the knowledge from the get-go you can travel all over the place in any order you like for the most part.\n\nGamers of yesteryear were quite fond of speculating about esoteric sequences of button-presses and their real or imagined impact on gameplay. It's obviously been quite popular to actually put these obscure secrets into games for more than a decade now (after all, most game devs grew up when it was popular). Tunic follows a similar philosophy, and while the idea behind the holy cross puzzles isn't new it's very well-executed, much better than most other games that attempt it. Very few of the puzzles are overly obscure and even then the game gives you ample hints.\n\nIt's interesting looking at reviews for this, since it seems like the intent of the game flew right over most players' heads at mach five. You know the industry is just straight up fucked when the only frame of reference most players have is Dark Souls, but I guess the likelihood of most modern players having touched any of the games this is based off of is pretty low. I'm honestly not even sure most players of this game have played Fez, which goes a long way to explain the general attitude towards it. It's a shame, but for the game's intended audience, it doesn't get much better than this. 8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1695426699, "timestamp_updated": 1695426699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146786868": {"recommendationid": "146786868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198886350332", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1697817744}, "language": "english", "review": "much yes", "timestamp_created": 1695397421, "timestamp_updated": 1695397421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146776048": {"recommendationid": "146776048", "author": {"steamid": "76561199527061528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1695356249}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly cute and engaging gameplay style, with a fun control scheme", "timestamp_created": 1695386616, "timestamp_updated": 1695386616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146775489": {"recommendationid": "146775489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000391915", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1695385779}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, a bit on the shorter side but that's fine, especially if you get it on sale.

I'm not a fan of isometric games, nor do I like the general artstyle of the game. On top of that, I've currently got a bit of Soulslike fatigue. So, I didn't expect to enjoy a game that looks like a mesh together of Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls. Time and time again Tunic would be recommended by someone I respect. I'd consider it, then decide against it. But something about the overwhelmingly positive reviews eventually swayed me to get it. \n\nAnd I don't regret my decision one bit.\n\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nThe exploration in this game is fantastic. The game is in part a metroidvania - with traversal abilities you can unlock that allow you to explore the world. The game is also \"metroidbrainia\", with abilities you can do from the start, you just don't know how. The world is nicely interconnected with many satisfying shortcuts you can unlock along the way.\n\n[b]The Manual[/b]\nThe game drip feeds you pages of a manual, but unlike pretty much every manual in existence, this one doesn't bore me to death. In fact, it's fantastic! Most of it is encoded in a strange different language, with only key bits of information in English or told via images. The game slowly lets you in on little tips and tricks, but you don't NEED the manual, you can figure these abilities out on your own (and when that happens it is very satisfying).\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\nI mentioned earlier that the artstyle was not my favourite. Despite this, the animations, colour scheme, and the sound design are masterfully put together. The environments are far more varied than I would have expected. While I loved the atmosphere of the rustic forest temple-y areas, there were more impressive areas later into the game.\n\n[b]Progression[/b]\nThe progression in abilities feels great. I love it when games make loot that feels valuable and most loot either contributes directly to a valuable upgrade, gives you an upgrade, or rewards you with information. \n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nThe combat was good. The final boss was fantastic. The bosses in the runup ranged from decent to great. I had a little trouble with the lock-on system, but all of this could have been mitigated if I'd used the arrow keys to switch lock on targets. Even despite my Soulslike fatigue I still enjoyed the combat. \n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nYou don't need to solve any [i]real[/i] puzzles to get an ending, but if you want to get the [i]good[/i] ending there are a lot to solve. The final puzzle required for the good ending is incredible. There are hints hidden right under your nose throughout the game; when you figure out the solution, it feels absolutely amazing. One downside, however, is when executing the puzzle solution, it is very easy to make a tiny error interpreting parts of it - which then unfolds into an unfortunately frustrating experience diagnosing the small error you made. At the end of the day though, I am still very satisfied with my experience figuring it out. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThis game had me hooked. From ringing the bells to now (having just completed the good ending) I had a burning desire to uncover the secrets around every corner; it takes masterful game design to create that feeling. I was able to recapture similar feelings in this game as when solving puzzles in Outer Wilds.

Atmosphere is great, combat is not bad (\"not bad\" being the best it'll ever get ) and you figure out game mechanics through clever use of finding manual pages and part of the game is puzzling out how things work. All of this, when it works comes together well and feels great.\nHowever when it fails it fails also really hard and all the fun goes out the window pretty fast. There's multiple ways the game can do that. \nOne is to simply be stuck on not figuring out where to go. Thankfully this didn't happen a lot to me and usually I could find my way to looking over the \"map\" again and deciding that \"there is probably something here, so let's check that section out again\". But generally almost all access points are hidden by the perspective of the camera. Be that hidden ladders or corridors or whatnot. I get the throwback to older games where some secrets where hidden that way, but it's way, wayyy overdone here by being basically the default way of going from section to section at times. This also makes it more annoying to remember which way you needed to go when going through an area later.\nAnother really bad aspect is the combat. At first it's not too bad, since both you and the enemies seem equally clunky. But in the second half of the game enemies are mostly a keep away AI that runs away from you and then attacks from long range. And for some enemies it takes you longer to swing and hit with your weapon after they just attacked you than it takes the enemies to run away from you again. Some also get invulnerability frames just after their attack so you're guaranteed not able to hit them. Basically, most basic enemies become a huge pain in the ass while adding nothing interesting to combat.\nSimilar for bosses. except bosses have the extra problem that for some the camera moves too fast (as it's always on the boss) so aside from that one boss where during a specific sequence all it does is circle around you (and thus move the camera, which made me dizzy as heck after a while) you often get problems of the boss attacking while moving fast that leads to not quite seeing what's going on or inputs not working, or blocking not working cause your character turns too fast (or not fast enough, idk). which means sometimes you block sometimes you don't which is also quite frustrating. Aside from the same keep away/i-frame stuff on top, which just drags out the already not so fun battles too much.\nThen the secret puzzles. I'd say I can see how some people can get really into those. And good for you, I hope you had a lot of fun with hose, but unless you enjoy staring at cryptic messages and just trying stuff out a lot and never getting clear feedback it's seems a bit too much trial and error. I even had it happened that I actually correctly figured out what to do, but then it didn't work anyway, so I assumed I needed maybe a certain item first, but as it turns out I did everything correctly already, it just didn't work as intended (for whatever reason), so that kinda sucked big time. \nSome puzzles/clues are incredibly vague at times and some seemingly require you to translate that whole fake language to even get the clues. So if you enjoy that kinda stuff, that's probably a plus, but I just thought the game had its head up wayy too far it's own arse at that point tbh.", "timestamp_created": 1695049175, "timestamp_updated": 1695049175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146533166": {"recommendationid": "146533166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066364715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1150, "last_played": 1695639983}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not just a LoZ clone:\nAfter almost 20 hours I finished the first playthrough and I still have so many things to do that I havent done in the game.

I really hope more developers bring this isometric style back now that we all have full analog controllers, which was the main hurdle in the 8- and 16-bit console eras. There's a certain satisfaction from making all parts of an area slowly click into place.\n-The art styles, both in the main game world and the NES Zelda-style in-game booklet, are wonderful. I'd sometimes stop walking around just to take in the airbrushed geometric art of the game world.\n-The regular sword/shield/etc. item mechanics are straightforward and give you a lot of freedom in how you map them.\n-The orb/whip is super fun once you get that. You can get into some hilarity by whip-snapping enemies over to you.\n-Difficulty toggles.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n-The shadows in dark areas are a bit hard to see subtle details in even after bumping the brightness.\n-It worked with a PS5 controller, my preferred Steam controller, but kept showing XBox button names. The choices for how the menu controls were mapped were also strange.\n-Targeting is a bit dodgy. You need it not just for attacks, but snapping yourself around using the orb.\n-After the first bell, the difficulty ramped up ridiculously. I toggled invincibility on after getting repeatedly brutalized by the crocodile enemies and could tell I would not have passed the quarry or ziggurat. It has its own equivalent to the Gloom from Tears of the Kingdom, but more frustrating.\n-The Souls-like leveling mechanic doesn't intuitively fit in with the retro aesthetic. I had the manual page for it but it didn't click what it was telling me to do until I looked up a guide online.\n-Several other mechanics, like teleporting, don't have any subtle UI cues beyond anything shown in the manual.\n-There's too many collectibles and they're not fun like the regular platform puzzles. After a point, I pulled up a guide and powered through them to get the Steam achievements rather than for their own sake. I wouldn't have bothered getting them at all if I'd bought this game for the Switch instead. The gold skulls one was my least favorite because the physics were wonky.\n-The devs are way too in love with the Wind Fish Egg puzzle from Link's Awakening. It's repeatedly rehashed here, such as for a good chunk of the hidden collectibles, but in longer and even more annoying ways. \n-I still didn't entirely get what was going on plot-wise even after collecting the whole manual.\n\n[h1]Neutral:[/h1]\n-I was back and forth on how I felt about the gimmick of the fake foreign language in the in-game UI and the manual pages. It's a novel idea, but it sometimes got in the way of getting my head wrapped around the game mechanics. I think I would have preferred something where the fake language translates itself bit-by-bit as you collect more pages, with 100% manual pages = 100% translated.\n\nTLDR; fun premise and artwork let down by a quasi-attempt to make it a Souls-like and the devs forgetting that some 8-bit era game mechanics were just cheap rather than a fun challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1694901816, "timestamp_updated": 1694901816, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146426249": {"recommendationid": "146426249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147062014", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1181, "last_played": 1695072079}, "language": "english", "review": "* slow claps* This game is incredible.

The art style is simple yet experssive and the music is soft and atmospheric. While the combat targetting can be finicky against multiple enemies, it works.\nWhat sets the game apart is how you learn mechanics and get hints: by literally collecting pages of the game's manual.\nEven if you don't care for the hidden secrets, Tunic still has the basic outline of a story through the manual pages you do collect and even provides a twist, all without any dialog and with most text in a made up runic language. However, going for all the collectables is where the game really shines.\nPoring through the manual and understanding certain parts of it literally changes how you view the environment and the world's design. The isometric view and world design is cleverly used to hide secrets; you will miss something the first time around, no matter how thorough you think you were. Rereading manual pages to realize how to get to something you missed or understanding the initially random scribbles within the manual itself is very satisfying. However, not understanding or missing something can lead to you wandering around for a long time not knowing what to do. This is something that applies to the game whether you are going for 100% completion or not, but is a lot more noticeable while searching for every last secret.\n\nTunic is a game best experienced as blind as you can. Only look up hints or guides as a last resort. The only exceptions I'd say are worth it are the two achievements that will be missed during a vanilla blind playthrough as it requires having the pages for two specific items, translating their descriptions, and inferring the meaning. By the time you have the resources to do so, you will have most likely already failed the conditions to get them. In addition, the items in particular don't really have a reason to be explicitly translated as you've probably inferred the descriptions while using them, meaning you'll be going out of your way to translate them.", "timestamp_created": 1693952225, "timestamp_updated": 1693952225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145728363": {"recommendationid": "145728363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260672930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1571, "last_played": 1693948182}, "language": "english", "review": "wonderful game. can't play it enough\n[spoiler] every good indie game has a disturbing purple-themed psychological horror section nowadays and I'm all for it [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1693946153, "timestamp_updated": 1693946153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145696168": {"recommendationid": "145696168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060589307", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1693814692}, "language": "english", "review": "Is the game good? Yes, it's fantastic, but it is definitely not for everyone and I can more than understand why.\n\nWhat's a good way to explain this? Well, this game is more like a game for people who have played a lot of other video games before. That might sound confusing so let me try to break that down a bit. \n\nThe whole game, from traversing the map to reading the instructions, is a puzzle. Now, this is a really cool concept and I personally love it, but with no tutorial and absolutely no direction other than a hieroglyphic like \"instruction manual\", most players will have to rely entirely on their gaming intuition and/or google to figure it out what is going on.\n\nYou could honestly argue this is more of a \"git gud\" issue and I can't really say anything but that that is valid... It brings to mind titles like Terraria where you're kind of just thrown into the water and you either sink or swim, and slowly learn as you go with a trial and error approach. And that is one of the most successful games of all time on steam. But this style can make the game very dislike-able for newer, more casual gamers and children. And ironically, it seems the art and animation is styled more for that type of audience as well.\n\nOverall, I think this game is fantastic. The art style, the music, the combat, the collecting, the souls-like and rpg-like elements, the puzzles and the intuition this game requires would put this on the list as one of my favorites of all time. You kind of just have to [i] be a gamer [/i] for lack of a better, less cringe phrase. \n", "timestamp_created": 1693898531, "timestamp_updated": 1693898531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886460006237030029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145692504": {"recommendationid": "145692504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061539854", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1694049414}, "language": "english", "review": "As a passionate love letter to the original Legend of Zelda, Tunic presents an experience of free exploration that's guided by subtle signposting and tutorials.

After starting Tunic these memories immediately came flooding back.\n\nTunic takes the Zelda formula and not only executes it, but improves upon it. Combat and movement are clean and crisp. The music and atmosphere were two of my favorite aspects of Tunic. The artistic design is breathtaking. I especially loved the in game guidebook idea. There was absolutely no handholding for Tunic: you were given all the information that you need to solve the games many puzzles. This is something that many games today are lacking.\n\nThat said, towards the end of my playthrough I came to the bitter realization that I lack the patience I once had as a kid. Technically everything you need to know is explained in the guidebook, but some of the more nuanced details can be difficult to figure out. Without spoiling anything, I got stuck trying to find a specific key item, which completely halted my game progression for some time. Because I couldn't figure it out using the guidebook, I looked it up online. This was a big mistake, as doing so immediately killed my immersion within the game. The entire point of the guidebook is to find things out yourself, which prior to this point provided a great feeling of accomplishment figuring things out on my own. While this was mostly my own fault, I would argue that the description of how to get said item (or even the existence of said item) was not entirely clear from the guidebook. General ordering/progression could have been made more clear.\n\nOverall I would give Tunic a high rating, but it is far from perfect.

The game is often as much of a tricky puzzle game as it is an enjoyable and familiar-looking action RPG. Tunic undeniably lifts the base of its presentation, top-down camera, tough-yet-fair sword-and-shield combat, and clever interconnected level design from iconic sources (i.e. Link's Awakening and Dark Souls), but the game adds a layer of \u2018knowledge-progression\u2019 that\u2019s hidden within a nostalgic, half-translated in-game strategy guide.\n\nIn a gripping perspective-expanding process akin to the joy of solving Outer Wilds, from the start, you essentially already have everything you need to go anywhere (or at least do some serious sequence breaking before key items get in the way), but you don\u2019t yet know enough about this new land to harness your own potential. Here, knowledge from the game\u2019s scattered manual has the same door-opening/problem-solving power as keys or \u2018super missiles\u2019 might. While you go about the intended adventuring route, so many shortcuts and interactions lay just out of reach, merely hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe value Tunic places on information is quite refreshing. As your tools and stats progress, so does your understanding of the world. You have no idea what subtle details could become relevant later, which bestows this unknown depth and mystery to the whole experience. When new pages of lovely art and inconclusive imagery are revealed to you, deciphering them makes you feel like a real detective. I also love the dramatic irony of knowing that nothing was stopping you from your goals besides a trick that seemed obvious in retrospect.\n\nThis [i]retro-and-other-inspired RPG that incorporates its manual into the pacing of its gameplay[/i] concept works so well. That guidebook/exploration dynamic makes for some unforgettable moments. But it\u2019s also worth briefly complimenting how Tunic\u2019s other components elevate the game into something much greater than the sum of its sources. The story is told indirectly and silently. It brings further intrigue into this seemingly friendly animal world. The music, while an initially unexpected tone, evokes waves of synthy nostalgia. Tunic\u2019s soundtrack could\u2019ve been a lot more predictable and I think Lifeformed and Janice Kwan found a great way to add to Tunic\u2019s unique identity. Combat isn\u2019t a major thrill, but it has good moment-to-moment pacing. While parrying is a little slugging, it\u2019s far from necessary to succeed. Most bosses require ample mastery to overcome without having to pull out any hairs.\n\nAnd if it ended there, I wouldn\u2019t be hesitant to rank Tunic among its like-minded masterpieces.\n\nSadly, the game ends on a pretty painful note. [spoiler]It begins with a slew of backtracking. Some paths are new, a lot are now blocked. Some upgrade materials you missed are also blocked off. Combat essentially doesn't exist for this portion. There\u2019s nothing in your way as you run around, looking for the clues from the manual. For the final set of new adventuring material, Tunic asks you to take an extreme dive into the manual for cryptic secrets which demand a lot of brainpower and offer no tactile reward. And, as you\u2019d expect, the final boss isn't anything trivial. [/spoiler]\n\nI was so into the first two-thirds of this game.

However this Game put some of the most annoying Puzzle hints into the very thing you need to collect. And these Hints are sometimes simple, however most of the Time, you can learn this entire new language, just so you can get D-pad combinations that make the Konami Code look simple. \nAnd all that for one trinket, you just need for a good ending. \nThe Game also does not tell you that you can upgrade your stats unless you do some digging into the Play Manual. \nAnd with digging, I mean translate some more language or just trying out buttons. \nThe Bosses can definetly be fun, (if you did upgrade your stats) however if you fail to notice that, you get a rage-inducing slog of a Game. \nAnother thing, why do you need to Upgrade your Potions? Just give the player 30 to 40% heal per Potion, it is simple Players have always a good amound of health, without a good chucking of potions when hurt and it takes inspitation from Estus flasks.\nCan I recomment the Game? I don't really know.\nThe Gameplay is decent, but the Mindboggeling Puzzledesign that expects some Metagaming knowledge in solving them, clearly doesn't make this into a Game  I can recomment to everyone...If you are very patient and you love good old Nintendo Power-escue hints.

From the most basic puzzle, to everything leading back to the path for the true ending which to achieve includes everything that you have learned through the entire game in order to solve it. Making us (the player) go back to taking notes, writing and drawing with a pencil on a piece of paper like when we used when we were kids playing an old game. \n\nAnd the game is not just about puzzles though, as there is a LOT of good and meaningful exploration through out this bizarre and strange world in Tunic that just keeps evoking you with feeling of wonder that constantly pulls you towards its mysteries and secrets that it hides. And all of that, accompanied with a very strong art direction, very good music and with a surprisingly deep combat system for a Puzzle-focused game once you learn every secret and hidden mechanic (tho the combat can be turned off in the options for people who just want to focus on the puzzles).\n\nI specially loved how you have to find pages of the long-lost manual of the game and how even though it is incomplete at first, you can kinda follow along what it is trying to tell you on a language that you can't possible understand in your first playthrough. That part in particular really meant a lot to me because even though I am a \"2000's kid\", I was born in a desert in M\u00e9xico where we couldn't just get new games, so we were kinda stuck with no internet and only old games entirely on English, a language completely different from my own.\n\nI mean, we had the manuals for those games at home and even though they really helped a lot in the games, at the time I only knew a few words on that language so I had to solve what it was trying to tell me page by page, turning the manual of the game into its own mystery and puzzle to solve so that I can tackle what those games needed from me. And now that I have learned to speak English alongside a few other languages after all these years, I always thought that I would never get to experience all these feelings and sense of wonder and mystery towards a game just like a did when I was a kid... Until I played Tunic, the game that sent me back to that time.\n\nSeriously, I can't thank you enough for giving me (and probably many others) one of the best experiences I have had with a game in a very long time.

The bad reviews seem to come from either the heavy puzzle aspect or heavy combat portion of the game.\n\nPuzzle-wise, this game completely blew my mind in the best way possible. Nothing in the game is put by accident. There's layers upon layers of puzzles in this game. And it's really up to you how much to invest on them. One definitely has to do part of the puzzles to advance the game's main story. But the more obscure ones are completely optional. The amount I discovered on my own left me very satisfied by how well designed they are. And I looked up the rest just to have a better sense of how deep the puzzling gets. I will say here that  in order to enjoy the game, you do need to really enjoy puzzles (as there's no direct accessibility option to completely eliminate that). And some puzzles might take multiple tries.\n\nCombat-wise, it is definitely a tough game. However, although it was my first souls-like game, my skills got better the more I advanced in the game. To the degree that when I did one of the bosses out of order, I was able to kill a previous boss on my first try. However, there was a section where I think it got significantly harder in compared to other sections (which I found more challenging than the final boss). Because here, your upgrades didn't matter as much, and it was all about skill and weapons/items. It was also particularly harder for me as I missed a weapon that would have made it easier. Regardless, I was able to beat it after a very stressful try. And if I would have been really stuck, I could have just used the accessibility options!\n\nIt's also worth mentioning how amazing the artstyle is. The cute vibe is all I ever needed, we really need more cute yet challenging games. But also, the aesthetics and texture of everything is so good. And the manual is wonderful, of course.\n\nLast, but not least, the music and sound effects are incredible as well. They both effectively make the game significantly better.

It's honestly very exhausting looking through the manual (which is a crime to flip through) to either decipher stuff or look for clues. The game was pretty decently made (it has many small annoyances that compound and make the game less fun, and sometimes, infuriating to play) and is obviously very clever and well thought out (in concept, design elements are hit-and-miss.) It's incredibly cute in design and graphically very consistent and pretty. Combat is okay, not the best or most polished I feel, but easy enough to get into.  It just didn't jive with me enough to call it a masterpiece, but it may be a masterclass in puzzle adventure games.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the first 10ish hours of the game. Just running around hitting stuff, going places, and getting stronger. The secret items, pages (manual), [spoiler]fairies, mountain door, holy cross, etc[/spoiler] were the downfall in fun and ability to enjoy the full scope of what the game has to offer. [spoiler]The holy cross thing was simple to understand (its written pretty clearly in the manual) but finding all the fairies and what not... no... that's awful. I found no enjoyment whatsoever in trekking through the game to try and find each fairy holy cross spot, or tediously inputting the combo.[/spoiler]\n\nI think the game is good enough when you ignore the puzzles (get the \"bad ending\") to buy it on sale, just enjoy the (shortish) adventure with very minimal puzzle solving, and beat the final battle; a casual run doesn't really require all that much thought put into it. However, if you really enjoy puzzles, obtuse linguistic deciphering (like Fez,) and adventuring, you'll absolutely love this game because it delivers on all those fronts spectacularly and you should buy it regardless of its current price tag.\n\nTunic... is a good game. It isn't the best. It isn't the most fun I've ever had. It doesn't have the most annoying puzzles. It doesn't have the best combat. It doesn't have the best adventuring or exploration. Its map design was probably the single best element of the game. The interwoven passages and round-about-ness made me feel like I was discovering Lordran all over again. It's a fine game that delivers an experience. That experience is what you shape it to be, whether its full dedication to the puzzles and unlocking every secret the game has to offer, mastering its combat and plowing through every battle to race to its finale, or figuring a ton of stuff out and being bored of the game so you then resort to using a guide because the tedium of discovering everything on the map left you feeling unmotivated, bored, and vexed.", "timestamp_created": 1690745438, "timestamp_updated": 1690745438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143092455": {"recommendationid": "143092455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029985551", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1690733406}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1690733432, "timestamp_updated": 1690733432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.372918844223022461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143088243": {"recommendationid": "143088243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061339634", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1690385230}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego es innecesariamente demasiado cr\u00edptico la mayor parte de las veces.

TUNIC is super fun and cute with a lot of memorable 'aha' moments. The puzzles are all really well made and properly communicated. The entire time I was playing I wanted to see what would happen next. Over the course of game you'll find pages of the game's instruction manual teaching you how it's played and offering useful information. It's a really cool idea and the manual is so well made with beautiful illustrations and an insane amount of secrets. The game is a perfect blend of exploration, puzzle solving, and combat. I think it would be useful to talk about each of these components in depth.\n\n[h1]Exploration[/h1]\nThis part is about the exploration. If you\u2019ve done a good enough job to avoid any spoilers, then upon starting the game everything is very mysterious and you\u2019re basically just doing the only things that you\u2019re able to. You don\u2019t have a lot of options about where you want to go or what you want to do, but that\u2019s okay because you\u2019re still figuring out how the game works. Over time, the area that you can explore and the speed at which you can do so improve by exploring, fighting, and solving puzzles. The world is just big enough to feel daunting and exciting, but not too big that it\u2019s tedious to explore.\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1]\nNow about the puzzles, which are my favorite part. As soon as you start the game, you're constantly finding weird new pieces to puzzles that you're unsure how they work / didn't know existed. Often, you'll slowly piece together how some of the puzzle\u2019s rules might work until you find the solution to how they function in the manual. Not all the puzzles are solved in the same way, so you're constantly finding new information. There's different types of puzzles that all have unique rules. In function it works like this: \n\nThere's a new type of puzzle that is present in the world obstructing your progress. Over time you'll find pieces of information in the manual, but not enough to figure out how to solve the puzzle type in entirety. You can guess the general gist, but enough to actually solve anything yet. Then suddenly after a big fight or cool new area you find a manual piece that reveals exactly how the puzzle works! Now you must remember where you found those individual puzzles so that you can attempt to solve them. Each of the individual puzzles will have a cool twist that make them still fun to solve even after understanding how the rules work.\n\nThere\u2019s also a [b]LOT[/b] to work on with the puzzles. The number of secrets in this game is unbelievable, they\u2019re basically everywhere. There\u2019s also categories of puzzles that range from easy to communal, and necessary to not even in the game. You can just solve the easy ones to beat the game if you\u2019d like or take on the harder ones although they\u2019re not necessary. I recommend that you try to solve as many secrets and puzzles as you can and then just look up the rest. Eventually the difficulty of the puzzles increases beyond the scope of what a single person can achieve.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nPuzzles aren't the only way you make progress, however. Sometimes there's just an elaborate dungeon that you must explore and get to the end for a new weapon or tool. The combat has always taken a backseat to the puzzles in my opinion, but it's never boring. Enemies are basically just an obstacle. Fortunately, they're simple enough to deal with that I didn't mind fighting them, but the strategy was deep enough that I wasn't bored. It's exactly the kind of combat you want from a game that isn't solely focused on combat. You can attack, roll, and block along with some other items and consumables to mix things up. It\u2019s more about your opponent\u2019s attack patterns that makes the combat enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Possible Downsides[/h1]\nHowever, there are some things that you should know if you\u2019re considering buying this game. I feel there are two main things that will turn a lot of people away and it\u2019s best that you know beforehand. Exploring an isometric world might be annoying and this game really isn\u2019t about the combat.\n\nA lot of emphasis has been put on exploring an isometric world, which includes rubbing your face on areas that are obstructed by the players perspective. Often, there are optional treasure chests that are hidden behind your perspective, but sometimes it\u2019s a really important area that is easy to miss. It\u2019s the game\u2019s job to try to communicate to the player that there could be something hiding out of view, and it usually does a good enough job. It\u2019s simply another type of puzzle - trying to find hidden areas. I thought it was a lot of fun, but I can easily see how this would be a turn off to some. If this sounds frustrating, then this game may not be for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of action type games and you\u2019re looking to buy this because it has the tag \u2018Souls-like\u2019, that\u2019s kind of deceptive. This game has light combat elements. There are only a handful of challenging fights in the game but they\u2019re simple once you figure out their attack patterns. It\u2019s difficult enough to be fun, but it\u2019s not really the focus of the game. If you like combat more than puzzles in games, just be cautious about playing past two hours for the refund.", "timestamp_created": 1690686335, "timestamp_updated": 1690686632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143049633": {"recommendationid": "143049633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091403663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1690672886}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a video game.

If you like that, I recommend it. If you played video games in the 90's, I REALLY recommend it.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how to rate this game, because the thing I love about it most is something that might only appeal to old people like me. \n\nAt face value, it's a pretty neat Zelda/Dark Souls mash-up of a game. It has some key components of each, although it's not quite as good as either at doing the things those games do well. The thing that really makes me love it is the powerful sense of nostalgia I get from the in-game manual mechanic.\n\nWhen I was a kid, the Internet wasn't widely used. There are a lot of ways that made everyday life different, but the one that's relevant to this game is that if you were a kid that played video games, it was pretty difficult to look up guides or secrets. If you got stuck, you just kept playing and banging your head against a wall until you figured something out. I have vivid memories of sleepovers with friends doing this with Zelda 2, Star Tropics, Zelda, a Link to the Past, and Super Metroid - we would get to a point where we were stuck, and all we could do was stay up all night re-exploring areas we'd been to, trying our different weapons on weird looking walls, and consulting the instruction manual for any tips we could hope to use to progress. \n\nThis game is excellent at conjuring that same feeling. Instead of having a physical copy of the manual, you locate the pages of it in game as you play. The art in the manual brought back strong flashbacks to old NES and SNES manuals - if you zoom in you can see the dots from the print, there are things written in the manual in pencil, and you can even see the game being played  behind it, adjusted to look like it's on an old CRT screen. There are a lot of moments where I got stuck in the game, went to the manual, dug through it, and figured out what to do next. It was an exciting feeling that I had forgotten about - most current games make your objectives clear, and if you're stumped, there's a website ready to tell you what to do next. Playing this game cold with nothing but the in-game instruction booklet really took me back to the basement of a friends house at 2 AM, trying to figure out what came next. \n\nSo here's the thing - I really enjoyed that experience, but I'm not entirely sure if that would be an enjoyable experience for someone who it didn't trigger the nostalgia that I felt. If you don't like that experience, it's a pretty cute Zelda/Dark Souls hybrid - not quite as good as either, but it's neat to see the two combined.", "timestamp_created": 1690256784, "timestamp_updated": 1690256784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665471971035003662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142733153": {"recommendationid": "142733153", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970719126", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1690234412}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game!

Es un juego poco convencional, misterioso, que no te explica nada. Y siento que eso lo hace incre\u00edble. Estamos en una etapa de los videojuegos donde todos los juegos con mundos amplios tienen que indicarte con pelos y se\u00f1ales todo lo que tienes que hacer. Pero Tunic no lo hace. Y eso lo hace quieras o no distinto. Empecemos.\n\nTunic es un juego sobresaliente. En todos sus apartados es genial. Quiero empezar hablando del gameplay y todo lo que le rodea. Que pasada es el t\u00edtulo jugablemente. Lo m\u00e1s superficial ser\u00eda el combate, que hace una mezcla entre Dark Souls (por el estilo) y los Zeldas 2D cl\u00e1sicos (en perspectiva) para dar un combate que parece simple (porque realmente lo es) pero que se hace mucho m\u00e1s complejo. Las boss fights son incre\u00edbles. Si no has jugado nunca un juego de este estilo, la primera es s\u00faper dif\u00edcil, pero cuando te acostumbras, es s\u00faper satisfactorio esquivar los golpes que te has memorizado de un boss y saber cuando atacar. Si bien he echado de menos alguna boss fight m\u00e1s, las que hay son un 10 absoluto.\n\nEl mapa es otra cosa que me ha encantado. Un mapa que sabe controlarse en tama\u00f1o y que est\u00e1 relleno sin sentirse sobrecargado. El mapa tiene muchos coleccionables que van desde objetos clave (como armas), objetos secundarios como bombas y m\u00e1s cosas. Tiene muchas zonas y muy variadas, con diferentes tem\u00e1ticas y enemigos caracter\u00edsticos.\n\nSiguiendo con el gameplay, quiero comentar lo misterioso del juego. TODO el juego est\u00e1 escrito en un idioma que le es desconocido a nuestro protagonista (incluso en el men\u00fa de pausa, donde deber\u00eda poner pausa, lo pone en ese idioma). No sabemos nada, ni lo que tenemos que hacer. Pero para eso est\u00e1 el manual de instrucciones (la que es a m\u00ed parecer, la mejor mec\u00e1nica del juego). Como si de un juego de los a\u00f1os 90 se tratase, tendremos un manual de instrucciones, del cual tendremos que encontrar sus p\u00e1ginas. Este manual tiene mezcla de idiomas, pero te va contando lo que tienes que hacer y me ha parecido una forma muy original y que funciona muy bien de contarte el mundo.\n\nAudiovisualmente, es otro 10. Es precioso (a m\u00ed me recuerda visualmente al remake de Link's Awakening) con una paleta de colores muy amplia y en su mayor\u00eda de colores vivos. Aunque la OST no tiene ning\u00fan tema que se me haya quedado marcado, est\u00e1 bien. \n\nNarrativamente, no he entendido mucho, pero lo que he entendido me ha gustado. No quiero hacer spoilers, porque tiene muchos giros y es mejor que cada uno descubra el lore a su ritmo, pero os aseguro que os va a gustar.\n\nMe he dejado muchas cosas del juego, pero solo con esto, ya podr\u00e1s ver lo mucho que me ha encantado Tunic. C\u00f3mpralo porque aunque parezca caro, es una experiencia como pocas en la industria actual.

It's a combination of incredibly smart game design which relies on minimal hand-holding and rewards your curiosity; puzzles that give you that 'AHA!' moment and unlock a whole new way of looking at the world once they click; isometric action combat that feels just challenging enough to keep you on your toes but never making you feel like the task is impossible and you aren't going to progress further; beautiful art direction and compelling world-building through visual storytelling and last but not least, a cute af protagonist. If you are like me and all of that sounds exactly up your alley, then I highly recommend TUNIC! \n\nVery quickly into the game, TUNIC teaches you to be observant. You will not be able to progress unless you are curious and are looking for visual clues at all times. The most unique mechanic that TUNIC has is a game manual which can be accessed at any time and contains everything you will need to beat the game and solve even its hardest puzzles. It's very much inspired by actual retro game manuals and the aesthetic of it is *chef's kiss*. The twist is that the manual pages are written in a foreign language with only some english sprinkled around to guide you. You are also able to find only certain pages at a time so you are forced to solve as much as possible with as little as you have. You aren't always sure if you already have the information to engage with what you're finding so that fuels your curiosity even more.\n\n[b] How much CAN i do with what little I know? [/b] \n\nOne of the smartest parts of TUNIC's design is how both your discoveries in the world and your reading of the manual pages is teaching you to be observant. You will always be rewarded for using your eyes in this game. As you progress the game will also reveal hidden paths & ladders that have been there all along, you just didn't know it but you [i] could've[/i] seen had you been looking closer. You will find little scribbles on maps in the manual, only to discover secret chests/paths/etc. in the world. It's an extremely smart loop of both secrets in the manual and smart level design that just constantly fuels your sense of wonder, curiosity and gives you a dopamine rush every time you figure out any of its secrets. I never found myself stuck or lost simply by keeping an eye out.\n\nFair bit of advice though, go in as blind as possible (don't even watch the trailer/video on steam as it gives a fair bit away that would otherwise feel more rewarding to discover on your own). I went in knowing very little about the game except that it was a game all about discovery, had a cool retro game manual mechanic and that apparently had one big compelling puzzle (which I'll circle back to), that's about it! This is the type of game where you are doing yourself a huge disservice if you spoil yourself so my biggest advice is: [b] DON'T LOOK UP ANYTHING, DON'T LOOK UP SOLUTIONS EITHER! [/b] All I'll say is if you're stuck/lost: \"When in doubtie, game manual-ie outie\". The game is very smart in the sense that at all times you are given everything you need to progress further, the manual pages are very selectively given to you at certain times to give you all the knowledge you need ([b]so a hint is to always look at what page you found last and ask yourself why[/b]). \n\nAnd knowledge really is the biggest \"power\" you will be given. I was always so excited to receive a new page of the manual and analyze it as much as possible with my current knowledge of the game. Also worth knowing is that you do not need to decipher the manual language to beat the game with the good ending. You also do not need to understand every puzzle/scribbly note in the manual to beat it either. I completed some post-game/side puzzles that I got through using the hints in the manual (that do indeed make you feel like a genius), but there is tons in there just for the pure love of hard af puzzles. There is a whole rabbit hole of secret puzzles and insanity that the community has unearthed online that is worth looking into only [b]AFTER[/b] you finish the game. But safe to say, you only need to understand [b]some[/b] of the manual puzzles/hints to finish the game and that is always connected to a repeating phrase/word, a whole page spread, etc. The game manual is very clear as to what's important and much more subtle about the extra fun notes/small hints to bonus puzzles. \n\nThe game also has some awesome boss fights that have the difficulty fine tuned to challenge you but never make you despair and stop playing. I will say though, some of the boss hit boxes could be finicky and your attacks don't always hit despite not being physically possible to get closer to the boss/weak point. Leading up to each of the boss encounters there is so much visual storytelling and world building as you go from zone to zone, each weirder than the last. I was constantly at awe and curious about why this world is the way it is. There are few moments of \"revelations\" as well that are purely visual/environment storytelling that had me asking so many questions and made me very invested in the lore of the world. As a huge sucker for cryptic visually driven storytelling that doesn't give you all the answers but forces you to theorize, this game scratched just the right itch!\n\nLastly, I want to talk about the \"last\" puzzle and the ending, but do not spoil yourself if you haven't figured it out yet as it's by far the most satisfying part of the game to figure out on your own. [spoiler] The most amazing aspect of the Mountain Door puzzle is that it all comes back down to everything the game has been teaching you so far: be observant, be curious, question everything that sticks out, the answers are always right in front of you. The moment you notice the golden path has been right there the whole time, the feeling is absolutely amazing. It got me busting out the pen and paper and drawing it all out and I kind of love that the game required me to do that! I can't remember the last time I had to do something like that and it felt very rewarding. Inputting the code though felt more difficult  than the boss fights lol, but hearing the little ding and finding the first page of the manual with the dev note...what a fantastic feeling you could only ever experience once! The knowledge you end up gifting to the Heir to get the good ending being the game manual you analyzed and learned from in order to complete it is just such a wonderful way to bring things full circle. Definitely a gaming experience that will stick with me for awhile![/spoiler] \nI will say though, the puzzles/ world secrets in this game definitely lean towards the visual pattern-breaking observation kind of thinking and if that is not how your brain works this game's puzzle hints may not make a whole lot of sense to you. My brain clicks with that type of thinking and puzzle solving very well so it was all immensely satisfying throughout the game!\n\nTL;DR Amazing game, fantastic world, joyous game manual, smart puzzles that make brain go brrr, brb going to buy the fox plushie now", "timestamp_created": 1689924855, "timestamp_updated": 1689933138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142507254": {"recommendationid": "142507254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039266977", "num_games_owned": 975, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1004, "last_played": 1689970098}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun metroidvania, I don't usually play this type of game but I really enjoyed my time here!

When you start playing Tunic, you begin to get the impression that it's actually a fairly punishing Dark Souls clone. And then, once you get into Tunic's late game, it just turns into something else entirely. It's hard to properly review Tunic without wading into spoiler territory, but what I can tell you is that there's people on both sides of the fence who either love or hate Tunic for the exact same reasons. If you ask me, I think it's worth playing if you have the right mindset.\n\nI'll start by saying that Tunic is designed to be played blindly, and you'll ruin the experience the moment you look up any sort of guide whatsoever. There's no tutorial or even any real sense of direction at first, with the game even going as far as to force you to find pages of the manual on your own. Some people drop Tunic within the first few minutes because [i]waaaaah, there's no waypoint for me to follow and no mission objective to tell me what to do and there's no multiplayerrrr[/i] and that's perfectly fine because Tunic is made for people that actually enjoy it when a game assumes that they're an intelligent human being. Figuring things out by trial and error is, at least for me, refreshing and rewarding. I like it TO A POINT, a point which Tunic admittedly does reach towards the end of the game, but it's still good overall. I was able to at least beat the game without the use of a guide, but I DID have to go back and use a guide to [spoiler]actually...beat the game.[/spoiler]\n\nNature of the gameplay aside, Tunic has a lot of other things going for it. The colorful and minimalistic graphics get the job done, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. Tunic is certainly unique, and even though it draws inspiration heavily from Zelda and Dark Souls, it's able to use those elements as a springboard to become its own thing rather than being a simple clone. If you're okay with being frustrated by design, Tunic is an ultimately rewarding experience even if it has the occasional brief misstep along the way.

The design choices feel well thought out and intentional, however, for that same reason I can see people loving or hating it. Overall, I enjoyed the game myself but the longer answer to how is nuanced since there were aspects of the design choices I was not enthused about.\n\nFirst off, going in blind is definitely part of the experience with Tunic. You are given no information starting off and you simply have to meander to figure out what to do and where to go. Even then, the instructions you receive are in the form of \"game manual\" pages scattered throughout the world which can at times be cryptic themselves. It is a neat concept but also not for me. The lack of descriptions on gameplay mechanics and items (unless you stumble upon a relevant page) was intriguing at first but eventually grew tiresome. I don't blame that on the game since it's clearly very intentional; so it's purely a matter of personal preference. I got to the second boss before looking anything up, at which point I started looking up information. I was one of the people that did not even figure out there was a leveling system until I saw it mentioned online, so I was basically playing on extra-hard difficulty until then... That said, I don't regret both playing blind up to that point or looking up info from then on.\n\nThe combat, stat system, and item system are standard RPG stuff. They are pretty good and well implemented. Well, at least once you figure out the details from trial and error, in-game manual pages, or looking them up... I played with a keyboard and you could tell at times some things were clearly designed with controllers first in mind. No big deal since that's somewhat standard for these kinds of games and it did not block me from anything but something to be aware of.\n\nThe story was simple but fun. I don't have much to add there. Similarly, I liked the graphics and soundtrack but there wasn't anything extraordinary me to call out about them.\n\nThe last thing I will mention is that there are tons of secrets in the game. Some of these are required for the true ending although most are just for fun. These secrets follow the same principle of being hidden behind cryptic instructions or puzzles in the manual pages you find throughout the world. I found some secrets on my own but I also looked up a bunch of them because I was curious to know and also wanted to get the true ending without needing to do sweeps of the map and manual pages to figure out what I was missing.

I bought it on sale after it had been at the top of my Wishlist for a long time. I loved the conceit of finding bits of a partially-translated manual as you play, and said manual gave me serious nostalgia for old NES games. The Zelda-meets-Dark Souls gameplay was great, as I'm a huge fan of both those series. I don't know how far I got in the game, but I'm assuming somewhere around 80% of the way to hitting credits. Unfortunately, after having a great time exploring numerous beautiful areas and unlocking the central mystery of the early game things changed drastically.\nUp to this point the game had been moderately difficult, with some occasional spikes for bosses. This made it challenging, forced you to learn boss attack patterns, and gave you ample reason to scour the world for powerups to cope with increasingly tough baddies. Suddenly, for story reasons, all your powerups are taken away, your stats are reset to base levels, and you are ushered in to a previously inaccessible area. The enemies here aren't terribly difficult, but because you've lost most of your progress (you still have extra potions, tho they now heal far less), taking a single hit typically takes over 1/2 of your HP. I found this frustrating, but adapted, \"got good\", and made my way to the next area, hoping the game would soon return to its previous form.\nHere the game ramps up the difficulty by making its systems unfair. Not only do you still have only base stats, but the enemies now hit for over 1/2 of your HP AND reduce your max HP. This means that you have to heal after every single hit, and even if you do, after about 3 hits everything will one-hit-KO you. It's made worse by you having to fight shadowy versions of yourself who don't have a stamina bar to manage, can endlessly dodge-roll-counterattack you, and have the ability to instantly chain a thrust onto any basic attack (something you can NOT do). Even after swallowing my pride and turning combat difficulty down in the options (something I *hate* having to do; a properly-balanced game doesn't need an \"Easy\" setting, but I digress) the problems weren't alleviated, as all this did was change the number of hits before a OHKO to about 5 or 6, and didn't change the nature of combat at all. Sadly, I got so frustrated that I had to give up on a game I had previously been loving (and a friend assures me that there is an even more unfair, unfun hurdle to clear at the end of this zone), and I was really looking forward to trying to figure out the secrets after beating (I found one of what I can only assume is a bunch of secret treasures during my play by puzzling out a penned-in note in the manual).\nBottom line, it utterly sucks that such a great game idea is ruined by a section that breaks the \"tough but fair\" standard, leaving you feeling super-frustrated instead of fulfilled by a beautiful, cryptic world that challenges and rewards you.", "timestamp_created": 1689533877, "timestamp_updated": 1689533877, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495000392198562622", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142204537": {"recommendationid": "142204537", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977132992", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 504, "last_played": 1697498419}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't believe I waited this long to try this game!

I think this was supposed to simulate playing an imported game in a language you don't understand, but it just makes the game frustrating to play since you have extremely minimal guidance on what any items do (it isn't always obvious even when you use them), how your abilities work, or even where to go to advance the story. There are even entire gameplay systems that you won't learn about without looking it up, including a stat upgrade system that is mandatory to stand a chance against bosses, but can only be discovered by happening to press the right (unprompted) button in the right map location or by looking it up.\n\nBosses are a HUGE difficulty spike every time, being endurance battles about dodging and whittling down their health while common enemies are more hack-n-slash in how you deal with them. It creates a bit of dissonance and makes boss battles feel out of place with the rest of the game. Your items don't reset after a loss either, so be ready to grind for gold and hike back to a shop.\n\nSome mechanics are very hit-or-miss with whether they'll function as intended for you, with the shield not always blocking attacks for some reason and the invincibility period at the beginning of a dodge roll sometimes being completely ignored, especially by bosses. Locking onto enemies is also wonky since you can't pick which one to lock onto, which makes fighting multiple enemies needlessly tough as you get slaughtered by something six inches away but can only lock onto another enemy across the room.\n\nThere's fun to be had here, but you'd best at least have some online hints handy because you'll either have to look everything up or spend ~70% of your playtime running around aimlessly hoping to stumble on what you're supposed to do next with no indication of what that is.", "timestamp_created": 1689457441, "timestamp_updated": 1689457441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142158064": {"recommendationid": "142158064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970335562", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1689456289}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't want to say too much to avoid spoiling, but this game has some really interesting and unique puzzle design.

If you want a Souls experience this is not it. \n4 BIG ISSUES with this game that add up to a poor experience. \n1. Having the doge/sprint button hard locked to the interact button...just hideous. If you rebind the button to where you prefer the doge button it makes navigating menus really annoying when you mess with muscle memory, but far more debilitating is rolling every time to want to go up a ladder, not to mention the interact ranges on stuff if find to be way to small.\n1b. Not having dedicated slots for consumables and magic attracts, I don't mind that you can organize it how you want but it leads to constantly having stuff in different slots which prevents you from building up muscle memory to use you items and abilities fluidly in combat...just use the souls system where i can cycle between items of each category. \n2. Combat has three main issues for me. \nA. The lock on system is atrocious to this point its still feels unpredictable. It tends to hold lock on for crazy distance sometimes and when you feel it would be natural to break lock on like say when you are running away from a enemy and trying to point you character at the enemy in front of you it fails to switch. Basically, its a pain in the ass to break lock on in a natural way without actually inputting the button press. \nB. The range of Tunics melee attacks, the game wants to be a Souls-Like and it succeeds in a lot of aspects, but the melee range is so short you have to be right in the enemy's face which means it can be hard to read attacks, but more so it makes it so you just want to spam when in attack range because its not like you will be able to doge and attack, you will need to doge and then move back into attack range which is boring and doesn't capture the satisfying dance the is Souls combat because its boring it encourages hack and slash gameplay. \nC.) The roll or iframes seem pretty imprecise or maybe there are just very few iframes and doge tends to follow the character orientation rather than the camera orientation which leads to rolling sideways a lot. The biggest issue though is because the roll feels hit or miss the skill ceiling also feels capped. I've beat my head against souls bosses for days because it felt like there was room to improve precision and get gud and its enjoyable...this game feels to loose, you just hope the roll works for you 3 or 4 times when you needed and during an attempts when you beat the boss it just feels like good RNG and when your dodge successfully it a \"o it worked\" feeling rather than something you can learn from and get more consistent with. To sum it by 8 hours in combat felt maxed out like not really any room to improve just have to rely on getting more powerful rather than better at the game.\n 4. Finally, the whole hidden game mechanics thing...was cool at first, I like games that don't hold your hand, but the big secrets are what your items do....give me a break I know games have certain types of items its just a matter of which one is which... I'm not trying to wait 2hrs to find out that this is a freeze bomb and not a FP replenishing item...I guess I'll just burn pick up to see if I can figure out what they do. My advice just look up a guide to see what items do so you can incorporate them into you gameplay right away. \n(Small Issues) Not the biggest issue but things could be a big more zoomed out cause the maps get a bit confusing and tons of the hidden stuff is just hidden by geometry and odd angles not so much clever level design. Finally, the story is whatever, goes to far into the obtuse realm and you just end up praying at the generators and collecting keys and for its own sake rather than any narrative motivation.", "timestamp_created": 1689390457, "timestamp_updated": 1689390457, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495483338832855225", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142095684": {"recommendationid": "142095684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236996026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1431, "last_played": 1682184766}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

So far, I'm a 4 bosses in and there's not much I can think of that lends to an overall positive experience. To me it seems like a lot of people just like that this game is going back to how old games used to do things. Lots of reviews detail why they think the game is great, so I'm going to go through my gripes with the game. This is really one of those games where I feel like it deserves something in-between a positive and a negative review. If I were to put a number to it, it would probably be something like a 7/10 (on an actual scale out of 10, not a the games journalist scale which only uses the top third). I'd only recommend it if you're looking for this specific kind of game or you can take the gamble when it's on sale for a lower price than it is currently (30% off, \u00a317.49). Jump to the last paragraph for a TLDR.\n\nThe exploration isn't particularly fun. Nothing that other games haven't already done but with some overdone aspects. Lots of things are hidden from view of the camera, so you just end up sticking to walls all the time to find all the hidden alleys and rooms. Having to do this everywhere isn't particularly fun and dulls down most \"aha\" moments due to the many things that are hidden this way. To me, this kinda of exploration isn't all that fun. It's exploration turned into busywork, especially when a lot of the rewards for doing it are just money and the occasional consumable. The mystique and intrigue that Zelda dungeons create is quite absent from this game and the bosses don't really do anything to balance that out.\n\nThe puzzle element is mysteriously absent from this game, despite being tagged as so, unless the dev's idea of a puzzle is trawling through an area just to flip a switch. This game is as much a puzzle game as dark souls is if you consider opening doors from the other side or knocking down a ladder is a puzzle element. I haven't played through the whole game, so maybe all the actual puzzles are later, which is a failing of a game aiming to be and is lauded as a puzzle game.\n\nOf the bosses I've encountered, only 1 really felt all that well designed with the others having major issues with the camera that make focusing or moving accurately far more difficult than it should be. Imagine trying to beat a group of enemies whilst your camera is spinning just so it can keep the boss on the same place in view. You have no control of the camera throughout the game and it's just for the cinematic aesthetic and  hiding things out of sight. I'd also recommend turning off depth of field for at least the boss fights. The effect is way overdone and often leaved the boss and the environment blurry unless you're up in its face.\n\nThe combat overall doesn't feel particularly great. It's relatively basic and of a similar vein to that of Zelda but they've tried to make it more challenging. Personally, I don't find it all that interesting or challenging after you get to grips with the general feel. There's not anything fundamentally flawed about it, just nothing that makes it something I actively want to do more of. Most encounters practically can be attempted the same way with a handful of enemies needing something other than your sword and shield to initiate. I've enjoyed a number of Zelda games, but so far, this game has too much of an emphasis on combat without making it interesting. The game forces you to do things different very infrequently. It's only when you get to boss fights do you actually have to use your brain in a meaningful way. Where in many other games, the encounters you have leading up to a boss will teach you things that are useful when facing the boss. In this game, every boss (of the ones I've faced) have been completely blind and will be the first time you actually need to use core mechanics. To me, this means a significant portion of the real challenge in the boss fights is in learning the mechanics in the middle of a boss fight (or relearning them because you haven't had to use them in a long time). This only creates needless frustration and means the devs could make simpler bosses with the illusion of difficulty.\n\nThe game takes an old school approach to tutorials in this game, relying on a manual to communicate mechanics, objectives and the like, but the manual is built into the game and you have to collect the pages as you play. The execution of this is mostly well done. You get more pages as you explore. It's one of the few actually meaningful rewards you get for exploring outside of upgrades and equipment. That's not to say it's flawless. At the start of the game, you're given very little direction, aside from a few pages in the manual. This manual is mostly written using pictures and a cryptic unreadable language with the occasional interpretable thing or english word. There's a lot of guesswork that goes into understanding what the manual is going on about and on a number of occasions, I only understood the actual point until I had already done the thing, practically making portions of the manual redundant.\n\nThe game is also specifically advertises its soundtrack as a point to buy the game. I love a good soundtrack. A good soundtrack can be the cherry on top in a truly awesome game or can save an average game from too many bad reviews. Hollow Knight, Vermintide 1 and 2, Link's Awakening, and Octopath Traveler are a few games that come to mind with great soundtracks. This game's soundtrack is a bit of a let down without even considering those prior mentioned games. It's just okay. It's a bit of background music. It doesn't do all that much to set and maintain the atmosphere. It is truly just an accessory to accompany the rest of the game. It is not a soundtrack that is worth my money.\n\nAll of this is to say that in my experience, there isn't much to cry home about. It relies on an old school way of designing games which is absent from modern game design and that alone seems to be one of the major features that people love about the game. I think it has plenty of flaws and is far from a perfect game, but people are willing to overlook that because of the different design philosophy used in this game. There's very little hand holding. All the gameplay is reliant on exploration and using your brain when you're stuck. With all that said, I am mostly enjoying the game. It's not amazing but I am entertained and I don't feel like I'm wasting my time most of the time. If what I've said above doesn't sound all that bad to you and you want an exploration/combat game with very little hand holding and some occasional difficulty, then it's probably the game for you. I'd still recommend waiting for a sale though (larger than the 30% at the time of this review).", "timestamp_created": 1688593441, "timestamp_updated": 1688594609, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495847642421722412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141373558": {"recommendationid": "141373558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152226799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2012, "last_played": 1688569494}, "language": "english", "review": "It's one of 'those' games.

On first glance, it appears to be an isometric Zelda clone where you play as Fox Link, and it is, but it's so much more.  The game is just so smartly designed.\n\nYou start off on the beach with no items, no direction, no story, no nothing.  It's up to you to find out where to go, what to do, how to win, and how deep you want to delve into the world.  It completely respects the intelligence of the player and spoon feeds you very, very little.\n\nThe game most resembles Zelda 1 of all things.  You know, the one you couldn't beat without reading the instruction manual?  Well, this game also has an instruction manual, that you collect the pages of in game.  It  details the maps of areas, how to play, the controls, the steps you need to take to complete the main game, and all the secrets.\n\nExcept for one thing.  The game isn't in English.  It's in Tunicese.  If you've ever had to play an unlocalized game from Japan, like if, say, some mediocre publisher never localized it and you had to use some bootleg ROM (*coughSuperRobotWars*) then you know that maybe 10% of the text and interface would be in English, and with enough intuition and trial and error you could figure out how to play the game.\n\nI was not expecting this game to so accurately reflect such an experience but it does, gloriously.  By putting together snippets of readable text, along with the pictures and things you notice in game, you can figure out almost everything.  The game relies on it, because while you also have your standard Zelda items that unlock ability to traverse the map in ways you couldn't before (hook shot, etc) many times you had the ability inside you all along - you just didn't KNOW it yet.  Shortcuts that you could have always used were hidden just out of sight and you'll be startled you never noticed they were there.\n\nSo when you finally figure out how to perform some new skill it completely recontextualizes a lot of the things you've seen in the game so far.  Knowledge is just as powerful as some new magic item.  It reminds me a lot of The Outer Wilds and it's just so well done in this game.\n\nYou figure out the secrets, you unravel the story, you earn every breakthrough.  Or you could look it up online, but really that ruins the fun.  There's a few optional puzzles that are sketchy logicwise that I had to check solutions for but the vast majority of things can be figured out just by paying attention and keen observation.

I'm getting 2 hit killed by every enemy and need to get past a LOT of them to get to the next section. I got to the almost the same spot probably 15-20 times now and keep getting killed in that spot or just before it. The difficulty spike is out of nowhere and beyond ridiculous. I am out of the refund window, but requested one anyway. The point of the game is to not look anything up and literally everything up to this point I figured out on my own. Even what is considered the hardest boss in the game, I beat in like 4-5 tries. He's annoying, but not impossible. If I could block this dev's games, I would. Because this is complete garbage to do this to players. And if you google The Cathedral, you'll see a large number of complaints on Reddit for the area I'm in and they were able to get further along to what sounds like a much harder part. Don't waste your money.\n\n\nEDIT: Changed this to Not a Recommend. Made it past the initial part of invisible enemies to the next section with a number of enemies that lower your max already cut in half health bar with every hit and then followed up by 2 really aggressive even stronger enemies. Sorry, but this difficulty spike is ridiculous and not fun. I was fine with the challenge up until now, but this feels extremely unfair. To me, any dev that has to resort to a \"challenge\" like this, took the easy way out versus making a skill based game. I won't be buying from them again.\n\n\nOriginal: I was loving this game so I won\u2019t ding it with a negative recommendation. But I have some pet peeves with games and this one hit two mid to late game. They cut my stats about in half while throwing more and harder enemies at me and included in those are invisible enemies. Both of these are stupid sleazy tricks to hit a player with an unnecessary difficulty spike. I feel like this dev is better than this and shouldn\u2019t have resorted to these tactics.

Well... that's not exactly what you're going to get. \n\nRight at the beginning, something feels off -- both about the world itself, and about the way the game feeds you information about what you're supposed to do next. Why does it feel so confusing just to find a sword and get out of the starting area? Why does the world feel so empty? Who's that spirit trapped in the hexagon prison? Why is the village abandoned and inhabited by moblins? Where the heck is your minimap? What the heck is this weird language on the signposts, are you supposed to be able to read this? Does it ever get translated? \n\nMost importantly, why does it feel like the game is already beaten by someone else, the grand adventure is already over and done, and you're just following in some hero's footsteps? Seriously, what's going on? Why is the game designed like this?\n\nNot even ten minutes into the game, you'll have so many hanging questions. And guess what? The game isn't going to tell you any of the answers. They're for you to figure out. ...Yeah. It's [i]that[/i] kind of a game.\n\nIf you want some answers, maybe you can take a look at the game's instruction booklet. There's some valuable info in there about basic game controls, like how to use certain items or lock onto enemies in combat. Just one problem -- the instruction booklet is torn up into individual pages and scattered around the world. Good luck with that. Not even the game's basic controls and mechanics are free info. \n\nSee, this is no Zelda-like; it's a puzzle game disguised as a Zelda-like. I've heard some people also call this a Souls-like, and while I'm not entirely sure I agree, it does strongly remind me a lot of La-Mulana in the way it forces you to look at the world differently when you're desperate for answers. It's quite satisfying to slowly absorb and internalize the way the game hides its secrets and communicates its ideas. And once you learn something, there's a special kind of joy in realizing that it was [i]always[/i] true... and it's a lot of fun to imagine what you could do with certain information on a new playthrough if you knew it from the very start.\n\nThe game's artistry is what I'd call perfect. The graphics are cute when they want to be, hauntingly powerful when they want to be. I especially liked the instruction booklet artwork, a perfect parody of what it's referencing. The soundtrack is expansive and masterful, though it leans more towards ambience than catchiness, so there are only a few tracks that will actually get stuck in your head. There's a deep story to unravel here, too. I dare not spoil anything, but I'll simply say that it's got moments that'll strike hard, it's absolutely not what you're expecting, and it's a lot more than you bargained for.\n\nAs for criticisms: \n\n[list]\n[*]It's obvious the designers put a lot of effort into keeping the combat system simple and unintrusive, and while that works perfectly fine for exploring the world and solving the game's ridiculous puzzles, I find the combat a bit [i]too[/i] uninteresting when it's placed front and center, like for certain boss battles. \n\n[*]It's not far-off to say that \"every copy of TUNIC is personalized\". The game is built around letting you progress surprisingly far without having found key items or knowing basic information, and while this [i]mostly[/i] works, I feel it sometimes goes a bit too far in withholding information from the player. Depending on certain paths taken, it's not always reasonable to expect the player to infer knowledge they were supposed to find ten hours ago. It works a lot, just not always.\n\n[*]While I didn't encounter any intrusive bugs in-game, the UI has some very strange bugs, ranging from showing incorrect item counts on the pause menu, to sometimes even loading the wrong file on the file select screen. Baffling! \n[/list] \n\n[i]TUNIC[/i] obviously wanted to be a masterpiece, and it came [i]so close[/i] to being one. Though I feel it stumbles a little at the finish line, it's absolutely still worth experiencing. If this looks the least bit interesting to you, I invite you to dive right in. It lasts about 20 hours, and is guaranteed to blow your mind more than once. Just go in with the right expectations: this is a puzzle game, not a Zelda clone. If you want some top-tier bragging rights, see if you can get all the pages, fairies, and secret items without looking at a guide. (Tip: while you can get through the main story on your own, better grab a pen and a notebook if you're going for any of the game's bonus collectables. You'll need it.)\n\nI'm very happy to have played this.

The entire game is one big maze- the path may seem straightforwards at first, but then when you get stumped, there's always a new path you'd missed. You may not have seen that path if you didn't gain the new information the old path taught you. The world is filled to the brim, so much so, there are secrets INSIDE the secrets. There's always something new to be found and gained.\nThe music takes you inside the world, its very neutral pacing allowing you to ruminate at the wall you've been trying to get around for the past 20 minutes without it getting grating or irritating. The game is meant to be a puzzle in every sense, pushing you in the same directions you've been, and giving you resources to a puzzle you don't know exist. Every minute I played this game was a nother minute that I was captured by its charm, and surprised at every little twist and turn the game had to offer. Was it hard when I got stuck? Yes. Was it annoying? Also yes- but it was never to a point where I wanted to remove myself from the game. Everything was always in reach, and if one path yielded nothing, I knew I could go back to an area I had combed 3 times over and find something new all over.\nThe story itself keeps very hidden, which to me was a bit of a disappointment. I'm someone who loves games for their story, and that's not the kind of game that Tunic is. There are aspects of Environmental Storytelling in the booklet and areas within the game, but no part of the story is directly discernible. To me that's part of the game- I realize that now. It gives itself to hypothesis, being a new puzzle to explore once you feel ready, or come to your own conclusions about the story as you play. The story is never outright spelled out for you, but just to a higher extent than you'd expect from other similarly narratively-structured games like Dark Souls or Hollow Knight. In those games, the story is present everywhere and can be deciphered through painstaking research, the story of Tunic is less so. This was initially disappointing, but as I look back on my experience, I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to craft a story of my own through bites of context. That's not something a lot of games get right these days.\nTo summarize; Tunic is a game for EVERYONE.

Tunic makes for a great combination of both sides, creating what it would be for a Zelda game to have that kind of combat. The combat is a lot simpler than most souls-likes but you still got the essentials, being the dodge roll and health potions. The combat being simple doesn't mean that the fights were easy though. Many fights had me stuck dying over and over but I was still able to get through. The boss fights were all very enjoyable (even though I fought one of the later ones earlier than I probably should've). The puzzles were also pretty interesting, with all of the obelisks and how you needed to get to them to open the big door. Especially the puzzle to open the mountain door, I thought that puzzle was so interesting I didn't mind that it took me a while to complete it because it was honestly that good.

And at first, it was just that, however I then realized that there was much more to this game.\n\nSince there was nothing telling me what the story was, I began coming up with my own narrative on who my character was and what was my goal.  As I continued to play, pieces of the story were revealed in different ways that started filling in gaps and kept driving me to continue.  This eventually led me to discover many more secrets and puzzles within the game that would further flush out the story and help me beat the game.\n\nThe game\u2019s combat is pretty simple and was easy to get used to.  I do think there quite a bit of a difficulty curve once you get to a boss.  I feel like the bosses almost force you to learn to do certain technique that help you do better in combat.  However, I could never get how to perform a parry.  I got it to work a few times, but it was highly unreliable and sometimes I felt like not being able to parry was making bosses more difficult than they needed to be.  Another thing I found cumbersome about combat was trying to combine powers into new attacks.  I would struggle a lot trying to get these combination attacks to work and wish it was simpler as these would probably have made boss fights easier as well.\n\nSome of the puzzles in TUNIC can be tedious to solve and I can\u2019t see this being something everyone would enjoy.

I do hope there is some effort to make a sequel though as I found this game to be pretty unique and would like to play more.\n\nThis game also has a new game+ mode that lets you go from the beginning of the game with most of your items and abilities from your previous playthrough.

Unlike a lot of games in this \"cryptic puzzle\" genre, such as [i]La-Mulana[/i] and [i]The Witness[/i], [i]Tunic[/i] cleverly embeds it's puzzle solving into the game by presenting it in a unique way; make the answers incredibly obvious, but completely obfuscate them.\n\n[i]Tunic[/i] is a Zelda-like exploration RPG where the major twist is that you have an in-game manual. Not just a \"heres how to play the game\" manual, but a full on guide, full of maps, secrets, and important details. The manual is written in a cipher language that you cannot understand, forcing the player to instead rely on visual cues and tiny clues hidden throughout the book to progress. This is, in a single word, enthralling. The game has quite literally every answer for every puzzle stuffed into this guide somewhere, making the act of even picking up a page exciting. Some of the puzzles in this game use the manual in fascinating and engrossing ways, and even outside of the puzzles the manual is used to excellent effect. You get foreshadowing, atmosphere, useful tips and practical advice from this thing, making it a constant companion in your journey. The integration of the manual into the puzzle design is nothing short of genius and it is easily [i]Tunic[/i]'s most successful idea. \n\nUnfortunately, that's all of [i]Tunic[/i]'s qualities I can fully praise. Everything else is divisive. To sum it up quickly, [i]Tunic[/i] slowly shifts from an exploration-based game to a puzzle-based one. While I personally liked this, quite a few people strongly disliked this shift, feeling as though the qualities they liked about the game were phased out for something else. I wouldn't call this false advertising, more like a shift in priorities. It honestly feels like all the meaningful exploration is just there to set up the puzzles, which can feel disheartening when you realise how repetitive some of the puzzles can be. Using the puzzle as a guidebook while exploring or figuring out where to go next is awesome, using it to do most of the lategame puzzles really isn't. Even though I liked the shift to the puzzle focus, I can't really say I enjoyed it more than the exploration of the first three quarters.\n\nStill, I really freaking loved this game. The manual idea alone is ingenius, and all of the concepts surrounding the game and its cultivated mystique are executed perfectly. Even if [i]Tunic[/i] didn't hit all the beats I wanted it to, and ultimately moved away from what I felt was a very strong design focus, I cannot deny that it succeeded in what it wanted to accomplish: inspiring genuine wonder and awe in a guy who's been playing games before he could walk.", "timestamp_created": 1687918068, "timestamp_updated": 1687918068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140808378": {"recommendationid": "140808378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180468741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1587, "last_played": 1690658986}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un juegardo, tranquilo y a su vez desafiante", "timestamp_created": 1687893882, "timestamp_updated": 1687893882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140807119": {"recommendationid": "140807119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025234274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1636, "last_played": 1687892277}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good.", "timestamp_created": 1687892411, "timestamp_updated": 1687892411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140753587": {"recommendationid": "140753587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973650738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1688339457}, "language": "english", "review": "A stunning looking game that packs a punch.

What makes this game stand out however isn't in it's similarities to Zelda games, but rather in it's differences.\n\n\nMuch like Outer Wilds, this is one of those games where I can't give you too much information without spoiling major aspects of the game. In fact, that is the very premise the game is built around. Despite the Zelda-like layout and Souls-like combat, the core of this game revolves around information. Everything in this game is written in an undecipherable wingding language, leaving the player guessing as to what signs mean throughout the world. More importantly though, as you go through the game, you'll find pages of the game's \"instruction manual\", being very reminiscent of the manuals in older NES/SNES titles. This manual is also mostly in this wingding language, forcing the player to decipher meanings from the pictures, other pages, and context clues. While you may think this sounds annoying upon reading this review, let me assure you that this is excellently pulled off, making you want to find these manual pages and keeping you thinking about what some enigmatic riddle could mean long after you've put the game down. When you do figure something new out, the \"Ah-Ha!\" moment is unparalleled and you feel like a genius.\nThe only time these manual puzzles become really over the top to solve is in the post-game for the \"good\" ending. I did not actually manage to solve all of these, but despite it, I never found it too frustrating to go on, and if anything makes me even more determined to eventually go back and solve that mystery.\n\nBeyond that, I can tell you that while there aren't that many boss fights, they are quite enjoyable and visually pleasing. The exploration in this game is top notch. The items are very fun to use, and combat in general is fun. The skills you get as you go through the game, as well as how you get them, are also a blast. I will say, while the story is pretty decent, it's probably the weakest part of the game overall.\n\nTruly this is a game I would recommend to nearly everyone. One of the best games in every genre it falls into.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSteam shows me playing this game only a few hours.

A key difference is that, although you still collect items to help you traverse the world, the true primary thing you collect is information about the game, which is learned via pages of the instruction manual scattered across the world. As a result, you should ABSOLUTELY go in blind if you don't want to spoil a lot of the information-based puzzles throughout the game. Puzzles are altogether not terribly difficult, and the game loooves hiding stuff just out of sight of the isometric view, so if strafing walls and shifting camera angles regularly pisses you off, this might sour your experience a bit. One thing to note is that the instruction manual, and nearly all text in game, is in a foreign script, so the primary \"puzzle\" is critically examining context clues you find in the manual and around you to understand what's going on and what to do. That said, the game still does a very good job directing you along the critical path without relying on you finding obscure secrets, so if you do want to just breeze through without searching for and finding every little hidden thing, there are plenty enough breadcrumbs for that. At worst, if you have slacked on finding pages, you may find yourself in an area without a map, but this still works find so long as you aren't trying to find every secret in the area.\n\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, the game is a fair bit more challenging than Zelda, and combat has a \"weightier\" feel akin to Dark Souls that encourages you to precisely use I-frames in dodge-rolls to avoid damage or be heavily punished. Bosses in particular can be very challenging, and force you to really learn their patterns well before you have even a chance to win against them.\n\nOverall, an absolutely fantastic experience and a remarkable example of good, hands-off game design that teaches the player by allowing them to learn themselves via subtle, precise guidance.

Part of makes this game so incredible is how detailed and creative the puzzles are. Once you finally start to figure things out the game really opens up and it really gives a classic feel to it. I do have to warn however that it really isn't your average puzzle game where you're just gonna get to a point where you can breeze through the puzzles.

You have to carefully examine the small handwritten notes and illustrations on each page to help you solve puzzles and progress. There is a very satisfying sense of accomplishment in figuring out these obtuse hints that lead to greater discoveries.

Overrated, overpriced.\nSPOILERS BELOW\nPeople talk about this game like it is so fresh and unique, OOOH, MANUAL AND EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN IN JIBBERISH! OOH THERE IS SECRET KNOWLEDGE TO BE HAD! OOOH YOU GET MANUAL AS A SECRET REWWAAARD! GAME REWARDS YOU WITH KNOWLEDGE. SO COOL\nWell, jibberish is a silly gimmick. It wears thin really fast, and doesn't add anything to the game. \nSecret knowledge is in almost all (except for one, basically) cases is either a input combination to open a door, or a shortcut to skip some stuff. \nManual pages are either useless (most of them), have those input combinations I mentioned (a couple), or have information on game mechanics which are usually hit or miss, depending on whether you were able to deduce yourself that being out of stamina or health is bad for you.\nI remember in a first couple of hours walking around, seeing unreachable stuff and thinking to myself - wow, cool hooks. I wonder what they do. Ooh, what about camertones? Maybe there is a simple melody you can play. Oh, those are teleport waypoints. I bet if I knew how they work I could skip like half of the game.\nWell, no. Hooks and camertones are literally just a grapple point.\n99% of all unreachable stuff just requires tools. Tools no knowldge in the game will be able to replace.\nAnd first two teleport points, which you could have gotten to before getting the info on how to use them, are useless without another tool you will get later. Nice.\nYou know what this game really is? Legend of Zelda. One of the worse ones, where every tool has a designated use points. Oh, it also has 2 endings, and Zelda is evil and you have to kill her. Don't worry. she is just cranky cause people use her brethren as battery fluid.\nMusic is really good, The highlight of the game for me.\nCombat is as basic as it gets (roll. block. single(usefull) attack, single usefull weapon, several spells), and doesn't feel good. Your character is slow. Attack feedback is boring. Enemies looove to block and dash back, and both your chasedown and guard breaking ability is basically non existant without spells.\nI don't know whether it is a deliberate choice or a bug, but holding sprint when you a locked on forces you character to run to an enemy in a straight line. Yep, you heard it right, you can't sprint around while you are locked on. Weird.\nBlock is almost useless with how much stamina and hitstun it takes, and how easy it is to get dead angled. Parry is such an afterthought that some enemies with shields don't even drop their guard when they are parried. Also it is so slow that most attacks in the game can't be parried on reaction even with good reaction and moveset knowledge. Just sad.\nAlso there is a LOT of combat. With how much there is, I expected it to be mor fun. \nWell, thanks, Fromsoft, I guess we all now get to live in a world where every game has stamina meter and other soulslike trappings without understanding of what makes them fun and compelling.\n", "timestamp_created": 1686845623, "timestamp_updated": 1687103709, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398515284061431885", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140097313": {"recommendationid": "140097313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083983697", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1686827507}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game for a single playthrough.

I also received this game as a birthday gift (thank you!!)\n\nTo keep things short up front, this game is a love letter to exploration games like zelda while making use of the fromsoft souls formula for a lot of the game's mechanics, in a stripped down way. There are pros and cons to this. The world keeps you wanting to explore for no reason other than \"I wonder what lies ahead?\" This will be very familiar to fans of souls games, and you may find yourself right at home.\n\nNow, for the long part. A lot is subjective person-to-person so I'll lay out the more prominent things I experienced. \n\nThe game has an obscured language that slowly reveals itself as you discover pages of the lost instruction manual. It very much starts out feeling like you're playing a foreign untranslated game and you have to guess and experiment with how items work, and there are many hidden mechanics you'll have to puzzle out yourself. There have already been a few instances where I had to return to an area later because an obscure mechanic or puzzle solution was hidden and only hinted at in a page of the instruction manual found much later. And by obscure, I don't mean hints about a puzzle you could brute force, I mean arbitrarily obscure. As in, hold a random button for 5 seconds in a specific place so something will happen. Spoilers: [spoiler] You can tell the one that annoyed me the most is the prayer mechanic that moves the big pillars and allows fast travel on the golden plates. It is fine on its own but felt entirely random and came out of nowhere. [/spoiler]\n\nThe combat is really tough and took some getting used to because it is clunky at times. Not DS1 clunky, but actual clunky. Enemies hit like a truck in the early game when you have nothing but a stick and no hp upgrades. Sometimes the lock on makes you strafe instead of rotate to face the enemy. There is little telegraphing in enemy attacks because of the basic art style, save for some of the sword enemies. The big problem though, is the enemies don't really scale up too much once you find the items that make it easier to fight them (getting the shield and wand makes fighting encounters WAY smoother, to the point of trivializing them). This is also not a souls game where dodge rolling is king; in fact I only use the dodging to reposition because of the poor iframes. It's more reliable to focus on positioning and blocking rather than actual dodging. None of this was bad enough to push me away, but it did come close until I found the sword and shield. I can very well see the early game dissuading others.\n\nThere are many hidden paths and rooms all over the place, which is neat and rewards a careful eye and exploration. That said, there is definitely a pattern of \"if a corner of a room is obscured by the walls/camera angle, there is at least a 60% chance something is hidden there\" which, again, is a little cheap but at least consistent. Illusory walls in souls games are pretty much an immersion breaking meme but at least this game integrates secrets a bit better into the game world itself.\n\nVisually, the game looks great. No major comments here. I especially like the art style of the instruction booklet. Very nostalgic!\n\nThis game is a tough recommend unless you're used to the game language of souls games and don't require much direction to feel fulfilled. Exploration can feel rewarding despite knowing nothing about what you're doing or why you're doing it. You will have to want to play the game to enjoy it and uncover the mysteries held within it. I haven't even beaten the game and I have no idea if the ending will even be worth it, but its been fun so far.

[/u] Imo, if any game ever got the feeling [spoiler] Link's Awakening [/spoiler] was going for, it's this one. I'd argue it even does it better. Not only do you [spoiler] wake up on a strange island with no bearings [/spoiler], to add to this feeling [spoiler] you can't even read most of the text within the game. The only thing you can even do a lot of the time is wander aimlessly with nothing more than the feeling that you're probably doing what you're supposed to. [/spoiler] As you progress, [spoiler] things become more and more surreal. [/spoiler] [spoiler] You find pages of an NES style instruction booklet of the game's mechanics that you have to slowly try to understand because when I said you couldn't read most of the text, that includes this. And as you piece together the mechanics of the game, the mechanics of the world and its artificiality become clearer. It adds an unsettling feeling to an otherwise inviting world. [/spoiler] [spoiler] So you're stuck in this world where you're constantly unsure and looking for answers and secrets while never really knowing why you're doing it in the first place. While playing, I would often think \"what would I do here if this was a Zelda game?\" and when what I thought of worked, it felt like I was being rewarded for having a shared interest with the developers. [/spoiler]\n\n\n[u] \u2606 Puzzles. [/u] The game has great puzzles. If you've enjoyed [spoiler] The Witness [/spoiler] then you'll probably like Tunic. Like [spoiler] The Witness, the game doesn't tell you much upfront but there is a lot to discover.[/spoiler] [spoiler] The more you play, you begin to realize how many puzzles have been staring directly at you the whole time, you just didn't realize it until you get on the same brain-wavelength as the game.[/spoiler] [spoiler] Even a lot of the game's mechanics are left to you to figure out with just a few hints scattered around. I watched a friend play the game and discover things I never knew about and solve problems in completely different ways. It [i] feels [/i] like you're only given the bare minimum information but there's actually clues everywhere, it just depends on how you think that determines which ones you see. [/spoiler] And by the end [spoiler] you realize just how much power you've had since the beginning of the game. What looked like a linear path was actually a completely open world. [/spoiler]\n\n[u] \u2606 It is what it is. [/u] The game can be very challenging if you want it to be. I'm told the game's combat is similar to a small indie game called [spoiler] Dark Souls? [/spoiler] Never, played it myself but I hear people like it. That said, it's also completely optional. You can play [spoiler] without upgrade for an extra challenge [/spoiler], Modify the combat in the accessibility settings, or turn it off. If you turn on \"No Fail Mode\", you can just sit back and solve the puzzles. That being said...\n\n[u] \u2606 It is what it is? [/u] [spoiler] If you want to just play the game like an open world where you can fight enemies until you reach the boss to fight then you can kind of just do that too I guess. [/spoiler] I have no idea why you would [i] want [/i] to do that [spoiler] but you're the type of person that really wants to play puzzle games but wishes they didn't have any of those puzzles, then you can turn off pretty much every puzzle in the accessibility settings as well. Turning off all puzzles [i] and [/i] combat is also an option if you want to experience the game without actually having to play it. [/spoiler] Is there a \"right\" way to play Tunic? I don't think so. [spoiler] Is there a wrong way? It really seems like the developers don't think so. [/spoiler]\n\n[u] \u2606 The [b] Style [/b]. [/u] I generally believe that in almost any case, a hand drawn 2D version could look better then any 3D modeled version. Tunic is not one of these cases. Everything from the models, to the animations, to how they interact with you as the player was crafted perfectly. Graphics expire, but art direction is timeless. There's so much charm in the way the tall grass bounces as you run through it or as the bushes bounce away when you cut them. All the way down to the smallest detail, it all builds to an extremely pleasing aesthetic. [spoiler] But the cute is always just offset enough to build an atmospheric feeling that something isn't right. And it rides that line perfectly between inviting and somber, fantastical and futuristic, epic and silly. But the game never tells you what it is so anything it surprises you with something out of left field, it can't be \"wrong\". Everything you thought it was, was your own projection of what you thought the game was. [/spoiler] [spoiler] Even the way the camera moves adds to the specific charm of the game. Something about being able to pan around a corner to reveal what's behind it feels jarring due to its isometric nature and style of top down adventure games. [/spoiler] [spoiler] Being able to go behind so much of the foreground where you can't even see yourself anymore adds to it feeling artificial. [/spoiler] [spoiler] And when the camera pans to reveal a shortcut that circles back to where you started, it almost feels like the developers are acknowledging you and messing with you at the same time. [/spoiler] It's great! [spoiler] The game kind of cycles between being a fun adventure, hinting at a darker theme, and then reminding you not to take it too seriously. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] And as you come to understand the game as a metanarrative, you start to see the game for what it is. It's really just a game. An epic adventure with unfathomable technology, a cute story in an unsettling world with an incomprehensible history, and just a game.

After playing it through and eating every puzzle it has to offer, the praise is quite warranted. The puzzles are more mature and complicated and there is less item progression compared to ALttP, however I do not feel the game suffers for it. It is not totally similar to ALttP and similar games but I feel that it really scratched the same itch of a million secrets and things to explore.\n\nThe combat is enjoyable and the bosses feel the right amount of difficult, however on keyboard re-focusing is a little cumbersome, but there is only one fight which benefits from doing it so it isn't a huge problem.\n\nThe story is the weak point of the game however that doesn't mean it is unenjoyable. It is merely a little simplistic compared to similar titles like Hollow Knight and I was never particularly drawn by the story, but then again I wasn't much drawn by ALttP's story either. I don't feel the lack of a great story detracts from the game experience and the story still has a couple of \"Oh wow\" or \"Aww cute\" moments which will stick with me.\n\nThe game is extremely rewarding for someone who loves devouring puzzles, returning to areas, noting little things that don't quite seem right, and watching everything come together in the end. You are given no direction, no instruction, and no goals by the game. This game will not hold your hand, not in the hardcore way, but in a way that makes you feel like you are able to do all things at your own pace and really makes you feel special each time you discover something new entirely on your own.\n\nThere is a lot going on in the puzzle department and a lot of areas to return to, so this game might be a bit tricky to come back to after putting it down for a month or something. You know its a good puzzle game when you get out the pencil and paper notebook, and this is one of those, so don't be afraid to write down stuff!\n\nThe manual adds a ton of charm to the game and everything feels lovingly crafted. I cannot recommend the game highly enough. I hope they will make something similar in the future. Thank you TUNIC team for your hard work and love!\n\nIf you think you may like this game. You will. Buy it. My greatest recommendation is to absolutely NOT look up anything about this game. If you are *really* stuck, have a friend look something up for you and tell you the piece you are missing. You can spoil so many good puzzles with the smallest idea or spoiler and there are so many layers.", "timestamp_created": 1685832891, "timestamp_updated": 1685832891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743192970752716064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139502850": {"recommendationid": "139502850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207854185", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1873, "last_played": 1688503652}, "language": "english", "review": "Tunic is a wonderful detective game and RPG stitched together, and I'd recommend it to people who enjoy both.

Maybe I didn't do my homework first, but it had been described to me as, and the previews made it look like, a Zelda clone. But it really isn't. The basics are there, you have a sword, a shield, and a green tunic, but that's about it.\nOn it's own, the game is pretty challenging... until you get to the bosses. The bosses are incredibly difficult. I found myself spending more time trying to beat the bosses then playing the game. Yes, there's some of the \"git gud\" mentality to them, but even after learning their attacks and how to dodge them, it still mostly came down to luck. For example, most games with difficult bosses, once you learn their patterns, you can beat them pretty reliably. In Tunic, you can beat a boss one try, and not even get a single attack the next. Not only that, but the boss battles are incredibly boring.\nThe other thing that I disliked was the game instructions. Without giving away spoilers, there are no game instructions at the beginning. As you start to go through the game, you start getting some of those instructions, but at that point you don't need them. It was pretty interesting how the instructions tied into the puzzles though...\nAnd speaking of puzzles, the one part I really loved about the game is the puzzles. They were very difficult, and I love that. The problem is, they are not advertised to you at all. I didn't even know I was looking for puzzles until I was looking up help on beating a boss. Then I had to slog my way back through the game looking for all of them.\nAll in all, it was a cute game, but I found the bosses too much of a pain, and there wasn't enough other stuff to keep the game fun.", "timestamp_created": 1685807426, "timestamp_updated": 1685807426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483221471309661865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139485871": {"recommendationid": "139485871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186912563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1821, "last_played": 1685821218}, "language": "english", "review": "incredible", "timestamp_created": 1685806292, "timestamp_updated": 1685929591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139465494": {"recommendationid": "139465494", "author": {"steamid": "76561199257079934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1689739697}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun exploring hidden areas.

It's hard to convey to someone who hasn't played it just how brilliant this design is. The combat of the game is also really engaging.\nAnother thing that really draws you in is the super charming artistic and audio/music direction.

Tunic seems on the surface as a bright, colorful, indie title taking inspirations from Zelda-like series and a few small Souls mechanics in it. But, it does get quite a bit deeper and involved than most would initially think. It's difficult to tell anyone much about this game, as playing it and uncovering both lore and inner workings is a integral part of it's experience. In order to avoid spoiling anything, it's best to go into it blind.\n\nTo anyone who enjoys just getting lost in a game world, it's story, and uncovering secrets, I would fully recommend it. Much of the story you pick up from clues and small snippets in game and you largely construct the story and background yourself as you go, seeing more of that the game has to offer you. The soundtrack and audio design is excellent, as well as the games visual style. And others like myself, may find that this game reminds them of games they played when they were younger, and were able to enjoy with a sense of wonder, and become attached to it long after the game is complete. I still haven't found all it's secrets yet, and will happily continue trying without ever looking up a guide.

I like the idea of piecing together how the game works from clues, but the clues rarely contain all the information you need, so in practice there's a ton of brute force. The game really likes its \"there's an invisible path the fixed camera doesn't let you see\" gimmick, and I spent a lot of time running around the edges of zones trying to bump into those to progress (not for secrets, to complete the core game).

Combat is pretty clunky to begin with, and about halfway through the game takes away all of your upgrades and ramps up the difficulty significantly.

That's good! I used to love those games and felt like this sort of exploration of old games' level design was a very fun idea.\n\nAnd the game exectutes this fairly well! The manual pages are fun to find and the secrets can be wonderful to figure out yourself, some many hours after you already had the opportunity to do something with them. A lot of people mention how this makes it so getting lost is way too easy, and yes, it is, but I think that is to be expected if you want the ideal experience with this game. Fuck, go play the first Zelda on the NES, are you not lost?\n\nThe problem is something else entirely. Because exploration and cryptic puzzles simply isn't enough to make this game entertaining (debatable), TUNIC has a lot of combat too. A sword and a shield, magic items, a dodge roll, and every type of enemy attacking you that you can think of. You heal through flask-like items, and using checkpoints makes enemies respawn. Sound familiar?\n\nUnfortunately, TUNIC's combat is an intrusive mess, a complete \"fuck you\" to the player with very easy to understand but mechanically unfair fights. Every enemy encounter is potentially fatal, and they're all okay at best and \"immediately closing the application\" at worst. Out of, what, 5 or 6 boss fights I did, only 1 was all that interesting. Fuck, at some point they even give you [spoiler]enemies who make your health bar smaller if you get hit. Are you serious? What is this design?[/spoiler]\n\nIt is upsetting to me how much a game so unashamed of showing its influences can also feel so afraid of having simple zelda-like combat. This game should not have been a soulslike. Its hostility towards the player can make some sense thematically, but is so frustrating that I've tried three times to give this game another chance and failed. I got to one of the parts people consider to be \"when the game gets good\" but at that point my patience had wore down so much that I couldn't bear to keep going.\n\nIf you want to get this anyway but consider my opinion on this worth a listen, just... Don't be afraid to just use the invincibility. The fact that it's an option right there from the moment you start means something.\n\nI just wish TUNIC was a game about exploring areas and solving puzzles.

It is absolutely outstanding. \nThis game does not give you a lot to go off. You don't really know anything when you start, but it gives you just enough as you go through the game to piece everything together. It's an interesting idea which a lot of games try to do, but i personally feel like this is one of the only times that it has actually been done well.\nBy giving you a user manual in a cryptic language, it gives you guidance, but makes you figure it out yourself. It's such a unique approach. It explains everything, absolutely everything, but does so in a way that still requires you to figure it all out for yourself. This is such an innovative way of doing instruction, explanation, and guidance, and it works shockingly well. It is engaging, interesting, and uninvasive.\nI do however think that this feature is a massive hit or miss sort of thing, with some serious downsides, and the potential to ruin the game for some people. You will frequently find yourself getting lost while playing, and remaining lost for a while until you find what it is that you missed. You won't know if you're just missing something obvious, or if you're in the wrong part of the world entirely. The frequent confusion followed by aimless wandering definitely gets quite tiresome and frustrating, but overall i think this is an extremely cool part of the game.\n\nThe storytelling is done in a similar way. It's engaging, and it's presented in a way that I can only describe by calling it art. It has you experience the story rather than being told it, which i absolutely love.\n\nThe visuals are just stunning. A very unique and stylised aesthetic which looks beautiful, has serious love and attention put into it, and doesn't require a supercomputer to run well. \n\nThe combat isn't good, but it's okay. This is where the similarities to dark souls hurt the game. The dodging, attacking, blocking, parrying, and healing are all so slow and clunky, and the game could be better with a more fast paced combat system, BUT, it works okay in this. The enemy attacks are very well telegraphed, both visually and aurally, and there are well defined patterns. The mechanics which may not be immediately obvious are understood after checking the manual, the hitboxes are accurate, and the animations are good. The clunkiness is a definite negative, but the combat is built around it better than most games that have the same issue, so unlike those games, it's quite manageable here. Once you get comfortable with it, it feels fine.\n\nAudio is great, the music goes from intense to eerie to beautiful so smoothly, and the sound effects do an outstanding job at making you feel immersed.\n\nThe physics give a good feeling of polish to the game, but at the same time, can be a bit detrimental. For example, I got stuck completely at one spot because some debris blocked the path up and I just couldn't push it out of the way for some reason. It's cool seeing pots shatter to pieces that all move independently, and it's cool being able to make use of the physics by doing things such as rolling explosive barrels into a group of enemies, but the fact that these pieces can create roadblocks feels like a bit of an oversight.\n\nThe world is remarkable. It is very detailed, absolutely packed with secrets, so interesting and unique, and so well made. Every section fits together so seamlessly, shortcuts are scattered around in the most convenient places, and you're constantly shown things that are just out of reach, filling you with curiosity as to how and when you will be able to reach it. And every time you are given whatever new thing you need for you to get them, it feels absolutely amazing each and every time.\nIt is so full of life too. There are new enemies everywhere you go, that are all so clearly tailored for that area. They're all unique and interesting, and they are perfectly suited to their environment. Paired with the stunning visuals, this has to be one of my favourite video game worlds ever.\n\nThe puzzles are absolutely genius. I thought they were amazing all game, but once i reached the post game, i was blown away. I've always struggled with puzzle games, because they never make sense to me. Rather than trying to figure out the puzzle, i'm stuck trying to figure out what the rules and mechanics of the puzzle are. Yet somehow this game which is intentionally mysterious makes perfect sense to me. I know how to figure out the puzzles, i just need to actually solve them. I'm not wasting much time questioning what I need to do. This game has the single most interesting puzzles I have ever encountered, they are outstanding. Figuring out how to open the mountain door was such a gratifying feeling.\nSome of them however, or more specifically, some of the bonus collectables, are way too demanding. They vary from simply needing you to notice little details in the manual, to expecting you to study up on musical notations. I do strongly recommend trying to figure out as much of the game as you can by yourself, but by the end, it felt to me more like you as an individual are not expected to, the playerbase as a whole is. You will definitely need guidance to 100% this.\n\nOverall, i do believe this game is a hit or miss, as the unique approach to guidance could just as easily turn people away from the game as it could attract people, and the complexity of this world and the secrets it contains may be a bit much for some. Though I think if it does hit for you, you're going to have a new top 10 favourite game. It is just so good. I very strongly recommend giving it a chance.", "timestamp_created": 1683781594, "timestamp_updated": 1683781594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138121110": {"recommendationid": "138121110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004565666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1687046426}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant Zelda-style adventure, with a huge focus on the sense of discovery.

Half of it it's enjoyable for me, the other half it's just frustrating.

I wish there was a mode for mere mortals. It's sad because it's not a bad game, it just doesn't feel balanced. I can't recommend this game to casual players, but hey, give it a shot.

Every reward is a discovery, and every discovery feels like a reward. The game takes you in so many different directions. You go right, left, up, and down. And I'm talking about the GAME, not simply the story. \n\nAnd the combat and difficulty isn't even the selling point like in a Souls game. By all means, if you're having trouble, turn the difficulty down (it's an option). The game to me isn't based around its difficulty or hardship, its based around the feeling of discovery.

Helps that it's short and tightly packed all the way through.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThe art style is lovely - both for the game itself and the accompanying documents.\n90% of the puzzles are fun to solve, even if most use the they mechanic.\nThe combat feels fun. even if very simple. Bosses were pretty satisfying to beat, although often cheeseable.\nMusic and Sound Design is great.\nProgression is tangible, which is nice.\nThis aesthetic is incredibly enjoyable.\n\nTHE BAD:\n10% of the puzzles can range from annoying to frustrating. I feel like this would depend heavily on your personality though. I feel as if past me would have enjoyed these way more than present me.\n\nOverall, I would say this falls at around a 7.5-8/10. If you like puzzles, play this game. If you like exploration, consider playing the game.

It has such a beautifully stylized, highly detailed, handcrafted world for you to explore. Basically every 10 square feet of this place has something important going on with it. It's not particularly big, but the stark lack of dead space here makes it feels like a continent.\nBut OH BOY it is so much more.\nBasically everything that you need to know in order to play the game is kept a secret from you in the beginning. There is an in-game manual, but its are pages scattered throughout the world, and you need to collect them in order to get any sense of what you're doing (otherwise, it's trial and error). I'm a person who loves making secret codes and conlangs in their free time, and finding the first few pages of the manual lit that part of my brain up like a fireworks show. While there are parts of it you can get from context, more than half the thing is written in a secret language you have to solve. [i]Learning how to play this game is a puzzle.[/i]\nRemember how I said every 10 square feet of this game has something important going on in it? Well, this game actually has another name, \"Secret Legend\", and given how many secrets there are in this game, it fits very well. While this game has been appropriately labelled a Zelda-Souls-like, it is first and foremost a game about learning secrets. There are collectible upgrades and special abilities you can access, but secrets serve as your primary means of progression. I was afraid that this would hurt the game's replayability, but here's the funny thing: IT DOESN'T. While there is a New Game+ option that makes things a bit tougher, restarting the game from scratch with a totally new save is a completely different experience, since the secrets you have learned from completing it still apply: while in-game you are as weak as you were when you first started out, you can use your old knowledge to completely overthrow the order of progression.\nIt is a wild experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a mystery. A few things you should know, though (and keep in mind, this is a person who likes solving puzzles): \n1. If you get any pleasure from puzzle-solving, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM INTERNET GUIDES AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. While there are a rare few who respect the player's intelligence by tastefully dropping hints, most resources you find on the Internet just give you the answer, sometimes spoiling more than you'd have liked to know. There were a few times I had to look something up (one of the late game secrets required me to know a game mechanic I should have learned in the early game),  But if you really like the thrill of solving a puzzle yourself, read the manual closely. Try different tactics and perspectives. Heck, if it's still pretty early in the game, save it for later. It might be frustrating in the moment, but once you solve it, you'll be glad you did.\n2. While there are some opportunities to softlock yourself, there are even more ways to get physically stuck that aren't actually softlocks, i.e. getting temporarily stuck on a ledge or cheesing your way into an area before knowing how to get out. There are a few game mechanics that are particularly tricky on this; they've been fined-tuned to greatly reduce the likelihood, but it can still happen. Usually, getting stuck is just a matter of finagling your way out, but it you do softlock, you can just reload the save to escape them.\n3. Keep an open mind going in. I went into this thinking this was going to be an ordinary adventure, but I was completely caught off guard by its sheer complexity, in more ways than one.

Maybe I was a bit too hyped for it, because, as it is, it is still an ok game and I had fun playing it. It however doesn\u2019t innovate in any meaningful way and compared to the games it got inspired from, namely Zelda and Darksouls, it feels shallow. Even though it\u2019s basically a combination of those two games, it doesn\u2019t borrow their strongest elements and doesn\u2019t manage to get the same level of excitement as either of these two titles while playing. \n\nAs I eluded before, Tunic is an isometric dungeon crawler type of game the likes of Zelda, with many elements borrowed from Dark souls, such as the bonfire-system, the estus-flask, the mysterious barely explained narrative and maybe some small empathies on boss fights using a dodge and parry mechanic. The aesthetic of it really make it seem like it\u2019s a Zelda-type game which has elements borrowed from Dark souls, which was what I was expecting, however it more feels like a souls-like game that has elements borrowed from Zelda. What do I mean by that?\n\nWell for a game like that I expected something similar to the temples/dungeons found in Zelda, with some kind of puzzles and keys and new items with which to fight the bosses of said temples. Well some of Tunics levels can be thought of as dungeons or temples, but there are basically no puzzles or key-riddles in them, neither are there any new items. Tunics levels boil down to elongated hallways with a bunch of monsters to fight, the treasures found mainly elude to upgrading your characters\u2019 base stats instead of giving a different ability or fighting style. One level I found particularly disappointing: There was one lair which totally gave me the vibe of an assassin hideout, so enemies sneaking up on me and traps and those sorts of things was what I expected\u2026. but what I got was the same as any other level. I am all for subverting expectations, but you have to at least do something with it and not subvert it by doing nothing. I think no level in Tunic is really memorable or unique, they all kinda feel samey and not really interesting. They look nice, so the level design is nicely done, but they play very repetitively without any soul in them. \n\nThe only thing uniquely interesting about Tunic is probably its darker world building in the second half of the game and the game journal you use to make sense of the world. The game journal however also includes the maps of dungeons, which in my opinion gave away too much if you got them before even entering the specific area.  \n\nAll the riddles in the game kinda came at the end and after figuring out how they work you have to go through every area again searching for them\u2026 it\u2019s a very tedious job and since those riddles mostly use the same mechanic, there is not much variety in them. Overall I would say that a lot of the mysterious-solving elements of Tunic basically boil down to going over the same area over and over again until you find something new. It was not very fun to do so, which is why I didn\u2019t finish off all the optional puzzles. \n\nTo conclude, Tunic was a fine game, with some nice level design and the bosses very fun to fight. However it doesn't manage to stick out of the many forgettable 2D indie souls like games or the 2D indie Zelda like games.", "timestamp_created": 1682085419, "timestamp_updated": 1682085419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563071906566619873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137027558": {"recommendationid": "137027558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198888542328", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1683604506}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blend of Zelda and Dark Souls, with the added bonus of all the words and clues being in an incomprehensible language.

The second the camera zoomed in on that little fox and the beautiful music started playing, I could instantly feel the game was going to be one to remember. I'd be lying if I said the nostalgic hook was the only thing that kept me playing, but the game has so much more to offer than just \"cute little guy with a sword\". The OST alone would be enough to sell it to me- it really carries you through each area and matched every one's vibe perfectly.\n\nEchoing what some others have said, I will agree that the gameplay, while simple, is very \"soulslike\". I played on the normal difficulty and died dozens of times to each boss until muscle memory kicked in, then it was secondhand nature and at that point the combat got really fun. The consequence for death isn't much of a setback though, but still- go in with the mindset that you'll be learning the mechanics by dying. A lot.\n\nAbove all else however, the one thing that kept my absolutely hooked was the overarching meta \"manual\" collection quest, where you come across little pages of an actual game manual that subsequently also doubles as an in-game strategy guide. The more I collected, the more immersed I felt, and the more it took me back to feeling like a kid literally looking through the guides of my old favorite games. It's a very unique and charming implementation of directing the player, without being overtly direct or holding your hand (which Tunic does pretty much none of), and towards the end, I felt like a madman mulling meticulously over each page over and over again for hints to the final puzzles. And if you're like me and couldn't get enough of the manual aspect, you probably wanted a physical version (which are becoming a reality and up for preorder!)\n\nOverall a truly amazing experience that I find my review can't do any justice- the only way is to pick this up and play it yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1681799190, "timestamp_updated": 1681799190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136886663": {"recommendationid": "136886663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092811392", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1683563838}, "language": "english", "review": "Gives off heavy OG Zelda vibes.

Tunic's puzzles are very, very boring - just like the way in which the puzzles of Fez are bad. \nI liked a bit one of the twists, but overall, when you solve them instead of \"Aha!\" all you will feel is \"Meh\". \n\nI'm saying this as a person who likes and solves difficult logical puzzles (Snakebird, Stephen's Sausage Roll, English Country Tune, The Witness) and also likes exploration and environmental puzzles (the earliest Tomb Raiders, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, the puzzle driven Zelda games, Project Eden, Ico) and of course, good 80s and 90s adventure games.\n\nFrom one point on, you are basically asked to \"decipher these weird patterns and symbols, or figure out this one little thing in this enormous world\". If you like cryptography, interpretation and deciphering for the sake of it, with no other justification... you'd better pick up a better game that does exactly these, like The Witness (patterns) or Heaven's Vault (language). Solving them isn't hard, it just feels like a chore, even less interesting than what I do at my day job. The puzzles are also pointlessly contrived; they don't follow from the emergent properties of the world. Obfuscation and red herrings for the sake of it. And the worst part - some puzzles have clear instructions once you notice them or obtain them, but the author has no idea in how many ways his \"clear instructions\" can be validly interpreted (in one particular case, it's hundreds).\n\nIt's notable that Tunic sells very well because of false advertising, or, more accurately put, because of the impression of \"Dark Souls meets Zelda\" it creates. In reality, it is \"Fez but with added combat\". Both Fez and Tunic feed on the nostalgia for exploration and discovery that old games provided and do it badly.\n\nThe worst part is that you can't figure out a game like this before you have wasted your money and, more importantly, A LOT OF YOUR PRECIOUS TIME. A demo wouldn't tell you enough; someone else's opinion may be irrelevant because they may be just dumb or not into that kind of thing. This is what bothers me the most. I'm used to exploration / puzzle games being rare and good. Now I have to be paranoid about my favourite genre. Maybe that's what I paid for: I paid for this bitter lesson.

Everything from the artstyle, design, soundtrack, and experience is well done.\n\nThis is rare of me to say, but I think the slightly high difficulty actually increased the overall exploration. The game doesn't have grind, where you can overcome a boss easily by wasting a few hours. It lets you try and figure out something that works. The reward for overcoming a boss is gratification, something that many games abuse a lot, to their detriment.\n\nThe idea of not telling the player where to go and what to do actually works here, despite it being a problem for me in older games. Although I did look up a guide from time to time, I think for the most part you'll be able to find your way around without getting stuck too many times. I loved the idea of the in-game manual, because it's not a cheatsheet, it's more like pages of hints. The language is hard to decipher, but you can try what you can and figure out what the pictures mean. Personally that part was fun, surprisingly. Loved how the manual has it's own texture, as if you could feel it.\n\nExploring is enjoyable too, getting new items, solving puzzles etc. Some are easy, well-hidden, or are absolutely insane which I only found after beating the game. The art style of the game makes each different area stand out. and you can see this in areas where the camera shows you this. This with the accompanying soundtrack really makes you feel the tone of each area, even the music is stuck in my head from time to time. \n\nThe greatest part of the experience might be the fact that it trusts the player a lot. Even if you check a guide, you will need experience. Even if you can cheese a boss, you still need practice. \n\nTunic has a lot of love put into it, and more people should get to experience it for themselves.

I've been following the development of this game since it was announced, and it has been well worth the wait. This game somehow captures the cryptic nature of games from the NES era, and that theme is continued as the game guides you almost entirely through a 90s-esque gaming manual in-game full of impeccable artwork, charts, and maps. I showed up for a cute, Zelday game with a fox, but I will compelled forward by gorgeous graphics, an immersive soundtrack, enchanting sound-design, and perfectly-paced \"story.\" The game play overall is accessible but still spicy. I found myself having to reevaluate my strategy each time I faced defeat, but didn't spend any longer than half an hour on any one boss. This game is truly excellent.\n\nI do have two areas of critique, however. The first is that the controller support for Steam failed to support the targeting system. I started with a controller, and had to switch to keyboard because there were certain enemies I could not get past, as the 'locking on' in fact, did not lock on, and chose instead to switch targets as it pleased. My second area of critique is that this game has a LOT of hidden pathways, and relies heavily on them to move you through levels. I found myself getting stuck for far too long simply because I didn't find a specific, hidden path. If hidden paths would've been introduced earlier on, or even in the manual, I think that would've prepared me better and alerted me to their usage. But even after I knew about the out-of-sight passages, I still struggled to find them; imagine my frustration when I couldn't move forward without finding a path forward that I could not see, when I did not know that they were ever on the table.

It does a lot right, a few things not so much and despite having good mechanics, some of them eventually wear out their welcome.\nAs a throwback to the Zeldas of yester-year Tunic gets a full score with it's lush graphics, combat and exploration and initial setting and atmosphere. Fighting offers all the trappings we have come to expect in this current games industry where everyone seems compelled to copy Dark Souls, for good or ill. There's stamina, healing flasks and bosses that hit like a truck. They even included the corpse-run, which I find particularly unnecessary.\nThe game world is really pretty and inviting with it's soft lighting and simple, kinda squarish, angular artstyle. Exploration is done by nosing through every nook and cranny, employing gadgets and unlocking shortcuts. Curiosity is very much rewarded. One neat feature inherent in the birds-eye-view, locked-camera setup is that many secret passages are hidden behind the topography, in crevices and around corners and such. The downside is that you spend quite some time fumbling your way through these paths with nothing but a silhouette to guide you by and the rather stiff movement controls doesn't exactly help matters. And as fun as the exploration is, the backtracking you have to do at the end is rather tiresome, although I suppose it's optional.\nThe standout feature is obviously the in-game instruction manual. Richly illustrated, informative and immersive (it even have coffecup stains!) this booklet fleshes out the game world, teaches you how to play the game and solve puzzles and on top of it all provides a serious nostalgia kick. Some puzzles and features are quite brilliantly hidden in plain sight until you find the correct manual page telling what you can do. And since it's mostly written in a made-up tongue you still have to piece together the clues yourself. However If you're planning on 100-percenting Tunic I wish you good luck because some of those secrets are so goddamn obscure I have no idea how you're supposed to find them without a guide.\nPart of the plot is also revealed in the manual and in true Soulslike fashion it's an obscure affair and frankly not terribly involving.\nMy biggest complaint though is the tonal shift Tunic undergoes partway through the game. It starts off with a more lighthearted setting and premise but then takes a noticably darker turn and I find it quite jarring, subjective as it may be. It feels almost like the game wants to be subversive because that's what you're supposed to do these days. I really would have preferred if the developers would have stuck to the initial impression.\nSo there it is, despite some design choices I don't agree with I can't deny Tunic is solid craftmanship with a lot of heart and it therefore receives my recommendation!", "timestamp_created": 1680859671, "timestamp_updated": 1680859671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701516687870025635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136251722": {"recommendationid": "136251722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892106455", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1680844139}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun art style, great sound design, lovely atmosphere!", "timestamp_created": 1680845079, "timestamp_updated": 1680845079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136235526": {"recommendationid": "136235526", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972034954", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1570, "last_played": 1680950373}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really really good you guys, it's like if Fez had more substantial moment-to-moment gameplay and wasn't made by a French-Canadian asshole.", "timestamp_created": 1680820020, "timestamp_updated": 1680820020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458177268505096436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136232504": {"recommendationid": "136232504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051670322", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1680815895}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has interesting mechanics...

It is a isometric action adventure with difficult encounters. However, Tunic is also a puzzle game where you collect the pages of the game manual to solve puzzles. It uses this mechanic very cleverly, as there are notes on the pages left by an unknown brother like figure.\n\nTunic was overall a very delightful experience that made me wonder what was going to happen next. It is a game where you learn more as you play, and each new mechanic you discover feels fresh and rewarding. It isn't very in your face, and it expects some  deductive reasoning from the player part. The puzzles come in varying degree, and the ones that are too difficult are left as side content, which I really appreciated. The puzzles also require no combat capabilities, which give a nice break between fights. The visuals are also pretty and cutesy which create a contrast between the brutal battles.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend this game to people who like puzzles and also like or don't mind the challenging combat. It has a very nice twist on an already established genre, and overall, a very fun game. \n\n[spoiler] Also the holy cross is not an item, please don't make the same mistake I did and don't try and look for it in game.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1680748094, "timestamp_updated": 1680748094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136167240": {"recommendationid": "136167240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081879224", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1683390946}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and cozy :)", "timestamp_created": 1680721853, "timestamp_updated": 1680721853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136154265": {"recommendationid": "136154265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354051038", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 897, "last_played": 1680710832}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked up this game because I heard it had some elements similar to Outer Wilds (My Favorite game), It definitely scratched that itch, while also being my first souls-like.

The problem is I just actively didn't want to do it.  It wasn't going to be fun for me.  I pushed through anyway to see if I was underestimating the fun factor for these roadblocks, but, sadly, I was not.

Exploring distinct, colorful areas, fighting enemies with basic hack-and-slash combat, finding upgrades and new progression items, solving engaging but simple puzzles, using maps to chart complex dungeons, unearthing secrets, and fighting demanding but satisfying bosses. All your Zelda staples are covered, and the game does a pretty competent job of copying the nostalgic bits from ALTTP and other Zelda games while also adding it's own twists. It also borrows the corpse run mechanic, demanding boss encounters, and parry timing from Dark Souls. The graphics are amazing, the music is nice and atmospheric, and the story is simple at first glance but becomes steadily more engaging and surreal as you progress.\n\nI'd give this main, Zelda-like portion of the game a solid 8/10. It does most everything extremely well with some fresh ideas, but it isn't groundbreaking (with the exception of one aspect I mention below). It will definitely hit the spot for any fans of Zelda or Souls games, though. I certainly thoroughly enjoyed the adventure, though be aware the difficulty is closer to Dark Souls than Zelda.\n\nThe [b] second game [/b] is the in-game user manual that you will piece together throughout the game. This is Tunic's gimmick, the thing that makes it unique from other retro Zelda-likes. Throughout the course of the \"main\" game, you will find pages of this cute, Zelda 1 style manual that will give you small pieces of information and clues to push you in the right direction pr explain game mechanics. Crucially, the manual has very limited readable text, as most of the text is in an ancient runic language that is indecipherable. So you have to take the limited hints you get and read between the lines to really understand what is going on. \n\nThe manual also acts as the game's map. You will pick up detailed map pages (complete with compass showing the player's position) of the overworld and all the main dungeon areas. You can miss pages that will help you progress, but generally the important ones are along the main path and difficult to overlook.\n\nBut that's just the beginning of the manual. Hidden deep within it's pages is a much larger puzzle, one that will consume countless hours of time beyond the main story of the game as you slowly piece together dozens of hints and clues. To complete this huge meta-puzzle, you will find yourself flipping back and forth between the manual and the game world, completing smaller puzzles scattered around the world, writing down information in a physical notebook (yes, this is one of only a few games I have played, along with La Mulana and a couple of the Myst games, that really requires you to use a notebook outside of the game to track info), and testing out hypotheses to figure out what hints are trying to tell you. Honestly, this puzzle alone is better than many puzzles from standalone puzzle games, because the answer is the culmination of everything you have accomplished and come to understand in the game since the very beginning, and it feels immensely satisfying to finally put it all together.\n\nEven this meta-puzzle is not the end of Tunic's endless depth, though. Remember that \"indecipherable\" runic language that most of the manual is written in? Turns out it's not indecipherable, and you are actually able to translate the runes, which can help with a few puzzles and is absolutely mandatory for two puzzles at the very end of the game. Ultimately, deciphering the runic language and solving the huge meta-puzzle is not required to finish the \"main\" game (a wise decision considering most people interested in a simple Zelda clone won't have the patience to complete these mind-boggling puzzles), but it goes to show the sheer amount of depth and dedication put into a portion of the game that many players won't ever see.\n\nThe puzzle part of the game involving completing the manual was by far the more interesting and engaging part of the game for me, and I'd give this aspect an enthusiastic 10/10. It includes one of my favorite puzzles in any game ever, and I love the aspect of writing down information from across the game world and manual in a notebook to solve an overarching meta-puzzle. This portion of the game is not for everyone, but if you appreciate the ideas behind old-school adventure games like Myst or Riven or puzzle games like the Witness, this part of the game is for you. Not enough games explore this type of intense puzzle-solving that transcends the limits of the game itself, and Tunic does it very well.\n\n[b] Overall Score: 9/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1680342157, "timestamp_updated": 1680343367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135849548": {"recommendationid": "135849548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369329802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1323, "last_played": 1691304852}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with a very creative ending, would recommend going in knowing as little about the game as possible!", "timestamp_created": 1680319800, "timestamp_updated": 1680319800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135842610": {"recommendationid": "135842610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373633163", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1679079764}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me pas\u00e9 la mitad del juego sin saber que se pod\u00edan subir los stats, me duele el orto", "timestamp_created": 1680311587, "timestamp_updated": 1680311629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135831491": {"recommendationid": "135831491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028019911", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1024, "last_played": 1680292750}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha atrapado mucho en estas horas, muy divertido en sus mec\u00e1nicas y desafiante por momentos.

You collect pages of the game's instruction manual and most of it is written in this fictional language. However the manual breaks into perfect English on occasion to give you just enough information to nudge you in right direction. For a majority of the game the hints make sense and I feel smart for figuring it out without being explicitly told where to go and what to do.\nwith the exception of a few traversal upgrades you have most of your abilities from the very start of the game but this information is slowly fed to you by the manual pages in a way that, again, feels intuitive!\nUntil you get to the final boss... the last few manual pages inform you in increasingly cryptic ways on how to get the good ending. You are encouraged to take notes on puzzle solutions and take a crack at deciphering the fake language just to get some semblance of how to progress.\nYou get neck deep in this manual rabbit hole and it honestly feels like a completely different game, and it sucks because I want to solve the puzzles as intended, using nothing but the manual and my intuition, like I've done for the rest of the game. But attempting to navigate this this Zelda 1 homage without outside help brings the end game to a screeching halt.\nSo if brain teasing cryptic puzzles really tickle your fancy then well, you have about 6 hours of a souls like to get through just to get to them.\nThis gear shift to what feels like an entirely different genre is what holds back Tunic from being a masterpiece in my eyes.\nOverall I loved the experience, Just be prepare to whip out a guide for some of the later game puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1680197125, "timestamp_updated": 1680197477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135749379": {"recommendationid": "135749379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036436857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1680194455}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good, not great", "timestamp_created": 1680194485, "timestamp_updated": 1680194485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135748498": {"recommendationid": "135748498", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968210709", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1626, "last_played": 1684450407}, "language": "english", "review": "It starts as a simple isometric adventure game... then the puzzles get deep!

It seems to take the worst bits from fromsofts' games, Fez, Hob, Hyper Light Drifter, Bastion, etc. and combine them all into one mishmash of the most generically indie of all indie games you can imagine. It's like scientists worked in a lab to distill the bullet points that makes Fangamer shoppers drool and Twitter reviewers tirelessly defend. Oh my god, it's got SOULS COMBAT with a DODGE ROLL and PARRY and a STAMINA SYSTEM with ESTUS and you DROP YOUR CURRENCY when you die???? SIGN ME UP!!!!!!! No way, the world is some overgrown ancient stone tech-bio hybrid? I've NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE! A game where you don't progress in a straight line the entire way through? Oh, that's a METROIDVANIA! I LOVE THOSE! You get to stand on buttons? No, not just that, you have to stand on two buttons but in a specific order? YOU MEAN A PUZZLE?\n\nAlso, if you don't have time to play the entire game through in a week you're gonna have to google stuff because the main conceit of the game is that there are mechanics you learn about only by collecting the manual to the game itself while playing. God forbid you go somewhere and forget something because you're not gonna be able to remember it or piece it together from one funny illustration in the game manual you picked up a month ago.\n\nAnyway this game is charming but that's all it is. The combat is mind-bogglingly boring and you can easily beat anything by button mashing, the bosses suck and are far too easy to cheese, you're often rewarded for exploring with a single one-time consumable that might deal a little bit of damage to a common enemy.

For the first while, I had a good time playing through a charming little Legend of Zelda inspired rpg. Then I started to notice a lot of mysteries and puzzles to solve. I mostly ignored them and continued through the game. I hit some pretty difficult boss fights that almost made me want to stop, and a few segments that were particularly frustrating, bit eventually I arrived at the \"end\" of the game.\n\nOnly after beating the final boss did I unlock the ACTUAL game. It was then that it went from \"pretty neat little game\" to \"masterpiece created by a lunatic\". The puzzles, man. The puzzles go so deep. I have never before had a game so quickly and dramatically shift genres on me, and never have I been plunged so deep into the rabbit hole. I can't explain anything, because it will spoil too much and ruin things, but I did share many of my puzzle solutions and attempts with friends. Here are some actual reviews - not of the game, but of me playing the game:\n\"Holy Moly\"\n\"This is insane\"\n\"Wow I love this\"\n\"I am genuinely concerned about your sanity\"\n\nOne gripe I did have was that the music was a bit too mellow for me. Some of the boss fights are legitimately quite difficult and intense, meanwhile the music didn't reflect that. I ended up muting the music and playing much heavier stuff during boss fights as it actually helped me fight better. That was probably a placebo but hey, it worked for me. Overall, not a big problem, and years from now I will not remember the lackluster music, but I will most certainly remember spending 3 straight days going way too deep into the secrets this game hides, with the help of a few great friends.\n\nTLDR;\nGame starts like this: https://i.imgur.com/zdnr2gx.png\nand ends like this: https://i.imgur.com/HGLviLF.png", "timestamp_created": 1679478484, "timestamp_updated": 1679479102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135140426": {"recommendationid": "135140426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014556801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1681535853}, "language": "english", "review": "Shockingly beautiful and magical experience.

When the game fails to let you know that \"praying\" is a thing that lets you interact with the world in new ways, so you spend hours wondering how many items you're missing since you can't interact with the big metal pillars or the shiny golden platforms. There is no prompt, too. There is no hint, no tips, nothing. \n\nThe devs just magically expect you to find out that by holding *Lock on + Dodge* you can pray and therefore power the statues (which i did not do because i encountered about 10 of those pillars before finding out -in a guide- that you can actually power them) and use the teleport platforms (because I only found out after looking up a different guide on where to go that teleporting exists, but don't worry, it's not fun either, since there is no way to know where you will be teleporting since all you see is blocks of light). \n\nAlso, did you know you can run in the game? Because I sure as hell didn't. You have to hold the interact button to run. As well as finding out there's a grappling hook hidden away behind 4 or so caverns.\n\nIs that not enough to discourage you? Oh, well in that case the game also has special magical cards you can equip. I obtained about 6 of them. I have no idea what they do after trying every single one of them, healing, dying, fighting, they seem to have no apparent effect on gameplay. As well as the cool upgrades you can spend gold on! There are about 4 of them. Only one of them is useful, which is the one that makes you have a bit more HP, so you can get stunlocked for even longer.\n\nThe combat is also not fun. It's like the worst aspects of a Kirby game combined with the worst aspects of a Souls game. Some enemies have tells so you can dodge or parry. Most enemies don't. Most enemies simply charge randomly with no way to counterattack or parry (See: large dogs, crows, frogs, large frogs, mages, etc).\n\nI wanted to love the game, but it feels like there is no learning curve as the game doesn't give you the tools to improve, it just drops you into the world without letting you know that those tools even exist, and when you get them, gives you no way to find out what they do.\n\ntl;dr: the first 30 minutes you'll think \"oh man I can't wait for the game to lead me in any way to have fun\" until you realize that the game will do nothing to help you have fun with it, and just trips over itself due to its lack of explanation so you know what anything does.

You won't be able to learn a second time.\n    [*]If you're \"not sure\" if there is more to find/complete, then there is more to find. If something is completed, you'll know.\n    [*]Beware: there are a couple of optional puzzles that are insanely hard/intensive in my eyes, I think it's cool they are there, but I did look up the answers, and was glad I did. Not every puzzle is for everyone's taste. You won't really 'stumble' into these puzzles, you will know they are there and optional, by the end of the game.

It all felt significant. And what I remember most about playing that game for the first time was my friend and I putting our heads together and the satisfaction of figuring out one of the many, many secrets for that game.\n\nThat's exactly how I feel about Tunic. \n\nIt's beautiful to look at, to be sure, but the way the game plays with your perspective--secrets hiding behind corners, pathways that are clearly there but just hard to make out from your angle, chests just barely peaking out from behind a rock--it begins to change how you look at the world of the game. It all becomes potentially significant and often times, it is. \n\nAnd that's not even getting into some of the deeper secrets in this game. Without giving too much away, throughout the journey you pick up pages to the instruction booklet for the game. At first this seemed kind of silly to me, pages describing seemingly basic stuff; dodge rolling, stamina, blocking, and so on. But on closer inspection, almost every page has some hidden depth to it--a curious symbol that seems slightly out of place, a handwritten note in the margins, an arrow pointing to something off the map, or even a code for a free item. None of this is handed to you though, you have to pay attention, put pieces together, experiment,  and I found that all of it inspired a level of curiosity and intrigue I've rarely experienced in games. It begins to feel like no detail is superfluous, it's all very intentional, and it grabbed my attention for the whole game. \n\nGranted there are a few puzzles in this game that are so obscure as to be somewhere between absurd and genius. *Looking at you wind chimes and water reflecting on a cave wall* And lets just say that the last big puzzle in this game is a real doozy. Sorting that one out without the aid of Google should be something you can boast about on a college application.     \n\nA brief nod to the combat: I'm an avid fan of the Dark Souls franchise. I've done multiple play-throughs of DS 1-3, Elden Ring, and Sekiro. That said, there are a few fights in this game that gave me a run for my money. So they're f-ing challenging. And just like solving one of the many subtle puzzles in the game, overcoming that challenge is very satisfying and rewarding. \n\nFinally, I love the music, May not be everyone's cup of tea, but I felt like it was the perfect feel for this game. It's one of the very few video game soundtracks I listen to just to listen to.\n\nI dearly hope they make a sequel to this.

Throughout the game, you will learn information that allows you to progress just as much as any hookshot would. \n\nThink Outer Wilds - a large portion of what holds you back is what you haven't yet learned about the game world. But there's the addition tons of unnecessary items, shortcuts, and other details that make every moment of your exploration through Tunic's beautiful world a joy that keeps you invested and coming back for more. While Outer Wilds took the view of \"make everything matter\" to keep you invested, Tunic tries instead to \"make every moment a discovery.\" In most ways, it succeeds.\n\nIn my opinion, the one place Tunic fails is when you try to go for total completion of the game. In contrast to Outer Wilds, there are unimportant things, and you can look for those things after the game is over.  But because the motivating factor in Tunic is the consistent availability of secrets to uncover, it falls apart somewhat once you've found all but 2 or 3 things. \n\nIf your stuck on a puzzle, even if you have everything you need, you might just end up trying the same things over and over, praying it'll work. And it gets frustrating, and takes away the wonder of this game. \n\nSo if you play this game, which you most certainly should, complete it. Finish the game to the end. And let that be the end. \n\nOr, keep going - try to discover everything the game has to offer, - but don't be afraid to get hints from friends or the wonderful spoiler free secret guide you can find on Tunic's community page on Steam.\n\nWhatever you chose to do, this is one of those games that will leave you wishing you could play it again, knowing it will never be the same.

Everything in Tunic is a puzzle, even things you might not realize matter at first glance. To learn about any of the big secrets hidden in the game is tantamount to completely recontextualizing it, and suddenly you find yourself considering the importance of things you would have never bothered looking at originally.

It manages to be a fresh blend of the games that inspired it (Souls, Zelda, etc.) without being defined by any of them. More importantly, it captures the feeling of being dropped into a new world without much to hold your hand and piecing it together as you go along. Combining that with the manual mechanic, the sense of discovery it manages to instill in you calls back to the days of playing classic games.\n\nI didn't go into this game expecting much of a challenge, as I expected the focus would be more around exploration. The game starts out easy enough but it gradually ups the difficulty and manages to include some tough sections that require careful play. The boss roster, while not huge, is interesting enough and I genuinely enjoyed most of them but obviously not all. I don't want to give much away so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThe game is not without its frustrations however, especially with how it handles backtracking, traversal and how it chooses to obscure/present information to you as you progress the game. It does this through its isometric perspective and the manual. [spoiler] Minor spoiler, but the game manual has two languages, one that's alien and plain old English. [/spoiler]  When this works, it works well, but I found myself frustrated with it at times, especially towards the end. The game's puzzle elements are mostly fun but some of the later puzzles are a bit too obtuse for my taste and I generally enjoy puzzle games. Thankfully though, they're mostly optional and the particularly difficult ones aren't needed to complete your manual (if you want to do that)\n\nTechnically, I didn't encounter many issues. Some minor bugs and a couple of framerate dips throughout my playthrough. The camera can be a little annoying because you can't control it during boss fights and it tends to spin sometimes which can be a bit disorienting.\n\nIf you're looking to get lost in a new world that rewards exploration and has a reasonable challenge to offer then Tunic might be for you. Just keep in mind that the game does have its flaws but it succeeds at what it's going for. I highly recommend not using guides at all till you get to the endgame, you will manage to figure it all out in time.

The idea of generating appeal based not on the quality of your own work but for the emulation and or restoration of the quality of a different work. This becomes even stranger with the concept of anemoia: nostalgia for a time or a place one has never known. Which is what I felt playing Tunic.\n\nTunic draws much of its inspiration from earlier Legend of Zelda games such as \u2018The Legend of Zelda\u2019, \u2018Zelda II, The adventure of link\u2019 and \u2018A link between worlds\u2019. These were all games far beyond my time, by several decades even, yet I could still feel a connection and even a longing for such simpler games.\n\nThe name of the game for Tunic is simple: discovery. One of the most core aspects of the game is the process of rebuilding the game\u2019s guidebook, allowing you to learn the context and function of many things you may have simply ignored or misunderstood. This results in the highest amount of \u201cOooooohhhhh thats how that works\u201d situations of probably any game I\u2019ve played.\n\nGame play and direction is deliberately kept to a minimalist taste. combat abilities being three sword slashes and whatever items you have available. Puzzles are often a test of perspective or awareness rather than a say a riddle or contrived three part marathon. Most of the art assets could be recreated in programs like Blender relatively easily. Whilst the game could have come off as unchallenging or unimpressive, Tunic instead achieves a disciplined perfection of style. No hint misplaced, no encounter mistimed. It becomes down to the player to understand the situation as the pieces of the puzzle are commonly already in front of you.\n\nMusically speaking Tunic steps lightly with more focus on ambience and leitmotifs to show continuation and similarity in areas that may not seem related, but later have their true natures revealed as time progresses. But the music does a type of heavy lifting often not mentioned in other reviews, and that is the what I like to call the Professor Layton factor: the music is simultaneously peaceful, distinctive but of a musical quality that it helps you think rather than distract. \n\nOverall, I hold high praises for this game, though there is one factor that is worth mentioning. Tunic is not a game for everyone. There are a number of puzzles that are annoyingly cryptic, requiring either a guide, a true sense of puzzle games or a frustratingly long amount of time to succeed with. And it's with this that I think it's not exclusionary to say that not everyone will be able to beat this game unassisted. \n\nAnd that's okay. \n\nTo me, the most important part of Tunic is enjoying the game for what it is in your way. If that means completely unassisted to you then that's what you should do. But if you have more fun with a guide by your side then that's also valid. Tunic is a game that preaches the sharing of wisdom and understanding what others left behind, and I think that's a fine stance to take for both this game and all puzzle games.\n\nFinal score - 80/100", "timestamp_created": 1678557684, "timestamp_updated": 1678557684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134483643": {"recommendationid": "134483643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025104382", "num_games_owned": 1281, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2711, "last_played": 1661282824}, "language": "english", "review": "Tunic has to be among the very best games of all times.

Their weapons have much longer reach than yours too.\n-Clunky rolling. You can't roll/evade right after a sword swing. I understand why, but I dislike this mechanic in games. If your life is in danger, you'd drop whatever you're doing to evade, right? (EDIT: not a problem in late-game)\n-And the difficulty spike. In a certain part of the game, where your power ups are stripped off, the game will throw a gauntlet at you. (EDIT: hardest challenge but worth it)\n\nI am not a fan of souls-like games. If you're like me, I don't recommend it. If not, then feel free to play.

I never digged the legend of zelda formula very much, I often found it bland and overly complicated but this game while being challenging that is for sure, it never felt impossible. You can always find a way to get where you want if you put your mind to it, and where you can't go, you can go later once you get the upgrades through playing the game. While some of the puzzles are just wild (looking at you mountain door) and 90% of the text are in a made up language, it gives you just enough if you use context clues and with what info is given you can figure things out. While the story is open to interpretation, I think it is one of its strong suits, your not really sure what is going on, but the more you see, and the more you read, and the more you get actual hints, you end up creating your own version of sorts and why lil tunic is doing what he is doing. One last thing I might add, I though the camera would fuck me up or be in your way, since there are times where you go behind a wall and you just see the characters shadow, I never felt as if it was in my way, say, maybe once or twice, trying to get some dumb chest. I can't recommend this more, all the legend of zelda fans bought this I am sure, but if you enjoy dark souls, explorations, or just something challenging and interesting, then your 30 dollars is well worth it, especially that most triple AAA companies are charging 70 bucks for a 8 hour adventure, its well worth the money.

Tunic has that blend of that classic Legend of Zelda style with a Dark Souls 1 cohesive world. The combat is simple but tight, the world is littered with secrets and worthwhile exploration, and the map design is top-notch. The game is designed around you picking up pieces of the Game Manual which is written in a language that's decipherable but there's no need. It's the most rewarding, dopamine inducing, original idea I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Do you need it to beat the game? No, but it gives context to everything you're doing and seeing. I honestly have no complaints. This is one of those games that sticks with you and every other game in this genre you play you will compare to this one.\n\n[b] tl;dr [/b] Tight combat, clean aesthetic, and one of the best \"map\" mechanics I've ever seen.

And If you are fine with the combat but aren't really tuned-in for the puzzles, you will eventually reach a point where the game appears to have reached a rather unsatisfying conclusion, while further progression, and the true endgame, are locked beyond an activity that holds little appeal to you.\n\nNo doubt the hope of the game's developers was that, for a certain kind of gamer, TUNIC would hit a sweet spot, becoming one of the best games of all time in the minds of its intended audience.

The combat is fine, even enjoyable for the most part, but the puzzles and the general sense of intrigue that arises (again, I have to be frustratingly vague here) are exceptional.  I just don't see anything nearly as special about the action side of the game.\n\nSo, I would give this conditional recommendation: I wouldn't go into this for the combat alone.

The combat is okay and the story is interesting, but honestly what really enraptured me were all of the secrets hidden all over this world. I was blown away as secret after secret after secret were revealed to me in ways that I never even imagined. The way the \"manual\" teaches you and drops hints for you and the way the world is structured around all of these little surprises. It was incredibly satisfying to uncover and solve all of these secrets. I went down a route that probably 90% of players sadly won't stay long enough to see, but I honestly enjoyed all of the secrets and puzzles even more than the gameplay. I had an overwhelming urge to solve everything I possibly could. I used a guide for a few of the late game secrets since.. they are absolutely NOT meant to be solved by a single person. I will not spoil much on that though. Go in as blind as you possibly can and, when you feel like you can't continue or do not want to muster the energy to solve things, whip out a guide and keep going. There's no shame in that if you'd like. I had an absolute blast through it all.\n\nAlso, my favorite puzzle in any game in existence, dubbed the \"Golden Map\" puzzle, is something I'll remember for a while. Slowly connecting the pieces in my mind and having a huge epiphany that this puzzle was giving you hints from the moment you stepped into the game, all culminating into this solution, was extraordinary.

It's got a nice art style, and a few new neat ideas like being able to find manual pages. \n\nUnfortunately the actual experience of playing it is frequently turned into a frustrating slog primarily through poor map design. Tunic map is very, very complicated, largely in service of Tunic's favorite trick of showing you places you can't get to until later and hiding shortcuts behind geometry. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it does mean that you'll frequently find yourself very close as the crow flies to areas you've already cleared and want to get back to that are, through wrinkle of map layout, in fact a long and convoluted trek away.\n\nA trek made more difficult by a guiding map that prioritizes aesthetics over actually showing you how to get where you want. In a simpler map design, not a problem, but with Tunic's map the lack of detail means it's often not clear how to get where you're going.\n\nIt's save points are also poorly laid out. Some are quite close together, but other new areas lock their save point behind multiple encounters of difficult enemies, and the closest outside save point is very far away. That means that to learn how to play around this difficulty spike, you'll need to spend around a full minute treking through already-cleared map to get back to the neat area every time you die. Which will happen a lot, especially for difficulty spikes like the quarry where there are sniper that one or two shot you. Each time something goes wrong, back to two areas away you go, to hike run through empty areas for 60 seconds.\n\nIt technically has a fast travel system, but it's laid out in such a way that it doesn't mitigate these problems.\n\nIt also has a lock-on 'focus' system that's fairly vital for combat sometimes, but is clunky to use. The default keybinds for switching focus targets require you to move your entire hand away from your attacks and items, and because it uses directional inputs instead of cycling through all available targets, it's hard to rebind, and difficult to get to focus on who you want.\n\nThere are lots of small problems like the interact prompt both taking a moment to show up and sharing a key with your dodge roll, meaning if you run up to a ladder and press interact, you'll lock yourself into a dodge animation for a second instead of grabbing the ladder. Not a huge problem, but they pile up.\n\nI'm just going to keep listing them as I run into them. Was this game not QA tested or something?\n- Some bosses can be pulled with the grapple hook, except when they're in some attacks, at which point instead of it failing *you* will be pulled to them and murderized\n- The grappling hook can latch onto dead bodies in the seconds before they disappear, even if you're locked onto someone else. It locks you into the animation, doesn't do anything, and just got me killed.\n\nTunic has a lot going for it, as a mentioned before, but the omnipresent frustration of dealing with the map design sours the experience. I'm probably going to finish it once, and I don't regret putting time into it, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone that doesn't feel called to it.\n\nMore than anything, the setting and music made me wish I was playing Hyper Light Drifter instead, which exceeds Tunic in just about every category and doesn't have most of its flaws. Better combat, similar setting but more interesting, similar music but better, more engaging story, similar themes... I'd point anyone in that direction in a heartbeat.\n\nAlso, if you do play tunic you're going to want to customize the controls early on. The default control layout is pretty poorly optimized, feeling cramped and not using the mouse at all. The game doesn't tell you you can bind keys to the mouse, but you can, and I highly recommend putting your most-used few buttons on the mouse and rerouting the rest around your WASD keys.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've finished the game, I can say with confidence that I don't recommend it. The second half of the game solves some of the map design problems (it turns out the entire map is designed to be super obtuse to navigate until you get a special dash when you're 75% finished), which is... a choice. But the omnipresent problems never really let up. \n\nSmall places where you get stuck and have to reset, map design that remains obtuse even when you get the magic dash.\n\nThe boss design in particular is bad throughout the game. It's seldom clear when vulnerability windows are, what attacks are being telegraphed. The final boss is the worst example: its has a stunned state, but even after half an hour beating it I never figured out what triggered it. Not damage, not health loss, no clue. Some runs it got stunned three times, others none. \n\nIt has several wildly different attacks that all share identical or near-identical windups, so the same telegraph sometimes is a short jab and sometimes is a two-part combo that will take your entire health pool if you don't get more out of the way. Those weren't the only radically different attack with an identical windup.\n\nIt seems to be able to cancel its own animations at random: attacks that usually have a two-second windup will sometimes come out instantly followed immediately by a second attack. These can even chain together, meaning at sometimes it will do a janky 6-attack flurry over the course of four or five seconds. As time went on I became less convinced this was intentional and not bad coding.\n\nThe effect is the same as with all the other bosses. I never once felt like I was learning a boss, growing familiar with its behaviors and beating it with finesse. You just run at it repeatedly until you get lucky and it chooses not to do its heavy attack six times in a row.\n\nOverall, I just can't recommend it. Tunic has good points, certainly, but the actual experience of playing it is frustrating and tedious. The story is Hollow Knight to a T but less interesting, the everything is Hyper Light Drifter but worse. \n\nA solid attempt was made, but the finished product just doesn't measure up.", "timestamp_created": 1677010167, "timestamp_updated": 1677108358, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429553240537643433", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133299050": {"recommendationid": "133299050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330910283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1851, "last_played": 1676994057}, "language": "spanish", "review": "TUNIC - Excelente juego nost\u00e1lgico de tipo zelda.

Addictive battles with fluid animations and responsive controls are mixing magically with exploration and clever puzzle inside a colorful, eerie world full of mysteries and unexpected discoveries. \"Tunic\" shows how going back to the basics in a creative way can gives us gems.\n\n\nManometer: 8/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Adorable aesthetics. Nice, minimalistic 3d graphics with vivid colors and atmospheric lighting. The cool day/night system gives it some variation too.\n- Great world design with multiple height levels, hidden paths and alternative routes that get unlocked gradually as you play. Each region guides you masterfully in order to always be at the right path, but also not limit you from exploring the surroundings.\n- Awesome core gameplay logic. The way that you unlock secrets and gain small pieces of knowledge through exploration and observation is amazing. Even after a lot of hours you keep discovering things that may related to basic control mechanics. The game is full of well hidden secrets and clever puzzles and always gives you enough hints so it never feels impossible or unfair. It even has its own real language that you can try to translate. So imaginative and well balanced.\n- Fantastic animations. Soft bodies, particles, physics after each blow, everything seems smooth and natural. Protagonist's walking is so funny.\n- Fast battles with nice controls and addictive kills. Everything feels fluid and responsive.\n- It offers a decent variation of abilities, upgrades and tools that introduce new interesting mechanics when you acquire them, so the game never gets boring or repetitive.\n- Well designed enemies. Each region has its own tribes. Bosses' design seems a little bit generic, but their battles are great and have really good pace.\n- The story is cool but pretty abstract. The most interesting part though is trying to understand what's going on by collecting all these scattered pieces of information and putting them gradually together.\n- All those illustrations at the pages you find are simply gorgeous. \n\nThe bad\n- It would be an entirely different game if you change this characteristic, but the fact that there are side invisible walls everywhere so you cannot jump down to the lower levels seemed to me odd and I could get used of it till the very end.\n- Poor sound design with only few environmental sounds. The background music keeps playing almost always, which can be tiring after a while.\n- Sometimes interacting with some objects like chests and stairs can be unresponsive.\n- The story is pretty abstract and fragmented which isn't bad at all, but initially it doesn't give you enough clues to understand your purpose, what you are fighting for.

However, I don't think the last 1/4 ruins the game enough to not recommend the game. Note the in-game \"manual\" plays and extremely important role in all stages of the game, so pay close attention to it.\n\nFor the first 3/4, it is fun. The game lifts from Dark Souls mechanics and motifs in a positive way, and is less so Zelda-based than you'd initially think. The game has in common with Dark Souls:\n- sprinting, parrying, dodging with i-frames, lock-on targeting, stamina\n- mana for spells and abilities\n- not-bonfires which refill your not-estus, and which respawn enemies when you rest at them\n- great interconnected non-linear map design, whereby you unlock many shortcuts\n- many secrets; the game is chalk full of secrets, which range in difficulty to find from mildly clever to needing a galaxy-brain\n- stat levelling up\n- difficult bosses whereby you have to learn their moveset and weaknesses; at least for me they were difficult\n- an interesting, fallen, and mysterious world, whereby the narrative is the opposite of spoon-fed to you\n- you ring two not-Bells-of-Awakening and collect the Hexforce and collect the not-Lord Souls\n\nOne of my biggest criticisms with the art direction is the fox protagonist has bead-eyes. He is still a cute fox, but he would've been far more cute and relatable if he had \"normal\" emotive eyes with an iris an such. Hopefully if the devs make another game, they'll mix up the eyes to be better. Otherwise, the lofi aesthetic is very cool, and the lofi soundtrack is amazingly good. The art in the manual is also great.\n\nThe game keeps you engaged by providing you interesting items and abilities as you progress. It also gets you to ask deep questions like:\n- why tf am I praying to mecca\n- why is my (incomplete) game manual scribbled over and slopped all over with coffee stains\n- who is writing in pen on my manual\n- in fact, why are parts of the map geography straight-up wrong\n- why does it feel as if someone has been though so many places already before\n- who made all these robots\n- why and there so many meccas\n- why does the purple stuff irradiate me like I'm at Chernobyl\n- do I get to wield the cool sword\nSo yea that is all cool.\n\nThe last 1/4 of the game sucks cuz:\n- it takes away all of your upgrades, but makes you play a long and difficult section whereby the game mechanics are pretty much the same. I don't think this was necessary from a story or gameplay point of view. They could've just made this section hard without taking away your upgrades, and thus not removing your feeling of progression. This choice would be like if Dark Souls yeeted your levels and weapon upgrades partway through until you defeated a couple of Lord Soul bosses.\n- to not get what I regard as a bad unsatisfying ending, you need to get a bunch of difficult collectables. Getting these collectables requires you to press your d-pad/arrow-keys a lot, with no indication if you made a mistake. I think the default ending is too unsatisfying given the amount of manual-decoding, careful exploring, and d-pad effort needed to get the okay ending. For most of the \"golden path\" stuff, I used online guides.\n\nThis game is a great demonstration on why games don't come with manuals anymore. They've been rid-of for good reason. Having to decode and rely on a game manual for important gameplay purposes is an immersion-breaking anti-feature. Games whereby you must solve their secrets and challenges by immersing yourself in the game world are far more compelling.\n\nAnyways, if you don't think the last 1/4 of the game will bother you, go for buying it.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1676852925, "timestamp_updated": 1676852925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477707028388977051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133204052": {"recommendationid": "133204052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009215427", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1648693416}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful adventure as a small fox.\nGives me the nostalgia of playing games as a kid again.", "timestamp_created": 1676848186, "timestamp_updated": 1676848186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133202700": {"recommendationid": "133202700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009660996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1674011189}, "language": "english", "review": "Super cute and satisfying game that rewards exploration and figuring stuff out for yourself!

TUNIC is a game like no other, and I'd recommend everyone to pick it up and give it a chance. But before going more into detail, you should know that this is a [b]knowledge based[/b] game, looking for guides or tutorials WILL take away from the experience.\n\nTUNIC is all about the feeling of finding secrets, discovering things you didn't know of and that were possible, like mastering a fighting game by using secret movesets. It's a kind of language that you will learn to pick up, but it takes a while to get there, so be a bit patient and enjoy the other aspects of the game.\n\nIt is true that the game [i]is hard[/i] and that it uses the Dark Souls principle of dying and trying until you get it right. It can be quite challenging in both difficulty and progression, but it is accessible enough for you to only focus on the things that you want to do, don't be ashamed to reduce the difficulty if it's too much, just enjoy the game at your own pace.\n\nExploration and problem solving is very Zelda-like, as in the first and original The Legend of Zelda. You are just thrown into the world, no objective, no cutscenes, no preludes, just you and the world that TUNIC offers. Most of the hints and guidance you will receive come from an special in-game item, and believe me, it really is your best and only ally.\n\nTo fully enjoy this game you need to be willing to get completely lost, you must accept that there will be times where you have absolutely [i]no idea[/i] of where to go next or how to make progress. These are the [b]main[/b] puzzles of TUNIC, finding the way forward.\n\nThe music in this game is amazing, it never gets repetitive and really helps a lot to define the style of the game. It may not be very orchestral or incredibly iconic like other games, but there's definitely a lot of tracks that stand out! Lifeformed and Janice Kwan really put something very special, and you can [i]feel it[/i].\n\nI do admit it, there are times were some secrets are just a slap in the face, but must of the puzzles and secrets felt right and natural to solve. There are a couple of bugs here and there, but none of them are to the detrement of the game.\n\nIf you care about the lore and story of the game you might have to go a bit far to get the whole picture, and even then it's quite hard to make sense of it, but the story isn't really the point of this game.\n\nIf you couldn't tell by now, I absolutely love this game, it's a 10/10 for me, and it even made me enjoy playing video games all again. It might not be exactly what you are looking for, and that's fine! But I do think that everyone should give it a try, it really is that rewarding to complete the game.", "timestamp_created": 1676754048, "timestamp_updated": 1691812494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53947371244430542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133126422": {"recommendationid": "133126422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438992628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2195, "last_played": 1675795471}, "language": "english", "review": "Tunic is an incredibly well designed little game that I seriously think is worth your time \nFirstly, the game looks gorgeous, and has a deceptively simplistic art style that makes the world a joy to explore.\nGameplay has equal parts combat and puzzles.

I thought I got this game for like 5 dollars, but I got it for 25.97. I was thinking the whole time \"what a steal!\" I am not unhappy with paying as much as I did for this game. I will beat this game. \n\nThe game rewards exploration with hidden chests, hidden shops, and hidden areas. Very often i'm just looking for the way forward or a hidden chest and then I stumble upon something rewarding like a shortcut, loot, a new map that I didn't suspect was nearby, etc; it's all good stuff. \n\nCombat is easy, you've got your 1, 2, 3 combo, you've got a shield, bombs, pots, and other utilities that are easy to use. \n\nThe music blends in with the scenery and is easy on the ears. \n\nThere are various enemy types from slime likes, knights, skeletons, angry birds, and so so.\n\nThere is no dialogue and the story is up to interpretation. You develop an understanding as you progress and retrieve pages of information that are still not completely spelled out. It's very fun to feel that there is a mystery to be unraveled when it comes to what's happening in the game and \"what the heck does this do!?\"\n\nThere is no difficulty setting just like a souls like. It's challenging enough for me. You can swim past some of the fights, other fights mess ya up. I like that variation in difficulty with enemy types just as much as I like the variety of enemy types. I like them good nuff!\n\nI like them colors! So vibrant! The look of the game, so simple and eye grabbing! Much wow!\n\nAlright cons if any:\n\nThere's the targeting system which is simple at first. You just hold shift to lock on to enemies. I have not found a convenient way to switch between enemies when there are many of them and so I could be swinging or blocking in the wrong direction and obviously that leaves me vulnerable. I have had another problem with that while traversing the map with a tool for crossing gaps. You have to lock on to points that allow you to traverse gaps. There's an area that spawns enemies on top of the point you need to traverse to. What this does is it causes you to pull in the enemy and in this situation I was on an island of sorts, a minecraft block wide, and as I pulled the enemy they fell below my attack range, dodging my attack. There were two others who proceeded to blast me while I had little space to dodge around on. I was a sitting duck because I could not easily traverse like I wanted. I found that using the directional keys allows me to change my target, but it feels inconvenient to use when you have to use semicolon for blocking along with j, k, and l for attacking and such and so I cannot simply defend myself while switching targets.\n\nThere is a mechanic in the game, that I'm not sure if I should speak on in detail about so I won't, which you need to know in order to progress in the game. I had not seen an indication for its use in the player book in game. I was stuck in multiple areas and spent time roaming around the large map looking for things that I had missed until I eventually just played around with some things and accidentally found the way to progress. This is me saying that the element of mystery can lead you to become lost or confused. I suggest that if anyone with low patience becomes stuck you should google it.\n\nAgain, I've only played 5 hours. My feelings on the game may change later, but as for right now I'd say get it if you're looking for a challenging yet relaxing experience. Or maybe it's challenging at times and relaxing at other times. It's up to the player, I reckon.\n\nBeaten it at 28 hours. Final notes. The game has so much mystery because you're constantly trying to interpret characters on paper that you cannot understand, which is the intention. I learned about the end game secret mechanic, started doing the secret dance and what not, and the whole time I was so confused. Does it want me to input this or that? Oh, it wanted something else for this one. I felt like some details were missing, which is usually intentional, but I had no idea how to go about doing some other things that I found for the find all the secrets challenge. It has kept me up 'til 5 in the morning. I punched in so many key combos, obviously first doing the ones I was supposed to do, and nothing would work so I just went and had my 35 attempts at killing the boss and got the sad ending. Sad ending didn't make me feel great, but it was still a great game.

It had been hyped up based on the \"meta\", being a mechanic in the game where you collect pages to a game manual which provide solutions to the game's puzzles. I grew up with NES games in the 90's, but didn't import games. For that reason, I have a familiarity with using manuals as a kid, but perhaps not the same nostalgia as someone who remembers trying to understand how their new game works by relying on the manual they can't read. \n\nMy first experiences with games that have a meta are Doki Doki Literature Club, followed immediately by the Stanley Parable Deluxe. I won't spoil those experiences, but they are in a category of game that I discovered I love, and I believe Tunic belongs beside them.  Although those first two are absolutely 10/10, GotY, Tunic was more of a 7 or 8.\n\nMy first impressions of Tunic were loving the art style, but absolutely hating the unresponsive controls and clunky combat. I played on default settings until my first death taught me what was lost, at which time I turned on easy mode for the rest of the game. I enjoy roguelites and Demon-Souls-likes, but  didn't like how it fit here. Again, trying not to spoil anything.\n\nI found the environmental puzzles to be a bit too easy to recognize. I discovered many of the game's secrets prior to when I should have learned them in the game manual, just because the clues are so salient. That sounds like a positive because it indicates the game is intuitive, but the converse is true- I found the few times the game blew my mind by showing me something I hadn't realized before, to be much fulfilling.   \n\nIt's easy to understand HOW to solve most puzzles, but the physical act of doing so is an annoyance. Pen and paper are required, which is acceptable, but (redacted...) can be frustrating.\n\nGetting around the world is problematic, but made easier once I realized I could track my location in some way... \n\nI played entirely on Steam Deck, and it was a technically perfect experience. It took me a few days to complete pretty much everything except two achievements, which came in at 17 hours. I missed the two achievements because I completely avoided any spoilers, guides, or even looking at the achievements list until I was done with everything I could figure out on my own. And the feeling of accomplishment when I figured out the GP and reverse GP puzzles on my own are just about the only reason I am giving this game a recommendation.\n\nPro Tip- Playing on the Deck also allowed me to assign one late-game ability to the back grip button and have it \"turbo\" when held, greatly increasing my incentive to mop up every last secret.\n\nIn closing, the first 2/3 of the game was a slog, but the final portion made up for it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1676486010, "timestamp_updated": 1676486010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132886310": {"recommendationid": "132886310", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988516157", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2085, "last_played": 1676261777}, "language": "english", "review": "combat okay, everything else is great = great game overall", "timestamp_created": 1676454750, "timestamp_updated": 1676454750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132879550": {"recommendationid": "132879550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025800459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1662395413}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have a soft spot for endearing action adventure games, this is a must play.\n\nTunic is not just another entry in the action-adventure genre, it is an instruction manual on how they should be made.\n\nBut know that TUNIC is a puzzle game at heart.

Perhaps the most stand-out feature of Tunic is the way in which it wraps you up in itself.  You start with basically nothing, other than the intuitive WASD fingerings and space-bar rolling reflexes that you have honed playing a million other games.  Nobody tells you what buttons to push or where to go, and yet you feel so compellingly, so lovingly, hustled along the pathway, never really knowing where you are going or what you are doing really, but always feeling fairly confident that you are on the right track.  Interestingly, that last bit is true despite the fact that different players will take different paths - this game is so well done that you feel looked-after, even though you have to find your own manual, and when you do, it's written in another language that you don't speak.  These things should irritate us and make us think that the creators are making life hard on us, and yet the aesthetic of Tunic, the flow of it, the plot of it, the overall vibe of it,,, it creates a space where these limitations feel like a comfortable and loving challenge.  Furthermore, the creators have somehow created a game that generates faith (much like a religion) - you intuitively feel that things are going to work out... and generally they do.  And just like any good religion should, Tunic makes good on its promises - there are so many amazing secrets, Easter Eggs, surprises, hidden items and doors, and so on and so forth, that you really do feel rewarded for believing and persevering and pushing through.

That's not entirely true, while obviously gameplay mechanics are best kept a secret to keep learning them fun, there are some things worth knowing before you purchase this game.\n- It is indeed similar to FEZ, but with much, much greater focus on combat - and combat here is INSANELY difficult, unforgiving, brutal and often simply unfair. If you have the patience, reflexes and habits of a soulslike veteran, you may enjoy it... but otherwise expect all the frequent enemy engagements to feel incredibly frustrating. You never truly lose your progress, but do expect to get stuck for hours in the same place because you can't quite land a sequence of 100 dodges in a row.\n- HOWEVER, the game has a built-in god-mode you can enable in options menu for complete invulnerability. And I thank the developers for including it, because there's more to this game than just the tricky combat, and I would not be able to enjoy it otherwise.\n- Almost all text in the game uses a complex made-up (but well-designed and coherent) writing system, and the game does not teach the player how to read it! You DO NOT need to comprehend it to 100% the game, but if you also want to understand the entire lore, all NPCs and instructions, then you'll have to find your Rosetta stone and decipher the texts on your own - and it is not just a simple cipher. Up to you whether that sounds appealing.\n- There isn't much of a story in the game. Yes, it is thematic, and there is a bit of lore you get to learn and explore, but expect zero interactions with characters, or evolving plot. The world just.... is there. Don't expect any narrative to that cute fox's adventures.\n- While the game does offer a lot of fun meta-puzzles, they don't exactly scratch that The Witness itch as some of the marketing tries to promise; your progress isn't ever blocked by your lack of understanding, but simply lack of information.\n- But more often than not, your progress will be blocked by your combat skills. You will often think \"these enemies are far too strong, maybe I'm supposed to complete a different route first?\".

Wow, just wow. This game is amazing. There is a learning curve though. So you play as a fox who has to solve puzzles, and piece together what's going on. You as a player have to do that as well, as nothing is explained, and mechanics are very nuanced. I'm still learning what to do, and I think I'll be doing that the whole game, there are that many tricks up the game's sleeve. I'm having a ton of fun just exploring, and thinking to myself, now, how would I get THERE? When I run into a secret, I'm like '\nOh, Wow, this is cool, did not expect it'. The graphics are one of the best things about the game, they are vividly realized, and there are tons of extras, like where there are water reflections on the walls. The gameplay is very solid, but sometimes I'm feeling like there's something crucial, but it's just out of my reach. Also, there is a lot of thinking outside the box. Piecing together the manual is cool, but trying to figure out how to reach certain pages can be head scratching at best, and head banging on desk at worst. At the moment, I'm clueless about what to do next, and am just a titch frustrated. Alll in all, though, this is a great game, and it's very pick-up-and-play, which is a total bonus. \n\nOld review -> I have a very soft spot in my heart for foxes. This game, ticks off so many boxes. Enough rhyming, time for a 'First Impressions' review. The full one will come later. This game is a fairly basic (but that's not a bad thing) TLOZ-like, with a cute spunky fox as the hero. The developer/s of this obviously put a lot of heart and soul into making Tunic. I fell in love the moment I got into the game. Also a plus is all the  accessibility options for those who need them. All-in-all, this is just the kind of game to warm my heart, and earn itself a permanent place on my Steam Deck, so I can play it wherever life takes me. P.S.

Every area was perfectly drawn and every detail was carefully chosen to add to the mystery. The introduction of each new key item was very well done as well.\n\nThe actual gameplay I'd only give 6/10. It probably would have been better if I had a controller, but I played keyboard. There were a couple areas which were unintuitive regarding where your character can go and the lock-on enemy targeting could be very frustrating when you want to block an attack from one enemy but it targets the wrong one. \n\nThe fights are very difficult and they felt a little unbalanced since there were some cases where it felt impossible to not take damage. I turned on no-fail mode halfway through, which I don't regret in the slightest because the rewarding part of the game for me was figuring out the puzzles/areas rather than beating a lot of mobs. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend it say its worth the price. If you play on easy mode like me, you basically get an amazing interactive movie with a good chunk of exploring.

You could barely read and understand what was even going on, but had a blast anyways. If you were living in Europe there is a good chance the game wasn't even localized properly, so most of the text went right over your head. Everything was super mysterious, adventurous and playing the game felt super challenging at the time. Maybe one of your friends had one of these player guides, which gave your smooth brain a chance to actually progress through the game.\n\nTunic captures these early gaming experiences very well and transfers them brilliantly to modern times where games got a lot better while you got a lot older and more experienced playing them. There is a strong focus on self-guided exploration and discovery while the game takes a more modern approach trying to nudge you slightly in the right directions.\n\nHowever, this is another one of these games, where going in knowing as little as possible is definitely recommended. A sizable portion of progression is gated through knowledge of the game and the world, which means that your first playthrough can definitely be tainted if you know all too much before playing.\n\nThat makes it of course harder for you to decide if you would enjoy the game or not. I was on the fence for a long time, especially because I read so many reviews comparing the combat to Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I am not a big fan of these games but I am glad I took the risk with Tunic. While the Souls games might have been the inspiration for some of the combat mechanics, I really don't think the difficulty comes even close. I will not deny that some of the bosses can be challenging, but I feel you have a lot of room to outsmart combat encounters if you use all the tools at your disposal.\n\nSo if you are keen to explore an expansive Zelda-like world, riddled with treasure and intricate puzzles, and want to experience a little throwback to the good old gaming times, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to you.

Thanks for taking the time to develop a game that brought me back to my childhood plugging away on the Ol Nintendos. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1675282026, "timestamp_updated": 1675282026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132002545": {"recommendationid": "132002545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021631576", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1675259165}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat is to stiff to make it worth bothering.", "timestamp_created": 1675259212, "timestamp_updated": 1675259212, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.347587168216705322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131999353": {"recommendationid": "131999353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010596774", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1675974894}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1675255317, "timestamp_updated": 1675255317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131998580": {"recommendationid": "131998580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081314481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1675177721}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game, mixture of Zelda + Souls + Fez served on a cute aesthetic and satisfying gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1675254192, "timestamp_updated": 1675254192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131997940": {"recommendationid": "131997940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025133420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1675713490}, "language": "english", "review": "At first i hit the difficulty wall and quickly dropped the game.

Think the mud walls in OoT when you get the bomb bag. \n\n\nThis leads to weird interactions where you're led to believe you should go explore, but instead you're locked out of most of the content until you get more items, leading to just going back and forth looking for the right thing to use your new thing. And then checkpoints and shortcuts. Most of them are normal, where you get to the other side and drop a bridge or open a door or something. But other times for some reason they're just invisible holes in the walls or the ground? Sure that all sounds great for exploration or a 2nd playthrough, but for a 1st playthrough it just led to increasing frustration that I could've gone that way the whole time.\nI'm not asking for the game to hold my hand, there's just a bare minimum of information that I'm looking for.\n\nAnd the combat isn't hard at all, just annoying. Most enemies can be spammed to death. Then there's just enemies that require you to block for 90% of their fight, or outrun their turn radius to get behind their shield and slap them for 3 minutes until they die. Putting a fuckton of flying enemies that freeze you (in a game focused around melee combat), or just a bunch of giant bullet-sponge gators on a small platform isn't fun or difficult.

However, as the game progressed, the amount of revelations I had to come to using my own ability was insane.

It intentionally conceals much and expects you to figure things out on your own. Being given info gradually in the form of pages from a guide book is something I've never seen done before, and its meta appearance complete with hand-written notes was a very novel idea. But that's just scratching the surface of the intricacies this game has to offer.  \n\nDespite its apparent action/adventure appeal Tunic's combat - while generally polished - isn't particularly impressive. You use the same basic sword through the course of the game and the sub-weapons don't contribute a whole lot to the experience. Indeed, Tunic is at its core a puzzle game - the majority of which are well-designed and require a good deal of spacial awareness and attention to detail to solve. I'd argue that some are actually a bit [i]too[/i] obscure, but even looking up the solutions to a few was satisfying given how creative they are.\n\nAs incredible as it is that the glyphs you see throughout the game make up a unique script that can apparently be translated, for the average player this makes the guide book mostly indecipherable apart from a few English keywords. I don't think it was a good decision to leave so much story-building content inaccessible to those who don't look it up online. It also makes for a frustrating lack of clarity when trying to figure out the locations of some objectives. I was looking forward to being given some sort of translation tool eventually and was disappointed when it never arrived. \n\nWhile straying into the arcane at times Tunic offers impressively challenging puzzles and imparts info to its players in cleverly sneaky ways.

Many of the puzzles just consist of you finding a given solution on a manual page rather than figuring something out for yourself and not being able to read the in-game language makes it such a chore to figure out what manual entries, items, ability cards, etc. even do.\n\nI enjoyed it up until the half way point where the game becomes unexpectedly linear and you randomly lose all exploration ability, yet ironically it's by far the most confusing part of the game.

When I was a kid playing Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64 at my best friend's place, we would always talk about making our own game. It was going to be called Ravie the Raccoon, and would basically be a Zelda inspired adventure game where you play as a racoon. I've thought about this game a lot since them, and had even considered (naively) trying to make something like it after teaching myself a bit of programming and 3D modelling. Tunic is exactly the game we wanted to make, but way better than we could have done ourselves. I'm glad Tunic exists so I can confidently put my game making fantasy to bed.\n\nTunic is clearly a passion project made with a lot of love. While it has a wonderful nostalgic feel to it for anyone who grew up with N64 and earlier consoles, it also adopts many more modern game mechanics to keep it from being just a rehash of games we've seen before. The game is difficult, but fair, making you have to learn all the mechanics of combat to get through it; button mashing won't do. The combat is very satisfying once you get the hang of it.\n\nOne of the best elements of the game is it's secrets. It doesn't hand hold, or really explain anything at all until you uncover the strategically placed instruction manual pages. This is one of the most clever elements I've seen in a game in a long time. I recommend most people to try as hard as they can to not look up answers, as discovering it on your own is half the fun. Playing with someone else to work through the puzzles is a great experience too; just don't go to someone who's finished the game and ask them to tell you everything. You can only play it for the first time once, so try to make it on your own as long as you can. I'll admit having needed to look some things up for very late game parts, and if I hadn't played with someone else, I'd probably have gotten stuck earlier, but most of the spots just need a bit of time and thought to get through.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite games ever, and I think it will be a classic in gaming for years to come.

Tunic manages to deeply immerse you in its world, while absolutely every aspect of the gameplay gets integrated in the lore - even the freaking manual. Most impressive about Tunic how the game manages to implement all kinds of  puzzles into every aspect of its gameplay, I don't want to spoil anything, so, I just recommend you look into the manual pages you find and try to tinker some stuff out by yourself before looking into guides. The less you know the better. \n\nIn short, decent combat, great world design(!), awesome puzzles, superb lore, and probably the best manual I have ever seen in a video game. Tunic is worth its full price. Easily one of the best games of 2022.\n\nPS: If you enjoyed Tunic, chances are you'll also like Death's Door.

But I would mention that it would be early Zelda, not BOTW era. \n\nThe game is by far the hardest game I've ever played, and can be very frustrating but it is only as hard as you make it.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand at all, it doesn't even tell you the controls when you begin. \n\nAs you play the game you collect pages for a game manual that explains functions of the game, the harder the page is to find the more important is the information you would read in it.  So the early easy to find pages would be things like basic attack controls, the meaning of common items etc.\n\nYour best friend is experimentation, you will have to test items/consumables to figure out what they do. Combining buttons of two different weapons might give you a new ability, so you get rewarded for trying as much as you can in the game.\n\nSo there will be times where you die over and over to a boss (or regular enemies), you don't know where to go or what your next objective is. You get the urge to just give up or Google it but instead you decide to explore and you find a hidden passage behind some bushes with a page where it tells you some vital information you had no clue of! You feel very rewarded for having been a thorough explorer. \n\nIn fact I haven't played a game before that makes you feel this rewarded for paying attention. I was dying a lot early to mid game because I was missing a page explaining an important detail to your character and once I found it everything made more sense.\n\nThese are the things that make this game unique, the enemy system with health and bosses is your typical Zelda-esque game and quite self explanatory if you ever played them so I won't go into any details there. But I would put the difficulty on the same level as Dark souls games and not quite as easy as Zelda.\n\nYou need to outsmart the bosses, learn their attack patterns, figure out their weaknesses. The manual will once again help you with this.\n\nYou can explore most of the world in any order, maps are also part of the manual so if you decide to go to a distant land early you will be in for a rough time. No map, and high level enemies, good luck... But maybe you find some important item or pages there to help you elsewhere. Worth a shot but get used to dying!\n\nGood luck on the journey!

It's impossible to describe what makes it great without bumping into spoilers, so I'll try to tip-toe around a lot of the game if you'll pardon my vagueness:\nTunic obviously borrows a lot of imagery from the original Zelda; in many ways it's a modern take. The goal of the original Zelda was to get you invested in exploring the world, uncovering secrets, and fighting powerful enemies. Where the original Zelda succeeded for its year, just graphically overhauling it and putting it in front of a modern gaming audience wouldn't necessarily capture that sense of exploration... Tunic (in my opinion) succeeds with absolute style in making you want to figure out its world.\nThis game has souls-like combat that's fairly difficult, but barely punishes you for dying (fight 1-5 basic enemies and the penalty is reversed) AND offers a variety of difficulty mods in case you're more interested in just the puzzles. Meanwhile if you're more interested in just the combat you can just use a guide for the puzzles. I think the game would be fun enough with either the puzzle-box world or the souls-like combat alone. \nIt's on the shorter end; at time of writing I have 35 hours but have gone through a new game plus and I didn't use the internet to solve any of the puzzles, but I don't think it's something you'll binge through in one session on your first playthrough... The beauty of the game is in the things you learn on that first playthrough that make smashing through it on subsequent playthroughs so satisfying - not just because you got better at combat and know exactly where to go, but because the way you traverse the world - even on a fresh save - will change dramatically as you master the game's secrets.\nSeriously, you'll walk the same path several times and each time you'll learn something unique about it despite that it doesn't seem like anything strange could possible be going on - it evokes that sense of mastering something.\nBecause knowledge is power in this game, I recommend not watching a playthrough or any significant content beforehand... There's a good chance you'll spoil one of several things that aren't just story-related, this is one of the few games where mechanical spoilers are the most impactful kind. \nIf you loved a link to the past and dark souls with their complex inter-connected worlds, you absolutely HAVE to give Tunic a go. There's so much more I want to praise, but again, it's so hard to praise the game without spoiling what makes it great, so I guess I'll leave this here rather than dance in circles. \nSeriously, gaem is gewd.

It was a great experience, and one that had significant nostalgia value for me; my first \"real\" video game was Link's Awakening on the Game Boy, and this perfectly captured the feeling of playing that, including the part where I didn't understand a lot of the words. My only complaint is mechanical: the targeting is clunky, especially in fights with multiple enemies, and I got killed many times because the game kept locking me onto someone I didn't want to be locked onto. Still, this game gets nothing but praise from me, and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1673840606, "timestamp_updated": 1673883233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130946685": {"recommendationid": "130946685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049908326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1109, "last_played": 1673838210}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, very atmospheric, lots of secrets to discover.

I wouldn't gripe about this so much if the mechanic itself wasn't crucial to success in almost every boss fight. Furthermore, i-frames on the dodge roll seem spotty at best... your hitbox extends forward as the roll begins, which makes for a sloppy animation that's hard to pull off. \n\nAside from that, the game is fun... I guess? The map is kind of annoying... I did appreciate the \"user manual\" that needs to be decoded as you play, but I kinda got sick of flipping through it after awhile. \n\nThere's an upgrade system... but it's pointless at best, since the discovery of said upgrades are strictly linear - and there's no room for customisation... which begs the question, why have them at all? \n\nA lot of enemies use cheap tactics, and it doesn't take much to get overwhelmed. More often than not I had more success by cheesing these scenarios, rather than trying to pull of interesting parries (see above). \n\nAll in all I think Tunic is a bit over hyped....

making myself unkillable. The game is beautiful, the story is interesting, and I love puzzles. While I understand that complexity can be a good thing, having there be no indication that there are puzzles/items/whatever going on left me feeling frustrated. The only way I was able to finish collecting some items was because I had to look it up. Some items require you to bomb a wall or do other things that you aren't aware you had to do. Not that I want things to be spoon fed to me, but other examples of actions that can be taken would have been appreciated. On top of that there was no way I was going to be able to beat this game while taking damage. The bosses are waaay too overpowered on top of that, having enemies respawn every time you rest was terribly annoying.\n\nBUT!!! If you make yourself unkillable the game is good. I wish I had known about the immortal option the first time around, it would  have made my playthrough much more enjoyable.

It's one of those that's easy to get sucked into, making you lose track of time as you explore deeper and further. The game has plenty of surprises and mechanics to keep the player invested. Visually, it's beautiful, and they've done an excellent job setting up a post-apocalyptic world torn between nature and machine. This game is obviously very inspired, taking the best ideas from other successful games. While playing this, I often feel reminded of Legend of Zelda, Hyper Light Drifter, Metroid, Dark Souls, and even Monument Valley. I do however have a few problems with the game that stops it from being my \"Game of the Year\"... It just feels sorta clunky in certain areas. The combat doesn't feel as smooth as it could, because attacks/dodges/magic abilities don't chain into each other very well. I personally hate that I can't sprint without first rolling. You don't have a lot of control over your focus, and trying to toggle it to the desired target can often be a very undermining hassle in the middle of combat. Some of the exploration can be more frustrating than rewarding at times, so patience is very necessary for this game. Honestly though, my biggest personal issue with the game, and of course it's just my opinion: the lack of fast travel. The lack of fast travel in this game has already made for some of the longest and most tedious treks in my gaming career, and I've played all the soulsborne games. I'm only 6 hours into this game. Just turn those little checkpoint things into fast travel locations! To me, that would take this game from a 9 to a 10.

When I first saw a trailer for it, I thought it was a cutesy Zelda style adventure action game. But after it released, I heard there was more underneath the cover and I was intrigued enough to pick it up. My playthrough of Tunic reminded me of when I was a kid playing the original NES Zelda. There was no internet back then. You had to figure out things on your own and through word of mouth. The backstory of Zelda was told through the manual. It also had information on how to play, items, enemies, and a map you could reference. \n\nIn Tunic, you also collect pages of an in-game manual. The major difference is Tunic's manual is mostly in its own language with some english sprinkled in there for important information. This reminded me of what Dark Soul's creator Hidetaka Miyazaki said about how growing up he would often read books he couldn't understand and would have to piece together the meaning. It is pretty clear the Souls games also had some inspiration on the gameplay in Tunic as well.\n\nMost of the game plays like you would expect, but near the end there is much more focus on puzzle solving than combat. This didn't bother me much as I love puzzles and the final puzzle of the game was one of the most challenging and satisfying to solve in any game. That said, I would have expected there to be more challenging adversaries near the end game, especially after spending most of the latter quarter of the game powering up.\n\nAfter I finished the game, I discovered there were even more secrets in the game I was unaware of. I won't spoil them here, but it is reminiscent of games like Fez and The Witness. It is clear that the devs put a lot of love into the game and embodied that spirit of putting in content that only the most dedicated players will discover it and I just think that's neat.", "timestamp_created": 1673362859, "timestamp_updated": 1673362859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130572961": {"recommendationid": "130572961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157962206", "num_games_owned": 2373, "num_reviews": 171, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1219, "last_played": 1673360535}, "language": "english", "review": "This game should win steam most innovative gameplay award in 2022.

I found game design elements in it that I already enjoyed in FEZ and The Witness, but handled even better here.\n\nAll the environmental puzzles and discovery aspects I found extremely satisfying, but there are a couple of points I'd like to address.\n\nOf the 36 achievements I managed to get 32 by myself and without any guidance or solution. This to me is extraordinary, since the game has many \"metatextual/environmental puzzles\" that in other games are generally done in a worse way or that depend more on moon logic. Things that in other games would have me searching on google in no time, here kept me in-game. Tunic is exceptional in giving you \"everything you need\".\n\nOf the other 4 achievements, instead:\n- One took me almost 3 \"empty\" hours because I knew \"where it was\", but a very stupid detail and a red herring (cryptic reference to understand which one I'm referring to: alarmed birds) distracted me.\n- I found one too \"demanding\", in the sense that it is the only one that requires understanding of the language that Tunic uses. I reached half of what was needed, but for the last part I looked online for the translation (cryptic reference to understand which one I'm referring to: wet letters).\n- One I found just free hate on the player. It's something that is extremely missable in the first playthrough, and asked me for an ad-hoc new game just to do it (cryptic reference to understand which one I mean: pew pew).\n- One is feasible as long as you play \"conservative\" (cryptic reference to understand which one I'm referring to: piggy bank). The problem I have with this achievement is that I already play conservative in these games by default, but the game at one point pushes you not to, to the point that another achievement is achieved by partially \"letting go\". It pissed me off that I had to recover it in the ad-hoc run for the previous achievement since I was \"almost there\" in the main run but reached a point where it wasn't achievable anymore.\n\nThese last two achievements go so much against what (in my opinion) is the spirit of Tunic, that it would have been a better game without them.\n\nApart from these small negative points imho, as I said above this has been an amazing experience. Without making too many spoilers, the yellow page has been one of the most satisfying videogame things in recent years.

I put off playing it for a while because some of the negative reviews pointing to the punishing combat put me off, but I'm glad I played it anyway! Here are my thoughts on parts of the game.\n\nCombat: It's fine, completely serviceable, but nothing exciting. Your move-set is extremely simple, consisting of a very basic 3-hit sword swing combo, a shield, and a few extra goodies you can use (bombs, projectiles, etc). Basically, imagine how combat works in a 2D Zelda game, and that makes up about 90% of how combat works. The remaining 10% is souls-like. You have rolling for i-frames, stamina that depletes when you roll or defend (but NOT attack, you can always attack). And you have some bog-standard \"flasks\" you can use to heal up during or between fights. Overall, I thought it felt good, just nothing special.\n\nDifficulty wise, it's a bit tricky. As you progress, you will find areas where enemies can do a LOT of damage to you. You will die in 1-2 hits to some of these guys. And sometimes those enemies will not take much damage from you either. It can be frustrating, but there is a big upside. Every enemy in the game has very simple attack patterns and behavior. It is surprisingly easy to learn how to take on every combat challenge in the game. In other words, the game does not demand much from you mechanically. Once you learn an enemy's attacks it isn't that hard to dodge or shield them. The toughest fights in the game for me didn't take me more than 10 tries. Best of all, if you're really having trouble somewhere, the magic items and consumables available to you are very strong. In short, if you're having a lot of difficulty somewhere, maybe you're just not using the right strategy for the situation.\n\nExploration/discovery: The game shines here. You are never explicitly told what to do, it is up to you to figure out what the next step is. But the direction you should go is not esoteric. The game gives plenty of hints on what you can do, and what you should do, and it drops those hints in a natural way at the appropriate times. There are also plenty of secrets to discover, and it feels really good to find them.\n\nSpeaking of discovery, I'll cover the puzzle part here too. The puzzles in Tunic aren't actually that difficult, in the calculation sense. They're difficult in the discovery sense. You see, in Tunic, the puzzles are actually testing your knowledge and observation. Sometimes you'll see something that feels out of place. Sometimes you'll see something that seems weirdly organized. Sometimes you'll notice a pattern. And the game is asking you: do you know what's going on here? Can you connect the dots?

I've already 100% completed it, and it left me wanting more.\n\nAs some reviews have pointed out, the combat is indeed incredibly difficult, though there are options to mitigate this.  That said, with the exception of one or two things, it never quite feels 'unfair'.  The 'Souls-like' tag is well earned - you will die (probably not quite as often as in an actual Dark Souls game) but rarely does it feel like you didn't get punished for an avoidable mistake.\n\nMINOR SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n[spoiler]That said, I do somewhat dislike the endgame tactic games tend to use where your stats get reset, then have to deal with enemies that would be a pain regardless.  Enemies whose attacks lower your max HP is an interesting idea for the last act of a game...but when you also have beginning level stats, you're kind of screwed.  Thankfully, you do get to keep your items, and they do help immensely (at least, until New Game +).  To its credit, TUNIC handles the blending of these two annoying mechanics with relative grace, and it doesn't feel like an impossible challenge, but blending ****, dirt, and ice cream with grace still leave you with a **** shake.  It also led to the only times I died in this game and felt frustrated instead of challenged, with one exception - the damn double library statues, but given that I could do those last [i]greatly[/i] mitigated that annoyance.  The Combat Gauntlet was also a little much, but that ties into the whole 'reset stats for the last act' bit, and since there was a save point right before, and it was not so bad with a little practice, I'm calling that one a wash.[/spoiler]\n\nBut those are relatively minor squabbles.  What was more important to me was the realization I had about an hour into the game, after the first boss - something [i]magical[/i] was happening.  I was enjoying this game in a way I hadn't enjoyed a game in years, maybe decades.  The exploration, the puzzle solving, the discovery of mechanics that had always been there - TUNIC is a game that would feel right at home with a release 20-30 years ago.  A well-put together game that has you discovering the world organically as you play, finding secrets that are just there for fun, finding paths that were ALWAYS there but only became obvious after the first time around.  I think the collection of the manual pages exemplifies this the best - the pages contain maps for areas, details of the game mechanics, controls, and so on.  On multiple occasions, I would collect a page, look at it, and figure out how I was supposed to interact with those odd doors, or those golden pads, or the weird black obelisks, or how to run, or how to upgrade stats, or what enemies I would be facing in the next area, or any number of things that made collecting the pages fun and exciting in a way that hasn't been done well in a long time.\n\nOne more added note: the devs truly understand the gaming community.  I saw a sort of pseudo-interview they did during a speedrun where they were commenting on what tricks they were and weren't aware of, and many of the tricks were listed under the 'yeah, we knew about this' list.  Being able to freeze enemies and use them as grapple points to get around barriers?  Yup, the team knew about that, and decided to leave it in but only for enemies that weren't flying enemies.  Sequence breaking?  Are you kidding, the game is designed specifically to allow it!  There's even an achievement for getting a specific late-game item before the sword.  Cheesing the boss for an easy kill?  Go ahead, which method did you use?\n\nBy far, my biggest gripe is that the game wasn't longer.\n\nTUNIC isn't a perfect game...but it's damn close.  9.75/10 - a must buy.
