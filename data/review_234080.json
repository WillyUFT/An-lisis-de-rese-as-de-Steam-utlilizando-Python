The gameplay feels like it drags heavily, the boss fights are copy/pastes of God of War games, and the beat-by-beat exploration just doesn\u2019t feel rewarding. The main saving grace for this game is Robert Carlyle\u2019s great voice acting as Gabriel Belmont and Patrick Stewart as Zobek, other than that, you can probably skip this one, unless you plan to play the trilogy.

The good stuff first. For its age this game looks excellent. Modelling and animation per-se are rather good and it evaded the pitfall of its time by actually using a lot of colors in its environment. The presentation is great and impressive as are most of the character designs and monsters.\n\nThis is about where the praise ends for me. Because unfortunately this game has a collection of design plagues that sure are a mark of its time but have already been mastered back then and by now.\n\nThese the following issues:\n\nTerrible Hitboxes. Enemies, especially the larger ones, are EXTREMELY inconsistent in when and how they hit you. Hits that nowadays clearly would count as misses WILL count as hits. Getting damage from attacks that clearly did not connect with your character model is consistent and constant. I am talking here models being at least a meter apart and still \"connecting\". \n\nRidiculous damage. Enemies here hit hard. I am talking about medium enemies a few levels in eating a god fifth of your starting health bar with said hit being often part of a flailing combo and said enemy being part of a group of enemies. \n\nFlailing attacks are in general a pest in this due to inconsistent telegraphing. Telegraphing means enemies show via a variety of animations when and if they attack, for example a troll charging a heavy attack by lifting the arm up before crashing down on the player. This can help an attentive player to decide which attacks to evade or block or maybe decide to eat it for some tactical reason. Telegraphing in this game is inconsistent at best and makes no sense at worst. For many especially mid enemies don't really have different telegraphs, they just flail at you and if that attack is a small swipe or a massive lunge able to take half your health doesn't really matter.\n\nAwful camera. For starters you do not have any control over the camera. Doesn't matter if you are traversing between areas or are in an arena like combat scenario. That game decides where it looks and how it moves. Especially in combat that leads to attacks from outside the frame. often the camera is zoomed out so much that you can't really see the telegraphs or moves of enemies, especially when they, like the goblins often do, blend into the color of the ground. Those guys throw grenades by the way.  \n\nDespite this I pushed trough since i was aware of the games age and its qualities were actually quite good. \n\nI best describe the combination of all these things that finally made me quit. Traversing from an arena to the next area absolving the typical directed climbing section along glowing ledges a Mid strength Werewolf spawned on me on a small path. These guys attack really fast and with sweeping and lunging attacks. There is no space here to really evade and worse the camera frames the whole encounter from a side view meaning i can even worse see how to best evade the enemy. Still hurt from the last encounter this enemy one hit killed me at least five times in one hit and that the MOMENT I landed on the platform. There is barely space to evade, it is hard to read what moves the guy is going to do since telegraphs are basically non existent and camera does what it wants. And every time I died I have to repeat the last Uncharted style climbing and jumping area over and over again.   \n \nTrying this for the fifth time I realized that I still have barely touched Metal Gear Solid Revengence and that Devil May Cry 5 is still waiting for me. The point being that there is no reason to torture myself with this clearly flawed game when there are better alternatives in my very own library. \n\nAgain, for its time this game is not bad, However many of the games issues had already been solved a console generation before that for example with the first generation of God of War games.\nThis game attempts to do the same genre but does not excel at any of its aspects besides the visuals and that is just surface level and not enough to push me trough.\n\nThere are frankly quite better examples of this game for cheaper.", "timestamp_created": 1698142367, "timestamp_updated": 1700739412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561998665332794189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148697400": {"recommendationid": "148697400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400212531", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1594, "last_played": 1698007533}, "language": "english", "review": "decided to go on a castlevania marathon where I play all the games I hate this game its god of war but none of the fun hopefully Lords of shadow 2 is better", "timestamp_created": 1698007620, "timestamp_updated": 1698007620, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478316336870193481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148669024": {"recommendationid": "148669024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987509653", "num_games_owned": 635, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1697978389}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR Too much God of War and not enough Castlevania.

It's a franchise reboot from a 2D platformer into a 3D character action game.  Funnily enough this isn't Castlevania's first foray into trying to leap into a 3D combo-driven adventure title, and I suspect your opinion of this title will be similar to how you received the games Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness (lets not talk about the 64 game).  I would say that overall this package is a lot tighter than either of those games in terms of gameplay and presentation.  If you've recently watched the Netflix adaptations and want a game to jump around and whip night creatures in this is for you.  As you'll see mentioned in lots of other reviews it's very God-of-War -esque in its execution, but with a couple timing based tricks for people who like things a bit more technical and less button-mashy.  It's no Devil May Cry technical masterpiece but I found it a bit more challenging at times than GoW.\n\nComparatively where the game tends to suffer a bit is its link to the Castlevania lore.  CV has a very rich and long history of games and characters its introduced.  Tossing all that out to start over with a reboot is a questionable decision and it's hard to experience this without feeling like something is missing for it.  To its credit the voice acting is well done (they got mf'ing Patrick Stewart for this one holy shit) and the story it has to tell is interesting but it still isn't the gigantic legacy of the previous Castlevania history and future games fail to really drive it home.\n\nSo if you're looking for an action-adventure game that's got fun combat, spooky atmosphere, and the best whip-based fighting system you're going to see anywhere this is a pretty decent buy.  There are some real high points between the combat and some of the impressively delivered bits of flash.

The voice actor for the main character is awful, the other characters have solid to great voice actors so a strange decision.\nI will not go into the story in this review because this is my first Castlevania game, I didn't play the other 30 games :)\nThe game goes like this- you walk a little, fight small enemies, climb some walls and swing on a rope, do some lite puzzles and fight a boss. That is a pattern through out the whole game and it is really boring at times.\nDespite the boring patterns the game has some good boss fights and some great visuals. The other positive thing is that almost all things you learned will come in handy in combat and puzzles, really liked that the game forces you to use almost every gadget.\nWhen you beat 4 or 5 bosses you will quickly realize they have almost identical attacks and you will figure them out.\nThe game is heavy on QTE's but that is expected in this type of game. Lot of cut scenes etc.\nNot a bad game and since I have really mixed opinions on it i will recommend it but at a high discount of course.", "timestamp_created": 1696282548, "timestamp_updated": 1696282548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147526851": {"recommendationid": "147526851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089049845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1696446699}, "language": "english", "review": "a classic thats not cannon such a shame. all in all great pick up especially for the price.", "timestamp_created": 1696280407, "timestamp_updated": 1696280407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147489888": {"recommendationid": "147489888", "author": {"steamid": "76561199403660338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 544, "last_played": 1696602777}, "language": "english", "review": "played lord of shadow 2 and it was good but i didn't know that lord of shadow 1 is great too", "timestamp_created": 1696233373, "timestamp_updated": 1696233373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147478122": {"recommendationid": "147478122", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005796840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1698377043}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Distinto a los cl\u00e1sicos de la saga, este Castlevania tiene elementos hack n slash, resoluci\u00f3n de puzzles y plataformas en 3d.

This series reboots the story with religious themes and its own set of characters. The story is decent enough, but far from being one of the best things about the game. Still, the game has quite the presentation, with animated cutscenes, voice acting and a narrated opening for each level. \n\nIt plays like the PlayStation 2 God of War games, a 3D action game with hack-and-slash combat with combos and special abilities. The combat is ok but can get somewhat shallow: it's not really clear what will make enemies stagger, so if you're playing on the higher difficulties and can't afford to get hit, you'll usually do the first moves of a combo and roll away to avoid being hit. Rinse and repeat. There are lots of air combos but I found that I was barely using them, since you can't really dodge midair and most enemies just swat you away if you're messing around too long. Besides the combat, there's puzzles and lots of parkour sections in which you use your chained weapon to jump and climb around. Those were generally a nice change of pace, but were also a part of the worst thing in the game: Shadow of the Colossus-like bosses. There aren't many of those, but each one of them is a drag. \"Hold RT to grip\" is just not an entertaining game mechanic. \n\nThe game works with levels spread around chapters, and has a level selector accessible at all times. This makes the \"metroidvania\" aspects of the game somewhat awkward, since after you acquire new abilities, you got to replay previous levels to get whatever you couldn't get before, making you replay some levels two or three times. From the level selector you can see each level's completion rate and missed artifacts, so at least you won't replay levels looking for stuff that doesn't exist.\n\nThe part I liked the least were chapters XIII and XIV, chapters that were part of DLCs that got integrated in the base game in this version. These chapters include sections in which you play as a weaker and more rigid character, some of the worst puzzles of the game and an infuriating final boss. The boss has a lot of phases but uses the same attacks across all of them. The safe time window for damaging the boss after his attacks is quite short, so the entire fight is just a test of patience in which you dodge until he does the move you can punish, get a couple of hits in and retreat. The DLC barely has healing spots, so it's quite common to reach the boss while 1 or 2 hits away from death.\n\nStill, this is a positive review.

Nothing crazy special about it. It's just a good old fashioned H&S game. You have everything from your basic 2 or 3 hit villains to your typical oversized bosses usually at the end of the chapter. U can buy special moves, basic moves, ect. to upgrade Gabrielle (Main character) & make him a BAMF. U will have to do some grinding though if u want to get enough to buy the good signature moves & weapon upgrades. I didn't even have enough to buy everything the 1st play through. I had to do some grinding & got all but 1. But theres like some hidden stuff & some good extras. I won't get too detailed as i don't wan't give any spoilers. I probably praise this game a little more than the average Steam gamer because i'k like ancient (43) & i was a HUGE NES FAN & also fan of the Castlevania series way.... WAY back in the day. Anyway don't base your decision on that stupid Metacritic rating. Cuz those MF's are ruthless rating some games. I will say i think this game (and others) should be like $$5-$10 cheaper than it is. BUT... buy this game when it is on sale because this is one of those games that you see on sale all the time for like $5-$6 or something . Also the DLC of this one you can also get for like i wanna say $2.99 & Castlevania LOS part 2 is like $7.49. I love it because i can buy em' all at once. So wtbs, Wait til it's on sale. Not worth full price as i'm saying that only cuz I hate when Steam does it, there are games that are like 10,11,12 years old &they charge like a stupid amount still. Take COD B-OP's for example. Like r u serious man? Although in all fairness Steam does give some mad chances to play awesome games for a week or weekend & there season sales more than make up for overpriced older games.   It's not a freakin'  like a 60-something like Metacritic is saying. I would probably put it in upper 70's . It can get repetitive. If you juat want to star swinging a bad-ass Morning-Star chain with ALL the trimmings, Then when it goes on sale don't be a cheap-ass. It's really cheap & you can get 3 full games for under $20. Actually i believe it a little over $15! Your not going to get Final Fantasy X type hours  (which F.F-X is my absolute fav. But that's another conversation in itself if u know what i'm saying. lol ), but if u really like it (for the sale price), then you can drag it out and make it last a little longer with all the extras, DLC, and all the trail missions (ex. kill 30 goblins or beat such 'n' such under this amount of time. I really hope you guys like the Castlevania's .Again, like em' for the price. Peace, love, and gaming, NOT WAR!

Five years later, my second impressions weren't much better. Now, after a decade I gave it one final chance for it to prove itself... and... eh... I'm glad I did? This time through... a full completion and I'll likely even run the DLC.\n\nI think the best description for this game I've read \"This is my favorite 6/10 game\" and even then I think its a stretch. There is loads of potential here and there is fun to be had but every time I found myself smiling it smiles its janky smile and reminds me that it's got severe issues.\n\nLets start by saying... the pacing is off.  It feels like the developers set out to make the next great epic fantasy and had sky-high dreams...but ran out of money at the end of chapter 2.  At this point, it stops being bloated trash that's pretending to be amazing. I'd still cut out 5-10 hours of cheap filler, but even that felt better than the early chapters.\n\nThe early chapters just aren't a good indicator of the game experience and they last for far, faaaar too long. (Of the 40 or so stages, almost 15 are Chapters 1 and 2. The remaining 25 are split across an entire 10 chapters!)\n\nThe first chapter seems to want to show off how varied the gameplay is and has one mission per gameplay type. (It's worth noting you can't heal in this first chapter, and you can't use combat magic until even further.) \n - Hack and Slash / Platforming (with QTE kills galore)\n - Horse Riding (Which is NEVER again used and should have been cut)\n - Puzzle Stage \n - Navigational Puzzle (Slowly shimmying along ledges to look at pretty views but not doing much else)\n - Titan Battle (Climbing up giant monsters all Shadow of the Colossus Style)\n\nThe problem with recommending this game is that for every one of the above gameplay types... this game was inferior to the one it copied. Sure... 7/10 hack and slash isn't bad... but why not play the 9/10 God of War or Devil May Cry... and there's zero reason to recommend this game's 3/10 Titan Battles over SotC. \n\nIf you ask me what to play... I'll recommend each of the inspirations over this. \n\nThe other major problem that this game does have is its inclusions and implementation of puzzles. The full-on puzzles stall the progress but at least make good mental challenges (With a Give me the answer option if you hate puzzles). \n\nBut there are a number of specific navigational puzzles that require obscure traits of attacks that I forgot existed. I shouldn't have to google \"How do I hit this switch\" or \"Why can't I make this jump?\" or \"Why can't I finish off this boss\"... but I did have to several times.\n\nOne area I do want to highlight... the non-titan boss battles. While fairly samey in terms of movesets and strategy, they were legit fun. It's in the moments of focused 1v1 combat that the 7/10 starts to shine and I really appreciated this game. (The last boss really ended on a high note for me)\n\nAfter you unlock all your basic skills... you unlock a surprisingly in-depth combat system.  I-Frame dodges, Perfect Parries, raising combo to recharge mana burned to boost attack or heal, magical combination with each of your moves or weapons. \n\nEnemies hit extremely hard, non-combat healing is basically non-existent, and you do need to master it... but it feels pretty darn good when you do.\n\nIn fact, The combat system was good enough that I almost forgot to mention that the camera is trash. Like... literal trash. \n\nOverall, this deserves a sideways thumb because there's actually a good game here. Take my \"Recommended\" thumb as a literal coin flip.

Mankind faces ruin and despair. The world is changing, yet hope remains in the hearts of the people.\u201d\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game that is very similar to the early God of War games, just with a slightly different main weapon, the Combat Cross; a retractable chain whip that has many uses when handling enemies and level obstacles. I never played the old Castlevania games, so I won\u2019t be doing any comparisons between them.\n\nPros\n\u2714\ufe0f Good Story with interesting side characters.\n\u2714\ufe0f The combat is fun, with lots of abilities and combos to learn.\n\u2714\ufe0f Puzzles can be challenging.\n\u2714\ufe0f Great variety of enemies.\n\u2714\ufe0f Excellent boss fights.\n\u2714\ufe0f Replayablility (trials).\n\u2714\ufe0f Fun DLCs that have challenging puzzles and boss fights.\n\u2714\ufe0f The game is visually Impressive, with lots of areas to explore.\n\u2714\ufe0f Character models look excellent.\n\u2714\ufe0f The game is well-optimized\n\u2714\ufe0f Mostly great and memorable soundtrack.\n\nStory\nYou control Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light, who found that his wife was murdered recently. Your goal is basically to destroy an ancient order, known as the Lords of Shadow, to bring her back to life and save the world from darkness.\n\n\nDespite the well-made cutscenes, there was little focus on exploring Gabriel's character. \n\n\nMost of the characters in this game are interesting, mysterious and intriguing. On the other hand, Gabriel has very little personality; he is a generic protagonist with his cliche one-liners that you see in other games. It is until you play the DLCs where his character is more fleshed out.\n\nThe game has a total of 12 chapters (including the DLC), which include over 40 levels. Each level in this game usually takes about 10-20 minutes to complete, so you will be seeing a lot of loading screens. However, the story and writing overall were good enough to keep me intrigued till the end.\n\nGameplay\nCombat:\nYour main weapon is the Combat Cross, a retractable chain whip that can hit enemies from a great distance . You will be earn new abilities and throwables while you progress that make the combat much more varied and engaging.\n\nYou can also perform awesome finishing moves on enemies which vary from one enemy to another. QTEs and button mashing are also a common occurence; during kill animations, while solving puzzles, when operating a mechanism and sometimes during cutscenes. The QTEs were easy to execute and didn't bother me much.\n\n\nThe game has fixed camera, so you can\u2019t control it in-game. Luckily, it worked well for me and it didn\u2019t affect the gameplay. \n\n\nYou earn points from slaying enemies and solving puzzles, which you can spend on learning new combos and skills. You will also obtain two types of medallions later in the story; one of which inflicts more damage to enemies while the other replenishes your health by attacking them.\n\nYou can check all combos and skills in the menu, as each one has its own simple animated video that shows what happens when you do it ingame. The only issue I have with the combat is that the block/parry button is also used for dodging, so you can accidentally dodge an enemy instead of parrying an attack.\n\nEnemies:\nYou will face all kinds of enemies in the game, such as Vampires, Zombies, Lycans, Skeleton Warriors, Cave Trolls and so many more. You can learn more about them in your Bestiary (located in the menu). You can ride some of the large beasts, after inflicting a good amount of damage, and use them to kill the other enemies.\n\nPuzzles:\nThere are a lot of puzzles in this game. Aside from killing enemies, the Combat Cross can also be used to solve different puzzles and act as a grappling hook to swing to unreachable areas, or during platforming sessions. The puzzles get harder and harder as you progress through the story, and some require you to find particular scrolls from dead knights (can also be accessed in the main menu) or mount a certain monster to solve them.\n\nBosses:\nThere are a lot of bosses in the game that range from lieutenant vampires to huge titans, and some will grant you new abilities, once you defeat them. I like the boss fights, they are engaging, creative and balanced, even on higher difficulty settings.\n\nTrials:\nYou can replay the chapters again, after you complete them, but with special challenges. Each and every level in the game has its own Trial, which are difficult but add more replay value.\n\nDifficulty:\nI chose the Knight difficulty (hard) and it was perfect; the enemies and bosses are tougher and deal more damage but remain fair and balanced, as you will be using the abilities and combos that you learn to slay them and progress through the game.\n\nGraphics and Level Design\nFor a 2010 game, the graphics look pretty good. From vast and detailed environments to good looking character models. There are ingame cutscenes and prerecorded ones, the Ingame cutscenes still hold up and characters have decent facial animation.\n\nYou will be visiting different areas in this game, such as enchanted forests and the cold and chilly oblivion lake, and these areas provide a good sense of immersion. Areas range from the more generic, like the Dark Dungeon, to the absolutely beautiful, such as the Clockwork Tower.\n\n\nOne advantage of the fixed camera is that you get to see some amazing and visually impressive locations in the game at a larger scale. \n\n\nEvery so often you will come across a branching path, but the game fails to show you which way leads to the beaten path (long walks and similar looking paths), and if you missed it then there\u2019s a chance you can\u2019t go back and have to restart the level all over again. There are a lot of secrets and hidden areas that you can find and explore in the levels, so watch out for them.\n\nTechnical\nThe game is well-optimized and ran beautifully. No issues to report.\n\nSoundtrack\nA few of the songs are okay and not very memorable, while others are just excellent; some give you this gothic atmosphere, while others have a pleasant and calm melody when solving puzzles and during exploration. The songs range from the epic orchestra of Hunting Path to the pleasant, heart-wrenching melody of Waterfalls of Agharta and Belmont\u2019s Theme.\n\nDLC\nThere are two main DLCs in the game, Reverie and Resurrection, and they continue the story of the base game. I can\u2019t say more than that to avoid spoilers, but they are 2 chapters and 1 hours long each and they were pretty fun. The first DLC is mainly puzzles and less fighting, and the second one is just two very challenging boss fights and that\u2019s about it.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen I first installed Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, I had low expectations and thought I would just delete it after an hour or two, but I actually had a lot of fun and enjoyed my time playing it. Despite some issues in the story and level design, the combat was solid, the story was good, the graphics still hold up and it has a great soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1691158799, "timestamp_updated": 1691158799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143383497": {"recommendationid": "143383497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101659776", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1691352067}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game.

Castlevania, it is not. The levels are fairly straightforward and lineal, nothing like you'd see in a roguelike and thus what most Castlevania fans were expecting is not to be found here. \n\nBut if you're not familiar with the original games, like me, there's a game with a lot of potential here. I haven't finished it, as a disclaimer, but I am on Chapter 8 (out of 12) so I do believe I'm in a position to give my overall thoughts on the game. \n\nThe graphics hold up surprisingly well, there are a lot of awe-inducing vistas and the character models aren't... terrible, even though they are a bit anatomically weird for some reason. The whip is fantastic and really fun, I loved the platforming and this is coming from a person who typically doesn't enjoy his action games to be padded out by jumping around ledges. You can use your whip as a rappel and jump from it, climb it, swing to the sides, it's all around pretty fun even if it's streamlined.\n\nSeems there's a heavy emphasis on backtracking, what with each chapter and its subsequent levels having a % level. I assume this was done to pad out time or for people who really really enjoyed the combat (I did not, more on that later) and I probably won't be coming anywhere near close 100%ing this game. \n\nStory starts out really slow but if you stick it out I promise it gets really good. Like I said, I haven't finished the game, but I'm hooked. The only thing preventing me from actually getting to the ending is the god-awful combat. \n\nWhose idea was it to bind dodge and block to the same button in a game with a PERFECT PARRY?? \n\nThat's not even the worst of it; Gabriel has a really hard time stun-locking enemies, so you'll get hit out of combos quite frequently. Don't even DARE going for an air combo because you will be swatted out of the air like you're a fucking Boeing 737 in March 23rd 2022. Most of it boils down to press X a bunch of times, pre-emptively dodge because the enemies don't have good windup animations, press X a bunch of times again, ad infinitum. Of course, pressing light attack a bunch of times does nearly negative damage, so it drags the combat out a lot. \nI've found a strategy that has been working for me, somewhat, and it's that of standing completely still, waiting for an attack then PARRYING it. It guarantees a lot of damage on that particular enemy (even more if you're using shadow magic) and it almost entirely fills your focus gauge (which is an important mechanic that is also non-sensical because it requires you to no-hit enemy encounters lol)  \n\nThere's QTEs like any game worth its salt in 2013, but they're easy enough and don't require a specific button press; it's more like a rhythm game than anything. \n\nI read somewhere that the developers were somewhat bothered by the GoW comparisons, and while I can see where those are coming from, this isn't a GoW clone simply because there are too many major differences. \n\nKratos has an enormous arsenal of weapons, you are ENCOURAGED to button mash and combo the shit out of enemies and juggle them in the air and all sorts of stuff, platforming in GoW is a pain in the fucking ass and the story is... a story. \nGabriel only ever has his whip, which he upgrades throughout the story, the combat is more tactical because like I was saying, you can't stunlock for shit and the windup animations are stupid to the point where the attack might as well just pop into existence for 1/4th of your health bar, platforming is incredibly fun and the story is shaping up to be ABSOLUTE KINO.\n\nSide note, the extras menu has some HUD options that you might wanna activate, such as XP gains, damage dealt by Gabriel and enemy health bars (this one is crucial imo) \n\nSo yes, buy it, it's a game worth purchasing and it's a game worth experiencing with the caveat that combat is going to be really hard for no reason other than bad design. \n\nIf push comes to shove, the game has incorporated cheats which give you god-mode, unlimited damage, etc if you so wish and I do not believe it affects achievements in any way.", "timestamp_created": 1689743028, "timestamp_updated": 1689747355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142356519": {"recommendationid": "142356519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313168113", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1336, "last_played": 1689714414}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!

The combat is pretty much God of War, Darksiders, Dante's Inferno, ETC which I still believe is way better than the type of \"Hack'n'Slash\" games we have now. The game does have some down sides though. First the game does have these gigantic boss fights pretty much like the classic God Of War games. Even in God Of War these type of fights are just boring with little to zero challenge to them. The fixed camera does get a little annoying at times. And just like Classic God of War they have these challenges that are beyond annoying to do but thankfully they are 100% optional unless you care about achievements then good luck because from what I have read they seem tedious. I really believe Konami should do what Capcom has been doing and either Remake The Lords of Shadow series (and maybe finally make Lords of Shadow 3) or Remake the original series but in a 3D Hack'N'Slash game.

I think that this is a great sub-30-hour action game with some minor puzzles and exploration in-between combat encounters but do not expect this to be a metroidvania. \n\n[b]Note[/b] if you are playing with KBM change your keybinds [i]immediately[/i]\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThis is a reboot of Castlevania and is set in a new timeline, and these are dark times, times without hope, this is a world that God has abandoned, and which is dominated by the three Lords of Shadow. Your quest is to destroy them, fulfil the prophecy by becoming God\u2019s Vassal on Earth and bring back your wife. \n\nThis is generally told from the perspective of the main character Gabriel Belmont, a warrior of the Brotherhood as he travels leagues across the lands all for the sake of his wife. However, a lot of things cannot be shown from his perspective because he rarely talks to himself, and we are not privy to his thoughts. \nInstead, we receive something similar through the perspective of another character, one introduced within the first Chapter who sets the mood for any area with his narration, who tells us of Gabriel\u2019s state, and who arrives to aid Gabriel at points during his journey.  \nThese are really, really cool, it is a good quiet reprieve for a few moments, and can tell us things that would feel forced in-game, it also has a certain atmosphere about it that you will pick up on.\n\nSome more worldbuilding can be found in the Knight Scrolls, they are hardly a necessary addition, but they give you some tips for how to complete areas or info on where to find upgrades. They are basically glorified hints, and I like their inclusion since it shows what other warriors of the Brotherhood are hopelessly trying to do.   \n\n[h1] Presentation [/h1] \nThis game looks great even today because it is carried by its beautiful environments and a number of outstanding designs. This is further highlighted by the cinematography as the developers knew exactly how to show off an area and its world. Something is always centred, and it looks great, this is how fixed camera angles should be used. \nNaturally the cutscenes are about on par with this but they are heightened even further by the voice acting, because the cast does a really great job to bring emotion and some nuance to the characters. Perhaps that is not so surprising considering that a few of them had received awards even before this game was released.  \n\nAnother important note is the music, on the whole it is beautiful, however, a handful of tracks can sound rather generic which is not much of an issue since tracks are often specific for chapters or bosses. This has the added benefit of giving areas their own distinct moods though there is always an underlying feeling of hopelessness and ruin, which synergises well with the art style and, naturally, the story. This score received an award, and I think it deserves it.\n\nIf I have any complaints, it will come down to the enemy designs, they look great, it is easy to tell them apart, however, some of them are a bit generic, but that is ok because the game also has designs like the Creeping Coffins that look nightmarish.\nOn the other hand, the architectural designs are superb and even the ruins make me stop to appreciate them, while others are simply imposing on account of their massive, supernatural scale.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nFirst things first, the first Chapter is in many ways not representative of the rest of the game, but it does give you a taste of things to come. There is combat, there are puzzles, and there are puzzle bosses, but after the first Chapter they are paced out much better and feel less compartmentalised. \n  \nSo, besides the combat there is platforming and puzzles to shake things up. However, none of these things are particularly difficult, and the game gives you the option to solve the puzzles automatically which would negate any experience you would have gained if you had solved it. \nOf course, there is also exploration, but it is not open exploration, you are either looking for the path to progress, a key or you are straying from the path looking for collectibles. This is disappointing, collectibles are not hidden, and you are often given explicit hints for their locations through documents.  \nYou do not backtrack in this game either, in fact individual areas are so short you can easily do them in a few minutes once you know what to do, however, the game does incentivise you to replay chapters by placing collectibles behind double-jumps or breakable walls that you can only access later. In other words, do not expect this to be a metroidvania since it is not. \n\nThere are also the Trials, one for each area, most of them are trivial and a few are tedious, then there are the timed ones. I do not like timers in video games, and even when playing perfectly these can get very close, but even then, they should only take a few tries once you get the method down. Thankfully they are completely optional, but it might be fun to try out a few that sound interesting, if only to play certain maps in a different manner, or to discover things you did not know were possible.\n \n[h2]Combat[/h2]\nFighting in this game is rather simple and does not need much explaining, at its core is the combos and magic. The latter comes in two varieties, Light which heals you, and Shadow which deals extra damage, both of these have their own unique combos, and both require mana. \nSo how do you get mana? You attack enemies to build your Focus and once your Focus meter is full, they start dropping mana. However, whenever you get hit your meter resets, this would incentivise a more defensive playstyle, but parrying not only keeps you safe but it also gives you a massive boost to your Focus. This means the most effective playstyle is parrying paired with aggressiveness, dodging whatever attacks cannot be parried, and spacing. \n\nKilling an enemy unlocks their bestiary page which gives you some further info on them such as what sub-weapons they are resistant or weak to. The weaknesses are in general very obvious, take for example the werewolves, what could they possibly be weak against? \nHowever, you can easily underestimate the strength of these sub-weapons when you first start playing, because they are shockingly strong and remain useful until the end of the game, especially when paired with magic, since this can change their effects and their effectiveness.  \n\nObjectively the worst part of the combat is a few quick time events. These QTEs are terrible primarily due to their implementation with a keyboard and require you to do the equivalent of spinning a joystick in a circle but with WASD within a short timeframe. That is very unintuitive, but it is not impossible, so it may take you a while to get the rhythm down. One boss fight makes a lot of use of this mechanic, so you might be better off using a controller if you are struggling. \nFor the most part the other QTEs are fine, and some are pretty cool, if you count the grabs then I like those too. It is just very satisfying to finish enemies off, and its quite funny to activate a goblin's grenade and throw it towards a group of them. \n\nIt should also be said that the game has pretty great enemy variety and that they are spread out in such a way that each Lord of Shadow has their own roster of servants. This means that new enemies are constantly introduced and that you will need to adapt to new tactics and resistances at a regular basis which keeps the gameplay fresh throughout the story.  \nThis also hold true for the bosses as while they follow the general flow of the combat, they also have some sort of mechanic to make them stand out from each other. If not requiring you to complete a QTE, they might have adds, and sometimes they will make use of equipment that will help you in the future. On the whole they are fun, especially when they force you to think differently and not rely on tactics like parrying or spamming.", "timestamp_created": 1687540235, "timestamp_updated": 1687711844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629525721073150635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140536526": {"recommendationid": "140536526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066188655", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 259, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1504921866}, "language": "english", "review": "I understand that a lot of people like the lore of this, however I did not played the original game, and this one did not age well.

I also noticed it doesn't feel like Castlevania, for starters there is no map and the secrets are mostly based on camera angles and branching paths, it feels a bit generic.\n\nThe forced quick time events alone within the platforming and combat make this feel like a chore, while I will continue to finish it to get through all the Castlevania's on PC it's not exactly tons of fun.

On the plus side, you have absolutely gorgeous levels, decent gameplay, and Patrick Stewart's voice chewing scenery like nobody's business. On the less than brilliant side, you have a protagonist with a distractingly small head, quick time events (seriously?

I kept on playing for about 1,5 hours and after looking at how much i have left of the game, i abandoned it.\n\nPros:\nThe music is great in this game.\n\nThe voice acting is okay but can sound janky sometimes.\n\nThe character design is cool.\n\nThe game adds challenges to every mission once you complete it. Gives them a little bit of replayability.\n\nThere are chests in some levels, that you can only reach once you have a different item that you get in a later level. Once you have that item, you can go back and get that chest. I don't know if i like that or not, you decide.\n\nCons:\nCombat is very repetetive and some moves break you out of the flow of the fight (grabbing enemies and waiting for a bar to fill up)\n\nThis game has a fixed camera, you can't move it which is frustrating sometimes. You move from one fixed camera to the other and that suddenly changes the direction on which your character is moving.\n\nI didn't even know you could sprint in this game, i only figured it out through a review.\n\nDaggers. You find sacks all throughout the game which replenish your daggers. But almost every crate or jar can be destroyed and they have daggers in them most of the time. This makes the sacks almost useless cause you will never be out of daggers.\n\nThis game is looooong. I only reached chapter 3 and every chapter has different missions in them. This game has 14!! chapters and i got bored at the 3rd one.\n\nLevels are very linear. You can explore to some degree but you'll almost always end up in a dead end if you don't go the correct way.\n\nIf you explore the levels and you progress through the correct way, the game sometimes doesn't let you go back and explore other paths, locking you out from some collectibles and making you replay the mission or load a checkpoint, hoping it let's you grab the collectible\n\nThere is some kind of combat meter that fills up while fighting and depletes once you are out of combat.

"review": "CLoS has a very odd characteristic of being a decent game but being a very poor Castelvania game. The game play is decent, Music is ok, level design has  a few peaks but most of it is middle of the pack and plot...plot is actually pretty decent.  \n\nThe game works by doing it in a episode/mission fashion You complete a episode/mission you go on to the next the one. And while this does allow easy methods of back tracking to get collectibles and power ups I feel it takes away form the castlevania  formula as the the paths are fairly start forward with no real exploration being needed beyond a few basics.Part of this is the fact they tried to go away from the platforming angle and more into the hack/slash why would they do this on a series that has built it self on platforming is beyond my knowledge.  That being said level design has some questionable choices but overall not a bad job.\n\nCombat wise they tried to take a page from God of war and Devil may cry and while  that formula works  it just seems unrefined here. Enemies attacks seem to hit you when they should not. Often before they even complete the animation for it.  Your attacks don't seem to hit them when they should. Your combos are clunky and not actually  very easy to combo  and even trying to do air attacks is just not worth it.  because of that enemies attack hit you when they shouldn't I mentioned earlier.   \n\nMusic wise it was a major let down.  Every Castlevania I have ever played has had a music/sound track that just hits that spot of epic.  Lords of Shadow did not. It was more back ground noise then something that would suck you in like prior games have. And honestly this is probably my biggest thing. \n\nPlot wise its not bad. Granted its not Final fantasy or some other JRPG but over all not bad. And as this was meant to be a Retcon of the series it could probably of had some more work on it. But the story was fairly consistent and went to A to B to C in a manner that was easily understood though the plot twist they tried to bring in you could see a mile away. \n\nOtherall like I said earlier its a decent game, but a very poor  Castlevania one. I feel that it tried to hard to incorporate things taken from God of war, devil may cry, even Prince of Persia making it a Jack of all trades master of none. \nIs it worth playing? Absolutely  my issues with the  game aside I still had fun playing it. But I can't really recommend paying  full price I would advise to wait till its one sale. \n", "timestamp_created": 1684419880, "timestamp_updated": 1684419880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138354519": {"recommendationid": "138354519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973188939", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1684724694}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy insano\ud83d\udc7b", "timestamp_created": 1684183442, "timestamp_updated": 1684183442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592592597007751465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138349409": {"recommendationid": "138349409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066054596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1973, "last_played": 1684272897}, "language": "english", "review": "runs great on deck, can push 120+ frames with just shadows turned down a lil, still looks incredible. platforming can be annoying, puzzles entertaining, decent combat, nice scenery, good lil game.", "timestamp_created": 1684175500, "timestamp_updated": 1684175500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138347752": {"recommendationid": "138347752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117660047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1686820133}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is fun but a bit tough in hard mode. overall great game to kill some time.", "timestamp_created": 1684172921, "timestamp_updated": 1684172921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138330754": {"recommendationid": "138330754", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970550696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1681970264}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los aspectos destacados de Castlevania: Lords of Shadow \u2013 Ultimate Edition es su atm\u00f3sfera envolvente y su dise\u00f1o visual impresionante.

To keep it short and sweet, the western fantasy approach ends up fitting like a glove for this series, whose roots are already inspired by Western horror fantasy. \n\nIt's a bond made all the stronger by strong voice over performances from the entire cast, but most notably Patrick Stewart. Not only playing a role in the game, but also being the narrator and setting the tone for each and every level. This is narration done right, and Stewart delivers a Shakespearean quality performance that makes the experience more immersive and exciting. \n\nThe gameplay is quite fun, essentially designed in the vain of Devil May Cry and God of War. There are plenty of combos and unique powers to use through out the game. Keeping everything fresh. The QTEs are a mixed bag. They keep things simple enough for the most part, but there are moments I'd prefer to watch as reward for winning. There's also plenty of platforming and puzzle solving, which might be a mixed bag for some, but I found to be welcomed and fun. Admittedly, some of the parts I got stuck on most were puzzle segements, and the approach to platforming, while not difficult, can be confusing at first or if you come back from a game hiatus. Still, the platforming and puzzle solving make use of the powers you use in combat, making sure you as the gamer experience the protagonists many abilities. \n\nStory is quite good. A horror fantasy epic about a crusader hunting down monsters in the name of God. In this particular setting, you're tasked with defeating the worst monsters of them all, the Lords of Shadow. Who rule over their lands like warlords. Part of your journey is to use the power they possess and bring your dead wife back to life. It's a lengthy journey with plenty ups and downs. The cutscenes are animated like a major studio production and are a treat to watch.\n\nThis world is infested with a wide range of enemies. Werewolves, vampires, zombies, ghosts, titans, goblins, and more. Even Chupacabras! The combat is well designed and balanced for the most part, and the bosses are extremely memorable. The game borrows influence from Shadow of the Colossus to break up the other intense boss fights, and make for incredible set pieces. In addition, there's plenty of backstory, lore, conceptual art, and other goodies to find and enjoy. Including multiple difficulty levels and trials for each level. \n\nThe DLC for this game is included in the Ultimate Edition, and as post game content, is good overall. Mainly first episode which offers new gameplay experiences. The final boss in the DLC was a let down for me, simply bad design. Instead of CGI cutscenes, we get storyboarded scenes, which while still good, lack the visual flair we come to expect, and robs us of what could have been a great ending. We do get to play as one of the surviving characters in the game though, which helps to mix things up.\n\nThe Lords of Shadow ended up being a quality experience, if flawed, but it ultimately deserved the initial success it had.", "timestamp_created": 1683773871, "timestamp_updated": 1683773871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

balance as spamming the basic combos is your best option 95% of the time, which gets dull very quickly.\n\nThere's platforming which is, meh okay I guess, but far less engaging than the combat. However the game seems to have you climb around for a few minutes and then stumble into a combat encounter that takes like 15 seconds.\n\nCombine that with characters and environments that have less charisma than a plank of wood's ballsack and you get an entirely soul-sucking game to play.\n\nAnd that's not too mention the god awful soundtrack that blares overly dramatic \"Sad\" music in every level that feels incredibly out of place with the rather mundane opening stages of the game.\n\nI'm willing to bet further into the game it gets better as more mechanics are introduced but I cannot stomach slogging through anymore of this painfully mediocre crap.\n\nI went into this expecting an uninspired God of War ripoff and honestly I would've been happy if the game was just that, but no we get a game trying just barely hard enough to not be a blatant ripoff that it's bogged down with enough crap to take the joy out of smacking things around with a big chain.\n\nI know this game has it's fans and all the power to ya, but I just don't see anything here that hasn't been done 10  times better elsewhere.

There are lots of great set pieces, scenes, acting, and art in general, but the gameplay drags it all down into hell, literally. The gameplay is best described as quicktime events, the game, and most of the cutscenes, during boss battles, require them to finish a fight. The final DLC boss made me quit the game, it's not worth it for a cutscene. I have played through many other bosses without crap mechanics in other games.\n\nThe player combat is passable, and sometimes fun, but most of the bosses and enemies suck to fight. You're given lots of combos, most of which are useless and impossible to use in bossfights. There are no upgrades to damage, and the only way to get magic half the time is to be a perfect player without getting hit, which is impossible in bossfights, especially the DLC. \n\nMany enemies are simply defeated by grabbing and quicktiming, which defeats the point of combos. There is no air dodge, even though there is a ground dodge and you have wings. Jumping carries momentum most of the time with no air control, making it very hard to control direction of movement or attacks in the air, which is required for later boss battles.\n\nMost of the bossfights revolve around cheap gimmicks rather than anything fun. The titan battles in particular are a bore, only hard because of cheap quicktime events. Platforming sucks, ledgegrabbing is extremely overused and poorly controlled. Depending on camera angles and because the entire game uses fixed cameras, interactable objects can be hard to spot even when pointed out. The DLC especially has some very poorly planned platforming/ledgegrabbing sequences.\n\nThe game is extremely hand holding with annoying hints constantly taking camera control away both in and out of boss battles, and annoying reminders that the player is stupid for not immediately solving some stupid puzzle or mechanic. While at the same time, areas that clearly need more direction are ignored, especially some of the puzzles that need some basic directions to solve. There seems to have been very little QA testing. \n\nThere are many navigation bugs present forcing checkpoint restarts when getting stuck on geometry.", "timestamp_created": 1683005065, "timestamp_updated": 1683005065, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483221471309661865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137557373": {"recommendationid": "137557373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034339711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1682867464}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es de esos que tenes que tener\n", "timestamp_created": 1682867477, "timestamp_updated": 1682867477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137352549": {"recommendationid": "137352549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965591976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1686189288}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Dale una oportunidad\n\nEs un gran juego con gran variedad de enemigos , escenarios y habilidades que te mantendr\u00e1n entretenido, para ser un juego del 2013 se ve muy bien y la jugabilidad es buena, el \u00fanico detalle es que algunos efectos de habilidades no se alcanzan a apreciar del todo bien, pero no afecta 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1682565306, "timestamp_updated": 1682565306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137338640": {"recommendationid": "137338640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256301178", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2479, "last_played": 1682537123}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] \ud83d\udc80Hell of a terrible game design\ud83d\udc80 [/h1]\nDon't know where to start. This game suffers from a poor design in almost every aspect, especially world navigation. There're lots of situations when you intuitively want to rotate your camera to observe all those quite beautiful surroundings or simply check where are you supposed to jump. But there's just [b]NO camera rotation[/b] in Lords of Shadow. Simple as that. Developers think like you're playing on Playstation 1 or PSP or something otherwise I can't explain why the hell you're not using second analog in 2010 game   O_O\n[hr][/hr]\nAnother frustrating thing. Sometimes core mechanics of the game, such as pillars and jumping just [b]DON'T WORK[/b] as they've been working for entire game before.\n Throughout the game you can hold the RT when turning the pillars and the game doesn't care. You don't actually need to hold it, but the game carries on regardless. But in the clock tower, if you hold RT, the pillar stops revolving after a second for no obvious reason. Only place in the game that does it.\nAnd here, in the very Epilogue, this is the only place you have to tap the direction and jump simultaniously, rather than holding left and tapping jump like everywhere else.\n You might ask \"is that such a serious problem?\" And I'd answer [b] Hell yeah[/b], because Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is really really difficult game at it's core with lots of bizarre puzzles and trials, so it's [b]EXTREMELY[/b] important to make sure the game works stable throughout player's walkthrough, because as long as it doesn't, many annoying situations will happen when player can't understand, is it [b]HE[/b] who sucks, or is it the [b]GAME[/b] which doesn't work properly.\n[hr][/hr]\nAlthough combat system is pretty solid, you're probably gonna use 2-3 combos through the whole game for the sake of it's efficiency and simplicity.\nStory contains a lot of fantasy clich\u00e9. [spoiler] The main character is literally Anakin Skywalker, lol. [/spoiler]\nSoundtrack can be really good sometimes, I'll give them that.\nVoice actors did an amazing job too. Scottish accent of Robert Carlyle is a music to my ears! :D And of course, the Legend Patrick Stewart doing his thing. Lovely.\n[hr][/hr]\nIn conclusion, it's a shame that LoS could be much better than it is. This title has quite a lot of strengths, such as an amazing atmosphere (it includes soundtrack, visuals, characters) and decent combat system. But the whole experience eventually become ruined because of issues i've listed. \nIf you're really into some dark fantasy and you love God of War - you might give it a try, but you should be aware of design issues and be ready to use YouTube at least couple of times.", "timestamp_created": 1682539346, "timestamp_updated": 1682541487, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461332380771636963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137309867": {"recommendationid": "137309867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406022493", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6244, "last_played": 1682489075}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Personalmente, el mejor juego de Castlevania que he jugado por lo tan \u00fanico/diferente que se siente respecto a otros y el que m\u00e1s me divert\u00ed.

I remember that I didn't pay the game a whole lot of attention because, despite being a big Castlevania fan, my college midterms were going on at the moment and I was more focused on that obviously. Well, thirteen years later I can finally give this game the attention it deserves. The game is broken down into three main pillars: Combat, platforming, and puzzle solving. The combat is excellent and does a good job not shoe horning itself into God of War-clone territory that was so prevalent at the time. The platforming is fun and does offer some areas of challenge, however the game is sometimes very cryptic on where you need to go next to find the next set of platforms. The puzzles are fun and don't require too much thought to overcome (for better or worse). The story does it's job and the voice acting is acceptable, although Sir Patrick Stewart does an amazing job in his role and is by far the stand out performance. \n\nMy one big complaint (SPOILERS) are the Chupacabra segments. The Chupacabra will take your powers and it's up to you to get the back by overcoming trials, platforming, and combat challenges. These segments do nothing but completely halt the game's momentum and offer nothing but filler to the overall composition of the game. \n\nI would highly recommend this game to Castlevania and God of War fans, or if you just like good hack n' slash action adventure games. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1680090281, "timestamp_updated": 1680090281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135585819": {"recommendationid": "135585819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165624350", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 496, "last_played": 1678884062}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely a game of nostalgia, I grew up playing this game and it has not aged a day.

At its core, LoS is a good God of War clone with high production value, unmistakable Castlevania style, wonderful acting, writing, and rewarding gameplay, with a completely nonsensical and unearned ending. The \"Ultimate Edition\" ruins this further with the inclusion of the previously DLC levels, which are some of the worst levels I have ever played in a video game: instakill platforming that requires perfection, no source of healing or energy besides fights against hordes with unblockable attacks, and a trial-by-error, multi-stage boss fight with--you guessed it--entirely unblockable/parryable attacks, bubble AoE, and insanely lazy, cheap, drawn cutscenes.\n\nMaybe this sounds fun to the hardcore enthusiasts, but LoS is not designed with reflexes in mind. Pressing a button three times means you will play three, if not four full animations. There is no block cancelling, no aerial block or dodge, learn-by-dying unblockable attacks, and nothing but \"whip-sponge\" enemies. I bounced off this game hard twice, taking me nearly 10 years to finally get around to completing. At least the core game feels somewhat balanced with its energy/items/health and telegraphed attacks, but the DLC ending (which tries to justify the twist final cutscene of the core game and fails miserably) throws all of that out of the window with punishing padding and misery. I must have died to the \"Forgotten One\" 50 times, and only won thanks to checkpoints after every phase and having my health refilled to 50% after very death, or it would have been literally impossible--on Normal difficulty, by the way, and achievements dictate I play the entire game on Very Hard. I already have most of the health and energy upgrades, items are useless on bosses, and you never get \"strength\" upgrades, only combos/inputs.

To anyone looking to purchase this game with the intention of using mouse and keyboard. You can rebind the keys just fine but the mouse cursor is not confined to the screen bounds.

I did try to look for a fix online but to no avail.\n\nFor wanting to play the game I decided to switch over to game-pad. From this point on my experience changed for the better! \n\nConsidering this launched 13 years ago it holds up pretty well in 2023. Visuals are still great with some amazing backdrops and scenery. The combat and game mechanics are fantastic and the boss battles are nothing short of epic. I'm really enjoying this... like a lot!!\n\nFor the price this is an epic adventure you cannot skip! Would love to see a reboot of this series in the future.\n\nEDIT: Finished the game in about 22 hours including the 2 DLC missions. All for the price of a sandwich(on sale). Id say thats pretty good bang for buck. Although I wasn't a huge fan of the puzzles(there are fucking loads of them) for the most part this is a good game.

Its a solid hack-and-slash adventure game, with plenty of platforming and some puzzles that make it feel quite Castlevania instead of a tedious 'mash X to attack and win' sort of game.     The story line is nothing spectacular and doesn't make sense at a lot of parts, but you also get to hear Patrick Stewart more than anyone else!\n\nHowever, it has some issues.   Keeping in mind this is a game from 2013, there are still certain things that really grind my gears.\nFirst, the fact that enemy attacks connect and do damage at the START of their animation is pretty janky.   Plenty of bosses have landed killing blows on me before their attack actually makes contact with my model.   Each attack seems to have a wind-up animation, which you need to identify in order to react properly, but as soon as the actual attack animation plays, you're gonna get hit, or not.\nSecond, camera.  The camera is fixed into certain angles and placements through the environments, you dont get to control it, and so you may find yourself fighting enemies that are not actually visible on screen.  Or, in the middle of a fight, the camera transitions to a different angle and suddenly the fight is taking place in some corner, behind a wall, and you need to break off to reposition into an area with a better camera angle.      To make matters worse, the transition of moving from one camera view to the next is sometimes jarring, where the controls are quite wonky.\nThird, the checkpoint system sometimes screw you up.  Autosaves happen at various points, and they save all of your current health and ability bars.  So if you get to a checkpoint with low health, be prepared to fight your way out of the next battle with low HP, again and again and again, until you get through it.  Its a good way to master those fights, though!  Just a little frustrating when you finally reach a boss, or the second phase of a boss, and with one hit worth of HP left youre stuck loading back into that point over and over.\nFourth, Quick-time events.   A lot of them.   A sign of when this game was released, be prepared to mash input buttons at points through combat, and hit a button at the correct times during cutscenes even.  Im glad this sort of thing has been done away with, and this game reminds me WHY it was so annoying.   You just whittled a boss down, defeated him, and instead of relaxing and enjoying your victory you better be paying attention at all times, waiting for that required input during the cutscene!  Otherwise...  well, you lose and gotta restart from the most recent checkpoint!\n\n\nHowever, overall its a really solid game, well put together and a lot of fun to play, so long as you get past those gripes.

It is worth getting on sale if you are into this genre and can look past the cons listed below.\n\nPros:\n\n1) A fantastic premise and story. The lore is rich, the characters are varied. Granted, the presentation may have lost it's lustre when you compare it to modern games because it falls short technically, but if you consider the time it was made - spectacular. Heck, they even had Patrick Stewart on board as narrator/side character!\n\n2) Beautiful worlds and meticulous character design. I play a lot of whatever the current-gen AAA games of the year may be, but even I couldn't help but stop and say \"wow\" to myself when going through some of the Gothic castle ruins. I can only imagine what something like this would look like if done again now with say Unreal Engine 5.\n\n3) The boss fights in this game are a real highlight. They are varied and interesting, sometimes even taking inspiration from cult-classics like Shadow of the Colossus, God of War or Dark Souls. The final boss of the DLC especially had me fighting for my life, and gave me a glorious sense of satisfaction over a hard-fought victory.\n\nCons:\n\n1) The weakest aspect of this game is the choice they made to go with a fixed camera angle. I suppose this was done to keep the costs of production down, but it was like shooting the game in its own foot. Certain puzzle sections and hidden areas can be a proper headache to deal with due to this.\n\n2) If you are playing on normal difficulty or higher, enemies in the later half of the game tend to be mountains of health that take forever to deal with.

The worst thing on this game is it that it's hard it should be a good thing but instead that time to kill is too long I made myself die a lot of times. \nU have that game called Darksiders there was a pretty much long time to kill but it was so better so much pleasent in here enemies are not afflicted they dont limp bend lean down no they just attacking u over and over. That's why this game was hard I have wasted my time for almost 5 hours straight I decided not to play for collectibles and end up and what am I thinking now ? \n\n This game is worth playing but instead U should watch it on yt :P If ure a patient and I mean PATIENT hardcore player- I am not patient ofc. U can beat up this thing the cutscenes and all talks are cultural a fabulous comic worth the disney authorization or some shit :P The character is so nice elegant but in a fight the way the brutallity is made for finishers it's basically a brother of War from Darksiders <3. Music is nice sounds is nice I was not good enough with this powers crap but u will see what I'm talking about. \nFor me this game is worth playing but I will never get here back so for me its like 6,9/10 rate. \n\n                                                                             So don't bow down to the evil and try to make forgiveness <3\n\nEdit: Yeah actually it was worth play it again :D I have completed it on controller totally recommended but still the camera is stupid in every possible way of combat.

The protagonist isn't very deep but this was ok for me, I went in just wanting to kill monsters. The Quick Time Events (QTEs) can be a pain if you're not ready for them. if you miss it, bosses will get health back and fights can take longer. That said, these QTEs were entertaining for me to watch.\n\nWhen it comes to traversal, it can be a mixed bag. Sometimes sections of walls you can scale may not be obvious and the camera can be you worst enemy. This becomes real problem in the last few levels of the game when you deal with the final boss and by then I just wanted it to be over. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the monster killing action and the simple story, so much so that I got the sequel and will be playing that at some point.

Thinking about the music from symphony of the night and even the nintendo DS games, there just really isn't any comparison. \n- For me, the most difficult portions of the game occurred in the first 3 chapters, especially with werewolves/lycans that would block nearly every attack. Later chapters were easier...that's kinda weird.\n- Gabriel Belmont has a tiny head and grunts all the time.\n\nTrue castlevania fans might want to put this on their list to play through at some point, but it's much lower on the list than symphony of the night, dracula X, dawn of sorrow, etc.", "timestamp_created": 1667177199, "timestamp_updated": 1667177199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543014764785766602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124665675": {"recommendationid": "124665675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263858338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1667276553}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo, la banda sonora es espectacular y la acci\u00f3n muy satisfactoria los puzzles, algunos son tediosos. pero no afectan al general del juego", "timestamp_created": 1667144811, "timestamp_updated": 1667144811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124627130": {"recommendationid": "124627130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288271140", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1710, "last_played": 1667061776}, "language": "english", "review": "Bom jogo, mas [spoiler]com boss final (da dlc) muito dif\u00edcil e sem muito jeito, a n\u00e3o ser horas e horas de paci\u00eancia. \u00e9 muito diferente dos demais.

I will say though, it has a LOT of unnecesary blood, violence, crude elements and nudity in it which personally made me uncomfortable. But other than that, this game is enjoyable! It's a character action game (kinda like Bayo or DMC!) where the key to success involves timing your attacks and dodges, perfecting counters, using different subweapons, buying new moves all that fun stuff! What's really cool about LoS was how the magic system worked: you have two kinds of magic at your disposal - Light for Healing and Shadow for Attack - and managing those two ressources according to your situation was a blast!\nBesides the fun gameplay loop, I thought the music was pleasant but ultimately not catchy enough, the story somewhat stilted at times but with some quite good moments here and there - and honestly? I thought the environment design was great!! I loved exploring the areas due to the colors used, the way they looked, they just, really drew me in and fitted a modern day Castlevania game pretty well!\n\nSo yeah, I didn't hear great things about the core CV fanbase before playing this, but Lords of Shadow is actually really good in my opinion!

[/b]\n\nYou might get a bit of enjoyment out of this one if you like to mash buttons over some admittedly nice looking environments. It doesn't take long, however, for the frustrations to show - and they get steadily more grating as the game goes on. If you value your time, stay away. \n\nThis game has a giant problem with information. Too much at times, too little at others. Environments are not legible and there are invisible walls everywhere, sometimes even one-sided ones. At every turn, an ugly Arial font will appear at the top of the screen telling you exactly what to do, sometimes even coupled with slow-mo camera zooms. There is no way to turn tutorials off. When it isn't the text, side characters will yell in your ear giving you explicit instructions, including even the final bosses. When the boss is quite literally telling you how to beat him, it highlights a greater issue: this game has no concept of how to organically convey the arbitrary tasks it expects of you, so it just points a big glowing neon arrow at them and acts like that's a job well done. \n\nCombat starts out relatively strong but devolves after the unlockable combos get silly, with most of them just using two buttons in alternating press/hold/press a bunch of times sequences. Encounter design is also a mess, on top of that, with most levels just having one (or maybe two!) enemy types repeated ad nauseam. Many of the bosses don't even use the core combat systems, instead opting for giant enemies that have to be scaled and whittled down a la Shadow of the Colossus. It misses the mark by failing to understand why that game worked though, and these encounters play out more like an elongated quick-time event with Uncharted style climbing. The only tension you will feel is when you consider having to do any of it over again. These are legitimately some of the least engaging bosses I've ever faced. \n\nThe most fun I got out of the experience was listening to Patrick Stewart's narration of the awful script and picturing Captain Picard telling stories to children on the holodeck. When judged as an actual narrative, though, it falls flat once again because of the game's information problem. The story prefers to tell us what happens to the characters and what they're going through rather than showing any of it. The protagonist is supposed to be undergoing a dark downward spiral but that only really happens in the narration, he mostly just doesn't say much or do much unexpected. I also can't be expected to take it seriously when they do things like following up a supposed tragic revelation with an off-key Star Wars reference. \n\nI can count on one hand (or two, generously) how many links to the Castlevania series are present here. Not every game in a series has to be a love letter to itself, and tenuous links can sometimes be needed to break out of a stale formula. This has been proven to work, and the shake-up is often welcomed, but it doesn't work here for one reason - this game has nothing going for it.

Por ese motivo he hecho todo lo posible por acabar este Castlevania.  \n\nEl principal motivo de mi no recomendaci\u00f3n a jugarlo es que, a menos que seas muy habilidoso en los hack n slash la curva de aprendizaje est\u00e1 un poco descompensada por la poca barra de vida inicial o potencia de ataques para un nivel medio de dificultad. Esto, unido al dise\u00f1o en mini episodios y a la necesidad de repetirlos (para potenciar al personaje con combos o mejoras), no solo una, sino varias veces a lo largo del juego, hace que se te pueda atragantar.\n\nYo empec\u00e9 este juego hace mucho tiempo, y hasta el 40% lo estaba jugando casi como un casual, pero me propuse terminarlo porque estaba un poco harto.\n\nCuando comienzas el personaje principal es muy flojo, y necesitas ir avanzando y repetir fases para conseguir m\u00e1s monedas y desbloquear combos. En los mini episodios hay mejoras que solo las puedes coger con objetos de poder posteriores, con lo que esto tambi\u00e9n obliga a repetir las fases. Una manera m\u00e1s holgada de jugarlo hubiera sido poner el juego en f\u00e1cil e ir avanzando en la historia, y ya, hacia el final del juego, subir el nivel a medio y repetir las fases para conseguir las mejoras. Yo iba repitiendo a medida que ve\u00eda que pod\u00eda desbloquear o conseguir algo nuevo, o hacer un reto. Por eso un juego que si fuera lineal costar\u00eda unas 10 horas, acaba convirti\u00e9ndose en un juego de 40 o m\u00e1s por repetir y repetir.\n\nEste juego lo iba a jugar en PS3 pero lo dej\u00e9 para PC por la mejor resoluci\u00f3n. Recuerdo otros juegos del estilo como el Bayonetta, que aunque hab\u00eda momentos de dificultad grande, sobre todo los QTE, por lo menos ibas avanzando en la historia. Y luego hay otros juegos como el Darksiders que son una maravilla en la curva de la dificultad y en el gran dise\u00f1o que tienen para no darte la sensaci\u00f3n de que no haces m\u00e1s que repetir y repetir cachos de historia.\n\nPor lo dem\u00e1s las mejores fases son las que te recuerdan a los cl\u00e1sicos, las de localizaciones g\u00f3ticas y tenebrosas (abad\u00edas, pueblos en la monta\u00f1a, castillos, catacumbas), no tanto las de lugares fant\u00e1sticos o ruinas en medio de la \"selva\" o p\u00e1ramos desolados. En el apartado art\u00edstico no se le puede poner un pero y est\u00e1 todo bastante bien dise\u00f1ado. La c\u00e1mara falla a veces eso si y te puede desorientar o dificultar el combate.\n\nEn resumen, es un juego que si quieres sacarle algo de jugo has de repetir y repetir y se hace muy largo para lo que realmente ofrece de historia. Ya lo he dicho, 10 horas bien, 45 es un horror. Viendo la progresi\u00f3n de los logros de la gente se nota, porque he llegado a ver que m\u00e1s o menos un 20% de la gente no pasa de la fase 5 o 6. Y muchos logros no los consiguen ni el 5% (incluso completar los retos de fases iniciales). Habr\u00e1 gente muy h\u00e1bil con el mando que no est\u00e9 de acuerdo con mi percepci\u00f3n de la dificultad del juego pero como digo, solo hay que ver la gente que se lo ha terminado y el % de logros conseguidos.\n\nVeremos si en un futuro tengo ganas de jugar a alguna de sus continuaciones o no. Por ahora lo aparco para dentro de mucho tiempo.\n\nPD: Edito ya que me faltaba la fase XIV por acabar. El enemigo final del segundo DLC un suplicio en el \u00faltimo punto de guardado final de la batalla. Jugado con un mando con no muy buena respuesta, en nivel medio y llegando con bastante magia y vida.

And yes it still not that bad as of 2022. I could still enjoy the game. In some levels it might look a bit old. But some chapters really do look good. Like the castle and most interiors. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThe gameplay is classic God of war mixed with Devil May Cry and Darksiders. Most aspects like platforming, puzzle solution, find that item etc are similar to those games. \nI do have some negative comments about the gameplay. First of all, in some situations you'd straight up go crazy because it'll put you in such situations where you'll almost rage quit. Reason? Unnecessary gameplay situations (one good example is [spoiler] where you have to grapple and climb onto the dragon like titan and kill it. [/spoiler] THAT WAS SUPER ANNOYING. Where you'd get pissed very easily. It's connected with platforming and climbing as well. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe story is really good. If you haven't played lords of shadows 2 before this and didn't get any spoilers, you'll get to see a bunch of twists and surprising moments.\nHere's a basic summary. It'll feel a bit boring at the start. For few chapters...but when it passes, the more you play the game, the more interesting it becomes. It's because of the story. \n\nMy personal rating of this game will be 7/10 .It wouldn't even have gotten 7 if not for the story. Because there are some gameplay moments where you will get pissed very much like it doesn't make any sense to be there.If the gameplay was like Castlevania lords of shaodws 2, then it'd have gotten a solid 8.", "timestamp_created": 1664388224, "timestamp_updated": 1664412173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122955125": {"recommendationid": "122955125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004347626", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 1699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1699, "last_played": 1500555108}, "language": "english", "review": "Good hack and slay", "timestamp_created": 1664357598, "timestamp_updated": 1664357598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122904676": {"recommendationid": "122904676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066571031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1667925902}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it.

Apenas vi el trailer supe que era un Hack and Slash y no dude en jugarlo. Mi experiencia fue gratificante y he aqu\u00ed mi humilde rese\u00f1a.\nLa historia no tiene nada que ver con los otros juegos de la saga, por ese motivo no necesitaras jugar ning\u00fan juego anterior para entender la historia. \nA grandes rasgos la historia se centra en una profec\u00eda de que un guerrero destruir\u00e1 a los 3 se\u00f1ores oscuros que amenazan a la humanidad con llevarla a su fin. Dicha historia ser\u00e1 narrada capitulo a capitulo antes de empezar cada uno por un personaje secundario del cual sabremos no mucho despu\u00e9s de iniciar la aventura.\nLa trama tambi\u00e9n incluye alg\u00fan que otro giro inesperado, reflexiones del protagonista y sus respectivas revelaciones. La historia es sencilla de llevar y no requiere romperse la cabeza para entenderla.\nLos gr\u00e1ficos del juego han envejecido bien. Sin embargo, luce mejor gracias a su apartado art\u00edstico que es lo atrapa m\u00e1s al recorrer la aventura. Los \u00e1ngulos elegidos para poder apreciar paisajes y estructuras son los indicados. De cierta forma el juego desprende esa sensaci\u00f3n \u00e9pica al visitar cada lugar nuevo.\nLa m\u00fasica de este juego acompa\u00f1a muy bien las batallas, la incertidumbre de avanzar por nuevas \u00e1reas y los encuentros brutales con los jefes.\nEn el aspecto jugable es un hack and slash que premia mucho la concentraci\u00f3n al combatir enemigos, ya que al mantener el ritmo de las batallas saliendo ileso ya sea esquivando o bloqueando correctamente recibir\u00e1s energ\u00eda que podr\u00e1s distribuir en 2 diferentes tipos de magia: Azul para recuperar vida y roja para amplificar el da\u00f1o, as\u00ed de simple. Dependiendo de la situaci\u00f3n habr\u00e1 que decidir que tipo de magia utilizar o de ser necesario ambas en conjunto para sacar ventaja en cada pelea. Como en todo juego de este tipo se cuenta con una lista de combos los cuales podr\u00e1s adquirir compr\u00e1ndolos con puntos de experiencia que conseguir\u00e1s a lo largo de la aventura. Por otro lado, se dispone de armas secundarias que tambi\u00e9n se pueden utilizar en combinaci\u00f3n con las magias, y por ultimo, se dispone de 4 tipos de objetos gastables que podremos utilizar. Algunos de estos objetos hacen mas da\u00f1o a enemigos espec\u00edficos por lo que habr\u00e1 que utilizarlos siempre que podamos. Todos estos elementos combinados o por separado har\u00e1n batallas distintas haciendo que el juego sea variable.\nUna de las cosas que mas me ha gustado de este juego es la gran diversidad de enemigos, cada uno con diferentes tipos de ataque y movimientos. Los dise\u00f1os de algunos de ellos son muy buenos y es divertido enfrentarlos. Solo por mencionar a algunos: Licantropo mayor, vampiros, trolls, espadachines, duendes, ara\u00f1as gigantes, guerreros esqueleto, entre muchos otros mas.\nLos jefes finales son intimidantes en primera instancia, 3 de ellos requerir\u00e1n ser escalados para ser destruidos. Una mec\u00e1nica ya antes vista en otro juego: Shadow of the Colossus.\nAparte de ello, se cuenta con acertijos. Los tenemos desde muy b\u00e1sicos hasta algunos complejos. Hay la opci\u00f3n de poder pasarlos por alto desbloqueando la soluci\u00f3n. Si eres de los que gusta de este tipo de mec\u00e1nicas te recomiendo que intentes descifrarlos por ti mismo.\nLa aventura tambi\u00e9n implica mejorar las armas del protagonista, para ello ser\u00e1 necesario explorar bien los escenarios y encontrar fragmentos de mejora tanto para los medidores de magia como de salud y capacidad para objetos. Sugiero hacerlo de primeras para llegar mas c\u00f3modo a las instancias finales del juego.\nEste juego cuenta con varias cinem\u00e1ticas, algunas como introducci\u00f3n para un enemigo, otras para hablar un poco mas de los personajes secundarios, etc.\nPara complementar el juego tenemos los retos que hacen rejugable cada capitulo. Una serie de desaf\u00edos que deber\u00e1s cumplir con ciertas condiciones que har\u00e1n el juego mas interesante.\nPor ultimo, tenemos los 2 cap\u00edtulos extra que vienen con el DLC. Los cuales son muy importantes para entender el nexo que tiene este juego con su secuela. \nAqu\u00ed encontrar\u00e1s al enemigo mas dif\u00edcil de enfrentar de todo el juego. Podr\u00eda decir incluso que la dificultad es equiparable a enfrentar un jefe tipo soulslike. Personalmente fue un desaf\u00edo vencerlo y sobre todo en la dificultad mas alta. Derrotarlo despues de varios intentos fue muy gratificante.\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, Castlevania: Lord of Shadows es un hack and Slash con muchos elementos de varios tipos de juego que hacen una mezcla divertida. \nEs casi inevitable pensar en los antiguos God of War al combatir con los enemigos, sobretodo por el gran parecido de las armas de los protagonistas en ambos juegos. \nSin embargo, ambos juegos tienen ritmos diferentes.\nLord of Shadows es mas pausado. \nSe toma un break invitando al jugador a contemplar los paisajes o grandes estructuras, resolver alg\u00fan que otro acertijo o invitando a la exploraci\u00f3n para ser recompensado. \nPrecisamente por ese detalle me parece un buen Hack and Slash para empezar en el genero, ya que a parte de tomarse sus pausas, tiene una dificultad que se incrementa lentamente conforme avanzamos en la aventura. Eso lo podr\u00e1s confirmar tu mismo si llegas hasta el final, y con eso me refiero al final del dlc. Ver\u00e1s la gran diferencia de dificultad. Si sigues bien las indicaciones con cada tutorial que aparecer\u00e1 no deber\u00edas tener problemas para progresar en el juego.\nEL juego tiene mucho contenido y explotarlo al maximo me tomo 60 horas. Sin embargo, creo que se puede completarlo en menos de 50 horas.\nSi todav\u00eda no has jugado ning\u00fan Hack and Slash, mi recomendaci\u00f3n es que empieces por este, ya que me parece el mejor para entrar al genero.

But half way I had to change due to the aforementioned fact of the controls that were making the game more difficult than it already is. Furthermore the controls themselves are bad as well. Jumps are mid to badly controlled in mid air, dodges and blocks can't be more badly implemented with the timing for the blocks being actually terrible as when you think he is making an attack the game registers it as not attacking for even though the animations tells you otherwise. Parkour (yes there is parkour in this game for some damned reason) is mid to good actually. With some good little ideas implemented but not that much. Puzzles are mid tier. Not hard not easy. But they got that one problem where you don't understand what is going on. A specific puzzle is that you need to ground slam some tiles for a gate to open and the hint that the game gives is so cryptic that the first thing that comes to mind is completely different from what you need to do. Battles and combat are also mid tier. Some are amazing some are outright terrible. And the one thing I can say here is that you will rarely use the AoE attacks. It is so damned awful that you would be better off with the normal attack than that due to the damage output. Finally the control inputs were specifically terrible. Like mentioned the blocks and so on are bad, but due to 2 facts the game gets even worse. First there are QTEs (Quick Time Events) which doesn't help the game at all, and second the QTEs are also random buttons. You would have expect the Character is struggling for an attack you would press the attack button, but nope, it can be from the actual attack button to the jump button for some reason. Do not bother with this game.

Boy i put this down in less than half an hour and genuinely dont want to touch it again. The combat is fine but the amount of jank that comes with it is very annoying. Gabriel moves around very awkwardly and it feels like you're controlling a robot, combos dont feel exciting to execute and the base controls are a mess. This game dosent feel like Castlevania, the main character, Gabriel, said about 2 lines in the almost half hour i played and seemed like a boring character. But the second mission, the horseback battle, is what did it for me. It controls so fucking horribly and it expects you to have basically mastered all the mechanics by now. It just gives you a small prompt at the beginning vaguely describing the controls, then thrusts you in and i had no idea what i was doing, i was playing this on the \"medium\" difficulty (knight) and already enemies just felt like fucking sponges, the bear like enemy that was the boss of the first encounter just sponged so many hits and once you get it down low enough it begins a \"\"\"cinematic\"\"\" interactive sequence that HAS to be ended with a \"quicktime event\" that is thrown out of nowhere and has like a time window of 5 or so seconds. And since this game's default controls are so ass you have to stop and scan your keyboard for the button, but by then you missed the time frame and the bear is back up to like 60% health. And it will NOT DIE until you do the sequence. I know this game was made around the late 2000s / early 2010s but this games visuals are really on the low end and the design of the game is horrible. The game looks almost cartoony in a way, and the enemies were so boring it just felt like generic fantasy enemies and shit you'd find in WoW. I'm not amused by this game and im frankly disappointed.

I played Symphony of the Night for the PS1 and all the titles released for the PS2, the GBA and the Nintendo DS. Excluding those made for the PS2, all of these games shared a number of characteristics. They were all 2D RPG-lite platformers with maps composed of interconnected areas which the player could explore to advance the game and find secrets, itens and equipment. Lords of Shadow is an evident deviation from this model, designed to be a 3D hack n' slash action-adventure title not dissimilar to the original God of War. At first, while this change could disappoint die-hard fans of the metroidvania iterations of the series, it didn't mean this game would necessarily fail to become a worthwhile addition to the other genre. Its developers had the right to try out a new approach and make something different -- that's fine by me. However, in my opinion, LoS presents many design decisions that made my experience playing it quite unpleasant, and so I cannot recommend it. Let's see.\n\nFirst, a summary. As a hack n' slash title, Lords of Shadow revolves around combat. The player has access to a chain whip weapon that serves as the primary means of dealing damage. Four secondary armaments can also be used to dispatch or distract enemies, and two magic pools allow Gabriel, the protagonist, to heal his wounds or increase his damage potential with the whip. Certain pieces of equipment with special purposes will be looted over the course of the game from specific bosses or chests. Experience points are acquired by killing foes and solving puzzles that show up in certain levels, and these points may be allocated for the acquisition of whip combos and special abilities. A number of collectibles can be found in most levels to increase the size of the health bar and the mana pools. Since action is the focus here, exploration falls on the sidelines. Pretty standard fare for the genre, I suppose.\n\nNow, the issues. The camera in this game is, simply put, obnoxious. You can't move it anyhow. Yes, it works to present some breathtaking vistas and cinematic takes, but it frequently hampers combat and platforming with cumbersome angles and distant zooms. Sometimes it's hard to see what's happening because everything is far away, and keeping track of all enemies on the screen is problematic. It is not convenient, I'm afraid.\n\nA major aspect of this game is climbing and platforming. The player will be forced to climb a lot of cliffs and structures, and the task becomes quite repetitive. All levels are entirely linear, so these paths are unavoidable in order to proceed. Certain areas will also require precise jumping. This is a problem since the jumping and aerial mechanics in LoS are not precise, at all. I lost count of the number of times I died in a precipice because the controls were cumbersome, or when Gabriel refused to scale a wall in a certain way. Navigating through these vertical segments was a bothersome slog.\n\nI despise quick time events, and this game is full of them. Most bosses will prompt the execution of these commands, and performing finishing moves on ordinary foes will also require pressing a button at specific times during a locked sequence. This was annoying because I felt that most bigger enemies were bullet sponges in LoS. The secondary weapons are only useful against particular creatures and the whip seems quite weak against large foes. You'll have to swing it at them multiple times before getting the prompt to start the fatality sequence. Most combos and special abilities are either ineffective or impractical given the enemies' general resistance to stun effects, so expect to resort to a select group of combat moves and get ready to perform lots of individual executions. Sure, shadow magic can speed things up, but good luck maintaining its mana pool full on the hardest difficulty settings.\n\nThe majority of bosses were alright, I must say. There is a respectable variety of big guys and they all present a reasonable challenge, especially on the hardest difficulties. Exceptions to this standard are the titanic creatures, which are basically extended climbing and puzzle segments. I did not like the trudge of scaling them, frankly. I also need to complain about the final boss of the DLC content, a guy named The Forgotten One. I'm convinced the developers missed the mark with this one. As I said before, the aerial mechanics in LoS are cumbersome and imprecise at best. Given that this fella is rather tall, you have to use air attacks to hit his head during the final stage of the battle. Since the game doesn't have a target-locking feature... well, you can imagine the situation. This part became a nightmare on Paladin difficulty for the wrong reason.\n\nLords of Shadow looks beautiful, even for a game released in 2010. The amount of different locations and the richness of detail and colors in each one of them ensured that I wasn't bored by any drab areas. Many distinct creatures are found in the game and they all have interesting designs, in my opinion. I enjoyed looking at the elaborate architecture of castles and monumental structures, which, together with imponent natural landscapes, helped create a unique dark fantasy world. It's talented artistry, really. This is all accompanied by a nice soundtrack that has a bunch of inspiring songs which I had to add to my personal list of OSTs.\n\nAs for the story, well, we can't really expect to see Shakespearean dramas in videogames. The voice acting by Robert Carlyle, Patrick Stewart and others is well done, I guess. The protagonist goes on a quest to kill some evil dudes and revive his dead wife by assembling a magical mask. A bunch of twists happen along the way and Gabriel ends up becoming this iconic character. Standard fantasy stuff, nothing remarkable nor insulting here.\n\nTo end my text, completionists beware. This game has a bunch of achievements that will make you suffer. It took me 50 hours of replays and repeating deaths to unlock everything. Get ready for a challenge indeed.

Absolutely not for $30.\n\nI knew nothing of Castlevania. I bought because I thought it would be some kind of hack and slash similar to God of War/Dante's Inferno style combat with vampires. I didn't get that at all.\n\nThe combat itself is unfortunately the biggest downfall. In GoW/DI, you can hitstun and juggle enemies waaay more smoothly and better, allowing for those big meaty combo ending finishers that just feel good. In this game, you can be knocked out of the air by ground attacks and there's no juggling/hit stunning enemies for any big ending combos. You're always getting interrupted, and enemy telegraphs are NOT very good. Some are, most are not especially with lighting/distance. It's not a matter of just \"get good\" I beat the game on the second hardest which most don't even finish it, its just not very fun. Boss telegraphs are very good. Area attacks are basically completely useless. You'd think you'd have some invulnerability during magic use but nope. Just everything about the combat is designed so weirdly and not in a good way either.\n\nThe quick time events could have been so much more entertaining and engaging.. but they decided to simplify it to any button press and it's super boring. Glowing finishers could've been a million times better.\n\nThe story is sooo boring for about the first 3 hours. The pacing is REALLY bad, but it was enough to keep me going for the rest of it because I enjoy hack and slash combat even though this one was a bit bad.\n\nThings this game absolutely nails: platforming, soundtrack, visuals, enemy variety and bosses. The puzzles are actually fun and engaging, some even challenging. Visually appealing and voice acting and the bosses are THE most fun parts of the game. Enemy variety is actually huge and that is awesome. Platforming is very creative, sometimes boring but I didn't mind those sections at all. I minded the boring combat more than the platforming and climbing. The soundtrack, some songs, are excellent. Some are really annoying, sadly.\n\nIt's an absolute shame they didn't expand upon the things that made GoW/DI good, this could have been an incredible experience. Hopefully they learned their lessons and put them into the Lords of Shadow 2 which I'm about to go through.\n\nThe best moments in the game by far were the bosses. Getting through the first 3 to 4 chapters was so unbelievably boring I'm surprised I even made it through. \n\nWould recommend on sale when it's like $8.

It's pretty awesome whether you want to bang your head against a wall in some hardcore arcade goodness, or play on an easier difficulties which you help you out with health regain on retry and taking less damage. It's fun for people who like a great balance of combat, puzzles, and platforming. The game doesn't start feeling a little weird in quality until the DLC levels which is chapter 13  and 14.

Puzzles don't add much to the game but the platforming does, but it can be hard to know where to go and the camera angles are horrible. \n- Replayability: There's a good amount, you only unlock paladin difficulty after completing the game once, there are tons of collectables and trials after each level is completed. \n\nOverall, it is a fun game, it does have a few problems, but if you're able to overcome them, you will enjoy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1647295668, "timestamp_updated": 1647295879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112044447": {"recommendationid": "112044447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065366726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 986, "last_played": 1647092863}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es m\u00e1s un reboot que reinterpreta radicalmente la saga que un juego de la linea temporal de Castlevania, y adopta un estilo a lo God of War o Dante's Inferno que se aleja totalmente del metroidvania cl\u00e1sico pero aun as\u00ed es bastante digno de su nombre.\n\nEl juego tiene sus a\u00f1os y se qued\u00f3 algo desfasado en lo t\u00e9cnico, pero es l\u00f3gico tras dos generaciones.

But not because it is fun, but because it was an important birthday present. And the path to do so was a very annoying one, which I can not recommend anyone else to struggle through:\n\nCons:\n-Lack of monster variety:\nCastlevania was always known for the plathora of different monsters and creatures. But here you get werewolves, small werevolves, big werevolves, werevolve-mounts and werevolves riding other werevolves. And this is the entire first chapter. Later there are a few more monsters, but do not expect anything even close to a typical Castlevania-feeling.\n-Extremely linear gameplay:\nAlmost the entire game you have one single path that you can walk. one single way to climb a wall, one single direction to take. And if something actually changes at the same location and the path is blocked then once again you get only one single solution thrown at you. There are a few exceptions in terms of revisiting places, but the overal gameplay is a single string that you follow without valuing explorations. The only revisiting means that the game gives you are single sideweapon upgrade chests that require very specific later abilities. Do not expect any new pathes though: it is just a later ability unlocking a single room in an earlier level.\n-Level 2 uses a riding mechanic that is NEVER used again:\nSweep Y to attack enemy riders, slash X to attack enemies mounts hold a combination of buttons in the correct moment to dodge rams. And then throw everything out of the window after doing so, since this mechanic does absolutelly never appear again in the entire game. Don't bother even learning...\n-Your first Sub weapon, the knife, is the only one that can be upgraded with an additional ability:\nYou get a total of 4 subweapons, where the knife is the one you get at the very first level. It can instantly be upgraded with a holding technique, allowing you to throw 5 at once. Is this a preview of all the other subweapons that you can upgrade and master? No, this is the very only one. They didn't bother about anything else. They just want to give the impression.\n-The last 2 chapters use layout scetches for animated scenes:\nThe last 2 chapters didn't even bother using cinematics and went with the scatches instead of having actually proper cutscenes.\n-Corpses of the same order are scattered everywhere, even if it doesn't make sense:\nSo you are on a mission from the order. Of course you are not the only one. But there are even members' corpses at places where they could not have physically reached! Like one for example is bayond a monster-infested lake, that requires water-walking, behind a few obstrure mechanism and the note is clearly telling that he was around far after the great evil took over the place. Other are bayond places that took the main character a great sacrifice to get past. And bayond this are a huge amount of order corpses that appear to could have easily passed this without needing any strength at al.\n-Very disconnecting character lore:\nIn the first chapter you have internal dialogue scenes, dreams and get to learn about the character's reasoning at that moment. This continues at some occasions in chapter 2, but afterwards is just dropped. Almost the entire story is told by a 3rd person assuming the main character's reasoning and thoughts. Do we see that reasoning actually anywhere reflected at all after chapter 2? Nope. If you have a main character struggle with evil feelings, then add it in a cutscene. If he is sleep-deprived, then let him make a comment about it or something. But the main char doesnt look any different in chapter 12 than in chapter 3! And you wont get anything aside some third-party comments or some cringe order notes about that corpse itself that can assume anything about the main char that you play.\n-Horrible camera:\nThis is a 3D game. A 3D game with objects and scenery all around you. Does the game actually allow you to have a look around? No. Aside from cinematics ofc. In fact, the right stick on the controller is completelly useless aside from that press-in-button (R3) in order to collect shadow energy. And often enough you can dies or miss things because you can't look around. It would greatly help emersion, if you can actually look at the scenery that visibly had a lot of efford put into... And during fights you really better hope that the camera is where you need it to be or you get sniped by some offscreen attacks, which becomes exspecially annoying if that offscreen attack comes from the last boss of the game.\n-Literally each single riddle gives you the solution in corpse-form:\nIt even states ,,show solution\". But most of the ,riddles\" are these things that you are doing right now anyways. But just in case, you get that solution, if you did not think about continue going a straight path further.\n-Too many arrows point at the ,,surprise\" at the 3rd last chapter:\nBy the time you get there, it is not really a surprise anymore. But hey, your character is at least very surprised. Luckily it isn't something that you as player knew since chapter 2 or anything :P (sarcasm)\n-Deleting your existing save stat is not supported by the game:\nIf you want to start over from scratch, the game does not allow you. Everything runs on a single save stat and while you may replay a level, you can not fully restart from zero. Even deleting your save files on pc will just leave them undone by steam's cloud function. In order to really start over, you have to not only delete your files on your pc, you also have to go into offline mode and finish the first level to bypass steam's restoration whenever it goes online again. This is not a function that should require such a tedious workaround! Even Castlevania-games for Gameboy from before 2000 have the function to start over, copy and paste save stats!\n-You can never deactivate a learned combo or ability:\nThis game only relies on combos and a series of button inputs. While I am not a fan of that, others may like it. However, the issue here is that you can not disable or deactivate a certain ability. So for example, there is one move where you have to press X in the air, then hold down X while still in the air. Another move needs you to hold down X as first option while in the air. So both moves need an X-input and at the moment you learned a move, it will always perform the wrong move if you accidentally held down X for the wrong amount of time. In this case you are better off, just not have learned that skill in first place, if you do not want to use this move. But since the game does not support multiple save stats, you would need to either work around by messing with steam's cloud service or need to memorize a full list of things of what not to press in the heat of a fight.\n-Many moves take too much time to execute:\nThis is a game with an active combat and stuff does not wait for you to finish a combo; they just attack and interrupt you. While it is nice to have some strong moves at your disposal, these are almost never used, if they take over 4 seconds to be executed. 4 whole seconds where an enemy that is beeing attacked is not allowed to actually decide to punch you for doing so.\n\nThis game has some pros, too though:\n-Beautiful graphics:\nScenery looks nice, water reflections in the first scene are dope and each single level has a lot of details and graphical planning flown into it. It is just a shame that you can't zoom in or move the camera around on your own.\n-Hidden stuff:\nIt may only be another order's corpse in most cases, but these appear everywhere. And a lot of them carry stones for increasing your health or MP. So exploring a bit to the left or right to find more corpses is worth a look. There are no alternate routes though.\n-Chess-like minniegame:\nAt a certain point, you get to unlock a chess-like board game in the main menue.\n-2nd playable character\nEven only in 2nd last chapter...\n\nUltimatelly, this game is only using the ,,Castlevania\" franchise...", "timestamp_created": 1645599810, "timestamp_updated": 1645599810, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110784330": {"recommendationid": "110784330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198823706899", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1360, "last_played": 1663221132}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Siempre he sido fan de la saga Castlevania\n\ncreo que esta reimaginacion de la historia si le llega a los hombros a la franquicia original\nme gusta mucho el personaje principal y como se va desarrollando la historia en cada capitulo\nun 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1645555834, "timestamp_updated": 1645555834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110677573": {"recommendationid": "110677573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398538105", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1645308864}, "language": "english", "review": "A trilogy starting out strong. This is the first game in what would become a trilogy in the well established Castlevania series. This game had quite the hatebase when it came out due to it being such a huge departure from the previous entries in the series. As a fan of the old castlevanias, I still love this attempt at a different take on the series. \n\nLords of Shadow stars Gabriel Belmont, a monster hunter and member of the brotherhood. The brotherhood's sole purpose is to hunt the monsters of the land and keep the people of the world safe. It's a time of death and darkness, and the world is looking grim. We follow Gabriel on his mission from the brotherhood to find out what is causing all this stuff and sort it out. This mostly boils down to finding the three titular Lords of Shadow and slaying them for the good of the human race. The story telling here is pretty good. It's a mix of in game cut-scenes, a bit of CGI, and most of it being done in talks between characters during game-play. This story heavy approach to Castlevania is pretty new to the series and honestly I think it paid off well. The story isn't the absolute best thing in the world here, but It's definitely no slouch either.\n\nMercury Steam's take on God of War, with a little Uncharted and Shadow of the Colossus thrown in for good measure. Basically, the game consists of you fighting monsters, running around the levels figuring out how to progress through the games' many puzzles, and somewhere in-between all this you will have some uncharted-esque climbing sections in it. The combat, while a tad simplistic, had enough variety and flare to it to keep me interested and engaged the whole way through the game. As you progress in the game you acquire new moves, such as a parry system, and also as you battle you earn combat experience, which allows you to buy new combos and upgrade existing ones. This helps greatly in keeping the game fresh and having you eager to check out the new moves you just unlocked. The puzzles in this game are a mixed bag though. Some of them are pretty good. Good meaning you need to use at least a portion of your brain to figure out the solution. Some of them are incredibly simple and barely could be called Puzzles though. One example of this is lighting up plaques with your magic. You basically just touch the plaques and it's a simple case of trial and error to figure out what color goes where. Thankfully though i'd say this type of puzzle is easily in the minority here.\n\nNow, let's talk about the music in this game. The tracks in this game are absolutely beautiful and possibly carry some parts of the game on it's back. while playing this title there were quite a few times where I just stopped and admired the music. Every single area of this game has the perfect music choice to fit it. The emotional impact these more somber songs are trying to convey gets through clearly. and bumps the game quality up quite a bit. Hats off to \u00d3scar Araujo for his work on this game. He definitely deserves more praise, and more gigs.\n\nThe graphics and art style of this game are stunning as well. As we follow Gabriel on his quest we see vibrant forests, murky bogs, and gothic architecture that would make any fan of the aesthetic happy. The art style they went for works so well for the tone of the game, and anything more cartoony would have really hampered the feeling they were going for with this game. Just like the music, there were quite a few moments where I would stop and just take in the scenery in front of me. It's a testament to their developers that they were able to pull of such graphics with the hardware of the time.\n\nIn summary, this is a great game that has been maligned for over a decade now by people who wrote it off at first glance and never gave it a fair shake. If anything in this review sounds good to you, or you have seen stuff covering this game and think it looks cool, try it out.

It's not even a metroidvania ffs. Slow boring parkour, QTE's (with fucking button mashes), boss that you need to escalate to hit a weak point.\n\nBut the worst part, is that it doesn't respect your time. Oh you opened a door? Cool, 15 seconds unskipabble  animation of the door opening. Oh you changed a part in the puzzle? Great! Another 15 seconds of unskipabble animation. That permeates the whole game I can GUARANTEE YOU that it would be 2 hours smaller without this garbage.\n\nSo with all that said why is the game a recommended?

Discovering strategies to beat certain enemies is at times fun, but most of the time you're just learning by failure since enemy weak points aren't at all obvious. The camera is another problem - the fixed perspective means you'll often miss paths of exploration, or required jumps from forced camera angles make them needlessly difficult. If you can overlook these annoyances, you'll have a great time with the game. The story, music, and atmosphere really shine.

I am currently fighting the 2nd titan (the hot one), and I haven't gone back to find missing items and weapon upgrades yet. (I might do it at some point of the game, but I don't bother right now).\n\nOkay, so I want to explain why I am giving the game Super Positive Vote. \nIt's not because of KONAMI. I love them and hate them at the same time as developers. On one side, they have truly amazing games like: \"Silent Hill 1,2,3, origins and shattered memories\" \"MGS\" not into football but \"PES\" is pretty nice too, \"Castlevania ofc\".  For these I love them.\nBut they also ruined the SH series. The games which I loved even more than Resident Evil. They kind of ruined MGS... I mean, they are basically laughing at their fans and spitting in their faces (our faces). Let's not mention the almost unplayable port of SH Homecoming (which I played on ps3 and it was smooth af + nice graphics).\n\nI see that a lot of people hate Castlevania: \"Lords of Shadows 1\" because of the fixed camera and because it's less Castlevanian than other games of the series... and when they don't exactly know what else to say... they just say it's GOW copy :D I am a huge: \"GOW\" \"Darksiders\" and \"DMC\" fan. I played a lot of them (cross-platform). They are all with very similar gameplay, yet amazing games. This one is as good as them. Yes, it has a more GOW vibe than Castlevania. Yes, the vampires aren't the only villains in the game. There are also werewolves. Yes, there are titans and other mythical and faerie creatures... so wtf is your problem omg??? \nThe graphics are amazing for 2010. The port is awesome. The gameplay is smooth. (better played with controller tho). The music is nice. The characters are AsToNiShInG, InTeReStInG, and amazing. The game looks huge. The story is solid. The voice acting is the best. \nThe 2nd game is with an unlocked camera and a lot of people prefer it... but that one isn't bad. Don't let others to tell you if you will like it or not.

Lords of Shadow introduces absolutely nothing new, interesting, or innovative to the genre, but rather borrows sloppily from its predecessors while trying to shoehorn in elements from other genres.\n\n[h1]Combat is Not Fun[/h1]\n\nA tell sign of bland combat is a game introducing new mechanics at every turn. The developers acknowledge the stale combat by introducing new powers and abilities that would be better left streamlined. By the end of chapter 3, which takes somewhere around 5 hours, you have:\n-Main weapon\n-Light Magic\n-Shadow Magic\n-Daggers\n-Fairies\n-Dark Crystal\n-Gauntlet\n-Boots\n\nThis sounds great, but none of these flow together in a way you would expect or want from a character action game. Aside from the [i]very[/i] odd button mapping choices (like not having a dedicated dodge button, or LT being extremely over mapped), using anything other than your main weapon in combat is being ineffective and impractical. Need to switch secondary weapons? You need to take your thumb off of the left stick, immobilizing yourself, to use the D-pad to switch. You will be fighting bad controls and bad design just as much as you will be monsters. It sucks.\n\nSpeaking of monsters, expect nothing really new or interesting here either. Enemies come in the form of small, medium and large, with the only difference being how many hits it will take to kill then. Doesn't matter if they're werewolves, goblins, trolls, vampires - they are all the same. It is boring from the very start. Boss battles range from bigger enemies to rip-offs of Shadow of the Colossus, the ladder of which will test only your patience.\n\n[h1]The Platforming is Bad[/h1]\n\nThe other side of this game is platforming. In general, it's extremely unresponsive. Gabriel will fail to grab ledges for no reason. The rules of using the whip to navigate change on a case-by-base basis. Sometimes you need to release from swinging, sometimes it's automatic. Sometimes you need to Press A/X to jump down, sometimes you don't. When you can't reliably predict how your character will behave in ostensibly the same situation, then platforming becomes a chore. It's just not fun. \n\nPaths will also branch and be sealed off, making exploration more of an anxiety inducing trip than any amount of fun. You can return to any level at any time, but I never found myself wanting to revisit any level. It felt like more of an opportunity for punishment rather than to get something I might have missed.\n\n[h1]Story is Bad[/h1]\n\nRather than letting the story unfold throughout the game, Patrick Stewart gives you a narrative between each level. You can find scrolls from fallen knights that tell you things you already know. They don't add anything to the story or atmosphere. Characters just come in and out, or die having never been developed, and we are somehow supposed to give a shit. Having a famous actor reading lines doesn't fix a bad narrative.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nGame is bad. Play anything else. Music is okay. Environments look nice.

Sure there is a twist at the end but ends up being overshadowed by some dumb plot decisions. \nLastly, It just feels that nothing has weight, even when they tried, which left me feeling quite uninterested with most of everything by the end.\n\nFinal ratings:\n\nStory: 5/10\ncharacters: 4/10\nSound: 6.5/10\nGraphics/visual style: 7/10\ngameplay: 6.5/10\nWorld: 7", "timestamp_created": 1636385841, "timestamp_updated": 1636385999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523825287818908691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102427927": {"recommendationid": "102427927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025137198", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1636351708}, "language": "english", "review": "There are some definite things to like about this game, but at a little under 6 hours in...I just couldn't take it anymore.\nThe idea sounds great: A 'God of War'-esque game in the Castlevania universe, but:\nThe camera is very rough, as many point out -- but not horrible. \nThe combat...very repetitive, including the enemies themselves. Since so much of the game is 'this', that's a tough pill to swallow.\nThe controls are, well -- \"meh\". Not good, but not bad. The camera makes them feel worse than they are. You WILL die often for your character doing things you aren't intending him to do, though. \nThe boss fights? Pretty horrible...this was one of the last straws for me before checking out. \nFor all of this, I just couldn't continue. \n\nI *DID*, however, skim through a play-through on YouTube -- and it did bum me out that the core mechanics weren't \"there\" a bit more for me, as there were some great sights and set pieces to experience. \nThat being said...having viewed it: I'm glad I didn't continue. Gameplay-wise, my opinion wasn't going to change.  \n\nI WILL happily say though: the art direction is wonderful, and the settings in-line with my preferences. The music is great as well (though for me not nearly as good as \"classic Castlevania\" games). \n\nI got this on sale at around $7.50, and considering I got almost 6 hours of entertainment based on where I called it quits: I'm happy enough with my purchase.

The music is amazing... as ambient tracks in Skyrim. It constantly gives off the feeling that they are not created with the scene in mind. The tracks are beautifully composed, but they lack any motif that reinforce the atmosphere of the levels players are in. Forest, bog, vampire castle, hell all play thematically indistinguishiable music which made those levels more generic. \nThe combat is solid at its core but mauled by many, many of this game's design shortcomings. The lack of lock on is not an issue thanks to the wide range of Gaberial's whip and easiness of telling where the enemies are due to the fixed camera perspective which always stays high above the battlefield during combat, but some enemies are absolutely painful to deal with. For example, the skeleton warriors give me immesurable dread on any difficulties above Warrior when they come in hordes. They are in white (obviously) and love to spam unblockable attacks whether they are nearby or across the battlefield. Unfortunately, when they stay close to each other, it's very likely that the enemy in the foreground to the camera will obscure their buddies behind them. So, when the latter is about to use unblockable attacks, it's really hard to see their white flashes(also because they are white) and react. Sure, there is also an audio cue, but a lot of times they charge unblockable at the same time, so who knows which one is making the audio cue!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOnce again I wish there is an indifference option in Steam review. This game has amazing artistry and production put into it but just feels off when playing it, as if it is a beta build that has content ready but haven't sort out the balancing and fine tuning. Sometimes it's a perfectly enjoyable beat em up, and the next moment you are faced with multiple enemies with long health bar and barely telegraphed unblockable attacks. Sometimes it's a handholding to a fault platformer, and the next moment you go from scratching to banging your head trying to figure out where to go next without looking up a guide.\n\nThis game's Steam achievement is very telling: more than 50% of players who own the game beat the first chapter. But only 30% of people beat the next chapter, and with each subsequent chapter we see a roughly 2% completion rate drop off.

I'm going to give it a thumbs up with a warning. I did enjoy most of it more than I hated it so it's more neutral, leaning slightly to positive. Let me start with the base game which is the first 12 chapters. The gameplay is pretty solid. It's fun and satisfying taking on either single large enemies or groups of smaller enemies. The controls feel a bit iffy when jumping but when you're on the ground, it's smooth and responsive. The combat is absolutely where the game shines. If the game was more of a hack and slash game, I would give it more praise but there are too many weird problems this game had that I feel like was just poor decision making.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game has one of the worst camera systems I've seen in a game. As a result, platforming can become a complete mess. In fact, in addition to awkward cameras, the jumping mechanics are just plain bad. You'll get frustrated in areas with no enemies far more often than areas with enemies because you'll constantly find yourself having to reset some areas due to bad controls. Furthermore, sometimes the checkpoints in those areas are frustratingly bad. You can take your time and carefully work your way through a weird platforming area just to miss a jump late in the sequence due to an awkwardly timed camera change only to be reset back to the beginning of the platforming section. There are also a good amount of puzzles in the game. I didn't think they were bad but they weren't particularly great either. They mostly just felt out of place to be honest.\n\nThere are also three bosses for some reason that have you constantly climbing them and it's more of a platforming boss than an action boss. They just felt really tedious as you figure out the route to take and weren't very fun. The standard bosses, which there are a lot more of, are a lot more fun and the kind of action you expect from the game. Other than the three awkward platforming bosses, I thought all the bosses were a lot of fun.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Ultimate Edition though is the DLC. The DLC in this game is quite possibly the worst DLC I've ever seen in a game. There are two chapters. The first chapter is almost all awkward platforming and puzzle solving. It just felt more like a chore. The second chapter in the DLC is basically one big boss fight and it's probably the most frustrating, unfair boss I've ever encountered in any game. You'll fight it twice. The first fight is fine and pretty fun. The issue is the second fight. The boss' hit box is high up so you have to jump to hit him. The problem with that is there's no sense of height at all. Sometimes you'll jump and attack too high or too low and you won't know why because the camera gets really awkward in tight. It's only an issue in the last boss of the DLC, not any of the other bosses. You have to get in tight to attack it, you have to be in the air, and the controls in the air are really awkward, it's just a recipe for disaster. You'll often find yourself where you stop attacking but the game wants to continue your mid air combo and even though you stopped attacking a whole second ago, it keeps going and you can't get away. It has a lot of AoE attacks too so you have to be able to get away quickly.\n\nThe story overall is really enjoyable. I thought it was a lot of fun all the way through. The story for the DLC was pretty interesting too but for some reason they went away from in game cutscenes to the cutscenes being drawings and it felt really half-assed.\n\nOverall, if you're interested in a hack and slash game or like the Castlevania game, I would say give it a go for the base game and skip the DLC entirely. Considering the age of the game, I would also recommend waiting for a sale. Give it a shot and see how you like the camera. The camera isn't too bad for most of the combat but it gets really frustrating for the platforming which is a fairly large portion of the game. If you don't like the camera, refund it and don't look back because it's not going to get any better. If you're fine with it and enjoy the combat, play through the base game and enjoy the combat/story. Again, just make sure to skip what is probably the worst DLC I've played.", "timestamp_created": 1635011661, "timestamp_updated": 1635011661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683250069618225098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101417476": {"recommendationid": "101417476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066578993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1634868543}, "language": "english", "review": "Shit sucks", "timestamp_created": 1634868623, "timestamp_updated": 1634868623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.38147968053817749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101368590": {"recommendationid": "101368590", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997710472", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1060, "last_played": 1634706146}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a strange game. I'd recommend it, but with several pretty big caveats. If you're coming to this as a Castlevania fan, I think you need to temper your expectations of what you'll find here. This is very much a character action game in the vein (ha!) of the PS2/PS3 God of War games, with a setting that is sometimes reminiscent of the classic Castlevanias, but more often recalls the Lord of the Rings movies or Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. This isn't bad at all, it's just different! In terms of story, the setup is really good and the production values are great (it still looks beautiful in 2021, and the voice actors are really solid), but it's in service of a pretty weak narrative that struggles mightily to justify it's connection to the Castlevania series and never quite gets there. That said? It's fun to play from start to finish, with a very fleshed-out combat system, interesting levels with lots of secrets to find, and a load of one-off gimmicks and puzzles throughout its varied environments that keep things from ever feeling stale and repetitive. It tries a ton of different things, and even though not all of them work, it's always exciting to start a new level not entirely sure what you're going to get. Once again, it struggles in it's final stages to bring everything together into a really satisfying whole and ends up feeling like less than the sum of it's parts as a result, but those parts are frequently very well-made.

La l\u00f3gica no es tan l\u00f3gica en el juego, ejemplo: Existen cuerpos que est\u00e1n a lado pero no puedes tomar su item si no te posicionas correctamente frente al cad\u00e1ver, esto pasa en uno que est\u00e1 a un costado de una alcantarilla por dar un ejemplo. Otro ejemplo de la mala l\u00f3gica que usaron en la jugabilidad fue la parte del Dragon \"Dracolich\" (adverencia: spoiler) b\u00e1sicamente se torna aburrido e il\u00f3gico el ir subiendo, escalando y trepando de un lado a otro de las costillas del drag\u00f3n de una forma demasiado espec\u00edfica cuando f\u00e1cilmente podr\u00eda irse ido balanceando con el l\u00e1tigo por todo el cuerpo (eso pasa por ser un juego muy Lineal y por eso me gustan m\u00e1s los que son m\u00e1s mundos abiertos o que tienen un poco m\u00e1s de libertad para escoger). Peor aun es que NO  derrotas al drag\u00f3n como todo mundo esperar\u00eda: en una batalla \u00e9pica. Mas bien se torna algo parecido a escalar una monta\u00f1a de un lado a otro y repito de una forma No muy l\u00f3gica : te cuelgas de una de los huesos del dragon que pareciera la pelvis \u00f3 sacro, luego tienes que rotar y subir por dicho hueso hasta llegar al tope de la espina del drag\u00f3n, luego en lugar de ir directo saltando por las vertebras, tienes que hacer un completo rodeo hacia atr\u00e1s y luego hacia la punta de dichas v\u00e9rtebras luego volver a bajar... ufff ni hablar. Otra ILOGICA de este juego es por ejemplo cuando est\u00e1s en el Laberinto de Arbustos, resulta que con tanta fuerza y habilidades que tiene Belmont, \u00e9l no es capaz de destruir un simple seto \u00f3 saltarlos, no... tiene que Golpear literalmente una enorme columna de piedras que notoriamente son m\u00e1s fuertes que esos setos, escalar sobre dicha columna y brincar hacia el otro lado. Por cierto, existen BUGS en el juego los cuales no voy a mencionar, son m\u00ednimos pero existen y te puedes llevar un peque\u00f1o rato rabioso. \nLa mayor parte del tiempo estar\u00e1s Escalando como en Prince of Persia y usando muy pocas veces el l\u00e1tigo a comparaci\u00f3n de lo que hubiera sido un juego tradicional de Castlevania donde el L\u00e1tigo lo usas casi todo el tiempo para escalar y balancearte. En este juego falt\u00f3 m\u00e1s balanceo con el l\u00e1tigo a la hora de escalar. Tambi\u00e9n recuerda un poco a God of War pero No tanto, de hecho me hubiera gustado que fuera m\u00e1s como God of War porque en GOW tienes m\u00e1s poder, m\u00e1s lucha y m\u00e1s acci\u00f3n. \nEn todo lo dem\u00e1s, el juego es una chulada, una belleza, una grandeza, una excelencia ... jajaja!! En serio, me ha encantado, pero hubiera tamb\u00eden preferido un poco m\u00e1s de estilo \"anime\" al que ya estabamos acostumbrados en las series de Castlevania: las chicas como las lolis usualmente se ven mejor en Anime :) soy Otaku Furro awebo! \nFaltaron las Cruces, no hay las cl\u00e1sicas cruces voladoras pero igualmente est\u00e1 bien, se pasa. \nEl dise\u00f1o de personajes es muy bueno pero  algunos personajes no llegan a ser muy \"apegables\", muy desaprovechados y casi no te encari\u00f1as con ellos como es el caso de Marie en mi caso al menos no me gust\u00f3 mucho, pudo tener la nariz y boca m\u00e1s finas y los ojos m\u00e1s grandes para mi gusto al estilo anime pero bueno... adem\u00e1s de ser la esposa de Gabriel y la raz\u00f3n por la cual se desata toda esta batalla (\u00e9l busca revivirla) realmente creo que hasta podr\u00eda y debi\u00f3 quedarse mejor con Claudia y que hasta se aventuraron los de Konami al poner una Loli y dos (si contamos con la chica vampira) enamorada de Gabriel, y que pudiera haber f\u00e1cilmente hecho olvidar su aventura a Gabriel y otra historia nos contar\u00eda (Por eso me gustan los juegos con multiples finales alternativos especialmente si se trata por nuestras acciones que tomemos pero este no es el caso, este juego es super lineal). \nEl dise\u00f1o de los entornos son muy buenos y hermosos, pero flaquea en el desarrollo de niveles sobre todo en los mapas finales y por ser extremadamente lineal,  y la perspectiva de la c\u00e1mara puede que no sepas a donde ir en el mapa del Desierto. \nLos Puzzles son muy buenos, te hacen pensar pero en algunos puzzles, especialmente otra vez en los finales son tremendamente dif\u00edciles y hasta frustrantes y dejan de ser divertidos por ejemplo: si no eres ASTROLOGO tendr\u00e1s que aprender porque te pide una fecha mediante astrolog\u00eda y si no lo haces ser\u00e1 imposible pasar. \nB\u00e1sicamente CLOS no es un hack and  slash sino m\u00e1s bien un PUZZLEVANIA, con una excelente historia.\nLa Historia repito, es Excelente, aunque creo que es alterna a la verdadera saga de Castlevania aunque tiene personajes de la misma saga.\nLos primeros 10 niveles puedo decir que son muy buenos pero para el final empieza a fallar un poco la diversi\u00f3n por lo antes mencionado.\nComo fuera, es un muy buen juego y lo recomiendo.\n", "timestamp_created": 1633486269, "timestamp_updated": 1633486269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444444417953491211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100588976": {"recommendationid": "100588976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967980828", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 357, "last_played": 1634190308}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing once you get the hang of it, just some confusing level/ camera design every now and then.

Is it the best game ever? No.  Is it just 'alright' enough to satisfy the distraction you need from the monotonous rut of your (currently) pointless existence? Yeah, sure. Maybe.\n\nLook, I'm not a therapist or anything like that, but chances are, you're a lot like me.  36 years old.  A couple of kids.  A job.  Responsibilities and shit.  You don't have time (or energy) to be the first to download some latest AAA bullshit.  We wait for the sale.  We wait for the other trail-blazers to show us the way.  And sometimes, we go looking for an older experience that may have been cool at the time but didn't quite rise to level of our awareness because...you know, we had better shit to do back then.  That, and it's just the sort of distraction that we can pursue in finite increments.  A few minutes after bedtime routine.  Maybe a half hour while the kids are at gymnastics.  You get it.\n\nEnter LoS.  A weird hybrid of a game that screams late 2000s QT cheese, with puzzles you can (sometimes) skip.  It's like God-of-War knocked up Uncharted, and the kid turned goth.  Like the youngest kid in class, you're catching LoS right around the time of puberty.  Like, totally late to the party and approaching it like an amateur.  That's good ole' lovable LoS.\n\nIf you do buy this, don't fret or give up (or get mad).  LoS really doesn't get going until chapter 3-ish, right around the time you get the nekid-titty monster weapon.  Personally, I flexed the difficulty frequently.  Stuck on a weird, nonsensical puzzle?  Give it a google - there was always an answer.\n\nIf you're the sort of person that likes to complete everything, on hardest difficulty, with no help...yeah, again, that's probably not you if you're reading this... so, yeah. I forgot my train of thought.  If you are still with me, then you're trending psychopath.  \n\nPros:\n- Sweet character art\n- Sir Patrick Stewart narrates\n- Genuinely interesting combat\n- Fun take on Castlevania story, lore\n- Not overly complicated\n- Runs wicked fast on modern rigs\n\nCons:\n- Sir Patrick Stewart narrates (yeah its cool they got him and all, which was high production value circa 2010, but it's these weird chapter interludes.  It's just...weird.  Is the character 'Zobek' watching Gabriel in the woods, like some peeping Tom? Play to find out!)\n- Oddly misplaced sound effects - I think I read somewhere they hired a homeless guy off the street to rattle aluminum cans, an old egg-beater and bar chimes.  Lots of bar chime action going on here guys.\n- Some puzzles totally interrupt the flow.  Most of these you can skip though and you really don't need the experience.  Except for the music box...*shudders*\n- Inconsistent jumping & climbing rules - just remember, jumping and climbing is some combination of all the buttons...\n\nTLDR Conclusion - thumbs up, worth a few bucks.

No. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1633481216, "timestamp_updated": 1633481477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100536518": {"recommendationid": "100536518", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997396808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1009, "last_played": 1633579724}, "language": "english", "review": "The one positive thing about this game is that the trailer is super well done. Upon watching the trailer, there were so many raving reviews from critics saying that this was a potential GoTY candidate and best game on the PS3, extc. The trailer sold me on the game, so I ended up purchasing it. \n\nWhat a letdown.  The controls are clunky and the fixed camera angle is annoying which makes it very hard to navigate. There's a character in the game called a chupacabra that steals your items almost every level, and then you have to run around playing hide and seek with them until you find them in order to get your items back. It totally breaks the flow of the gameplay and is extremely irritating. \n\nHowever, worst of all is the lazy storytelling. Ever heard of the term \"show, don't tell\"? This game does the exact opposite. During the gameplay, there is no indicator of what's going on through Gabriel's mind. Then after each stage is a brief cutscene where Gabriel speaks in the most monotone voice, speaking very little if at all. There's definitely no significant dialogue which leads to any meaningful exposition. And then as you start the next level, there is a story book sequence where the narrator describes everything that is going on inside Gabriel's mind and somehow these storybook sequences are supposed to resemble character development. It's so utterly lazy and is such a lame excuse for story telling. There's such a disconnect between the actual gameplay versus the narration sequences.

Lords of Shadow 1 has some clunkiness that isn't there in its sequel (the overlong puzzle sequences, the lack of real enemy variety, a lot of sections that feel like padding or which were meant to be setpieces, etc.) but the reason I was drawn to the game was the combat. \n\nI'm not a Castlevania fan so this isn't coming at it from that angle. I'm talking as a fan of games like Devil May Cry 1, 3, 4, and 5, God Hand, Metal Gear Rising (which I played on PS3 when it came out), and other similar titles. Lords of Shadow is an in between of God of War and Devil May Cry, though taking more from the former. The flow of combat revolves around some rather lenient parries, absorbing orbs into one of your two super meters, and is based around the use of area attacks (AOE's with your whip) and direct attacks. The move list variety for what it set out to do is actually pretty large, larger than I expected when going in. \n\nWhile I think this game is hurt by sections like the Chupacabra tracking in a lot of missions, or some of the platforming sequences which are reminiscent of the Uncharted games, or the mountable enemies, I think at its core it's a fun game. Play it first especially if you plan on playing Lords of Shadow 2, which I consider to have the more memorable writing and the better combat, or if you like games like Uncharted, God of War, etc. The game is very competently made.", "timestamp_created": 1633393626, "timestamp_updated": 1633393626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100493512": {"recommendationid": "100493512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189043145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1562721353}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far the worst experience I've had with the entire Castlevania IP.I like even the bad games on Gameboy but this is just a trash fire. The combat tries way too hard to emulate God Of War but doesn't nail any of the nuance that most hack and slash games need to be even the least bit fun. there are fun ideas here like the new origin for some key figures in the series but the gameplay is just dogshit. Gabriel feels like he's made of rocks glued together wish rotten garbage which ruins the whole flow of combat. Most of the games in this vein are built around speed and reaction times but this one feels more like just a test of how much BS you can put up with before you bite your fingers off to save yourself. The combat is boring and sluggish, the exploration if you truly wish to describe it as such consists of nothing more than very slightly veering off the main path for a seemingly worthless 'upgrade' that will almost never feel needed in combat, and the arenas drag more ass than your average wal-mart shopper.\n\nThe display for how long I spent in the game is also inaccurate. I spent nearly 40 hours trying desperately to drag myself to 100% hoping that that might somehow make the combat feel less awful but it truly was an exercise in futility.

If you're looking for a hack and slash game, mostly focused on action, let me tell you that this is NOT your game, this is more puzzle and slash lol, I think that would be more accurate for this game, like almost 50% of this game is about puzzles, I came to this Castlevania because it looked quite fun in the hack and slash department but the game wants you to solve puzzles instead of fighting enemies, I completed all of the puzzles and all the chapters but like halfway through the chapters I was already tired of solving puzzles I just wanted to fight enemies and bosses. I have never played a hack and slash with so many puzzles and I hope I never do it again, first and last time.\n\nThe game has some really poor mechanics, the camera is pretty bad, not terrible but bad, and the whole climbing needs a lot of work to make it fun. Also, the dlcs, the last 2 chapters suck, the last one is the one that sucks the most. I gonna talk about the last DLC boss now, read at your own risk:\n\n\n\n\nThe last DLC boss is a total joke, they give you a bunch of skills, a parry and some other stuff but in that boss you're pretty much limited to certain attacks, if you try something different than those attacks he will kill you, you won't be able to block or parry, oh and the hitbox on that boss was ridiculous, no joke, sometimes I was not able see the sword hitting me and it would still hit me, whenever you beat a boss that was \"difficult\" and you don't feel satisfied, it means that you either hated that boss or the design was trash, for me, was both on that boss.\n\nThe history is actually good, not great but good, unfortunately I'm more of a gameplay guy than a history guy, if I don't like the gameplay I will not care about the history, there were some other issues in the game that you will see in other reviews, I've read many of the reviews after finishing the game and most of them are true.

For battles, you can perfect block an enemy, have another hit you and perfect block it, and during the same animation take a ton of damage because an enemy heavied you from off-screen.  Also, a lot of the animations of heavies (which require rolls) and other moves just look too similar to normal ones so you can't make a good decision.  There's just not a lot of strong group AI either so combat can feel frustrating and repetitive.

Many think the story is just OK, but I personally enjoyed it.\n\nCons: Game drags for first two chapters (not sure why, but they did for me and seemingly for others too), weird fixed camera angles that take a lot of getting used to if you are not already, and weird default key bindings- definitely use a controller.

Having to avoid Devil May Cry's lane, after ironically inventing it.

To say any attempt isn't loaded for a huge swath of dissatisfied fans. Same with so many other stories, drowning in cannon, that has to go against the grain to be its own thing. As much as stunning art direction is defacto these days, I'd say this still shines. The corruputing surrealism of Dracula's unnatural power, bordering on baroque wacky-ness, is litest here across the titles iterations, happily maintaining an overall darker tone. \n\nIts a beautiful game, with a beautiful story.

Lords of Shadow has some pretty cool stuff going for it. Awesome art, story, voice acting and sound track. However, inconsistencies with game design make some moments of the game very fun while other moments extremely frustrating and tedious. Overall, if you are a fan of games like Dante's Inferno, God of War or Darksiders you might like this game but a few design decisions left a bad taste in my mouth preventing me from giving it a thumbs up.\n\n[h1]Rant:[/h1]\nSome levels have platforming sections where the game is clearly not built to be a platformer. When you stop moving your character, your character will still takes a few steps forward to stop their momentum. While this looks cool from an animation standpoint, from a gameplay standpoint where semi precise platforming is involved, this is a pain\n\nThe game seems to try to encourage the idea of building a combo meter when in combat. Once you completely build up the meter, enemies begin to drop \"neutral energy\" that the player can absorb in order to use light/dark powers. This can be very important with certain fights because if you fight while using light magic you will heal from each attack, becoming the difference between winning and losing a fight. The problem here is that while combos are encouraged none of the enemies allow you to combo them easily compared to other games that Lords of Shadow draws inspiration from. In a game like Devil May Cry or Darksiders there is ample opportunity to combo an enemy and you just need to be on the lookout for a few attacks that are uninterruptible from the enemy. In this game you are constantly bombarded by these kinds of uninterruptible attacks making it so that you are constantly trading blows with the enemy. Instead of letting loose and barraging your enemies with hundreds of different attacks you are instead always on the defensive, dodging and blocking and waiting for a moment where you can sneak 1 or 2 hits in. It feels more like playing a worse version of Dark Souls rather than a game like God of War.\n\nTo make matters worse, hitting enemies with multiple individual attacks to build up your combo meter takes longer and is more unsafe versus just countering an enemy attack. When you wait and counter an enemy instead, your meter fills up instantly rather than taking 2 minutes to fill, or longer if you get hit. Further encouraging a defensive play style rather than a offensive combo oriented one.\n\nMany mechanics are re-used multiple times throughout the experience. The entire gameplay loop is: climb somewhere, fight some guys, do a puzzle and repeat until you reach the boss. The game introduces many different kinds of enemies but you deal with all of  them the same way, so effectively, gameplay does not feel different as you go on. You can unlock new moves to use in combat but since enemies will always bulldoze through your attacks, having a cool move that will just get interrupted is not worth it.\n\nThe game also provides items to use in combat which allow you to bypass some encounters quickly. Such as using holy water against vampires or summoning a demon to kill all enemies on screen. While these items are nice distractions they are never pivotal in combat and for the most part, I avoided using them.\n\nAs you play you also learn new major moves such as being able to sprint, double jump or do a charge dash. The game will try to spice up platforming by incorporating these moves into their usual challenges. As well as making puzzles that sometimes center around these new moves you have earned. Sometimes this leads to some cool results where you can now reach areas previously impossible to access or solve puzzles in creative ways.\n\nThe game usually offers hints after you have died in the game over screen. Most of the time this is helpful and helps guide the player to the right direction. However, the game sometimes tries to be funny by saying \"Try not to swim in Lava\" or \"Don't fight like a Diary Farmer\" when you die. The latter being constantly shown during the boss fight in the DLC for the game that's included in this edition. While stuff like this can be funny the first time through, it becomes annoying after fighting with the game's systems. The DLC boss fight in particular, is pretty cheap. It almost feels like they were worried that there was not enough content in the DLC so they wanted players to waste time by fighting a cheap boss. This boss fight really soured my experience of the game at the end and you are probably better off not even playing the DLC for this reason unless you are really into the story.", "timestamp_created": 1627774290, "timestamp_updated": 1627774476, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497666060924530029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96612276": {"recommendationid": "96612276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008110697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 1317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1317, "last_played": 1627601136}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, it's a sorta meh game, that often feels frustrating and like I'm wasting my time.\nThe core combat is not the most satisfying, though not terrible or anything, just ok feeling. Sometimes good, othertimes bad. Sometimes you fight one or two enemies in a clear battle of positioning, timing, blocking, skill, etc... and othertimes it's just getting swamped by fifteen flying demons while stuck on a tiny playing area so there's no real way to reliably avoid getting hit and taking damage except for maybe punishing the grab attack, something that works on smaller enemies and leaves you immune while performing... for all of them....\n\nAnd the problem is that this combat is honestly, while nothing great, still the best part of this game I'd say.\n\nFirst, this game doesn't know what it wants to be, its copying other games of its time. Primarily God of War, and Shadow of the Colossus. And then some prince of Persia thrown in to cover the 3d platforming side. The games all over the place honestly. Very often while playing during a new boss or area you get surprised with something new for the first time... only to deal with some weird often contrived feeling mechanic that doesn't seem like it was greatly pollished or even fits in the game. You find yourself stuck climbing big bosses that try to shake you off, but with move sets limited to normal climbings, and then with god of war cinematic style quick time events thrown in at random with quick time events, and somewhat contrived sudden rules on what kills your or not. Most parts of the game, falling even ten feet kills you, other areas, fall fifty and your fine, one boss battle, fall over a hundred or two and you're A ok. No real reason or excuse, it's just that it fits that moment so they make things work that way. A giant throws a massive boulder at you, grab it with your chain and spin it back, where's that insane ability to root yourself to one location and handle such weights during other times? No where to be found... your character randomly changes to do whatever they think he should or shoudn't for a given idea of the game or part to work. Makes me not feel attached to him or his skill, or his struggles. Just frusterated when he can't do what he could or should.\nAlso don't even feel powerful with the powers you do more reliably keep. I mean, there's one enemy type that just can take your powers and gear, just like that, and ever time you see one you just stare at it and can't do anything till it makes noise, and then takes your stuff. I didn't realize the abilities of the gods or ancient artifacts are all so easy to take by random creatures, and they aren't the only ones to randomly be able to do this. As the game goes on seriously wonder whats going on with so many characters or creatures that can just disapear the players abilities at a moments notice, and how I can take any real big bad enemy fights seriously knowing of this detail in the world. \nOh well, so the climbing from SotC is botched and doesn't feel good, and you can't get scenic feeligns when you can't control the camera quite often. The mood isn't well matched either. You have quick time events and some combat ideas from God of War, literally the worst parts in my opinion, made even worse when they can be of random inputs quite often, and also often placed in areas where one faillure means death and going back to redo a fight for another five or ten minutes to get back to that point. You know, the thing that really pisses you off when handling quick time events like that...\nAnd the platforming alla prince of persia, is poorly done. Visuals for what you can/can't climb or handle are often unclear, you can't control the camera and the fixed positions/angles aren't always good to see stuff. And the climbing movement constantly changes its rules to fit how they want you to climb any given point.\nClimbing up with your chain as a rope of sorts, sometimes you can climb up and down, other times you randomly fall because... idk, the chain wasn't long enough? Sure seems crazy long some times. Sometimes you can swing side to side, but that's only allowed when they want you to, many times I wanted to as it'd get me where I wanted to go but they lock that out then. Or the ability to jump, swing back from the surface and to jump away, also randomly locked, only allowed just when they want it. \nWhen jumping backwards to another ledge, the distance and height he can jump also varies insanely, sometimes like ten feet, even up five feet, other times they just block that and you can only jump back to a ledge ten feet down and five feet back instead. You just learn to try and feel out what they want you to do at any moment, there's rarely any choice, it's just follow their path with the immediate rules set for your movment at that one moment.\n\nAnd for a Castlevania game... they miss the biggest parts they should have brought in. The equipment and abilities, and branching world. Instead it's completely linear, with fairly limited abilities and keys of sorts to unlock areas. Often said abilities are also rather... oddly forced into a situation so you might only use one ability like once in an early tutorial, then need to remember it five hours later into the game because it never sees any other use before then. Or how you can't punch a wall out of the way, but can smash it with a body slam. But body slam can't push large objects, only punching works on those, even if that pushes it into and through a wall... both moves clearly have the power, the distinction feels completely arbitrary.

verdad de las mejores sinceramente, no soy muy fan de los clasicos siento que sinceramente son juegos demasiado toscos y duros de manejar, este nuevo juego toma la atmoesfera del primero y la vuelve a convertir en un juego de accion y aventura, no solo estas en un castillo sino que recorres el mundo por diferentes localidades y paisajes, es muy completo en ese sentido siendo que el juego dura aproximadamente 20 horas, es una locura lo larguisimo que es, puede jugarle a favor o en contra ya que luego 20 horas ya se empieza a sentir agotador el juego, pero si buscas algo que dure y quieres hacer valer tu dinero es excelente, mas aun con el precio ridiculamente bajo de este juego, ademas de que graficamente a envejecido super bien, para su epoca (2010) este juego era un despliegue tecnico impresionante acompa\u00f1ado de un dise\u00f1o visual donde los artistas estaban totalmente inspirados y encontraron los mejores angulos de camara para resaltar la belleza de los paisajes de este juego que son de infarto, fue impresionante en el 2010, sigue siendo impresionante en 2021 , creo que lo que podria decir encontra de este juego es que hay unos enemigos que tienen un hitbox muy muy injusto sobretodo con sus ataques, es cosa de acostumbrarse pero no deja de ser algo raro en el genero, sobretodo el jefe del dlc que si que tiene un hitbox muy cuestionable, fuera de eso es un

The in-game graphics have held up well, although cutscenes are a little blocky. This game is well paced, combination of combat, puzzle, bosses and exploration. Beautiful level designs, amazing soundtrack and voice acting, unique and interesting characters as well as creative use of your abilities in relation to your enemies.\n\nEach enemy has its own particular strengths to which, you as the player should strategically respond to if you want to be effective.

I can usually find the good in things. buuuut - TLDR: F**K this game. The story is kinda good so just watch the cutscenes on YouTube or something\n\nI just finished the Netflix Castlevania series and was like oh yeah I've been meaning to play Lord's of Shadow for years! Perfect way to celebrate the awesome \"anime\" so I really wanted to like this game.\u00a0\nUnfortunately I would say a sharp stake in the eye would be more enjoyable\n\nI'm the kind of guy who when I start a game I pretty much finish it whether I like the game\u00a0or not so maybe it will get more fun but I'm already halfway through.\n\nMaybe the game was good for it's time? Maybe it just didn't age well? I dunno\n\nTake all the bad stuff from God of War, Assassin's Creed, and Dark Souls and multiply it cause they just kept doing the same thing over and over\n\nCombat sucks. At first I was like damn I SUCK at this game. \n\nI pride myself at being a pretty\u00a0good gamer. I like hard games. The combat's not hard. It's just boring and tedious. It's boring because they give you all these awesome combos and like 80% of them are useless. They give you an amazing array of moves that if you ever try to use them you will immediately get bashed in the nuts because EVERYTHING just\u00a0takes the damage you throw at them and rolls right through you. So you end up sticking with just swing swing dodge... Swing swing dodge. This is especially true for boss fights. If they wanted to make a Souls game the shoulda made a Souls game. \n\nAlso the BLOCK and DODGE button are basically the same button! I hate that crap.\n\nThe boss fights sans 1 or 2 are basically the same boss fights over and over again. Once you've fought one you've fought them all just in a different skin. They all have the SAME MOVES and they are basically just REGULAR ENEMIES WITH MORE HEALTH. Just Werewolves and trolls reskinned.\u00a0\n\nThe camera SUCKS. A LOT. You can't see the enemy you are trying to fight half the time cause they are off camera. You can't find where you are supposed to go because the ledge is basically off camera.\nOh and you can't find a lot of the power ups because they are off camera which wouldn't be so bad if the jump/hit detection wasn't crap. Maybe it's the nature of this generation of games but invisible walls make it really uninteresting to explore and find gems of bullshit power. Just hopping around hoping to find a hole in the invisible wall... Or the ledge you spent 3 minutes trying to climb for nothing to happen and then you spend 15 minutes looking for another way to go only to have to look it up and see you WERE going the right way but apparently you were a millimeter off and the damn invisible wall was in your way.\n\nYou know how in Assassin's Creed you are trying to jump to the ledge on your left and instead you jump to your death? Yeah this game does that in spades. I can't tell you how many times I've fallen into pits for this reason.\n\nOh and to make matters worse you gotta revisit most of the levels if you wanna get all the power ups. I hate that shit. If the game was fun maybe it would be better\n\nI felt bad for my Twitch viewers cause I'm usually a very positive gamer. I like to give games the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYeah... I'm just gonna uninstall and watch some poor schlub play on youtube. Maybe I'll see what I was doing wrong.

Hay varias cosas, por las que me reus\u00f3  completamente y firmemente a recomendarlo, quieres jugarlo adelante el juego no decepciona, aun as\u00ed tomate un momento antes de que hagas tu compra y lee los que yo considero los puntos malos del t\u00edtulo.\n\n[b] 1.- LOS CONTROLES.-[/b] probablemente uno de los controles peor distribuidos e intuitivos que he tenido la desdicha de usar, me pase el juego y aun no me acostumbraba, simplemente NO PUEDES ponerle 25 usos al joystick que doble tab para correr, que <-- y x  para un combo, ----> y x para otro, presiona R3 para absorber esencia, R3 +L3 para otro combo.... sin reproches el peor aspecto del juego.\n \n[b] 2.-LA DIFICULTAD ARTIFICIAL.- [/b] no es posible que estando jugando en dif\u00edcil, no pudiera matar a el jefe del dlc y tener que bajar la dificultad no porque la pelea sea dif\u00edcil NO, si no por un QTE (las lanzas del olvidado ) mal implementado en todo lo que va del juego nunca te piden un QTE de ese estilo y el control es p\u00e9simo si el control est\u00e1 mal, pues el control del QTE lo empeora todo en un 100%, tuve que repetir ese QTE durante  40 min, al final simplemente una de las veces lo hice al azar sin intentarlo y sali\u00f3, baje la dificultad del juego simplemente para agilizar el proceso de el QTE por que sorpresa si fallas el QTE o te mata y te manda al inicio de fase o se recupera un porcentaje de vida y tienes que volver a quit\u00e1rselo si quieres repetir el QTE. Otra cosa es que ponen enemigos a montones para que sea dif\u00edcil, en los niveles contra tiempo o lo haces perfecto o no lo pasas, -tienes que dar muchas vueltas para encontrar las pistas de los puzles (a veces los pase sin siquiera saber  que eran un puzzle , porque no lo explican)\n\n[b] 3.- EL PLATAFORMEO.- [/b] aqu\u00ed no hay mucho que decir solo que a veces por el difuminado algunas cosas se ven las lejos de lo que est\u00e1n en realidad.\n\n[b] 4.- LA CAMARA .-[/b]bueno esto se lo atribuyo a los juegos de la \u00e9poca en general, as\u00ed que solo lo menciono.\n \n[b]  5.- LOS QTE.-[/b] no puedes ver una cinem\u00e1tica en paz porque siempre hay un maldito QTE que no te deja disfrutar la historia.\n\nEn General es un BUEN JUEGO. No Incre\u00edble, no excelente, no memorable simplemente un BUEN JUEGO con mucho potencial desaprovechado.\n\nPD.- La secuela mejora algunas de las cosas anteriores aunque empeora en otras", "timestamp_created": 1622274731, "timestamp_updated": 1662484397, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528204083442687988", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92772665": {"recommendationid": "92772665", "author": {"steamid": "76561199077964676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1696911361}, "language": "spanish", "review": "like", "timestamp_created": 1622262581, "timestamp_updated": 1622262581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92756448": {"recommendationid": "92756448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017728757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1420087028}, "language": "english", "review": "\u00e9 meio ruim, mas d\u00e1 pra jogar", "timestamp_created": 1622238221, "timestamp_updated": 1622238221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92602157": {"recommendationid": "92602157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077175048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1621995234}, "language": "english", "review": "I launched this game again today for the first time in a long time remembering how fun the combat was and wondering why I hadn't ever finished it.

Chapters end in bizarre ways, with one not ending on a vampire boss fight in a burning village, but immediately after on a level where you walk through two rooms worth of sewer.\nPlatforming is mostly automatic Uncharted-style climbing that you will only fail when the scripting doesn\u2019t work.\nIt has no real identity of its own, with most of the game feeling like cargo-cult versions of things taken from other (non-Castlevania) games, the most notable of which are the three Shadow of the Colossus style boss fights which don\u2019t seem to understand any of the reasons why people liked SotC.\nThey seemed to have deliberately picked the least helpful angles for the fixed camera to take in every screen without it being outright broken.\nMinor upgrades are obnoxiously gated behind mundane obstacles that require later upgrades in this linear, stage-based game.\nThe environments are actually quite nice to look at, but the character models are hideous and the animations are poor.\nDespite the number of cutscenes and dour, gamefuneral tone, the story is very boring, very dumb, and ends on a post-credits stinger that's so jarring it\u2019s hard to describe it in any way other than \u201clol\u201d.\nMusic is so bombastic constantly it becomes irritating despite being generally unmemorable epic movie score styled music. Disappointing for a franchise that usually delivers on music even in its worst entries (Hi, The Adventure).\nThe game will never stop telling you that you cannot carry any more daggers.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t feel anything like any Castlevania game.\nI can\u2019t really recommend this, as a Castlevania or as a video game in general, very 7th gen reboot, very bad.\n\nEDIT: Ignore everything above, the real reason not to play this is so you don't have to play the DLC and deal with one of if not the most poorly designed boss in a character action game.

Desarrollado por Mercury Steam, estudio espa\u00f1ol, producido y distribuido por Konami, due\u00f1os de la IP.\nEl juego se plante\u00f3 en un principio como un reboot, un nuevo inicio, para la saga Castlevania, finalmente qued\u00f3 en una trilog\u00eda que reimaginaba o reinterpretaba el mismo.\nNos encontramos ante un juego de acci\u00f3n-aventura 3D, hack & slash, con toques plataformeros y puzles, divididos en distintos niveles de duraci\u00f3n variable.\n \nEstamos en el a\u00f1o 1047 y nuestro papel ser\u00e1 el de Gabriel Belmont, miembro de la Hermandad de la Luz cuyo objetivo es acabar con la Oscuridad que est\u00e1 lentamente consumiendo el mundo. Para ello contaremos con la Cruz de Combate para derrotar a las incesantes hordas de enemigos a los que nos enfrentaremos. \n\nEl combate es uno de los puntos destacables del t\u00edtulo, se nota su fuerte inspiraci\u00f3n en la saga God of War. Contaremos con dos tipos de ataques y todo un arsenal de herramientas: dagas, agua bendita, etc. Que nos ayudar\u00e1n a acabar con los enemigos m\u00e1s duros, los controles durante el mismo responden bien y es espectacular, adem\u00e1s contaremos con una buena variedad de combos que iremos desbloqueando.\n\nEn cuanto al apartado gr\u00e1fico, hablamos de un juego antiguo, 2010, y que tampoco fue puntero en su momento, por otro lado s\u00ed destaca su apartado art\u00edstico, que nos deja aut\u00e9nticas estampas tanto naturales como de la arquitectura mas barroca y g\u00f3tica.\n\nTambi\u00e9n son destacables su banda sonora y su doblaje, ambos rayan a un muy alto nivel, contando en su doblaje con actores de primer nivel como son Patrick Stewart o Robert Carlyle, en los roles principales.\n\nLa historia, por otro lado, no sorprende, no pasa de ser la m\u00e1s que vista lucha entre el bien y el mal y en muy pocos momentos se apartar\u00e1 de estos clich\u00e9s tan vistos. Se sigue con cierto inter\u00e9s pero no es uno de sus puntos fuertes.\n\nComentar adem\u00e1s otro de sus puntos d\u00e9biles, el control. No con ello quiero decir que sea algo grave, el juego es perfectamente jugable, pero notaremos m\u00e1s de una vez que el personaje no responde como deber\u00eda y en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n nos encontraremos que no se agarra a ese saliente, cuando de sobra, deber\u00eda. Como digo, nada doloroso, pero s\u00ed, visible.\n\nAdem\u00e1s hablar de que el juego se llama Castlevania, pero poco toma del mismo, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ciertos aspectos del lore de la saga, en muchas ocasiones sentiremos que estamos ante una especie de God of War, como ya coment\u00e9 antes, del cual se nota que es su principal referente, entre otros como Shadow of the Colossus. No termina de tener una identidad propia que permita diferenciarlo claramente, aparte de su ambientaci\u00f3n.\n\nY para ir acabando, la duraci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s que correcta, nos puede durar entre unas 20-25 horas dependiendo de cuanto jugo le queramos sacar, contamos con desbloqueables tales como arte conceptual, a\u00f1adir que en esta \"Ultimate Edition\" se incluyen dos DLC que vienen a cerrar el arco de este primer t\u00edtulo.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, es un juego correcto, efectivo y divertido, pero que tarda en arrancar. No es un cl\u00e1sico ni una obra maestra, sin embargo es una aventura ciertamente recomendable si te gusta el g\u00e9nero, no pierdas la oportunidad de descubrir el destino de Gabriel en su lucha contra los Se\u00f1ores Oscuros.", "timestamp_created": 1621689396, "timestamp_updated": 1621690463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92379060": {"recommendationid": "92379060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409819627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1699060081}, "language": "english", "review": "it fun", "timestamp_created": 1621635707, "timestamp_updated": 1621635707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92373046": {"recommendationid": "92373046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297255437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1621626029}, "language": "english", "review": "i tried. i swear to god i tried to give this game another go. i thought it was because i played it with a keyboard. hoo boy, was i wrong. i tried again, now with a controller. no. just. no. i was determined to play it but i felt like the game decided to make me hate it even though i was SO. determined. to finish it. as soon as i got the hang of it, got used to a clunky camera and awkward controls, the game decided to scare me away once again. why, you may ask?

I played it without knowing anything about it and I loved it.\n\nYou play as Gabriel who serves to protect people from evil forces. His wife dies and her soul end up being trapped in between worlds. She guides Gabriel so he could defeat the lords of shadow and bring peace to world and its people.\n\nThe game starts with a really nice cut-scene and throws you in combat right after that which serves as tutorial. After getting used to controls you go on a journey to deal with the darkness. On your way you'll be slaying monsters like undead beings and solve some puzzles. Of course your wife is always with you and you get some nice cut-scenes once in while. It also has a really good, gloomy atmosphere.\n\nOne of the things I loved the most is combat. It's brutal, fast but not too hard to learn although on harder difficulties you'll need to sweat  a lot i guess, i've on easiest like i do most of the time. You have various skills which unlock with time and some nice moves. The combat is similar to God of War.\n\nThen there are boss fights. Boss variety is great in this game. From smaller ones like werewolves or trolls to gigantic monsters, again similar to God of War. Speaking of variety, most bosses are very different and require a different approach each time so it never becomes boring. Boss design is great too, same as all the minor enemies.\n\nThe puzzles on the other hand are not so fun. I'm not even sure an action game needs those. I loves those light, easy puzzles in Uncharted games but here they're a bit too much. Some may be quite challenging and you spend time figuring it out but instead you just want to brutally murder more monsters. I mean it's a matter of taste but I personally don't like when action games are disrupted by lengthy puzzles, I just want to kill things and bring light to the people. But overall you'll be fighting most of the time.\n\nThe only bigger downside I could think of is that some areas are annoying. Not because they're hard but it just feels like it lasts forever and you just want to move on to something fresh.\n\nIt's a wonderful game graphically. Obviously it doesn't look like current AAA games but when it came out it looked really good and in my opinion still looks good today, especially the cut-scenes.\nThere's also a huge variety of environments and they're beautiful. Forests, castles, greenery, snow, you name it, everything looks really nice.\nI guess some people might not like the fixed camera. Well, maybe not fixed but you can't control it. I find it nice since it always puts you on the right perspective and zooms in or out when required. It works perfectly.\nControls are responsive and you can execute all the moves without any bugs or clunkiness.\n\nSound design is great too. Voice acting is up to AAA standards and characters sound believable. Sounds add to the atmosphere a lot, it might be calm chirping of birds one second and in a blink of an eye orchestral music starts playing and you stand up against a deadly foe.\n\nOverall one of the best action games i've played. If you enjoy third person action games, fast, fluid combat, good story and want to kill a titan it's for you.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Fun combat\n[*]Great graphics\n[*]Great sound design\n[*]Great variety in environments\n[*]Great boss variety\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Some areas drag too long\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1621122312, "timestamp_updated": 1621122312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803212225437164307", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92060847": {"recommendationid": "92060847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838897166", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1131, "last_played": 1621109495}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played every single God of War game, and this is strikingly similar.

I hate the awful controls. I hate the fixed camera. I hate the terrible parry system that only works when it feels like it. I hate being hit by enemies before they even start their attack animation.

I don't mean waste time like playing games in the first place, to have fun while doing nothing productive; I mean literally waste time by having long, unskippable animation sequences in the middle of fights, by checkpointing right before cut-scenes and then making the player watch or skip those cut-scenes every single time they reload, by taking all of the player's gear away and then making them chase around for minutes before giving it all back.\nI don't hate everything about the game, just every part of it that is the game. The visuals are nice, if a little dated now. The soundtrack is great and the voice-acting is superb. The world design is generally very well done. The problem is, everything that's good about the game doesn't even need to be part of a game. If Lords of Shadow were a movie then it would actually be better because then nobody would have to struggle with the aggravating game design.\n\nIn truth, I only bought and played this on pc now because I never got round to playing the sequel and I thought it would be a fun romp to recap on the story. I was wrong and I regret it; it's just not fun to play.\n\nIf you have the patience of a saint and nothing better to throw your money at then you might get on with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, but I still wouldn't recommend it. You would be better served watching a heavily edited playthrough on YouTube for the story and then forgetting the game exists.", "timestamp_created": 1620685476, "timestamp_updated": 1620685476, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501474618911743164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91789592": {"recommendationid": "91789592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313335469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3049, "last_played": 1691339554}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego excelente, tiene una excelente historia y la m\u00fasica realmente de hace sentir ese\npoder que vas adquiriendo cada vez que avanzas, ya sea el poder de Gabriel como el de los\nse\u00f1ores obscuros.\n", "timestamp_created": 1620683456, "timestamp_updated": 1620683456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91725724": {"recommendationid": "91725724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365607624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1660845466}, "language": "english", "review": "I had this game for PS3 about 6 years ago and I thought it was super fun and it looked so awesome, and the voice acting and everything was just so damn cool.

It was very disappointing then when I reached an unplayable part of the game. Due to the game having been adapted for playing on PC's there are some bugs that make it difficult or at this point impossible to continue. My very first visual bug was noticed as soon as I started playing. I shook it off thinking that it was not so bad and that I could just play through it without an issue. Overtime the visual bugs became more noticeable, but since I could keep on playing I again did not care too much. It is only at the point I have reached now, the first location in Chapter II that I can no longer advance. The textures have stretched across my screen, blocking my path and opening me up to attack. While I can survive the onslaught of goblins, I cannot find a way around the dead end due to the top of my screen being covered in broken textures.

Jank and bad puzzles be damned!\n\nWhat I particularly liked was the amazing atmosphere in each of the environments, with every nook and cranny intricately detailed, making every location feel real - even environments that you\u2019d scarcely spend more than 30 seconds in. (For example, you start one level off in a beautiful, gleaming purple cavern with tufts of heat rising from the depths and distorting the air. You\u2019d think with that amount of detail the [i]cavern[/i] would be the level, but nope - you can rappel yourself out of there in no less than 15 seconds, and you\u2019re off to a completely area). And add on top of that there\u2019s [i]45+[/i] different levels, so by the time you reach the end, you really do feel like you\u2019ve gone through a hard-fought journey.\n\nThe story and voice-acting were also top-notch (especially the between-level narrations), and I was really invested into Gabriel\u2019s journey and how things would unfold. I was pretty thoroughly satisfied with the story, even to the point where I ended-up enjoying some of the QTEs, internally yelling at a particularly heinous individual as I was tearing them a new one while giving myself repetitive stress injury in my wrists. And props to stapling that cliffhanger at the end of the main story, since it now legitimately has me excited to continue the story in the sequel.\n\nThe orchestral soundtrack throughout the game was also memorable, and all the sound effects -- both in-game and in the cutscenes -- were spot on. Nothing much to say other than it served its purpose in getting me totally immersed.\n\nSo, onto gameplay, which is where I can begin picking at some faults.\n\nThe amount of difficulty in the combat was spot-on, for the most part, as it was challenging but fair (at least on Hard; never played Normal). But as the game progressed, I began to realize that the vast majority of the enemies (and even some of the bosses) all kinda did the same thing: they claw-swipe you, dodge around randomly, and do a groundpound. And it mostly devolves into mashing X (with 1 or 2 magic-guzzling moves thrown in), dodging during an enemy\u2019s windup animation, and being wary of either their unblockables or their groundpound attacks that need to be jumped over. Sometimes it really felt like a slog due to the relatively roteness of the combat. The mechanic of whittling down a midboss\u2019s health, and then taking control of him to open-up environment obstacles was also over-used. But thankfully, there were a good few bosses that had interesting and novel patterns that had to be mastered, and which sometimes required re-accessing my strategy before they could be beat.\n\nI guess next are the low-key, non-combat portions of the game that serve as breathers in-between the combat, namely namely the parkour and puzzle portions. The parkour parts served their function, and were enjoyable as it let me really take in the environment, but it wasn\u2019t as fluid as I would have liked, and would sometimes punish you by having you fall to your death if you didn\u2019t go [i]exactly[/i] where you were supposed to be. And the puzzles, or perhaps I should say, minigames, well... I can\u2019t tell if the game would be better or worse without them in terms of pacing, but I\u2019ll just say some of them were downright awful, and didn\u2019t belong in a Castlevania game.\n\nOnto SECRETS. Oh gosh, I loved the secrets in this game, as they very tangibly rewarded your efforts with buffs to your health, light/dark magic, and consumable item capacities. After I beat the main story, I spent a good 6 hours or so going back through previous areas to find any secrets that I had missed. And to top it off, the DLC final boss was a monstrous badass that took as much health & magic as I could possibly muster, making the secret-hunting feel truly purposeful. So after repeatedly getting my ass handed to me by him in his final phase, I was finally able to squeak out a victory against him due to having a slight increase to my health/magic pools (and better magic conservation throughout the battle).\n\nTo summarize: yeah it\u2019s got the occasional jank, some bad puzzles, and repetitive combat. But it\u2019s polished AAA product that\u2019ll take you on a journey through many scenic locations, deliver a good story, and give you a few memorable badass boss fights.\n", "timestamp_created": 1620498539, "timestamp_updated": 1620498539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91623342": {"recommendationid": "91623342", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123295123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1629850909}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente juego se ve mejor que antes y es un recuerdo de la mejor saga de castlevania\n", "timestamp_created": 1620444525, "timestamp_updated": 1620444525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91512372": {"recommendationid": "91512372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198998947478", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1679304608}, "language": "english", "review": "How did I miss this upon release? either way Play this now, if found on sale then its 100% a yes!!", "timestamp_created": 1620271632, "timestamp_updated": 1620271632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91497116": {"recommendationid": "91497116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170420382", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 691, "last_played": 1696275577}, "language": "english", "review": "Severe save data issue has destroyed any enjoyment I had for this game\n\nI was really enjoying the game.

A Castlevania game (or at least the Castlevania games I've played) have an open world where you discover new areas and new bosses, while you get new upgrades/ tricks to get to other parts of the castle, and square off against Dracula, Death and other bosses.\n\nThis game is non of that. It is more of a God of War type game, with some puzzle elements in it. But it mostly involves combat. So let's start with the combat.\nThe combat starts pretty weak. But when you get some new gear, it starts to get fun. Light magic eg. regenerates your health, and Dark Magic gives some extra damage. You will get more combos as the time goes on, and some combos only work when you activate one of the two Magics. You get more goodies that work with specific Magics, like a double jump or the Shadow Claw. When you play on higher difficulties (which I recommend), you need to be on-point with counters and dodging. I found the combat fun, and challenging enough to entertain throughout the whole game.\n\nThere are also puzzles and platforming you need to do. The puzzles are okay. They are never very difficult, and you can buy the solutions if you really want to. The platforming is a hit-or-a-miss scenario. I didn't really enjoy them, for the game uses a fixed camera. I often found myself jumping into lava, deadly fog or committing suicide by jumping off a cliff when the camera spontaneously changed position. Some of the climbing seem to go to a dead end, due to the camera not showing the points of interest...\n\nThe graphics themselves are beautiful. You will be visiting ruins that are overgrown, frozen castles, dense libraries, damp catacombs, deserts and swamps. It is diverse, and it looks gorgeous. The main character, enemies and NPCs are also very good. It was a beautiful game when it came out, and up to this day it is beautiful. There is also handdrawn art, which is great as well. The music is also very good.\n\nThe story itself is okay. It starts very dull, gets a lot better in the middle, and is somewhat disappointing at the end. The final fight at Chapter 12 is somewhat of a letdown, mechanically and storywise. The Epilogue is very interesting, but it does not build towards that in the DLC at all.\n\nThe DLC... Is pretty bad. It focusses on the climbing, which is really the bad part of the game. I had the most issues with the fixed camera when playing the DLC as well, and the fun part (combat, unlocking new moves) are neglected. Some mechanics are introduced, only to be forgotten a few seconds later (like running over water). The story is full of plotholes and is completely forgetable (which is ironic, for the BBEG in the DLC is the Forgotten One).\n\nIf Steam was able to give a 'meh', I'd give this game that rating. The combat is good, the platforming is not. The graphics are very good, as is the audio, but the story has ups and downs. This game has the title Castlevania, but this is definitely not a Castlevania game. It has a Belmont with a whip, but is lacks the rest. No open world, no side-tracking/ shortcuts, and worst of all: no Dracula. I compliment them for doing something new, but I think naming it as the rest of the francise is not that smart.

The company Mercurysteam did a good job with creating a 3-d Castlevania after the train wreck that was the N64 version. It is very solid with some minor gripes to it.\n\nThe combat is very solid with a close feel to Devil May Cry but with it's own mechanics and unique signature to things. You still get artifacts that grant you new moves as you play and it is very consistant. Minor gripes being some encounters and enemies can be a bit tedious and hit boxes can be inconsistant with certain enemy attacks (FINAL BOSS I AM LOOKING AT YOU!). \n\nThe world/stages are wonderfully constructed and look amazing though it can be misleading at times. Some places you think you can go and you end up falling to your death just because pathways and camera views don't always help paint where you can and cannot go. Overall sound design is good and the music is wonderfully composed by a symphony even though it can be very repeditive at times when you are trying to figure out where to go. Voice acting is good especially when you have Captain John Luc Piccard doing the narration.\n\nOverally this is a solid game though is it perfect and what we want out of a 3-d Castlevania...no but I appreciate what has been built here as a retelling of the Castlevania story. Given the age of when this game was made I find it is still a good game to play with some replayablity in it given it's minor gripes on it.\n\nRating: 7/10 - A good action/adventure game that can easily be within the B+ tier of other good action/adventure titles in the Devil May Cry section.

Play DLCs and sequel\nThat's it!\n\nEverything what happen in between was pointless waste of your time and have no story meaning\n\nThis is so much a western game that not only it pulls out all of lame cliche plot twists at the end of the game including the classic\n\"a good guy being a bad guy all along and now its time for me to start long monologuing for 5 minutes (!) where I explain my evil plan\"\nbut also the game copypasted the main villian and majority of story plot points from other very similiar character action western game released 8 months earlier - Dante's inferno\n\nIn short: every single attempt at expanding the importance of the story is terrible\n90% of cutscenes and dialogue is boring, pointless and skipping cutscenes (if its even possible to skip them ffs) does not change the main dull plot for a single bit\n\nLoS would be actually so much better without any dialogue like Shadow of the Colossus did but we cannot have that in a game from PS3 era because cinematic experience is way more important over gameplay\n\n\n\n2)Gameplay\nVery average western character action game and its painfully visible\nTries to copy Devil May Cry mix with God of War but it fails miserably\nbut that doesn't mean that combat is bad - just its fundamentals are shaky as heck.\n\nThere is so many gameplay mechanics shoved into the game and so many novelty level gimmicks in the game that its distract from central identity as a whole.\n\nFor example: we have dodge, block, parry, ground attacks, air attacks, mounting monsters, normal attacks, heavy attacks, multiple different consumables, 2 devil triggers(offensive and defensive), grab, quick time events, mashing button, focus, combos, platforming, puzzles, minigames etc...\n\nHow of many of those are refined or polished? None. \n\n\n\n3)Platforming\n\"You can't have a western character action game without brainless platforming\" developers from PS3 era said\nSo how is it in LoS?\nThe same as in other PS3 type action games such as Uncharted - clunky, imprecise, sluggish, boring, limited with horrible camera angles\n\n\n\n4)Level design\n30% good, 30% average, 40% horrible\nEasy the worst aspect of the game\n\nLots of boring empty spaces\nWay too many same looking filler levels to pander game length\nCommon backtracking and walking blindly towards camera\n\nAt least there is a big variety of environments but the amount of levels with actually interesting visuals - not so many\n \nMany things you do quickly gets too repetitive:\nlike for example another \"use magic to press buttons\" puzzle in row or   \nhow often you need to mount once again a big monster just to do that one single action to progress area and then discard monster like a flat tire.\n\nCombat enounters aren't any better - most of the time you fight a group of single enemy type or a group of single enemy type with addition of one big enemy type.\n\nFights where you have ANYTHING other than those combination are a rarity in LoS which is such a wasted opportunity\n\nAt least level design does get way better after chapter 4 with additon of pretty alright designed puzzles\n\n\n\n5)Puzzles\nSurprisingly puzzles in this game are in 90% good. There is not much bad I can say about those\nStill better than anything from action games like Tomb Raider reboots, God of War or Uncharted ever did\n\n\n\n6)Graphics\nOverall graphics does look really meh. \nCharacter models look ok but textures on them and everything else are horrible muddy and pixelated\n\nVisuals are dull in first 3 chapters. After this game gets WAY better with variation of colors and locations but still there is way too much boring brown, white and green colors IMHO\n\nThe game does run in 60 fps at least but cutscenes are in some weird galaxy brain low framerate and resolution for some reason\n\n\n\n7)Sound and music\nPainfully generic fantasy based songs.\nNothing special or original. Nothing that screams Castlevania to you\nNo remixes of classic songs or even anything remotely similar in the style\nMany songs are just playing on 30-60 second loop and sometimes its just pure silence.\nAlso soundtrack itself doesn't have much variety so you will end up keep listening the same thing over and over for majority of the game\n\nAbout sound effects? Nothing special\nMajority of QTEs are even missing sounds effects\nYou try to cut massive statue in half with your chain that is conveniently blocking your path? Not a single chain noise during whole QTE and one flat explosion sound at the end as statue explode into multiple pieces (for some reason)\n\n\n\n8)Basic enemies\nShocking it's also painful generic and as westernized as it can be\nNothing groundbreaking or interesting in design\nTrolls, boars, zombies, goblins, wolfs, warewolfs, spiders, skeletons...\n90% of enemies have 1-2 different attacks which is usually a melee or grab or ground smash or charge\nNo cool gimicks or anything that would make those enemies stand out amongs the crowd.\nIf you think about, those enemies are just reskins that rotates in between chapters with minor changes\n\nBasically nothing that made bestiary of previous Castlevania games so good and unique\n\nWhere are minotaurs, crawling skulls, Frankenstein monsters, mummies, lizard mans, zombie dogs, ghosts, medusa heads, wherecats, hunchbacks, mermans, giant skeletons, doppelg\u00e4ngers, Legion or Grim Reaper?\n\n\n\n9)Bosses\nMostly generic looking as much as you may imagine\nFor example: big Ogre, big boar, big troll, big werewolf, big bird, big vampire...\nYou get my point\n\nBoss fights are most of the time alright but mostly average in term of moveset and visual design making them super forgettable\nParrying bosses does feel really good and final boss fight was REALLY fun tho\n\nThe worst boss fights in the game are bootleg Shadow of the Colossus style titans - a combination of terrible camera, long dull platforming with tons of QTE's and zero actual combat\n\nThere are three titans and those are so bad that 68% of players permanently quit the game on second titan in chapter 2 and I wouldn't even blame them for doing so\n\n\n\n10)But \u201cWhere is Castlevania?\"\nGood question because LoS just screams \"I was a generic western character action game but then Konami told us to make Castlevania\" and then developers shoved in few Castlevania references\nWhere is Dracula or his castle? \nWhere is iconic music or iconic monsters? \nWhere is anything that made Castlevania games so fun and unique?\n\n\n\n11)DLCs \nIn term of story,cutscenes,locations, platforming, encounters, boss fights - pure hot garbage\nEven game producer Dave Cox did call DLCs (and I quote) a mistake\nPuzzles in them are ok'ish tho\n\n\n\n\n12)Personal nitpicks\n>Game length\n25 hours streched out by tons of copy pasted ideas, encounters and filler stuff that does not push story or introduce interesting events\nDevelopers could easy cut this game into 10-15 hour game and nothing would change.\nIt would make this game pacing actually good \n\n>Camera is really bad. Like OH MAN its so bad\n\n>Everything is glowing or telling you what to do\nLoS is like big brother holding your hand and spamming hints for a whole time\n\n>The huge amount of unskippable annoying and slow cutscenes that stop you from playing the game is outlandish. Especially during puzzles and boss fights\n\n\n\n13)Verdict\nHow a company trying to copy as simple concept as DMC with GoW can fail so miserable still baffles me\n\nJust make a game with good, fleshed out combat, variety of unique enemies in each encounter, decent boss fights and variety of puzzles.\nIs that way too much to ask for a game from seventh console generation?\n\nOverall this game is an average PS3 western character action game to its core\nMy score is 5/10\n\nFeel free to skip it but if you really want to give it a try, just know that the worst part of the game are first three chapters", "timestamp_created": 1618486864, "timestamp_updated": 1625414428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.348007678985595703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90289108": {"recommendationid": "90289108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096131108", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1158, "last_played": 1618390848}, "language": "english", "review": "A little boring but beautiful game with a magnificent atmosphere and story.", "timestamp_created": 1618396304, "timestamp_updated": 1618396304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90259880": {"recommendationid": "90259880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281521824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1618341788}, "language": "english", "review": "boring as fuck", "timestamp_created": 1618342004, "timestamp_updated": 1618342004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504854381084442139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90089483": {"recommendationid": "90089483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256549938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1919, "last_played": 1659889886}, "language": "english", "review": "wow, the story is grabbing and I am just half way through the game.

I can say it's a prequel to Castlevania 1 from NES.  In term of gameplay, the game borrow some fixture like the QT system from God Of War. \n\nAdditionally this entry is much darker than previous Castlevania. The last Castlevania which really get me go was symphony of night on PS1. If you want a platform game  and never had played Castlevania, this game is a game you deffo want to play.

Picking it up on Steam and going through the chapters again is a mix of nostalgia and renewed frustration at the controls.\nC,LoS is an action adventure game with some RPG elements that borrows heavily from the formula of the original God of War series. Much like the other underappreciated game in this genre, Dantes Inferno (I often hope it comes to PC as well), the developers tried to build on this formula with a mixed bag of results.\nAt first, it will feel very familiar to any GoW veteran, but progressing through the game not only gives you points to unlock more varied and complex attacks, but you will also acquire new items that in themselves add a whole array of moves to learn. By the end of the game, if you put the time in to learn much of these moves, your fingers will be moving like a concert pianist on your controller (I HIGHLY recommend controller play; the concept of doing this with keyboard controls scares me). Even though the new abilities are spoon fed to you through the first third of the game, this can scale the frustration with later game encounters. Even knowing what I am doing, I'll often find myself angrily messing up my attacks and falling to attempting a brute force win, more often than not losing entirely.\nWhere this game shines, though, is in its narrative and presentation. Where GoW used a sense of grand scale to make it feel like you were combating the Greek gods at the height of their power, LoS uses a softer musical score with these grand shots to convey the feeling of being a lone warrior in a world in decline. While the pseudo-fixed camera can make certain parts of the game (namely combat) annoying, the splendid vistas given when navigating this massive world make up for it.\nAnd the world [i]is[/i] Massive. A simple play through the main campaign can clock in at close to 40 hours. And that's not including replaying every level to complete the unlockable challenges or the DLC content.\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the GoW formula for what it was, and don't mind the added challenge of increased complexity in control.

Some incredible pieces that range from calming/chill to more heroic. You are not going to find much in the way of remixed tunes from previous games other then 2 or 3 songs.

A great story with decent characters, awesome voice overs and beautiful environments to enjoy! The action is solid with good depth and dynamics to ensure combat never gets boring. Interesting set pieces...awesome boss fights...it's just great - Well, that was how I felt originally when the game came out over 10 years ago...\n\nIt's now 2021 and a lot of games have come out with better character movement, full camera control and mechanics that respect the players intelligence and available time. So...playing this now may result in some frustration. You must employ patience to get through as it will annoy you at times BUT this is purely down to it's age and what knowledge was available at the time. There is still a worthwhile gaming experience to be had here...and it's epic!!\n\nYou are going to curse at the camera - Although it can be a beautiful game with some amazing zooming and cinematic angles it can also be the deciding factor over you losing a battle sequence due to it hiding the enemies from your view!!\n\nPuzzles are messy - The first puzzle is one of the trickiest in the whole game!! After that, you complete puzzles without even thinking about them. However, Chapter 7's Electric Laboratory must go down as the worlds most annoying puzzle in an action game. I would gladly stomp on the genitals of the feeble, ignorant tw@t bag that designed it. The same can be said also for Chapter 9's Music Box!!! He had no respect for the players patience and trust me...you will need quite a bit to get through this without your blood boiling!! And then we get to Chapter 11 which contains two cr@ppy puzzles back to back and an environment you randomly teleport around. It's absolute bullsh!t and a real vibe killer kinda similar to the Zen world at the end of Half Life!!!\n\nBoss fights are a lot of fun but you will need to \"manage\" the camera as best as you can...it's not going to be an issue with every boss...just a few and it's not a huge impact...just noteworthy!\n\nNavigating levels can also be frustrating. If you're like me and want to be sure to see everything a level has to offer then you will have to do some planning as to which path you commit to for progress. Like many games there will always be one path forward for progression and one or two other paths for pickups/items. It's never obvious which one is which...and in some cases if you go the path of story progression by accident without having picked up the items down other paths then you can sometimes be locked out of backtracking. This kills the mood for me when it happens BUT it is due to the games age. Signposting paths and managing the players movement wasn't a priority back when this was released so just be aware that the path you take might close behind you meaning replaying the checkpoint/level are your only options. Not a massive negative point but for 100% runs this will kick you in the balls a bit!!\n\nPlayer controls are a bit bloated in my opinion to with many buttons doing multiple functions depending on what's happening around you. RT is the most frustrating. You press RT to grab an enemy BUT you also need to press RT to pick items off the floor or interact. SO...an enemy throws a grenade at you whilst another enemy pushes forwards towards you. You want to pickup and throw the grenade so you press RT but that other enemy is now in your face so you grab it instead of the grenade. Having this happen again and again during a fight is pure nightmare fuel and you will scream and shout at your monitor!! It's infuriating how busy the control system is...! And that is only one example...\n\nTip - Turn on Anisotropic filtering on your graphics card...the game looks a bit nicer with it enabled!!\n\nAnd this is a long game...it doesn't over stay it's welcome but you won't be finishing it quickly. Completing levels often shows you stats revealing that you've not picked up some items giving you reason to replay. There are even trials that unlock that pose a particular challenge in the level like not using healing items. And the best news is that for a game where you might die a lot...the loading is SUPER fast so retrying a hard section is painless in terms of loading times. I guess the only thing that drags is the story at the end of the game. It just goes on and on and on...not sure if Hideo Kojima's input in this game added to the large number of long cutscenes but it does feel like a Metal Gear Solid game at this point with just an overload of story within cutscenes!! Overall, you're probably looking at anything between 25 and 40 hours for a complete playthrough on Hard depending on how much you back track/replay levels.\n\n8/10 - Just try and be patient...it's a slow start but you will have a great time playing it through til the end.

The difficulty is pretty fair the whole way through.... but then the developers decided to crank up the difficulty in the DLC.

The soundtrack chose to forget about the gothic influences of its predecessors to deliver an epic orchastral score. SFX is solid enough to make the monsters and environments that surround you believable.\n\n- Replay Value -\nYour first playthrough might take about ten hours but returning to previous areas to find every upgrades is advised.

Worth grabbing on a sale if you want a nice looking if not mindblowing hack and slash experience. Just don't go in expecting Castlevania and you'll probably have fun if you enjoy this genre.\n-\nI'm a huge fan of the original Castlevania series, and while this isn't *really* a Castlevania game and does not feel like one it's still a pretty solid and enjoyable title on it's own. \n\nFirst off this is set in a completely different universe from the original Castlevania games, the only real callbacks being characters who are named after vaguely similar counterparts in the original series as a homage. For example there's a werewolf named Cornell, but aside from both characters being werewolves he has nothing in common with the Cornell from \"Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness\" on the N64. \n\nI have to say that the scenery and overall art direction and graphics are beautiful even over a decade after this game's initial release. The gameplay is mostly fun if not mind blowing. I'm told it's a pretty standard God of War clone gameplay wise, but I'm not familiar enough with that series to say. \n\nNone of the iconic Castlevania music returns in any notable capacity. The music that IS in the game is fine but a year after playing LoS I can't recall a single track as outstanding in my memory the way tracks like \"Bloody Tears\", \"Wicked Child\" \"The Sinking Old Sanctuary\" and so many other songs from the classic series do. (Though in fairness, I did get to experience those songs over multiple games and years.) I'd say the music here is serviceable, it's fine. It sets the mood but doesn't stick with you.\n\nI do have to dock points for the ending though. Most of the game is fun enough, but the true ending to the story is hidden in DLC expansions (thankfully included in this Ultimate Edition) with gameplay I can only describe as unfair and frustrating without being enjoyable. Also the cutscenes in these DLC expansions use a storyboard art style, this art style is actually beautiful and would be fine if it didn't stick out like a sore thumb (both aesthetically and as an obvious cost cutting measure) when contrasted with the cutscenes in the main game. So after beating a couple short but frustrating and unfun expansions the cutscenes for the true ending of LoS' story don't quite match the feel of the main game. These problems aren't enough to sour the whole game in my opinion, but are worth mentioning.\n\nSo yeah, if you see it on sale and fancy a hack'n slash I'd say grab it. $30 is a bit much to ask for a game as long in the tooth as this though.", "timestamp_created": 1609552148, "timestamp_updated": 1609630116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501510560512542725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83717050": {"recommendationid": "83717050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012126098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3312, "last_played": 1618689639}, "language": "english", "review": "Magnifico !", "timestamp_created": 1609495405, "timestamp_updated": 1609495405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83698337": {"recommendationid": "83698337", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977260118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1610848777}, "language": "english", "review": "Disregard my hours played here because I've completed this game several times over on Xbox 360. Now, before we get into the review, it's important I clarify what this game is. This game is a single player Character Action Game in the vein of Devil May Cry or God of War. Please have a look at the following:\n\n1. Fixed camera\n2. Linear story progression\n3. Only 1 playable character\n4. No RPG mechanics, only DMC style upgrades\n5. Quick Time Events\n6.  Non-canonical story\n7. Must play with a controller for a good experience\n\nIf you don't care about these things and want to know if this is a good game then the answer is YES. Let me convince you why...\n\nCastlevania LoS feels like a complete experience. Nowhere does this game fall short in delivering its money's worth. The story starts off sort of uninteresting but around chapter 4 it sets a few hooks that will interest you in completing it. The characters are well written and even have stellar voice acting. There's a lot of passion here that really sells the characters and their experiences, even if some of the writing is a bit trite (nothing like hearing \"You Lie\" delivered like Orlando Bloom).\n\nGameplay wise there's enough variety in enemies to carry you through the whole game. It's essentially broken up into 3 major Acts with Act 1 being the weakest of the 3. If you don't quite enjoy the first 2 hours of gameplay that's understandable. You're very limited in the beginning and the combat suffers without the added challenge and complexity of later encounters. Don't worry, it will get better around Chapter 4.\n\nWhere a lot of reviews really fail is explaining how gorgeous Castlevania is. The team at MercurySteam NAILED the aesthetic of the world and each stage is painstakingly crafted to feel lived in and real. You'll travel through fetid swamps filled with goblins to ancient ruins overlooking a sunken city bathed in a warm shade of sunset. And what Castlevania would be complete without a Castle? Don't worry, this one delivers. Ooooooh does it deliver. Each environment is lovingly crafted and perhaps, imo, is the number 1 reason to play this game. \n\nEnemy design is stellar too, with each of them fitting a role in their sandbox. You have cannon fodder units, brawlers, large beasts, magic wielders, and puzzle enemies. Each sandbox has their own distinct monsters so you won't get too tired of fighting them. Bosses, however, do vary in their execution. This game has 3 Shadow of the Colossus style bosses that fail to execute that idea. The Colossus of Rhodes is a better attempt than anything seen here. But each of the Lords of Shadow and some of the in-between bosses are fun to fight. It's standard video game boss fare though and won't exactly rock your socks off.\n\nThe story is non-canon, but it's one of my favorites from the franchise. Gabriel is a great character who is fun to inhabit but also at times feels off the rails. He's wonderfully voice acted and the animators did a fantastic job selling his emotions during pivotal scenes. Zobek doesn't fare as well. His character model feels....off? Like it didn't get enough polygons to deliver the same level of creativity. But his voice actor is Patrick Stewart so I'll let it pass. The lore of this world is told through notes written by your fellow Templars of the Holy Order. Like the Ninja Scrolls in Ninja Gaiden, these lore tidbits are told from the first person and are well written. Some divulge secrets, some advance the story, and others are clearly jokes put in by the writers.\n\nWhile the visuals in this game are gorgeous, in 2020 the sound design still reins supreme. From every clank of metal, thunderous thump, and insidious hiss the soundscape never struggles to reel you into the world. The soundtrack is full of bombastic orchestral pieces during fights with somber songs filling in the negative space between. I played this both with headphones and on my 5.1 home theater with RP Klipsch speakers. This game fully utilizes the space of the speakers and fleshes out nicely on a good setup.\n\nIf you've read it this far, you're obviously interested. Well, here's my final selling point: flawless performance. This game runs like a dream on most hardware. I used to play it 4k 60fps on a GTX 980 and now, with my latest 34inch monitor with 2070 Super, I play it at 120hFPS 4k locked. Never a dip. graphics settings are barebones though. So I suppose if you're using an intel chip for graphics you will struggle here. There's native 21:9 support for menus AND cutscenes, a rarity even in 2020 (which is a shame, looking at you Cyberpunk 2077).\n\nSo, is Lords of Shadow a bad game? No, it's not. It may not be the game most people wanted but for everyone else they've always enjoyed it after I gifted it to them. Buy it on sale as it LITERALLY goes on sale every few months. $7 is a steal. \n", "timestamp_created": 1609470973, "timestamp_updated": 1609470973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586036443710327148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83662046": {"recommendationid": "83662046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126443995", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1629821294}, "language": "english", "review": "Noice", "timestamp_created": 1609431953, "timestamp_updated": 1609431953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83605157": {"recommendationid": "83605157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173158017", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 1705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1516, "last_played": 1610105253}, "language": "spanish", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1609369412, "timestamp_updated": 1609369412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83525953": {"recommendationid": "83525953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214146900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4042, "last_played": 1607732403}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego para pasar el rato", "timestamp_created": 1609290395, "timestamp_updated": 1609290395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83511323": {"recommendationid": "83511323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113496314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2262, "last_played": 1609195136}, "language": "english", "review": "The first Castlevania in this new trilogy is... definitely something.\nThe thing is, when you try to do everything at the same time, nothing is done correctly. That's the case here, unfortunately. This new entry tries to throw references, inspirations, minigames and novelty together, but nothing really works.\n\nWhat you get is a clone of God of War that sometimes thinks it's Shadow of the Colossus, in the world of Castlevania. All of this cut into about 40 levels that never feel linked together. You spend a level platforming with a couple fights, the next one is a boss, and the one after that will probably be a series of 5 fights and a puzzle. And we repeat that a dozen times...\nThe many puzzles vary a lot in quality. A few actually make you feel satisfied when you solve them, the great majority are boring and uninspired, and what's left is ridiculous. Poorly explained (when explained), obscure mechanics used once in the whole game, requiring luck... That's not pretty.\n\nIf the puzzles were the only issue, it'd still be okay, maybe even good. They're not.\nThe double magic system is never a success in any game, why try that here ? It's not awful this time, but it's not pleasant to use either. Few combos are actually useful, and apart from a parry that works most of the time, the game end up being a mashfest of X because Y doesn't do any damage. The jumps are really sketchy for a game that relies heavily on those sequences, and once you get the double jump, doodoo hits the fan, as the jumps in the previous levels are not programmed for a character with 2 jumps... Really ?\nThat's another issue. The game encourages you to revisit levels to get upgrades you couldn't get for dumb reasons. Easiest example : one of the first upgrade is on a rock in the middle of the road, but too high for one jump... And they're all like that. That's not how getting upgrades to have access to new areas work, I'm sorry.\n\nThe bosses... Half of them are okay, the other half are in the wrong game. If I wanted to play Shadow of the Colossus, I wouldn't have bought a Castlevania game. An example of a failure : The Stone Titan requires you to stay as far away as possible (?), remain still for about 10 seconds (??), wait for the boss to decide to throw a rock so you can start climbing on him... (???). Yeah, no. That's not a fight.\n\nThere's so much more, as well.\nHalf of the enemies are annoying to fight. Some mechanics required to beat sections or bosses are not explained, and a look at the controls is sometimes no enough. Your starting life is way too low, and special weapons are mostly gadgets. The unblockable attacks are sometimes faster than those you can parry, and take half your life of a fully upgraded bar on harder difficulties. Your life is not replenished in between levels. That makes sense in a classic Castlevania, not in something that's cut into 40 pieces...\n\nThere's more, but I think that makes it obvious enough.\nIf you only play the game once and forget it is supposed to be a Castlevania title, treat it as an action game with too many puzzles, you can have an okay time. You could even potentially give it 6/10 and rate it as \"positive\". That's when i went for the trials, which I thought could be fun, that I realized all that was wrong and how everything felt sketchy at best. Nothing fully works the way it's meant to, despite some pretty environments. \n\nI expected a lot more, and couldn't forget I bought a Castlevania game. That's unfortunate, as a new gen Castlevania in 3D had a huge potential. A big disappointment with a lot of ideas that never really work.

"review": "[h1] Intro [/h1]\n\nAh, Lords of Shadow. Developed by MercurySteam with help from Climax Studios comes another entry in the storied Castlevania franchise. This one has been compared to God of War, and even Shadow of the Colossus in some of it's boss fights. Does it live up to God of War or other character action titles?\n\nI'd say yeah.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe game takes you through various environments that are still pretty stunning today. I really like the art direction, and when the camera zooms out to show you a wide shot of certain vistas, it's very pretty. I do have one small caveat with the graphics though. Sometimes there are video files that seem to be compressed, or taken from the PS3/360 versions of the game, and it's a bit jarring going from a nice fluid cut scene into those. It's not a deal breaker, but I wanted to mention it.\nCharacter models look great, and the environments are beautiful too.\n\nOn the PC, the game allows a resolution of up to 1080p, and runs at a silky smooth 60 fps. You can also modify some graphics settings if you can't exactly hit that 60 fps target.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe game play is fairly standard for these kind of games. You have area attacks and heavy attacks, for multiple foes or just one. You do get some fun moves, but I relied on most of the same combos throughout the game. I also feel like air combat isn't as fluid as in GoW, as most of my moves didn't reliably connect in the air. The parry system is pretty cool though, and the main way you heal or do more damage is neat. You have these two magic meters, one for healing and one for more damage. They can get filled by focus, which is given when you find a fountain, or when you defeat enemies in combat. If you do well in combat, you'll fill up a focus bar which goes down completely on one hit. This is used to gain focus orbs on each subsequent hit on enemies, so having a full focus bar and using AoE attacks is a great way to gain magic. I do wish the focus bar only went down a little bit on hit, or at least maybe halfway. Doing different combos is a great way to fill up the focus meter quicker, which means more healing energy or more damage dealing depending on the situation. To aid you in combat, you also have sub weapons such as daggers or holy water. They are very useful, and can definitely help you get out of a bad situation. The daggers though are really only useful the early game, as most of the other monsters you face are resistant to them.\n\nThis game also takes inspiration from Uncharted in it's climbing and platforming sections. These are fun for brief respite between combat arenas, though some of them do take a while to get through. I did have some trouble where Gabriel wouldn't grab the ledge, and that caused some deaths. You also have to solve various puzzles throughout the adventure, and if you complete you'll get experience which you can use to upgrade Gabriel's abilities. The puzzles are all pretty good, and some of them really make you think.\n\n[h1] Music / Replay Value [/h1]\n\nThe music in the game is very great, and while the songs aren't what you'd call catchy, they do an excellent job of keeping you invested in the world and story. The game also offers collectibles for you to find in the form of health and magic upgrades, and sub weapon upgrades for some slight replay value in the levels. Speaking of replay value, there isn't just the upgrades to collect. Each level has a trial you can complete, which is used to fill up your completion percentage. For more replay value, you can also finish each level on the hardest difficulty, which is only available after finishing the story.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe story in the game is actually pretty good, albeit the ending is pretty confusing where the main character kinda changes personality abruptly. To put it simply, you play as Gabriel Belmont, a warrior for the Brotherhood of Light out on a quest to defeat the Lords of Shadow, and to find a mask that is said to be able to bring back dead people. It has some great voice acting, and the cut-scenes are well directed too. The story has some big twists and turns, and all in all was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but it does it's job well.\n\n[h1] DLC [/h1]\n\nThe Ultimate Edition of LoS comes with the two DLC chapters (Reverie and Resurrection). I won't spoil anything related to the story, but I'm glad they are here. The boss in Resurrection offers a nice challenge, and it's nice re-visiting an older area in Reverie again. The only real complaint I had with the DLC is the cut scenes. Due to budgets, the cut scenes are offered in a unique comic book style. It works most of the time, though when it tries to portray action, it's pretty hard to understand what's going on as the animation isn't super fluid.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nThis was a long review, but hopefully it helps you decide whether you want this game or not. At $30, I'd say it's worth it as I played for almost 30 hours and that was collecting all of the upgrades and completing the game on Normal. I did get it on sale though, so maybe wait for that.", "timestamp_created": 1608410441, "timestamp_updated": 1608410629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82650492": {"recommendationid": "82650492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322889649", "num_games_owned": 650, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1608327638}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fine for the first chapter, almost fun even, then getting into the second chapter they start throwing enemies with barely telegraphed attacks that can knock down your health in 5-6 hits, enemies that are hard to hit because they are constantly in mid-air and there is no way to hit them effectively because if they hit you you are sent tumbling uncontrollably back to the ground, grappling seems to be the only method. Also the camera controls are disgusting in how it makes simple maps needlessly complex, if this game wasn't made a year prior I'd almost say the director of Taken 3 had a hand in this. The tipping point was the second boss fight, where the big fucker just T-poses on you while flinging rocks on your position, no hints on the boss on how to get onto it to hit its weak points. Then the chick you're with screams \"Wait for your moment!\", the camera pans up, and nothing is shown indicating what you're supposed to do. This same chick was screeching constantly the last level on how many shards you have and how many more you need but is hopelessly vague during this boss fight and the level design gives no indication on how to engage the boss, unlike the first boss that had similar weak points sprawled on its body.

The game is a shameless GOW ripoff that ditches almost all of castlevania game design. The levels are boring and uninteresting, some being super confusing and poorly laid out. Theres like 20 secrests in every level and theyre hidden in super hard to find spots, which wouldnt be a big deal but its how you get more life and mana, which is required since you start with none, so youre forced to use a walkthrough, which is stupid design., especially as theres basically none if you follow the main path. There is good level design, and the combat design is decent as well, especially mixing the option of life gaining vs increased damage. \n\nThe game is wayyyyyy too long, which is a weird complaint with this game but since it feels so repetitive and theres not much variation it overstays its welcome significantly.  The story is meh and the two twists endings, one of which you know going in and the other one is super telegraphed. There is good enemy variety. The boss fights are decent as well, and the overall difficulty is pretty good. The platforming and camera are both pretty horrible which for a castlevania is a big \"woof\". \n\nI was still going to give this game a \"barely recommend\" until i had to play one of the worst, if not the worst designed boss fight ive ever seen, which is a sign these designers are morons with no idea what theyre doing. The final boss of the dlc, which continues the main story and is released as part of the steam game, so im still counting it, is designed incorrectly in every way imaginable. This guy loses armor in single spots and you have to attack it. First off its super stupid to have to attack specific spots on only 1 side when hes constantly moving and attacking, especially because of the horrible hit detection that when youre attacking right at it, it counts as hitting around it for some reason. But the worst part is you have to get close, bc for some reason theres no way to deal ranged damage in this game, as your chains barely reach out. This is so stupid because the boss has multiple slam abilities that create a shockwave, which in a normal game you can jump to dodge, but in this game for some reason it creates an invisible wall above the shockwave that hurts you if you damage meaning you need to just be back. So encouraging only close spot specific damage while the boss has multiple air+ground shockwaves he can do at a moments notice, see the problem here? Now this wouldnt be too terrible, but then they do the unthinkable and make the spots on ONE ARM OR ONE SHOULDER, so now you have to jump/double jump in order to attack. Now they would only do something like that if you had an air dodge, so theres manueverability right? Think again because that would make too much sense. So now you have a air attack without any way to cancel attacks or move in the air against a guy who can instant attack with aoe/air and ground at a moments notice. Sometimes after an attack he pauses so you can get a few hits in, other times he doesnt, some of which he punches the air so you get hurt trying to attack him which you never know when. If you think this is stupid enough, it gets EVEN WORSE. The boss has a sideways cleave attack you cant side dodge, and can only  back dodge if youre a far back which you wouldnt bve since you have to damage up close and theres no way he telegraphs his moves, so only a forward dodge works on this ability to get under it. So what do these idiot devs do, they make it so on the final phase he can spot track you with the cleave and the only working dodge DOESNT EVEN WORK ANYMORE. This means you have to stay super far away so you can back dodge it, but remember you also have to spot target and hit an area with poor hitbox detection while being close since you have no range while having to do it in the air with  no maneuverability or ability to move/cancel or dodge while he has air+ground aoe damage. This leads to having to try to land 1-2 attacks and then hope he doesnt cleave much or instant attack after last attack or air punch you while hurting him and that you get lucky with him missing randomly, leading to constant dying due to poor collision detection from his attacks as well and all mentioned above reasons. Some people would call it hard but instead of like dark souls this is all off poorly designed systems that all conflict with one another as if the devs were too stupid to realize it. That was the final nail in the coffin for this sh!t sandwhich of a game and why i give it two thumbs down.  5.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1606072592, "timestamp_updated": 1606072723, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438848912715911865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79674446": {"recommendationid": "79674446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391381631", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1360, "last_played": 1606035345}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Brillante", "timestamp_created": 1606071612, "timestamp_updated": 1606071612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79664894": {"recommendationid": "79664894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052277290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1328, "last_played": 1606060946}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is good, great even, but it has two major flaws (for me  at least).\nThe first one is camera.

The worst thing is that the platforming is not hard or challenging, it is easy, but really tedious, having long jumping sequences and some stages with platforms moving too slow (as if they were really trying to prolong the time of gameplay), like in the clocktower. Even some bosses consist in around 90% platforming, like the giant ones and the dragon... They are tremendously boring \"battles\" where you have to be climbing slowly trying to get to certain weak spots which you can hit, while the enemy is trying to throw you out so you restart the whole climbing again (I just can't describe in words how boring were those fights).\n\nThe puzzle sections could be interesting for some people who likes this kind of thing, but this is not what a Castlevania game is supposed to be like, and for me it was mostly easy or tedious (the music box stage is just awful).\n\nTalking about the cutscenes section... it is exaggeratedly prolonged. At the start they seemed pretty well done and sometimes interesting, but there are just a lot of them (and sometimes, after finish one, you play for less than a minute before the next one starts). So I got easily tired (I still watched them all).\n\nThe combat system could be good (and, actually, should be), but there are more than a couple of things that just don't work here (and I am talking of my experience of playing the game on hard difficulty). First of all, the fixed camera, which you can't change, makes the fighting too uncomfortable (and sometimes, even exploring doesn't feel right) and in some fights it picks a really weird angle to be fixed, making easy for enemies to hide from your sight. Also, the game is really trying to make you use jumping in your combos, with a lot of attacks requiring to be mid-air, and, to be honest, they would look pretty cool, but the problem is that you can't move/dash in the middle of an air combo, and almost every enemy has an attack that will hit you in the air, so you will get a lot of damage if you try them. I actually died a lot of times at the start when I went for this, but the game became a lot easier when I stopped trying combos that included jumping. This will make that the fights will be mostly about striking and dashing, which, after some chapters will do the combat section very boring. Also the hitboxes with which the enemies hit you is broken, particularly with bosses; they can make a punch while standing in the ground, with you in mid-air, and they will hit you; sometimes they do a dash attack that doesn't get even close to you, but they wil hit you; and sometimes they will do a swing that doesn't reach you, but it will hit you anyways (and I realized because there is a slow-motion sequence with the attack that killed you).\n\nOn the other hand, one of the worst things in the game are the quick time events (QTE), particularly in boss fights. You can be kicking a boss's ass, then, at some points, a cutscene will start, and you will have to be really careful, because at some point there will be a quick time event (sometimes even 20 seconds after the cutscene started, maybe trying to catch you off guard, so it is really hard to actually focus on what is going on in the cutscene... You just don't want to miss the QTE), and if you miss it... you will get damage (sometimes you will die) and the boss will get his/her hp back... for some reason, forcing you to basically restart the battle with less hp. That is annoying and doesn't have any sense at all. It is particularly annoying with the giant bosses, because there is a really long way until you can hit a weak spot, and it can take more than a few minutes, so starting that all over can be really frustrating.\n\nFinally, the dlc... This is just worse than the main game (unless you actually liked the game). They just got rid of all the battle sequences, and gave you some stages filled with platforming and puzzles, and some sections where you can control a new character, who is the most monotonous character you can ask in a hack & slash game (it only has 2 attacks, and no combo's variations). There is a hide and seek section and it ends with an awful boss fight (full of QTE).\n\nSo... What is good about the game? Graphics are pretty good. I would have really liked to play the first Darksiders with this graphic's quality. Also, even if there is a lot of tiresome stuff in this game, some fights can be good, like one against the male vampire boss (which I would have enjoyed greatly, until the QTE started), but still not good enough to recommend this game. And, finally, for some reason I really liked the cutscene that comes after you finish the main game... It actually made me consider playing the next game.\n\nIn summary, I don't recommend it at all, unless you don't like hack & slash games and you are looking for some 3d puzzle platformer... or you are just looking for a really different kind of hack & slash. For me it is a 2.5/10. Really bad game (probably it would have been a 4/10 without the dlc).", "timestamp_created": 1604889794, "timestamp_updated": 1606060317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493781596422195435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78966294": {"recommendationid": "78966294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030028749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1605641528}, "language": "english", "review": "It may be not THE best Castlevania game, at least for some people, but this game is still pretty awesome.

Fortunately, the designs they made for the game were the biggest reason that make me to playing it.\n\nGameplay mechanics were at least playable. There were so many lacking things but in general, it had an enjoyable hack and slash sense. It was not a God of War in combat system but better than Darksiders. Special moves and skills would work much better if they would increase the number of variations. This is one of the general problems of the game. The Classic series was known for having so many skill and item options. Even if you were a Belmont and your primary weapon was the Vampire Killer whip, it would still give you many other weapons to use. The choices were so many and you could build up your character with attributes by choices. And this game wasn't even bothered with something like that. Thanks KONAMI.\n\nI think the most hated thing by the fans was skipping Metroidvania elements. Castlevania was meant something and KONAMI ruined it by this game. Symphony of the Night was a revolutionary work in the 90s. Because there was a great improvement between Classicvanias and Metroidvanias. These two genres were different but you could see the elements in Metroidvania that were inherited by Classicvanias. Although it was new. You could say \"I am playing a Castlevania game.\" There was connected progress. As I am telling you until this point, this game is not a Castlevania game.

Bien es cierto que luego me despegu\u00e9 de esa saga al pasarme al mundo del PC, pero hay determinadas cosas que nunca se olvidan.\n\nSiempre quedar\u00e1 en mi memoria ese magn\u00edfico e innovador juego llamado Castlevania II: Simon\u2019s Quest, con su incre\u00edble ciclo de d\u00eda y noche que me dej\u00f3 con la boca abierta all\u00e1 por 1987, y aut\u00e9ntico precursor del g\u00e9nero metroidvania por mucho que Castlevania: Symphony of the Night y su creador, Toru Hagihara, quieran erigirse como creadores del mismo DIEZ a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s. \n\nS\u00ed, en efecto, fue Hitoshi Akamatsu el primero en dar forma a un modo de comprender las plataformas y la acci\u00f3n de un modo totalmente innovador. Y todo aquel que lo haya jugado sabr\u00e1 de sobra que esto es as\u00ed y que Simon\u2019s Quest es un metroidvania de manual, en 1987, ojo. Aunque fue Symphony of the Night realmente el que impuls\u00f3 y dio a conocer al gran p\u00fablico este g\u00e9nero que hoy en d\u00eda puede que est\u00e9 en su mejor momento.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es esto importante y que tiene que ver con Lords of Shadow? A priori podr\u00eda parecer que nada, pero realmente tiene mucho que ver. \n\nCuando empec\u00e9 a jugar a Lords of Shadow mi decepci\u00f3n fue brutal, para qu\u00e9 negarlo. Castlevania siempre fue una saga que ten\u00eda una personalidad propia, una que todos quer\u00edan copiar o imitar, pero en el caso de Lords of Shadow esto no fue as\u00ed. Realmente Lords of Shadow es un juego que quiere imitar a otros, especialmente a God of War, y eso provoca que por el camino se pierda mucho de su esencia. \n\n\u00bfLo convierte eso en un mal juego? Realmente no, pero todo lo que hizo grande a Castlevania no est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed, no aparece por ning\u00fan lado y no se le espera. Salvo por el apellido Belmont y el lore poco m\u00e1s, aunque eso no es poco y adem\u00e1s en ese aspecto supera con creces a lo visto en anteriores Castlevania.\n\nTeniendo eso bien claro, el juego si hace algunas cosas realmente bien. La saga Castlevania siempre ha sido un icono dentro del mundo de los videojuegos, pero ni ten\u00eda el mejor de los argumentos, ni su lore era para tirar cohetes, eso seguro. En ambos casos eran bastante planos a partes iguales. En Lords of Shadow esto cambia para mejor. \n\nSin duda, una de las mejores cosas que tiene este t\u00edtulo es la manera que tiene de contarnos las cosas, muy detalladamente, y el magn\u00edfico lore del que hace gala.\n\nPodr\u00e1s leer toda la informaci\u00f3n detallada sobre los personajes de la historia, los monstruos, las armas, los lugares, etc.. y todo no hace sino engrandecer a\u00fan m\u00e1s la experiencia y convertirlo en algo realmente completo.\n\nA su vez, la ambientaci\u00f3n es magn\u00edfica, con unos parajes muy bien representados a los que siempre acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 una banda sonora muy bien seleccionada y que imprime grandes momentos a todo lo que estemos viviendo.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, su duraci\u00f3n es realmente notoria, mucho m\u00e1s que en cualquier otro juego de la saga, pudiendo alargarse durante decenas de horas si queremos explorarlo todo y descubrir todos sus secretos. Durante todo ese tiempo iremos descubriendo las motivaciones del personaje, sus conflictos internos y sus anhelos que no parecen llegar a cumplirse. En este aspecto, la experiencia es realmente fant\u00e1stica.\n\nEn lo tocante a su parte m\u00e1s puramente jugable, el juego pasa directamente a ser un hack n\u2019 slash, muy palomitero en algunos momentos y con grandes dosis de acci\u00f3n que, si bien tocan levemente el g\u00e9nero de las plataformas, no lo hace del todo bien y adem\u00e1s est\u00e1n excesivamente prefabricadas.\n\nRealmente el juego es un hack n\u2019 slash en toda regla, con sus inmensos jefes finales esper\u00e1ndonos al final de cada episodio, y no es que lo haga mal, pero se siente a algo ya visto con anterioridad. Realmente hay m\u00e1s cosas positivas que negativas en su aspecto jugable, pero eso no quita para que haya determinadas cosas que chirr\u00eden bastante. \n\nPor ejemplo, el n\u00famero de paredes invisibles es ABRUMADOR, as\u00ed como los entornos pasillescos, de los que se abusa sobremanera. Pero lo peor de todo, y con diferencia, es su c\u00e1mara.\n\nLords of Shadow usa una c\u00e1mara fija en un entorno de acci\u00f3n en 3D, lo cual es, b\u00e1sicamente, una estupidez, ya que nos dejar\u00e1 vendidos en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n porque no pocas veces no veremos a los enemigos que nos atacan desde atr\u00e1s, as\u00ed como el mismo entorno que nos bloquear\u00e1 la visi\u00f3n. En serio, en algunos momentos puede ser MUY molesta.\n\nAfortunadamente, para la lucha con los jefes finales la c\u00e1mara si se podr\u00e1 girar, lo cual es muy de agradecer, pero es dif\u00edcil entender por qu\u00e9 no se utiliz\u00f3 para todo el juego. Lo m\u00e1s probable es que esto fuera as\u00ed para tapar todas las costuras gr\u00e1ficas y de dise\u00f1o, si no, no hay otra explicaci\u00f3n l\u00f3gica.\n\nA d\u00eda de hoy, la calidad gr\u00e1fica sigue siendo bastante potable, y soporta resoluciones hasta 4K sin problema alguno, aunque la calidad de las cinem\u00e1ticas ya es otro cantar, ya que est\u00e1n en 720 con un aliasing que da m\u00e1s miedo que cualquier enemigo al que podamos enfrentarnos. Sin embargo, es algo totalmente secundario a efectos de diversi\u00f3n.\n\nEn definitiva, Lords of Shadow est\u00e1 lejos de ser el mejor Castlevania que haya jugado, pero s\u00ed es el que mejor lore tiene y el que tiene mejor argumento e historia. Ambos elementos ayudan tremendamente a querer seguir la trama y saber c\u00f3mo acaba todo, independientemente de que su jugabilidad est\u00e9 algo \u201cempacada\u201d y que el sistema de c\u00e1mara pueda provocar m\u00e1s de una frustraci\u00f3n.\n\nSi buscas un t\u00edtulo que albergue grandes dosis de acci\u00f3n, mucho lore y una buena historia, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow seguro que te dejar\u00e1 totalmente satisfecho y colmar\u00e1 todas tus expectativas, o al menos, la mayor parte de ellas.", "timestamp_created": 1603317925, "timestamp_updated": 1603318940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664136111736297607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77860885": {"recommendationid": "77860885", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031130032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1104, "last_played": 1603182808}, "language": "english", "review": "for full price this  game is n ot worth it.

However, it is also one of the most genuinely beautiful and enjoyable games I had ever played when it first came out in 2010, and I am pleased to say I enjoy it now as well, even if I need a plug-in controller to play it well.\n\nThe combat, exploration and puzzle-solving, if you're used to God of War style combos and movement, should all be familiar. It has the same system of fixed cameras and spectacle fighting, where more upgrades are found through play and more moves and combos are bought from a menu. I find the controls solid and enjoyable, even as someone who is useless at pulling off complex combos and resort to basic attacks for the most part.\n\nWhere is this game truly shines the brightest, and where it won me over, was in the presentation.

Watch the Netflix series instead.Reviews giving this praise are most likely from those with low expectations, little gaming experience, or whose entire concept of gaming revolves around Assassins Creed.  This game is mediocre at best.  If there was a neutral option, I would give it.  The reviews stating that the game looks good visually are correct, especially for a 2010 game.  However, the controls are inconsistent and buggy (I can't count how many times my character would jump right after a respawn) making levels like Music Box just abhorrent, the camera is unacceptable for anything made after 1999, some of the voice acting is just atrocious (about on par with \"WHAT IS A MAN?!\"), player experience is a catastrophe (must watch cut scenes over again unless you go into the menu and select skip - 3 button presses that can't be \"mashed\" through just to skip), music is misleading and bland (battle music continues), the puzzles aren't hard just cryptic for no reason, and the story is just average.Overall it feels like an unfinished game, worthy of early access... even 10 years on.  Do not spend the $29.99 asking price for this game, it's simply not worth it.  It may have been worth $30 in 2010 and maybe $15 today (2020), but I would suggest getting it for $10 or less.  If you absolutely must know the story despite all of this, watch the GamerThumb videos on the red and white play button site, skip this, and save yourself some money for beer or smoke.

This is very far from a generic god of war clone as some will say. From a castlevania fan's point of view this is an amazing game. The visuals are amazing. The characters models and the environment are full of detail, the scenery is always something to stare at and the special effects are colorful and vibrant as they should. There is a huge variety of environments so nothing seems as if you've seen it before. The sound is crystal with an awesome orchestrical soundtrack (typical castlevania quality) and the voice-overs featuring Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle speak for themselves. The gameplay is excellent. It combines fighting, platforming, puzzle-solving together and it's varied enough that never bores. The fighting itself is deep and rewarding. No more mindless button mashing. The game is very immersive and features a beautiful story. Another big plus for this game is its length. Quite honestly I don't understand what people want in a game any more. This is a beautiful game apparently made with love and care (cheesy but true) and every attention to detail as possible from people who really like the original castlevania games.

So much so that there's an entire genre named after it and \"Metroid\": Metroidvania is a term used to describe games with a heavy focus on unlocking new areas through power-ups and backtracking. With that said, however, \"Lords of Shadow\" is distinctively not a Metroidvania game. Because by the time of its release, it mutated into something completely different.\n\n\"Lords of Shadow\" really is a \"God of War\" game, with the occasional \"Shadow of the Colossus\" bosses here and there. It became a linear hack-and-slash with a heavy focus on combos and platforming: a game trying to be relevant for its time. Of course the game tries to maintain some of its DNA alive: there's some backtracking, to be sure. But the world you navigate in is not a series of places that seamlessly lead to each other; it's really a set of separate levels. Besides, backtracking is limited merely to the collecting of more power-ups, rather than unlocking new levels and such: it's not mandatory for progression. So the game does have a Metroidvania element, but it's faint, and it's there much more for a matter of keeping some sort of identity for the series.\n\nSo this is a game that heavily departs from its predecessors, trying its hand at different ideas. And from my part, it succeeds with flying colours... but it's not without its flaws.\n\nThe game has this old-fashioned fixed camera gameplay, in the sense that you have no control whatsoever over it. When you go from one area to another, the camera may abruptly change to such an angle that your character's movement will change suddenly: this is a big reason why games today don't have that sort of camera anymore. It's not as frustrating because this doesn't happen in combat, but it happens in exploration. On top of that, the fixed camera makes certain areas difficult to read, and it also doesn't help in precise platforming, which you'll be doing a lot in the game.\n\nSince you can't control the camera, which is historically a function delegated to the mouse, developers must have imagined there would be no use for the mouse. So the game has no mouse support even at menus. The key mapping is all set for the keyboard by default, and it feels incredibly cumbersome to use the keyboard for everything. Thankfully, you can customise the controls to include the mouse buttons, and to make for something more intuitive. But then again, having a controller is always preferable.\n\nMany times you'll be facing multiple enemies at once, but it lacks a lock on mechanic which could have been really helpful. You can dodge and block enemy attacks, and if you time your blocks right, you can cause your adversaries to drop their guards, oddly similarly to \"Sekiro\". The game is full of different kinds of enemies, and they require different tactics to be better taken down: for example, silver daggers are great against werewolves. At higher difficulties, enemy behaviour and resistance won't change, but they'll definitely inflict more damage. Some bigger enemies can be stunned and then mounted for the proposes of opening or making new paths. The more you kill your foes, the more points you gain, being able to unlock new moves.\n\nSome combos are pretty effective, but there's no way you'll memorise everything. You'll just keep up with some of them, and most of the times, you'll be just button-mashing, getting some combos by chance. There's also the medallions, which will prove essential for combat: when activated, the blue one restores you health with hits, while the red one increases your attack power considerably. The game is also filled with quick-time events - at first they don't seem so bad, but it doesn't take long before they overstay their welcome and start becoming annoying.\n\nAs I said, the game is really this linear set of levels - each with its collectables. Once you complete a level, you'll unlock a trial mode for it, which was perhaps meant to make second runs more interesting. But I found myself just repeating a level I just concluded to beat the trial already - I would have much preferred if such trials were available from the moment you access the levels. Such trials are mostly quite fun, but some are frustrating and downright broken: at one point, the game asked me to dispose of more enemies than it could provide, and the solution for that would be to reload a checkpoint.\n\nYou'll also come across some puzzles, and while some are pleasant enough and very satisfying to solve, others are really strange. You don't even know how they work, let alone how to solve them. But they'll only make for a small part of the game, and besides, you'll usually find a scroll near them with the solution, which you can unlock by the cost of the puzzle's reward.\n\n\"LoS\" is a reboot of the franchise, more or less introducing a new continuity for the series. The game is narrated by the one and only Patrick Stewart, and unlike in \"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\" (another game from the XBox 360 era that I'm also currently revisiting), this is not a mere cameo. Your character however is voiced by Robert Carlyle, who brings a lot of gravitas to what could have been an otherwise unremarkable playable protagonist.\n\nThe visuals are just splendid. This is a 2010 game that looks amazingly well even today. However, many of the cutscenes are pre-rendered and sometimes very long, and you can't easily skip them: you have to confirm you want to skip the scene! The orchestral soundtrack by \u00d3scar Araujo is wonderfully arranged, even if a bit generic and repetitive. The game is very polished and well presented, and you can see it was a big investment from Konami, before it descended into a crappy publisher desecrating its own IPs.\n\nAs its title suggests, this is an expanded edition, with all the original DLCs included. The base game is already pretty extensive, and there are two extra levels adding a bit more to the journey. And with all its collectables and achievements, it will keep completionists occupied for a fair amount of time. \n\nThe game generated a sequel which I never bothered to play due to its bad word-of-mouth and scourging reviews. Regardless of what, \"Lords of Shadow\" surely is a hell of a good time. Its positive aspects far outweigh its issues, and it was, in many ways, the last noteworthy game in the franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1595625553, "timestamp_updated": 1596983685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73017268": {"recommendationid": "73017268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041327190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5426, "last_played": 1663090623}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1595275765, "timestamp_updated": 1595275765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72977784": {"recommendationid": "72977784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007301352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1214, "last_played": 1595207803}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a lot of great stuff about this game and an almost equal amount of frustration and questionable design choices.

I liked all the character and monster designs too. Gorgeous. But the jumping puzzles...oh God...the jumping puzzles. I fell to my death time and time again trying to nail jumps.

Mankind faces ruin and despair. The world is changing, yet hope remains in the hearts of the people.\u201d[/i][/h1]\n[i]Castlevania: Lords of Shadow[/i] is a third-person action-adventure game that is very similar to the early [i]God of War[/i] games, just with a slightly different main weapon, the Combat Cross; a retractable chain whip that has many uses when handling enemies and level obstacles. I never played the old Castlevania games, so I won\u2019t be doing any comparisons between them. \n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n\u2714\ufe0f Good Story with interesting side characters.\n\u2714\ufe0f The combat is fun, with lots of abilities and combos to learn.\n\u2714\ufe0f Puzzles can be challenging.\n\u2714\ufe0f Great variety of enemies.\n\u2714\ufe0f Excellent boss fights.\n\u2714\ufe0f Replayablility (trials).\n\u2714\ufe0f Fun DLCs that have challenging puzzles and boss fights.\n\u2714\ufe0f The game is visually Impressive, with lots of areas to explore.\n\u2714\ufe0f Character models look excellent.\n\u2714\ufe0f The game is well-optimized\n\u2714\ufe0f Mostly great and memorable soundtrack.\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n\u274c The protagonist is bland and generic.\n\u274c Level Design needs some work.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nYou control Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light, who found that his wife was murdered recently. Your goal is basically to destroy an ancient order, known as the Lords of Shadow, to bring her back to life and save the world from darkness. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123469352\n\nMost of the characters in this game are interesting, mysterious and intriguing. On the other hand, Gabriel has very little personality; he is a generic protagonist with his cliche one-liners that you see in other games. It is until you play the DLCs where his character is more fleshed out.\n\nThe game has a total of 12 chapters (including the DLC), which include over 40 levels. Each level in this game usually takes about 10-20 minutes to complete, so you will be seeing a lot of loading screens. However, the story and writing overall were good enough to keep me intrigued till the end.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[u]Combat:[/u] \nYour main weapon is the [b]Combat Cross[/b], a retractable chain whip that can hit enemies from a great distance (very similar to the old [i]God of War[/i] games and especially [i]Darksiders 3[/i]). You will be earn new abilities and throwables while you progress that make the combat much more varied and engaging. \n\nYou can also perform awesome finishing moves on enemies which vary from one enemy to another. QTEs and button mashing are also a common occurence; during kill animations, while solving puzzles, when operating a mechanism and sometimes during cutscenes. The QTEs were easy to execute and didn't bother me much.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123469149\n\nYou earn points from slaying enemies and solving puzzles, which you can spend on learning new combos and skills. You will also obtain two types of medallions later in the story; one of which inflicts more damage to enemies while the other replenishes your health by attacking them. \n\nYou can check all combos and skills in the menu, as each one has its own simple animated video that shows what happens when you do it ingame. The only issue I have with the combat is that the block/parry button is also used for dodging, so you can accidentally dodge an enemy instead of parrying an attack.\n\n[u]Enemies:[/u] \nYou will face all kinds of enemies in the game, such as Vampires, Zombies, Lycans, Skeleton Warriors, Cave Trolls and so many more. You can learn more about them in your Bestiary (located in the menu). You can ride some of the large beasts, after inflicting a good amount of damage, and use them to kill the other enemies.\n\n[u]Puzzles:[/u] \nThere are a lot of puzzles in this game. Aside from killing enemies, the Combat Cross can also be used to solve different puzzles and act as a grappling hook to swing to unreachable areas, or during platforming sessions. The puzzles get harder and harder as you progress through the story, and some require you to find particular scrolls from dead knights (can also be accessed in the main menu) or mount a certain monster to solve them.\n\n[u]Bosses[/u]: \nThere are a lot of bosses in the game that range from lieutenant vampires to huge titans, and some will grant you new abilities, once you defeat them. I like the boss fights, they are engaging, creative and balanced, even on higher difficulty settings.\n\n[u]Trials[/u]: \nYou can replay the chapters again, after you complete them, but with special challenges. Each and every level in the game has its own Trial, which are difficult but add more replay value.\n\n[u]Difficulty:[/u] \nI chose the [i]Knight[/i] difficulty (hard) and it was perfect; the enemies and bosses are tougher and deal more damage but remain fair and balanced, as you will be using the abilities and combos that you learn to slay them and progress through the game.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Level Design[/h1]\nFor a 2010 game, the graphics look pretty good. From vast and detailed environments to good looking character models. There are ingame cutscenes and prerecorded ones, the Ingame cutscenes still hold up and characters have decent facial animation. \n\nYou will be visiting different areas in this game, such as enchanted forests and the cold and chilly oblivion lake, and these areas provide a good sense of immersion. Areas range from the more generic, like the Dark Dungeon, to the absolutely beautiful, such as the Clockwork Tower.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123469174\n\nEvery so often you will come across a branching path, but the game fails to show you which way leads to the beaten path (long walks and similar looking paths), and if you missed it then there\u2019s a chance you can\u2019t go back and have to restart the level all over again. There are a lot of secrets and hidden areas that you can find and explore in the levels, so watch out for them.\n\n[h1]Technical[/h1]\nThe game is well-optimized and ran beautifully. No issues to report.\n[quote] Laptop: OMEN HP-17t\nGeforce GTX 1070\nIntel Core I7-7700HQ 2.80 Ghz\n16 GB DDR3 RAM\nOS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit[/quote]\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nA few of the songs are okay and not very memorable, while others are just excellent; some give you this gothic atmosphere, while others have a pleasant and calm melody when solving puzzles and during exploration. The songs range from the epic orchestra of [i]Hunting Path[/i] to the pleasant, heart-wrenching melody of [i]Waterfalls of Agharta[/i] and [i]Belmont\u2019s Theme[/i]. \n\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\nThere are two main DLCs in the game, [i]Reverie[/i] and [i]Resurrection[/i], and they continue the story of the base game. I can\u2019t say more than that to avoid spoilers, but they are 2 chapters and 1 hours long each and they were pretty fun. The first DLC is mainly puzzles and less fighting, and the second one is just two very challenging boss fights and that\u2019s about it.\n\n[h3]Additional Details:[/h3]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Total playtime[/td]\n[td]18.5 hours (with DLC) without playing the trials[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Recommended difficulty[/td]\n[td]Knight (Hard)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]M&K or Controller[/td]\n[td]Both work but a controller is preferable[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Offline mode[/td]\n[td]Yes[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Achievements[/td]\n[td]Yes, some are challenging[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Trading cards[/td]\n[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Games Saving[/td]\n[td]Automatically[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nWhen I first installed [i]Castlevania: Lords of Shadow[/i], I had low expectations and thought I would just delete it after an hour or two, but I actually had a lot of fun and enjoyed my time playing it. Despite some issues in the story and level design, the combat was solid, the story was good, the graphics still hold up and it has a great soundtrack.  \n\n[h3]Final Rating: 8/10[/h3]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37072886][quote]If you're looking for more quality reviews like this, follow our curator page, [b]Devils in the Detail[/b].[/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1592286355, "timestamp_updated": 1594160231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.80679786205291748", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70775569": {"recommendationid": "70775569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132999493", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1593200383}, "language": "english", "review": "well... i can say that is great game, nice story....  i might warn you that for me it is annoying to do a level again just for a thing that i couldn't get in the first run, but that is just me...  in other words it is a game that should be played ... :D", "timestamp_created": 1592139297, "timestamp_updated": 1592139297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70744403": {"recommendationid": "70744403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821860146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1950, "last_played": 1670579305}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a great tell and spin on the castlevania series. the only problem i have with it is you cant pan the camera but other then that great graphics and story had it on PS3 and wanted to play it again.", "timestamp_created": 1592085857, "timestamp_updated": 1592085857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70706384": {"recommendationid": "70706384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071096932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2201, "last_played": 1590552523}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un gran juego y buen representante de la saga Castlevania, pero lamentablemente  tiene 2 grandes problemas.

Decir que el juego luc\u00eda de esc\u00e1ndalo por aqu\u00e9l entonces. Muchos como yo, sab\u00edan que esto se ha conseguido por las c\u00e1maras fijas. Si, el juego tiene una c\u00e1mara fija. Esta va cambiando de plano seg\u00fan Gabriel (nuestro protagonista) se mueve por el escenario.\n\nEl juego, a pesar de ser muy bonito, siempre me produc\u00eda alg\u00fan rechazo que no supe explicar. Ahora, despu\u00e9s de haberlo empezado por cuarta vez y llegar un poco m\u00e1s lejos que las anteriores, entiendo el porqu\u00e9. A continuaci\u00f3n sin m\u00e1s dilataci\u00f3n, voy a enumerar los puntos que no me han gustado.:\n\n- Empecemos por lo b\u00e1sico y es si este Castlevania: Lord of Shadow se puede considerar digno de los cl\u00e1sico. La respuesta es obvia, pero para mi un NO retundo\n- La historia del juego no es que sea muy interesante, pero anima a saber un poco m\u00e1s. LO malo es la forma de contarla. Normalmente es con un texto antes de cada fase de nivel. Hay veces que si te la cuenta alg\u00fan personaje, pero es muy poco en mi opini\u00f3n. Parte de la historia tambi\u00e9n se cuenta con notas de soldados ca\u00eddos que nos iremos encontrando a lo largo del juego. Yo soy de los que odia saber m\u00e1s de la historia leyendo notas. Me parece una forma muy cutre de contar una historia. De hecho es un recurso que se utiliza en muchos juegos y nunca es un acierto. No me malinterpret\u00e9is, a mi me gusta leer, pero si quiero jugar un videojuego espero o jugabilidad o al menos, una cinem\u00e1tica por lo menos (aunque sea en plan c\u00f3mic).\n- La optimizaci\u00f3n del juego es excelente, y el port de PC es muy digno. Apenas te deja tocar los gr\u00e1ficos, pero funciona en cualquier PC medio de los \u00faltimos 7 a\u00f1os.\n- La c\u00e1mara en este juego es horrible, para mi es una cagada total ya que teniendo el stick derecho y no poderlo usar, es un grave error. No entiendo como a alguien se le ha podido ocurrir esta genial idea.\n- El dise\u00f1o de niveles, cortos, MUY lineales y casi siempre poco intuitivos y laber\u00ednticos. Me encanta que un nivel sea laber\u00edntico, pero si no hay recompensa detr\u00e1s de esa exploraci\u00f3n, \u00bfqu\u00e9 sentido tiene?\n- El combate es muy simple. Tiene varios combos que puedes usar, pero el combate en s\u00ed es aburrido. EL juego claramente intenta copiar la f\u00f3rmula de God of War, pero se queda a medias. \n- Enemigos poco variados. Para matar a muchos de ellos basta con esquivar y dar dos golpes, seguidamente repetir una y otra vez lo mismo.\n- La parte de plataformas es un script constante, no puedes apenas realizar un paso, un salto o un agarre a cornisa si tu vas por donde el juego no lo espera. Incluso cortando un camino que es obvio que podr\u00edas saltar por ahi sin problema, pero el juego simplemente te pone barreras invisibles.\n- Los controles son poco intuitivos. Habiendo jugado a tantos juegos d\u00f3nde los controles ya est\u00e1n estandarizados, este juego decide ir a su bola. Un ejemplo r\u00e1pido, Para interactuar con objetos hay que pulsar R2 en vez de A o X o incluso B. Para esquivar, se esquiva con L2 + una direcci\u00f3n. Decir que tambi\u00e9n que el bloque se hace con el mismo bot\u00f3n pero sin mover el stick. Para bajar una cornisa debes de pulsar A (igual que para subir) + el stick hacia la direcci\u00f3n que quieres. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no hacerlo con B de toda la vida,? pues los desarrolladores decidieron que es m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo as\u00ed..\n\nHe de decir que llegando a este punto, el juego definitivamente lo abandono y prometo nunca m\u00e1s darle m\u00e1s oportunidades. Veo que no encaja con lo que yo conozco por diversi\u00f3n, y por lo tanto si el juego no lo consigue; forzarlo por quinta vez creo que ser\u00eda absurdo.\n\nNormalmente los juegos que son m\u00e1s o menos buenos y/o recomendados por la comunidad de jugadores, les doy varias oportunidades a lo largo del tiempo, si por lo que fuera, no me hubieran gustado en un primer momento.

The soundtrack, even though much more western sounding (compared to other Castlevania titles) and less catchy, was not bad. I really like some of the tracks. Even though it loses much of the charm...

Voy a poner 3 ejemplos:\n 1 de ellos es el titan que aparece en uno de los lvls el cual no podemos atacar con nuestras armas sino que tenemos que esperar a que nos ataque , subir por su cuerpo , golpear una de las gemas incrustadas para as\u00ed irlo debilitando, una vez debilitado hasta cierto punto, debemos hacer uno o dos movimientos y presionar un bot\u00f3n para seguir as\u00ed, algo que pasa en la saga godo of war sino estoy mal es en el inicio del 3 donde peleas con pose\u00eddon y lo golpeas 3 veces y aparece el icono del bot\u00f3n para que as\u00ed vayas ejecutando combos, as\u00ed esta este juego.\nel ejemplo 2 es dir\u00eda uno de los jefes que es un vampiro que es literalmente f\u00e1cil, golpea y esquiva, pero ese chupa sangres recupera su salud etc.\u2026 lo mismo pasa en Godo of war y un combate donde tienes que evitar ese enemigo recupere la salud, y es cuesti\u00f3n de golpear y esquivar\n3- la forma de desplazarse con el latigo en forma de cruz y el combate son parecidas a la de godo f war, solo que Kratos tiene 2 cadenas , Gabriel en este caso tiene guantes yuna cadena que va mejorando a medida que vamos avanzando\n\nAHORA HABLARE DE LA HISTORIA Y EL JUEGO AL 100% EN SI CON SPOILERS ( si lees mas no es culpa mia)\n\nComo dije arribita nos cuenta la historia de Gabriel, si jugaste el t\u00edtulo mirror of fate , sabr\u00e1s de sobra que los acontecimientos de este juego van antes que ese t\u00edtulo, por lo cual la l\u00ednea temporal seria : \n1-Castlevania Lords of shadows Ultimate edition\n2- Castlevania Lords of shadows \u2013 Mirro Of Fate\n3- Castlevania Lords of shadows 2\nEn si en el 2 ya te hacen un resumen exhausto de lo que paso tanto en miror off ate como en el lords of shadows 1,  en el inicio vemos a Gabriel protegiendo unos aldeanos de los ataques por parte de los lic\u00e1ntropos una vez derrotados nos aventuramos en el bosque donde siempre estaremos con una presencia espiritual que tendr\u00e1 2 tipos de formas ( un caballo y un \u00e1guila) es un guardi\u00e1n espiritual llamado pan, este personaje es fundamental tanto en esta historia como en mirror off ate, tambi\u00e9n nos toparemos con zobeck otro de los personajes fundamentales que no desempe\u00f1ara en mirror pero lo har\u00e1 en el 2.\nZobeck y pan son los personajes que se lleven m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n en la historia ya que uno nos enga\u00f1a y otro nos muestra el verdadero destino, la historia en si es una obra maestra ya que nos hablan de que Gabriel est\u00e1 destinado a cumplir una profec\u00eda para acabar con los se\u00f1ores de la oscuridad, pero sin saberlo es un pe\u00f3n para alcanzar un poder para un se\u00f1or oscuro.\nNo hablare del final sino del DLC ya dije bastante de la historia en si, en el DLC que son 3 cap\u00edtulos cortos, muestra como Gabriel se transforma en el se\u00f1or oscuro, es algo que no pasa en la historia principal, en la historia principal si acabas con el jefe, Gabriel sigue siendo humano, tienes que acabar los 3 cap\u00edtulos restantes,  en el tendremos que jugar tanto con Gabriel como con Laura ( la ni\u00f1a vampira que jugo ajedrez con nosotros ) tendremos que ayudarla a que no huya un poderoso enemigo de los se\u00f1ores oscuros llamado el olvidado.\nNo puedo decir mas ya que siento que dije el 50% de el contenido, pero en si vale la pena el juego, la historia esta muy bien estructurada y no afecta si va antes o despu\u00e9s de mirror of fate, pero seria bueno jugarlo en el orden que dije.\nEncuentro al juego esta genial tenemos 3 barras las cuales son salud, una especie de magia azul y otra roja ( no recuerdo los nombres ) , lo que es genial es que vamos obteniendo poderes como alas, nuevas botas para correr, guantes mas fuertes y mejoras del l\u00e1tigo.\nAlgo que seguro va a molestar a mas de uno es una de las 2 cosas, los puzles o el chupacabras, los puzles porque hay unos dif\u00edciles que te har\u00e1n perder mucho tiempo y el chupa cabras por que te roba todo lo que tienes, poderes, dagas, etc\u2026 y tienes que buscarlo y darle en los huevos.\n\nSolo tengo que decir que lo que vale la pena es el cristal rosado, el cual invoca un demonio o demonia de grandes tetas, u\u00f1as con alas, una vez la invocas se traga todo a su paso (como una ex esposa rencorosa que quiere darse con mas del 95% de tu sueldo) pero lamentablemente no funciona con los jefes ( lastima que no sea as\u00ed en la vida real T_T).\n\nCreo que ya dije todo\u2026( me van a pagar verdad\u2026 hola Konami :V almenos dile a KOJIMA que saque un nuevo silent hill )\n", "timestamp_created": 1587779073, "timestamp_updated": 1587779073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409667432308197021", "comment_count": 0,

Hits don't feel well, dodge and movement is clunky. Every hit on the opponent feels bad.\n\nThe beggining of the game (the only part I really played) has so many cutscenes, you can literally play 10 seconds at a time in some areas. There is a cutscene when you enter a specific area, I kid you not, that spends something like 8 seconds showing the area, like it is something important, and then you just... go through the area... and it takes 5 seconds to go through it! It's amazing. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.\n\nThe graphics are very nice for the era, and the main character's animation is good.

Has a hell of an ending and it's gorgeous.\n\nAt Length - Though this game is EXTREMELY derivative of God of War, as well as a bit of Shadow of the Colossus, that's really not a problem seeing as this is a Castlevania game in the old style - you control a Belmont and you whip your way through levels as you combat hordes of creatures of the night - and they always were derivative but fun games. The trick was always in the execution, the presentation, and the unique twists to formula each entry brought to the table. \n\nSuch it is with Lords of Shadow, and the execution here is excellent. \n\nYou're looking at a sprawling adventure that spans 49 decently sized levels (44 in the OG game + the 5 DLC levels that are integrated with this Ultimate Edition) following Gabriel Belmont, the 2nd \"First Belmont\" in the series in this reboot/spin-off from the main Castlevania continuity.  For most of this run, each level has at least one new thing going on, so the game should prove entertaining and novel for first time players. There's not a lot of replayability though, unless you want to go for the challenge mission \"Trials\" that unlock for each level after you beat them for achievements.\n\nThe combat is fast and fluid, and it has a good sense of progression to it. It's the real centerpiece of the game and holds up. The exploration and platforming that separates the combat sections is less interesting, following the Uncharted series as a model, so you mostly just hold a direction and occasionally press one button to follow a linear track that looks cool, but is boring to play. Surprisingly, the puzzles that are scattered throughout are also pretty good here, though devs were wise to always let players who don't care for puzzles optionally skip them.\n\nThe Spaniard Devs at Mercury Steam did a fantastic job here, especially with the presentation. Even though the game doesn't match the expected standards for gaming PCs of today in technical terms, the art direction still stands out and holds up these many years later from its original release. I feel that storywise, the devs brought a unique tone by more properly integrating larger elements of Christianity into the Castlevania lore (before the Netflix show would do something similar) that makes perfect sense when you consider the setting is dark ages Europe and ultimately demonic monsters of myth.\n\nThough the story is often pretty brain-dead in its specifics of plotting and pacing, the ending of the game reframes the story so well and is such a fundamentally good concept overall that it's a bit sad that this never became canon. Plus the tapped voice-over talent is putting in a lot of work; both Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart do good jobs here. You're in for a treat if you just like Picard's voice, as you get a Stewart monologue with every level!\n\nAll in all, this is the best piece of software Mercury Steam has ever produced. The sequels didn't ever match this first, full-throated effort, and it's definitely worth anyone's time.", "timestamp_created": 1586101951, "timestamp_updated": 1586143193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587795555591583252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66538960": {"recommendationid": "66538960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995019351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1478, "last_played": 1680204911}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game!", "timestamp_created": 1585955637, "timestamp_updated": 1585955637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66468057": {"recommendationid": "66468057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146636686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1670749520}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, lleno de acci\u00f3n, enemigos f\u00e1ciles y dif\u00edciles, buena trama, la intensidad de juego es buena de acuerdo a la dificultad.

Symphony of the Night is my favorite.  I am also enjoying the Netflix animated series, which uses the classic timeline.

The game mixes both Christian references with Pagan references.  The boss fights are epic and some bosses are huge like the titans and the Crow Witch.  There are a lot of QTE's in the game but it does not bother me I kinda like them, and there usually easy to pull off.  Gabriel's weapon of choice is the Combat Cross whip.  It has several upgrades.  Speaking of upgrades there are upgrades for your health and Light and Chaos magic.  Oh yeah you can use Light magic which makes every attack you make restore your health bit by bit.

The story is grittier than normal for series standards and a lot of the names of the characters are reused from classic Castlevania with the characters themselves not being the same as before. Graphics and sound are good for the era it released, the sound being a little bit forgettable but still serviceable. Replayability is fine, if you want to 100% you need at least 2 full playthroughs. DLC is included so that's an extra. One of the biggest downsides are the puzzles, which are not really fun or memorable, being tedious and boring. The other is that some abilities are not really useful in combat, if you want to be optimal. Although there is a system that encourages use of different moves, akin to DMC stylish, called focus, it does not have the same amount of depth here.

I haven't played for 12 hours. I played for a few, trying to give the game the benefit of the doubt, and fell asleep in my boredom.\n\nWhere do I even begin? The game graphically looks on par for a 2010 game. Nothing special there. The music is alright. And I'm sure the story would be good too if it gave me any in the first few hours.\nNot only does this game start with no knowledge of what the f*** is happening, you don't get any interesting story in the first few hours I've played. I really wanted to give this game a chance for the story, cause the entire premise is interesting to me, but the gameplay is so abysmal that I can't do it.\n\nWhy is the gameplay so bad? Let me explain... Imagine playing an Arkham game without any sort of \"warning:  incoming hit\" notification but still having 3-10 enemies attack at once. Yea, it's really, really hard to keep track of everything, which leads to you getting hit.. a lot. I read that you can get some sort of regeneration ability later that makes it bearable, but really the game is a slog to get to that point.\n\nAnother annoying \"feature\" of this game is fixed camera angles. \"Hey look, we're like God of War!\" except it's just really annoying and often switches halfway down a hallway which leaves you standing still because controls have now switched.\n\nSpeaking of controls.. They. Are. TERRIBLE. Playing this game feels like a chore. It makes me wonder if the developers ever played a 3-D Hack-N-Slash game before making this one. Combat controls are awkward.. One example:  Block AND Dodge being the same button. Block standing still, and Dodge while moving.. Except this is a Hack-N-Slash and you're ALWAYS moving.. So pulling off any kind of \"parry\" is next to impossible. Not only that, but the QTE's (Quick Time Events)... Oh my god.. There's so many.\n\n\"How many QTEs do you want in your game?\" \"Yes\"\nEverything is a QTE. Wanna cross this tether, better do a QTE any time you wiggle too close to the edge. First boss of the game? Nothing but QTE. It would've been forgiveable if the QTEs were limited to combat, but nope. Wanna use your new gadget to open this passage? ANNOYING QTE INCOMING!\n\"BUT THE QTE MAKES IT MORE IMMERSIVE\" ... F*** off.\n\nI can't in good conscious recommend to anyone.. Hack-N-Slash fans or Castlevania fans.. Both are in for disappointment.\n\nTime to play Lords of Shadow 2 which is actually fun and engaging.", "timestamp_created": 1580535179, "timestamp_updated": 1580535179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451127827167510986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62650757": {"recommendationid": "62650757", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986793861", "num_games_owned": 851, "num_reviews": 652, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1390790387}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of style and flash.

I enjoyed my time with most of the game besides the two bonus chapters. I loved the story, soundtrack, characters, locations, and everything else but the gameplay is the biggest issue I had. The lack of free control over the camera means that once the game eventually opens up and wants you to do a bit more exploring to find things, you are constantly fighting with the camera to see jumps or see stuff that is hidden off screen and blocked from view. It also leads to a lot of off screen enemies hitting you during combat, which becomes annoying later in the game. Last complaint about the combat, the game wants you to parry enemy attacks later on for reasons, but it's usually really hard to get a sense of when the animation is actually about to begin, which can be really frustrating when you take a hit you were sure you timed right. \n\nStill, despite those flaws, the story alone more than made up for it for me, along with an incredibly satisfying ending. The DLC chapters (13 and 14) definitely drag down the experience and are required to \"finish all levels\" but if you're okay with like..not playing them, it's probably best to stop after you finish Chapter 12 and saving that DLC for another day.

When the game shows you its bad parts, it's showing you the absolute worst that the medium has to offer. Camera and level design are among the worst I've ever experienced--everything is blocked off by invisible barriers and you need to constantly walk around the edges or borders to find not just hidden areas, but sometimes main paths, which are hidden by a static camera that the moment it begins moving, generally spazzes out. Paths are never clear and there's even instances of enemies being the same color as the environment, and because of the zoomed-out camera, it's impossible to see what's going on. And levels have non-sensical end points, one level may take 45 minutes and another will take 5. The game lacked solid direction and seemed like it was trying to incorporate every single mechanic that was around in the era. Had they slimmed it down a bit and cut out half the environment interactions and skill mechanics, the game would have been more streamlined and enjoyable. As is, you're moving at breakneck speed with one new mechanic or skill introduced per level, with no time to ever assimilate any of it.\n\nThe settings and graphics are great, the soundtrack is amazing, and the story is a badly written teenage emo-fest, which in my case was a plus.\n\nThe game is absolutely NOT good.

It has a good plot nice visuals and some great voice acting. However it does have some problems.\n\nFirst the controls. You will definitely want to be playing this with a controller. While it has keyboard settings there is a horrendous input lag which will make an already not great control scheme even less so. In addition, even with the controller there is still input issues especially with the sprint commands as, at least for me it would sometimes not register that I had double tapped the sticks and this can be killer in boss fights. The other is the blocking mechanic where you have to hit is just right, even if you are a millisecond off you will take the dmg which can stagger you and set you up for even more damage stagger again especially in boss fights. Moreover, even though you have a dodge there are no I-frames so if a monster attacks right as you leave the dodge you take that dmg. Finally and this might be only with PS4 controllers the because your mana gathering is linked to the L3 sometimes when you would want to do other things like sprint or just move it will instead trigger the L3 gather command which roots you in your place which again in boss fights can lead to you taking dmg if it happens at an inopportune time. \n\nHowever even with these problems for the majority of the game you can work through this but there are a few times where it can be simply aggravating and you feel like you are fighting the controls more than the game. Which leads me to the next thing the combos. I love them when they work and they look bad ass but I really wish there was a way cancel action mid combo as you will be locked into it and take dmg and there is nothing you can do about it, you cant even switch to a block or a dodge so if you miss with an attack combo be prepared to get hit from the back or sides. While we are on attack might as well talk about the Quicktime events . . . they suck. Not only are they just button mashing they really just break up the flow of the game and the combat and in longer fights can just get tedious. \n\nFinally the static camera. There are times where the camera angles really do not help you this game was made in 2010 static cameras should not have been a thing           \n \nYet even with these problems I would still recommend the game as while I was frustrated at times i still had fun and was invested enough in the story to want to see its ending. I think that if some of these problems had been ironed out when it first came out some of the backlash it got might have been muted a bit. They tried something different, even if it was following the likes of God of War and DMC, but because it wasn\u2019t an other Metroidvania style game it got more backlash at the time then i think it deserved. Is it a Great game? No, but it is a very good game i\u2019d say a B- while it has it problems for me it gets a lot of things right so is worth a play though I wouldn\u2019t say it's worth achievement hunting for.    \n", "timestamp_created": 1573722179, "timestamp_updated": 1573722179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57050849": {"recommendationid": "57050849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131907668", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1654273759}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a New Game+ would have made this game so darn good.

A lot of wondering around through forced slow walk segments and showcasing all the enemy variants that might aswell be reskins of the same 2-3 enemy types. Backtracking/split paths feel uninviting between the forced slow walk, and hitting unexpected points of no return or very abrupt level ends, and seem to be abandoned almost entirely after the first few chapters.\n\nThe combat is actually quite promising, but is heavily bloated with an excessive number of unnecessary combos. Enemies are extremely predictable in the way they attack, although they have a habit of surprising you as soon as you get bored into playing to a script. The parry timing is the worst i've ever experienced - you have to parry so early that youve often finished the parry animation before the enemy attack even lands. The timing is so awful and the startup window so huge i've had instances of messing up my parry only to successfully parry a follow up attack - i should not be rewarded for messing up any more than i should be punished for timing correctly. Aerial combat is encouraged and yet enemies will frequently knock you out of the air with ease, often with attacks that appear to be ground based.\n\nThe level design is made up of a large number of fairly short levels, each of which sends you back to a main map screen to select the next level upon completion. This completely ruined any chance of immersion in the game - as a huge Patrick Stewart fan even his narration wasnt enough to save the repetitive cycle of narration>short level>map screen>repeat. Some levels felt like id barely done anything before they were over. Levels frequently have puzzles and platforming sections that often feel overly drawn out and tedious, and basically just a forced nod to the origins of the series in an otherwise hacknslash game. Checkpoints are also often in quite baffling positions, which adds to the general monotony of the game.\n\nThere is absolutely no camera control, and the camera often does very strange things - on occasion i have found myself confused about where i even am on the screen, or simply staring at a closeup of either my character or a wall. The player controls are in general kind of clunky, which combined with the lack of camera control can make platforming in particular quite obnoxious at times.

La saga Lords of Shadow (este, Mirror of Fate y Castlevania 2) es su propio universo y no tiene m\u00e1s relaci\u00f3n con la saga original que el nombre, el estilo g\u00f3tico y los nombres y est\u00e9tica de algunos protagonistas.\n\nEl juego en si tiene poco que ver con el estilo metroidvania tradicional de la saga, centr\u00e1ndose en la aventura y el combate hack&slash m\u00e1s propio de juegos como Devil May Cry. Una gran variedad de combos de combate, plataformas y puzzles hacen que el juego no se vuelva aburrido, y la exploraci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 importante si queremos encontrar todas las mejoras posibles para Gabriel.

On top of that, the world design is breathtaking; I always love seeing the camera pan out to display gorgeous views. There is also a lot of variety in the environments, as you go from forests to villages, a giant castle, a barren wasteland of undead, etc.\n\nSecond, while the gameplay does leave more to be desired and could do with some fine tuning, it's still quite enjoyable to play, especially if you are a fan of hack and slashes. You can purchase combos and mix and match moves with certain relics and artifacts you pick up as you progress.\n\nThe graphics are also very well done.

It really feels like the devs just kinda gave the boss a move set then cranked up its health pool and damage to the max. Wouldn't be as much of an issue if the controls weren't so clunky and you were able to refill health/magic during any one of the 5 or so interims between the fights proper. Overall a really intriguing and well fleshed out art design on the boss, but the climax was genuinely ruined by the sheer amount of time and 'effort' put into fights (aka pray to RNGesus until you get that one-in-a-million successful sequence, interlude, next fight stage, rinse and repeat).\n\n7/10 only because art and voice acting are superb and the only thing that kept me playing until I beat it.

The large enemies, that are no more than a slog through what is padded out by holding on to an edge until you get to the place where you can smack a rune, not fun, and padded.

They told a 6 hour story in 20 hours...\n\nSince 95% of the game was at least enjoyable, I'll grudgingly give it a thumbs up...\n\nHowever, after trying to complete chapter 14 (second DLC) i would give the DLC a 3/10!\n\nIf you value your time, sanity and health, whatever you do just finish up the original game in chapter 12 and then uninstall. Watch chapter 13 and 14 on youtube.\n\nChapter 13 is not too bad but is filled with puzzles. One of which is very difficult and frustrating without a guide.\n\nChapter 14 on the other hand is GOD AWFUL. The entire chapter is filled with cheap 1 hit deaths. After dying 30+ times and not even reaching the final boss I instead reached for the paracetamol. The game gave me a real life headache and that was that, UNINSTALLED and watched the rest on youtube.

Switching from your run of the mill 1080p monitor to 1440p 21:9 monitor made a world of difference in enjoyability. Level design in this game is top notch and deserves only the best.\n\nOn the other hand no matter how good the game looks you're stuck with the awful gameplay.\nI've lost count on how many times I've died because hitboxes are exponentially bigger than actual models on screen. There is zero windup with attack animations making you lose half the healthbar from seemingly nothing. Full healthbar if you get stunned and another attack has already been dealt before Belmount gets up.\n\nControls are also seriously lacking. No way of cancelling animations - especially mid-air - gets you constantly hit by the previously mentioned fair and fun enemy attacks. Or you just roll down the cliff because who would have thought you don't always want to evade with a uncancellable fixed distance straight line roll.\n\nPS.

Odie el combate hasta los ultimos 3 jefes de la campa\u00f1a principal, uno de ellos era basicamente un shadow of the colossus, pero mal... pero aun asi no era terrible y los otros dos jefes finales se dejaban pelear podias hacer bloqueos, esquivar los ataques que no se pueden bloquear y lo disfrute. Pero para esto llevaba 15 horas...\nAparte de esto, lo que va jalando del juego, es la historia y la ambientacion a pesar de que los dialogos no son los mejores y las animaciones a vecez son ridiculas, hasta que llega el final con sus giros forzados y el cambio de personalidad del protagonista, el que al final del juego tiene una nueva motivacion pero en el epilogo ya se le ha olvidado....\nNo lo recomiendo, se me hizo largisimo y mas de una vez evite el enfrentamiento (mecanica principal del juego).", "timestamp_created": 1557488612, "timestamp_updated": 1557488612, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50570869": {"recommendationid": "50570869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037946396", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1966, "last_played": 1541428398}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite enjoyable though sometimes a little frustrating.\nShouldn't be played without a controller due to the camera lock and movement restrictions a keyboard has.", "timestamp_created": 1557486056, "timestamp_updated": 1557486056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50564794": {"recommendationid": "50564794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342603434", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 896, "last_played": 1618332021}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a big fan of this game, I loved it back in the day and I still love it now, people say It's a GOW clone, but for me it's the better game, now don't get me wrong I can see it has flaws, but they are in no way big enough flaws to harm the whole package and that's what people who put this game down don't seem to realise...the sights this game will show you, the grandeur of the music, the excellent voice acting (something I usually couldn't care less about)...nothing has even been made worse by Picard.\n\nSo what it has some of the jankiest camera angle changes ever in videogame history...it's because of that jank that you get the sweeping majestic vistas of the world of LOS...and what sights they are.\n\nIt's a massive game too...you will feel like you've been on a quest by the end.", "timestamp_created": 1557444689, "timestamp_updated": 1557444752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50539603": {"recommendationid": "50539603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090376203", "num_games_owned": 1100, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1670, "last_played": 1557494874}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked the game.

Artificially making the game harder in a cheap way.\n- Not for the casual gamer as even on normal, this is a tough game to beat (doesn't bother me personally though)", "timestamp_created": 1552411860, "timestamp_updated": 1552411860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49510088": {"recommendationid": "49510088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007303054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2368, "last_played": 1552602246}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game.

Even playing it in 2019, the game has aged extremely well. I remember being surprised at how good the game looked on my PS3 when I had it. The only setting I had to adjust was VSync, otherwise the tearing was obnoxious. However, with VSync enabled, It stays pegged at 144 FPS on my 34\u201d Ultra-Wide. Additionally, the game makes use of my 2 GTX 970s, something modern games are neglecting big-time. \n\nSound: \nThe sound effects are very good. The whip sounds, the crushing fists, the jumps, etc. are all spot-on. The Voice acting is phenomenal. There are some games where it sounds like a child was hired to perform the acting, this is believable and engaging. Perfect for the series. I\u2019ve heard that Sir Patrick Stewart is too dramatic. I don\u2019t think so. I usually pick up on cheese like that but I haven\u2019t noticed it here. I was going to make a separate category for music but I\u2019ll just review it here. One of the greatest components of a great game. The music definitely has a gothic feel to it and it is both varied and appropriate. There are some games that will have such a beautiful gothic setting but then the music is dark and dreary. I have never enjoyed that. I always wanted more of an epic feel to it and LoS hits the nail on the head with a sledgehammer. While it definitely has some drear, it mainly utilizes the symphonic goth you expect from the series. Yet somehow, it exceeds my expectations. \n\nControls: \nThe controls make sense for the most part. The combinations are plentiful. The mix of different modes (shadow and light) allowing for different combos are perfect. They are pretty easy to execute (aside from those requiring the dash) but even the dash combos/relic moves are well-executed considering their requirements. The biggest issue is when the camera switches, the controls sometimes remain for the previous perspective. \n\nCamera: \nThe camera is by far the weakest point of the game. I think most people would agree, though I tend not to rely on ad populum. Even so, it is sometimes annoying. I do not think the camera is weak enough to detract from the fact that this game is a masterpiece. However, I think the game would have definitely benefited from being a proper 3rd person game with more control over camera panning. I think I can understand why there isn\u2019t any control over the panning. I believe it\u2019s because of how often the character is in close corridors.  However, other games have successfully implemented a mechanism in which walls disappear when the gamer is in tight spaces; this should have been utilized in LoS. The lack of panning options seems to detract from the incredible ambiance of the game. Sometimes, I would have liked to have the autonomy to view my surroundings. Again though, this one large flaw is not enough to dissuade me from finishing the game. \n\nStory: \nThe story is very interesting. Even if it\u2019s linear, sometimes I simply want to play through a good story. If the story is enjoyable, it doesn\u2019t have to be an RPG-style game. Some RPG stories are horrible no matter which direction the gamer takes. I\u2019ll take a good linear story with linear exploration over a drab open-world with open choice any day. The linearity of the game doesn\u2019t dismiss the fact that the story and ambiance are incredible. \n\nSetting: \nThe setting is perfect. This is one of the most beautiful games of its genre, even in 2019. The gothic style, the dark castles, the variety in backdrops and environments are beautiful. When you factor in the music and the art-style, they really nailed it in this game. For this style game, I am very impressed with all of the settings. This feels exactly like a Castlevania setting should feel. When playing through the game, I get a feeling similar to one of my favorite games of all time: Simons Quest. \n\n\nI\u2019ve heard the knock on the game for drawing too much from Shadow of the Colossus and God of War. However, I feel as though borrowing many elements from those games and implementing them in its own unique setting is fine. Should I knock DCS for drawing elements form FSX, X-Plane, and Falcon? After burner for being similar to Top Gun?  Should I knock Tekken for being too similar to Virtual Fighter? GoW3 is the first game I beat on PS3 so I definitely enjoyed that game. However, I think this game did a phenomenal job of taking components from those style games and making them its own. In fact, I think the setting here is probably better than SoTC, GoW, and Dante\u2019s Inferno.  \n\nAs stated, even in 2019 when so many games are being released, if you don\u2019t feel like wasting money on a brand-new trending game, this game has aged very well. I strongly recommend a playthrough. I\u2019m happy I decided to play this game again and probably should have completed it 9 years ago when I first played it on PS3. Additionally, I wish all games originally released on console would port this well.  In fact, when you watch reviews on the original consoles, there were many complaints about the game stuttering during important moments where the action is heavy. That doesn't happen at all on this game.

There are some good boss fights in this one. Also it has many of the iconic Castlevania enemies.\n\nComing to why this did not feel like Castlevania: the game is split into levels. The only reason to revisit levels are to get collectibles/upgrades that you previously did not. The story only advances linearly level wise. So when revesiting the level you play it from the beginning to get that collectible/upgrade. Sometimes even within the level some branches make it impossible to backtrack forcing you to start from the beginning of the level. For me the experience of Castlevania was backtracking seamlessly, the way \"forward\" could be anywhere, you search around with your new found upgrades.

YOU WILL NOT HAVE A FUN TIME IN CERTAIN PLACES. \n-Sometimes the combat feels really unfair. Best examples are from the DLC (included in this edition) and X bosses \"rings of protection\" that one needs to get through via changing auras. When navigation is dependent on vien diagrams, it feels really frustraiting. Or the Titans.\n-Titan Battles: If I wanted to play Shadow of the Collossus I would play that. I'm playing a beat em' up essentially, so I would NOT want this in my beat em' up. \n-The game has a weird fasination with just taking away your (Gabriel's) hard earn powers for lols. This does not produce lols. Especially when one spends an hour going back through levels to upgrade said powers and wants to use them without the game saying \"Lol isn't this Yoda type funny? He stole all your stuff! Gotta stop the plot and gameplay for you to run after this walking turd.\"\n\nAnd a special note reguarding the DLC:\nPersonally, it feels rushed and terrible. Most times while playing I kept asking myself \"Why am I playing this since I'm clearly not having a good time?\" The puzzles aren't particulary fun, especially the Sawblade puzzle. Which is also a primary offender of platforming sins during the first act that caused me to fail a trial without even starting the puzzle. \n\nThen there is gaming offense no. 236, playing as weaker people other than the main character. No one wants to play as side character 6. It isn't too bad, but I personally feel it slows the gameplay down quite a bit. Perhaps have the puzzle levels as her with occasional fight? In one level?\n\nAlso, I feel this it is a sad missopportunity for Victor Frankenstein to appear, especially with the ammount of references in the 2nd part of the game. They have a collectible based around him, but it doesn't do anything. It's just there. Why not have a special level come up after finding all of them? But no, it does nothing. \n\nAnd the final boss? Oh good god its bad. The game at one point decides, \"You know what this fighting game needs? reticals to throw into the enemy that spasm all over the place!\" Something that hasn't shown up in any point of the game. ANY POINT. lovely. \n\nAnd what does one get for all this? Strangely scribbled cutscenes made out of sketches. It is not very impressive. And what it adds to the lore could be actually better animated by a common youtuber. And it doesn't make much sense storywise. Shouldn't the downfall of Gabriel be perhaps its own game, or addressed as the second half of the original game. Unless you're an achievement hound, its not worth playing the DLC. \n\nIf you can get this game for cheap, then it's worth your time. Just make sure you're prepared for annoyances that will appear in the game. I wouldn't get it if it was not on sale though.

If you like the Castlevania universe, as I do, then you may want to play this game. There is no other reason to play the game.\n\nAbove all, the camera angles are absolutely horrible, not only for fighting but for basic navigation. To be clear, you have no control over the camera; it changes depending on your location. You cross from one point in a room to another and suddenly the camera flips 180 degrees. It's ugly and disorienting. At times objectives are inadvertently \"hidden\" by the bad camera angles. Obviously, this takes the fun out of combat as well.\n\nInvisible walls abound, making moving around stilted and unpleasant. Combined with the camera angle, some areas can be difficult to navigate; while wall-jumping, for example, you might find that the camera leaps back and forth between two points.\n\nThe combat is a bit boring, largely due to the camera angle. The timing on blocks is not intuitive -- it's almost useless, thus eliminating an important area of activity from gameplay -- enemy diveristy is low, and bosses/mini-bosses don't stun at all so combat is reduced to taking pot shots in the middle of battle. Boss battles are very boring.\n\nWith the difficulty turned up, all of the above defects become even more apparent and certain areas become quite frustrating. I recommend playing this game on the easiest setting because the flaws in the game make the difficulty artificially higher and unenjoyable; the mechanics simply don't scale well.\n\nThe puzzles are also quite boring and tedious. Combined with the atrocious camera angles, they're simply unbearable. Unfortunately, there are a lot of them. They aren't pleasant at all, but quite annoying actually. You often re-cover ground that you've already explored looking for the right object to find or activate.

This was challenging but rewarding. The puzzles in this game, likewise, are challenging but rewarding aside from a few that are just too difficult for my peabrain to figure out without a walkthrough. There were a few things that frustrated me throughout this game. First, the quick time events....... I had to redo a number of fights because I was too slow to react or bumped the wrong button (my fault, I know, but still). Also, some of the fights were nearly impossible on a keyboard and I had to plug in my controller to do them (namely, the fights were you have to swing object around in the air).....no chance my hand eye coordination is allowing me to type WASDWASDWASD without error in the middle of a fight.

(Probably because no one is [i]stupid[/i] enough to buy this at full price.)\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1] (note this part is plural, whereas the former was a singular statement)\n\nWhat a steaming pile of crap. \nNot only is the camera control absolutely beserk, but seemingly being a horrific console port, there is often no indication what key you need to be pressing.\n\nThis turns boss fights, minor goblin fights and even some environmental challenges into a frustrating bout of die, retry, die, retry another key, etc etc. \nCut scenes requiring action, have a frantic indicator, showing you need to be reacting to the event, but mysteriously, fails to tell you *which* key, out of the 109 available keys on a PC keyboard.\n\nCombat simply turns into a big old session of button mashing, because what works when you're close to the enemy, doesn't work when you're standing next to, say a tombstone. \nThis may not sound like a detriment, until you have a fight in a graveyard, and your character is more investing in turning marble headstone into dust, than killing the large troll who's doing his best to mash your head into figgy pudding\n\nHilariously (or not), when jumping around like psychotic leprechaun during combat it will sometimes face you the wrong way, with predictable getting-ripped-apart results. Again.\nAdding further depth to this frivolity, sometimes the keys change - again without notifying you. So, if trying to break free from a crushing grip was Space, next time it may be Right Click. Or.. who knows ? \nJust... just smash your face into the keyboard repeatedly, and you'll at least have some chance of finding the right key, because the game sure as hell isn't going to tell you.\n\nAnd despite a deep well of mythical folklore to draw upon, MecurySteam happily ignored it all. For example, your first boss fight is with a troll. It's been long established (LOTR movie notwithstanding) that the only way to kill a troll is with fire, due to their fast regenerative healing. \n\"Cool\", you say, \"Belmont has a fire whip in almost every Castlevania game, *this* should be a doddle\".\nExcept he doesn't. \nNo, instead 'Boy Band' Belmont has a chain cross, with not even a small flame coming from it. \nIt is at this point, you realise it's going to be a long day.\n\nThis game isn't a challenge of skill. \nThis is challenge through obscurity. memory learning and chance. It's a shite way to treat your gamers, resorting to a lazy programmers trick to prolong a game.  \nIn fact, the first few levels are simply wait-a-while events, interspersed with fleeting moments of combat. One of the sections I played was 8 minutes of watch, wait  and move, with approx 2 minutes of combat.\nThere's no story, character development, nor any reason why you would care about the protagonist.\nI confess, I deliberately walked Belmont into the Naiads, just to watch him drown. And then again. And maybe again.\n\nWhen not trying to decipher combat moves, your character will often get stuck in the scenery.\nOr loot items that you need/want, are projected into unpassable vegetation or scenery.\nThe mighty Belmont, needing a resupply of daggers, is thwarted by a simple shubbery. \nYep, it's really that pathetic.\n\nEvidently MecurySteam think gamers are masochistic, and have not learned the key lessons from luminaries such as Tim Schaefer, which is a shame given the majority of the developer team would have grown up playing his games.\nI absolutely loved Castevania: SOTN, but this atrocity is just too embarrassing to have in my library, so I'll be asking Valve to remove it. \nMy only regret is that they cannot also remove my memories of this turgid, steaming pile of defecation.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nShould you buy this game ?\nIf you like:\n[list]\n[*] Confusing and inconsistent contextual keys\n[*] Repeated deaths that could have been avoided, [i]if only you were clairvoyant[/i]\n[*] Combat moves that make [i]no sense[/i] \n[*] Complete avoidance on educating the player on the arbitary contextual control interface.\n[/list]\nThen you, my masochistic friend, have a bargain on your hands. God help you.\n\nFor all other gamers who prefer their games to be fully developed and not stillborn, then please avail yourself of an [i]entire bounty of outstanding fabulous games[/i], filled with evocative nuance (and mindless violence) that lay before you like a room full of glittering gems.\n\nFinally, for the fanbois that have descended upon this review, wondering who would dare desecrate their precious game - if you enjoy *this* game, then good for you. \nI'm not going to judge.\nI've long since realised there are elements of the human race that I don't really understand, such as trainspotters, Twitter users, people who watch unboxing videos, and ... you know what, I'm just going to stop right there. I'm just happy that you're happy. \n\nBy all means, leave your response in the comments, but please make it amusing.

The story is great, the atmosphere is amazing, the fighting is fun and even the platforming has its moments. I only played this with a Xbox one controller however I imagine this is a game that would play poorly with a mouse and keyboard. The biggest issue with the game for me is its terrible controls, repeated QTE's and camera angles. The controls are appalling, where the difficulty seems to come from the imprecision of those controls and the terrible camera angles given. The QTE's are easy and pointless once you get the hang of and are only there to frustrate.\n\nOverall, this didn't detract from the game until the very last chapter (the second DLC). I recommend not playing that level as is just consists of repeated and incredibly difficult platforming and a far too difficult boss fight that requires precicion controls (which you don't have). But despite all the abundance of issues I really enjoyed the game. \n\nI also only had a couple hours once or twice a week to play this game and in the end I set the level to the easiest level as the difficulty can be pretty punnishing. Everytime I would play it felt like I had to relearn all the combinations for moves which I just got sick of doing.\n\nPros:\nAwesome and captivating story\nGreat art style - this game won't age bad\nRuns really well 1080p 60fps max settings on r9 390x, not one drop. 4k on titan xp no problem also.\nFun fights  (mostly)\nAlright platforming (meh)\nSome OK RPG character progression\n\nCons:\nTerrible camera angles\nHorrible precision with a controller (probably worse with M&K)\nMany parts of the game requires precision. This makes the difficulty seem artificial as getting through many levels required repeated attempts until you finally got some luck, not skill.\nThe last level isn't worth playing - just watch a walkthrough on youtube. This dlc was panned for good reason. Its just really punnishing, luck based platforming and an incredibly hard boss right that requires pin-point precision on your attacks.\n", "timestamp_created": 1544870090, "timestamp_updated": 1544870090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616803169250488281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47494242": {"recommendationid": "47494242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026048770", "num_games_owned": 5920, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 2842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2842, "last_played": 1544596274}, "language": "english", "review": "(Important note: This game, for whatever reason, doesn't like being set to fullscreen + max res on a display other than that which Windows / your video card identifies as Display 1, regardless if it's your primary display or not. Weird bug but easy to fix.)\n\nLords of Shadow is a flawed but polished masterpiece and a triumph of artistic direction. It's shortcomings are forgivable. That said, since you can expect to sink upwards of 40hrs into this, I'll go into some more detail.\n\nPresentation wise, this game is stunning. Masterful visuals paired with smooth and optimized 4K performance make for an eye-popping experience. The art team went all out on this and it shows. I've never taken so many screenshots of a game before. Two major detractors though: 1. Some of the cutscenes were pre-rendered for console are unimproved by modern hardware (they still look passable but they're jaggy af); 2. Godrays are a weak point. The score is powerful but not iconic; you'll love it in the moment but try to recall the music later and you'll likely struggle, for the most part. This isn't objectively a bad thing, as it simply means it's enhancing the experience without overpowering it but I was disappointed by the lack of iconic singles and the abscence of a Bloody Tears revamp. \n\nThe game's artistic merits help prevent the linearity of the gameplay from getting stale. This is great, because the entire game is on some pretty tight rails with even the camera angle being fixed. This seems to have been a deliberate decision to maintain a more cinematic vibe throughout than we see in most modern games. Paired with a meriad of quicktime events insterspersed with the action, some people may find themselves feeling a little claustrophobic. However, none of this detracts from the arcade action. The quicktime in this is generally unobtrusive and balances user input with the epic visuals  better than, say, God of War, where you're missing most of the cool action because you're focused on not screwing up the minigame. In LoS here, you can do all the QT without letting it distract you from the show that's being put on for us and it's a good feeling.\n\nGameplay wise, this has a balanced mix of combat, puzzle-solving, and climbing/exploring. It's blended in the ways of classic action adventure titles wherein a sense of journey/wonder is maintained without it becoming too non-stop bloody or too bland. That said, the puzzles are generally quite easy and the exploration is limited to the linear but cinematic route there for us to discover. Combat wise, the action is quite fast and your character has access to dozens of moves; mastering the action gameplay is pretty fantastic. I would have preferred to see a bit more action in the core game and I wish there was some sort of arena survival mode, like in Onimusha.\n\nThe gameplay difficulty caps at \"Knight,\" the second hardest difficulty, until you clear chapter XII. This is a mixed bag as Knight is well tuned in that a competent player can expect to clear most of the game's encounters without dying unless there's some hidden trick you can only learn through trial/error. The downsides are as follows: a) Knight isn't really challenging enough to force you to use all the tools at your disposal in combat to succeed; b) to 100% the game you have to replay the whole thing on Paladin difficulty; and c) When you unlock Paladin, you have access to tools and powers that both enable you to speedrun most levels and which trivialize every fight, even on the highest difficulty, so skilled players spend most of the game feeling unchallenged and the whole point of locking Paladin defeats its purpose. That's not to say the fights aren't still exciting, just that you're not going to be a master of the combat system because you were never truly tested. There's a happy ending for thrill-seekers though in the form of the additional \"DLC\" content that's included in the Ultimate Edition's chapter XIV, when you get to fight a boss that keeps things interesting on Paladin.\n\nThe above positive points come with a major caveat: the last few chapters of the base game are failures in terms of using conveyance to inform the player. Throughtout most of the game, you'll receive a short, well-crafted cinematic to help you from thinking, \"uhhhh what the hell do i do / where the hell do I go?\" but near the finish line, with previously un-introduced gameplay elements, you're suddenly forced to feel around in the dark for a bizarrely obtuse course of action. In a game with only one direction to go, this is ridiculous. Eg climbable bone paths, right in front of you, that don't look very climbable, islands you can jump to that you can only see if you stand at the extreme edge of the island you're currently standing on, etc. Basic silly things that shouldn't be an issue. It's ultimately a minor annoyance but when the fix for it would have been so easy it's hard to not be frustrated. It took me an embarassingly long time to figure out why I kept falling off a boss due to a mechanice that only exists on that boss, is only perceptible if you're watching hands to catch a few quick frames from quite far back where your grip slips, and which looks exactly like an input error as opposed to an actual mechanic. It's bad because it busts up the tempo and kills the immersion at a crucial point leading into the conclusion. The plus side is that when you replay the same sections after learning your lessons, the tempo/flow feels amazing, makes for an even more cinematic experience, and you feel like you've really mastered the game.\n\nThe narrative is quite good. It starts out as what seems like decent B-movie fare, passable without getting in the way of the action. It quickly evolves into something good in its own right. I was aware of the big twist going into this but the journey to get there is well crafted and well executed with lots of little twists and depth along the way. The voice acting is pretty stellar as well. At first, you're going to wonder wtf is up with Patrick Stewart narrating with the feigned innocence and naivety one uses when reading to a child, but there's actually a method to his madness and his narrtive performance, ultimately, is spot on. Everyone's, Patrick Stewart's included, character acting is superb. Solid VA casting. There are some powerful moments in here. The story is a departure from the norm for the Castlevania series but it also gives it more room to grow laterally, so really nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe game should be played with a controller. A modern fight stick also works perfectly and pairs well with the quick arcade action. This has tight controls but they're initially frustrating until you master the little quirks of direction/timing to make it feel like you have 100% control of the action. It's almost like a cross between a hack & slash and a fighter in terms of how much control you have, how fast you have to react, and stupid you feel if/when you screw it up. It's actually pretty rewarding. Once you master it, the game is going to look/feel as smooth as a movie the entire time without hamstringing your actions in combat.\n\nOverall, this is well produced AAA title with a lot of heart behind it.

Safe to say I couldn't finish this game. The general plot interesting, but every enemy is annoying to fight, nearly every \"puzzle\" is only thought provoking because you're thinking \"How am I going to fight 5 enemies and finish this puzzle at the same time\", and the camera is harder to fight than half the bosses in the game. Not to mention how dull Gabriel is, currently I'm on Chapter 8 and I swear I've only heard him speak several times, and thats more than halfway through the game. *Spoilers* The reason why I bought this trash heap is because I thought that playing through the alternate story of Dracula would be amazing, not just a fun experience but an interesting one as well, but the game is lacking in both the writing and the gameplay. Having a lot of the emotion of Gabriel be conveyed through the thoughts of Zobek, who, if you haven't noticed by the distinct lack in similarity in names, is NOT Gabriel. All I really know about the story so far is that Gabriel wants to reunite the heavens with the Earth by killing the 3 Lords of Shadow and obtaining their power. After that its revealed that God pulled a bamboozle switcharoonie on Gabriel and made him Dracula. I wanted to experience that, but I give no fucks about Gabriel seeing as he has as many lines as Isaac Clarke in Dead Space 1, I give less than no fucks about Marie considering all she does is die, I don't care about Zobek because he's not even with Gabriel for half the fucking story, I don't care about the plight of the Earth and the heavens because I haven't seen enough human characters with writing to make me care about the consequences of what will happen should I fail in my quest to save the world and its inhabitants. I read somewhere that one of the problems with the game was that there were cutscenes up the wah and zoo, however clearly whoever wrote that has never played a Mass Effect game because holy shit unless you count the weird moments where the game shows you the layout of the level as cutscenes, then I've only seen like 14 real cutscenes, the beginning cutscene where Gabriel fights wargs and shit, Gabriel meets Zobek, Gabriel meets whats her face, Gabriel meets Black Knight, Gabriel kills whats her face, Gabriel finds Zobek in Skyrim, Gabriel enters Whiterun Keep with Zobek, Zobek gets bamboozled, Gabriel and Zobek are douchebags to the abbot, Gabriel fights vampires, Gabriel fights more vampires, Gabriel fights Ghoul Chef, Gabriel plays chess with little girl, and Gabriel gets hugged by dead wife. Reminder each of these cutscenes are like half a minute long max. Seriously, this game could have benefitted from better writing, or alternatively a different play style. Whats the point in telling me the world is in danger if all you show me is already ruined cities and forests, I cared about the people of Gransys in because I travelled through their towns and met their people, I cared about the people in the alienage of Denerim because I walked in their shoes and knew their poverty, I cared about the people of the Galaxy because I had been to the Citadel and Omega and understood their problems. I don't care about the people in this Castlevania world because I dont know them, in Darksiders 1 the point of the game isn't to save the world it's to save yourself, in God of War the point isn't to save the people its to take revenge on the Gods, and you aren't just told this the game shows you too. LoS just fucking tells you that it'd be a bad should you abandon the world. I dont give a fuck, I dont know these people, everyone I've seen is either a douchebag or already doomed to death.

Corre a 60 fps en una tostadora. Esto lo corroboro habi\u00e9ndolo jugando en mi antiguo FX4300 con 8 GB de RAM y una HD7770 con los gr\u00e1ficos a medio. Cualquiera que tenga un ordenador m\u00ednimamente actual no deber\u00eda preocuparse por poder o no jugarlo\n\nSegundo: Es bueno. Muy, muy bueno, Como viene haciendo la saga desde Symphony of the Night toma la jugabilidad descaradamente de otras sagas, en este caso God of War, pero no tiene a Kratos as\u00ed que afortunadamente el juego no da asco. El estilo freeform de los combos le sienta de maravilla y los movimientos especiales, armas secundarias y magia le dan vidilla al asunto. No esper\u00e9is un Castlevania tradicional que no lo v\u00e1is a encontrar, pero eso tampoco es necesariamente un defecto.\n\nTercero: La ambientaci\u00f3n es sublime. Cada nivel es diferente dando la verdadera sensaci\u00f3n de estar realizando un viaje, y todos los niveles son oscuros y retorcidos. La banda sonora es ambiental, lo que para muchos ser\u00e1 un defecto, pero lo cierto es que le viene como un guante.\n\nCuarto: Si eres novato en la saga \u00a1No importa! Lords of Shadow supone un debut, con nuevo maloso, nuevos or\u00edgenes para el primer Belmont y viejos nombres colocados en nuevos roles. Si te atrapa lo suficiente tienes una saga enteriiiiiiiiiiiiita por explorar. Los 3 Castlevanias de GBA est\u00e1n en Wii U, los 3 de NES y los 2 de SNES en Wii U y 3DS, Rondo of Blood y SotN en esa especie de timo que ha publicado Konami en PS4 (Y exclusivamente en PS4, porque son las versiones incluidas en Dracula X Chronicles metidas en el emulador propietario de PSP de Sony al doble de precio) y para el resto ya te buscar\u00e1s la vida. Es una sagaza, y Lords of Shadow es el punto de partida perfecto.\n\nEl \u00fanico defecto es que el juego es de Konami pero \u00a1Ey!

He is actually a great character with a pure heart that will sacrifice himself for a higher cause, unfortunately he ends up in the worst possible situation by the very last chapter [[major spoilers end]]. For this reason I'd say its a great story if you look at character development. \n\nAlso great logs and scrolls left by dead knights, flesh out the world more and even foretell of upcoming events. There is also an index for characters and monsters which helps you learn more of the lore but also what weaknesses each creature has in combat. \n\nCombat\n\nIt is good but the final boss (from the DLC chapter) is almost like a devil may cry boss whilst the game doesn't have devil may cry level combat speed and execution of moves takes slightly longer than the boss will allow for so you need to have perfect timing to beat it. OTher than that the game is very enjoyable with a great deal of combat techniques and the need to switch between light and shadow magic to be most effective against enemies. \n\nMany bosses and sub bosses which adds a great deal to the whole journey. \n\nPuzzles are interesting and some require a bit of thought too, which is fantastic. Really enjoyed this aspect of things. \n\nI did the game collecting everything except the last few magic gems and it took me over 20 hours. \n\nDefinitely worth the purchase, and its even cheaper on humblebundle store when discounted. \n\n\nCons:\n\nPlatforming is an issue, in some places requiring tight parameters but controls aren't good enough for this so expect many deaths in some places. \n\nAlso I wish there was more interaction between gabriel and random townsfolk, etc. But I understand why this wasn't the case given the story and his motives. But it would have made us care for the main character a bit more and allow for some personality development outside of the main motives. Also would have helped the pacing as at times it can feel a bit too long between dialogue with others. \n\nSome parts require you to replay to get items, etc. These parts seem a bit drawn out upon replay but this is a minor complaint. \n\n\n8/10 overall, recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1542501815, "timestamp_updated": 1542501981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45864928": {"recommendationid": "45864928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057698611", "num_games_owned": 3739, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1383, "last_played": 1542463495}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Pros: [/h1]\n[b]+[/b] The beginning of dracula\n[b]+[/b] The bestiary and character descriptions\n[b]+[/b] The voice-acting (Patrick Stewart) \n[b]+[/b] It will take to finish about 21 hours\n[b]+[/b] Some well puzzles \n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-[/b] Camera is locked on hero (It's impossible to change it)\n[b]-[/b] Keyboard controls is terrible (But if you set it manually, it's playable)\n[b]-[/b] If you want complete it on 100% (You will must go back on some levels)\n\n[b]When it's over you will be hate Chupacabras.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1542473496, "timestamp_updated": 1639268159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45853176": {"recommendationid": "45853176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025307019", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1538, "last_played": 1542336491}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] All of his Love [/h1]\nBasic premise/Story\n\nFrom developer studio, Mercury Steam and Kojima Productions is a dark fantasy action adventure starring Gabriel Belmont; a member of the brotherhood of light. An order full of knights dedicated to defending the innocent from the supernatural. He embarks on a quest against the Lords of Shadow who have disrupted the natural order of Earth and its bond with the heavens. Seeking absolution for his wife who no longer walks on this earth. But bound between the living and dead, forever trapped for eternity. Evermore determined by his recent tragedy Gabriel\u2019s mission is clearer than ever. To release souls in perpetual torment caused by the Lords of Shadow. His quest begins. \n\n[h1] Seeing Beyond Whiplashes [/h1]\nUnique Gameplay to be aware of\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow plays as an third person action adventure set in a dark fantasy setting with certain homages to famous folklore all contained in it\u2019s own universe. It takes the classical spin of fantasy into a darker turn as evident by literally throwing players in a fight against a werewolf as a boss. Such a gloves off approach details to anyone interested in an enthralling and serious story in the Castlevania universe. \n\nThe game is divided by chapters with multiple levels within a chapter to tackle. These aren\u2019t a single area created by developers to have Gabriel wack at his enemies on end. But semi-linear areas within levels to traverse and in some cases different paths to take as well. Paths littered with platforming, an area of combat, and verticality swinging as if your mistakenly called the medieval Tarzan. What is interesting is some slight backtracking involved when you need a certain tool you haven\u2019t required yet, as well as several paths cleverly hidden to mask these paths. Making what you would assume a linear level to hide its true nature. Players who enjoy a sense of exploration and cracking at every jar or crate will feel familiar with such gameplay mechanics. These levels aren\u2019t without some consequence, almost all of them have some form of puzzles to solve. These puzzles are never mind-bending nor outside the box thinking. Newer mechanics, for example, are shown slowly as you progress further into the story in order to ease players with new tricks and gadgets to use at their disposal. More often than not these tools are vital in clearing a level to progress or backtrack to an earlier level to unlock a secret you couldn\u2019t unlock before. Even more helpful are scrolls you may find littered by deceased brotherhood of light members who may shed more light on the puzzles or deliver a final account of their last days. However, some puzzles can be bypassed should they prove too hard for the player. Making it easier for those who do not want to be blocked by puzzle obstacles. \n\nThe chapter levels are never too long to become tedious nor are they too short to experience to the fullest. The level design changes in every level to not become an eyesore for repeated mechanics of jumping, platforming, puzzle-solving, fighting enemies, mini-bosses and repeating the formula albeit with changes in the pattern. \n\nWhat is interesting to note is the combat. You can buy more moves each time you kill an enemy in the form of experience. With advanced moves and special moves unlockable as you progress further into the story and acquire more weaponry to unlock more moves to do. The combo based combat is light, and nearly all the moves are easy to execute and to purchase. There are enough enemies in the game in Warrior difficulty to buy any combat moves to flesh out Gabriel some more. The decision to make some more combat moves purchasable by experience is a welcome feature. But also I can learn the controls early on. It allows me the freedom to purchase more advanced moves later to supplement Gabriel\u2019s arsenal even further in bashing the skulls of my enemies to dust. \n\nWhile it can be a daunting task for Gabriel to undertake to defeat the Lords of Shadow, he will meet certain individuals on his journey to help him. So never fear, you are not alone on this venture!\n\n[h1] Dark, yet Vibrant Fantasy Awaits [/h1]\nThe Graphics\n\nThe dark fantasy setting for Lords of Shadow is aptly named. Each time you enter a new chapter level there are larger than life in nature, on trees, the looming castles, and dreadful creatures oozing with terror and power. Even the bosses and mini-bosses look particularly well defined and can be differentiated from the common mobs of enemies you encounter. Graphically, the game also makes use of smooth transitions from quick time events in game to cinematic that doesn\u2019t detract from the overall depth of the story. Exemplified by the actions of Gabriel and what he does during harrowing moments. \n\n[h1] To Live on, To Struggle further, And the Weight of Burden [/h1]\nThe Usage of Sound And Music. \n\nThe sound design is full of drums, violins, trumpets, piano and high, low, short and long vocals. Reminiscent of an orchestra playing in the background seeking to give morale to the player in need. Or start in low haunting and dreary tones to gradually increasing levels of tempo. To deliver urgency and frantic action inbound. Then there are moments of classical heroic tracks comes along as if your about to pull an epic feat in an intense battle. These tracks are numerous and never feel tedious to listen to. To the voice actors Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart, they put up a phenomenal job delivering their lines. I could hear the emotions pouring from the two and couldn\u2019t stop listening to their dialogue whenever they said something. \n\n[h1] Finding Purpose, despite Recent Tragedy [/h1]\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\n\nThe camera placement in a third perspective is a mixed bag. While I did appreciate the sense of scale regarding the environments of each chapter level and the setting landscapes used. I didn\u2019t like the camera fixed without player input to see around Gabriel. It was a hamper for exploration, whenever I wanted to backtrack and then the camera shifted in an angle that forced me to see the area only from that angle. These camera changes can change spontaneously as Gabriel moves around into a different part and isn\u2019t truly a dealbreaker. What does take away from the majesty of the game\u2019s environments is the combat during times of intense clashes with the enemy that requires a lot of moving. These moments weren\u2019t a lot, but a sizable portion remained where I had to move a lot during combat and the camera abruptly changes to match a different view of the battlefield is troublesome. And these abrupt camera changes occurs frequently during levels with a large area making the momentum you gained fighting enemies sometimes lost. Because of a second or two to reorient my eyes to the new perspective. It\u2019s not a deal breaker, by any means for the change in camera perspective is still manageable. But, it's a troubling matter easily fixed if I had control of the camera. \n\n[i] Throughout my 22 hours with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow I didn\u2019t experience any major bugs or glitches. The game ran smooth like slicing butter with a knife. Overall; Lords of Shadow feel like a cinematic experiment trying to mix the best parts of cinematic and combo-based combat along with slices of puzzles and platforming is an interesting challenge to undertake. While it does suffer mainly in the camera and certain dodging mechanics, it presents players with a unique story in a dark fantasy setting. Unafraid of tackling shadows nor facing beings larger than life itself. Bring a struggling hero, who is dealt a heavy hand in tragedy. And ultimately demonstrates to newcomers and veterans of Castlevania a new story unfolding from the darkness.

But, I digress.\n\nYes, \"Lords of Shadow\" shares mechanical similarities to the combat in \"God of War.\" But, it also features a whip as its primary weapon. A whip is a much more practical ranged melee weapon than a pair of flaming machetes attached to bungee-chains. (Okay. I promise that's my last jab at GoW.) \n\nCastlevania Lords of Shadow is also a jaw-droppingly beautiful game, and it knows it. It welcomes you to judge. Heck, it even gives you the original concept art mock-ups and dares you to compare them to the finished 3D set pieces. And considering that this was a 2010 release, the fact that it still looks damn fine is no small feat.\n\nThe game's musical score isn't especially varied. However its main theme is epic enough that it never gets old throughout the entire quest's run-time. And most of the score is just variations of that main theme. The fact that it's good enought that I wasn't annoyed by it after 12+ hours is sort of amazing. You know waht else is amazing? The stage-crafted tone P. Stew's thespian monologues! And there are quite a few of them. Trust me, you will get MORE than your money's worth of Patrick Stewart voice overs. And the voices that aren't Sir Patrick Stewart? Yeah, they're also pretty dead solid. Quality VA work all around.\n \nCastlevania's focus is naturally on combat. However, the constant skirmishes are nicely broken up by a variety of puzzles, that breathe a lot of life into the experience. There are also extended platforming challenges. And, I will admit, the jumping mechanics are less than great. Originally, I was going to make this a serious black mark against Lords of Shadow's design. But, then I thought of its NES source material and remembered trying to jump anywhere in Castlevania has always been a nightmare! So for all I know, the godawful jumping was an intentional choice...it certainly makes the Clock Tower a more authentic experience.\n\nOh, and the game's story is pretty okay. Gabriel is sympathetic enough as a character that you can't help but feel badly for the Catch 22 he finds himself entrapped between the bureaucracy of Heaven and the vengeful denizens of Hell. As far as reboots go, I think this is  one of the better ones in gaming history. It tries to install some serious emotional legs to a well established series, and does so with relative finesse. Without spoiling anything, after you beat Lords of Shadow, it will make you seriously rethink the dynamics between all the big players in previous Castlevania titles. [spoiler] Dracula hates his roommates as much as you do. He also wishes, he was dead as much as you do. Suddenly, the fact that he always refuses to come down from that one damn tower makes a little more sense. [/spoiler]\n\nIn summary, Castlevania Lords of Shadow is basically \"God of War.\" Except for the fact that it looks, sounds, and controls better than the game about the pouty, misogynist, psychopathic albino.", "timestamp_created": 1542092948, "timestamp_updated": 1542170504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45769949": {"recommendationid": "45769949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235762786", "num_games_owned": 4628, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1541451905}, "language": "english", "review": "kojima genius", "timestamp_created": 1541974572, "timestamp_updated": 1656593091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45761491": {"recommendationid": "45761491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351326948", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3101, "last_played": 1544869942}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un Castlevania que gustar\u00e1 m\u00e1s a los que se adentran en la saga por primera vez.

There's a lot to process here, so I'll try to break it up into three sections. The good, the bad, and the ugly. LoS came out in a dark time with video games, and it suffers from every conceivable drawback that brings with it.\n\nThe good: LoS has some amazing design choices, with a simply inspired design team working as best as they could with a dark fantasy setting. A lot of polish was put into this game, and the optimisation is absolutely phenomenal. A smoothe 60fps can be expected at almost any resolution, with max settings. The bosses are frequent, which is (personally) a favourite. As for immersion, it does a great job of making you FEEL like you're in whatever frozen wasteland, arid abyss, or muggy swamp you're in. \n\nThe bad: It's dated. It's SO dated. From the Gabriel's mop haircut, to his almost Liefeld proportions, to the abominable use of quick-time events. No, the reviews were not joking. Open a door? Turn a lever? Fighting an enemy? QUICK TIMES. The bosses are plagued with them too, meaning it becomes more a game of whittling the boss down before trying that DAMN quick-time for the UMPTEENTH TIME!\nNow, this is spoiler territory, but it is worth mentioning, so I'll tread lightly. Many of the bosses suffer from gimmicky design. Some you climb up, which makes them more of an obstacle course than an enemy, and unfortunately with the latest example in game? This completely ruins any modicum of intimidation they once posessed. Some bosses require button pressing to defeat, and some...Some are insane. I mean really, truly insane. I'm talking you can die in about 4-6 hits, while they take (and I am not exaggerating here) over 100. It took me almost two hours to beat the DLC's final boss, and I promise you it was not a fun time. If not for the mid-bossfight checkpoints, I don't believe any human being could beat that boss without entering some transcendent realm where they can see the very fabric of the universe and tug upon its strings to tear that bosses heart out of his wretched, steel-clad, glowing weak-spot chest. \n\nThe ugly: This is a special category reserved solely for decisions that were made outside of the game itself that were...poor. Patrick Stewart isn't known as a particularly talented voice actor in games, but boy howdy is he phoning it in here. Another poor decision is the fact that the POST GAME CUTSCENE plays before the DLC, DESPITE that the DLC is set BEFORE the cutscene. Pro tip? Skip the post credits cutscene, then bring it up on youtube after you finish the DLC.\nWhich brings me to the next point? The cutscenes. While (thankfully) the designers didn't end up locking them at 24 fps (the MADNESS!) they did, however, resolution cap them at around 1080p, so if you're running a monitor higher than that you'll be greeted with more jagged pixels than a busted Pac-Man arcade machine. \nMy final victim to mention is the character of Gabriel, who is completely infallible. The game makes no efforts to truly lay any honest blame at his feet. Even when characters call him a savage murderer who has carved his way through hundreds, one must look back across the long line of vampires, ghouls and werewolves who were little more than butcherous animals, and wonder \"WHO exactly did I kill that didn't deserve it?\"\n\nIn conclusion, this game is on sale right now. Pick it up if you want a cheap castlevania with a bit of quality hidden beneath layers of trash. I give it a solid 5/10 -  It would have been 6/10, but holy hell did that final cutscene misplacement burn my soul something fierce, and that final boss....That accursed, final DLC boss...\n\nNEVER AGAIN.", "timestamp_created": 1541337474, "timestamp_updated": 1541337474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477178424596786499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45598696": {"recommendationid": "45598696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107779127", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 383, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1240, "last_played": 1541238928}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best game", "timestamp_created": 1541239038, "timestamp_updated": 1541239038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45594895": {"recommendationid": "45594895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061436792", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1641241590}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game!", "timestamp_created": 1541218835, "timestamp_updated": 1541218835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45568906": {"recommendationid": "45568906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036573735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1541097348}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll be honest - the difficulty is simply unfair.

Most of the game is playable and fair, though a bit clunky. If you are used to platinum's games then it will feel awkward due to the slight changes to functionality that makes blocking and dodging less than stellar. The story is good but nothing special. \n\nNow for some insight on why the last chapters ruin this otherwise OK game. The way that Gabriel is writen for the last bit flips his character completely around and feels like an unnatural change that exists purely to make writing his twist easier and worse. Where there could be some reason for his change, we are given none and just expected to accept that he no longer thinks, feels, or acts at all similar to how he was when last we saw him pre credits. In addition to this minor storytelling complaint, the final chapter in particular made me happier to uninstall this game than any point made me happy to be playing. Evey fighting mechanic that was introduced throughout the game outside of double jump is made useless. A major portion of the game's fighting was the perfect block counter with unblockables being shown with a glow on the enemy weapon, but in this last chapter, no attacks are blockable in any form and dodging still goves no invulnerability. In other words, if an enemy attacks then you take damage. The final fight is the worst form of artificial difficulty added in at the last second that I have ever come across. \n\nTL:DR: \nGood game if you plan to play all but the last 2 chapters.

The voice acting will bring you to Heaven.\n\nFor a game called Castlevania, the first 10 hours are devoid of any castles and have little 'vania' to speak of. In terms of what you expect from a Castelvania game, they could have named this something else and you wouldn't have known otherwise until the end. This is a reimagined world. And oh, what a world they've created! \n\nUnfortunately the camera almost ruins the entire experience. On the one hand, the fixed camera angles make things cinematic and create a sense of scale. On the other, they take control away from the player, resulting in endless frustration, countless misplaced jumps, and accidental deaths. Not to mention the level design being ruined because you can't see where you're supposed to go next, causing immediate annoyance. I would preferred a camera like Dark Souls, where I am in control of it, and yet nothing of the aforementioned qualities are lost.\n\nThe music is great, but there's not enough of it, and they use the same songs too often.\n\nThe concept art, the environments, and the game design--on paper--are exceptional. It's when they have to turn this into a game that it doesn't work quite as well. It's drawn out much longer than it should have been, and there are many annoying segments, due in large part to you fighting against the camera, rather than the enemies. But Patrick Stewart as the narrator saves the whole experience. And the DLC that comes with the game is also good. \n\nOverall, a flawed gem. It's not what I expected or wanted out of a Castlevania game, but at the same time I was compelled to keep playing and beat it. It was a slog to get through, even on the easiest setting, but in the end, the positives outweigh the negatives, and the story pays off. \n\nThis game wasn't my cup of tea in terms of game design and overall fun, but it's a game I'll never forget for the feeling that it left me with.

The music is phenomenal and the game is really pretty. \n\nThe combat feels fluid, but there are several game design elements conflicting with eachother. There are no incentives to learn all of your combos, as monsters seem to have seperate cooldowns for dashes, shields and attacks. A monster could be stunned on the floor and it'll still hit you with an unblockable attack as you prepare a combo in mid-air. You'll find yourself spamming the same attack over and over. \n\nGame has artificial difficulty. On a scale of 1 - 10, Easy is a 1, Normal is a 7 and Hard is a 10. The mechanics are the same, but the monsters' health and damage are scaled. Do not waste time playing on Hard during your first playthrough - I switched after 12 hours of frustrating combat.\n\nAnnoying camera angles. The flip between entirely different angles in a single area, making some fights harder. Sometimes monsters that you battle are completely off camera, and they can still lunge at you with an unblockable attack. \n\nPoor level design. Do you see an open space? Then you're fighting a mob of monsters. It's incredibly predictable. This makes combat feel grindy because you'll never face a monster alone unless it's a mini-boss. Sometimes you'll fight mini-boss after identical mini-boss; how fun. \n\nLack of player agency. The game holds your hand throughout the entire game - highlighting where you need to go and telling you exactly what you need to do. The camera will zoom in during a new boss mechanic to emphasize the importance of the next few moments, even though it also highlights the appropriate object. Characters will literally yell at you and tell you what to do. You are handed scrolls that give you information too.\n\nPoor storytelling. The majority of the story is told via long-winded dialogue before each new area. There aren't many cutscenes that relate to the story.\n\nYet, after all these issues I came back again and again.

Not having the camera rotate with the player, as is common in almost every third person 3D adventure game, proves clunky, frustrating and wasteful.  It is clunky, because many of the 'hidden' objects rely simply on a poor camera angle obscuring something (a path, an alcove, etc.) that you must blindly walk into to discover. \n\n The camera angles are frustrating, because while the camera angle might change from scene to scene - your controls do not.  For example, running off the left side of the screen might transition to a scene where your character enters from the top of the screen... yet holding 'left' on your controller remains 'forward' in movement, which would be down on the hypothetical second scene.  Once you let up on the controls 'down' becomes 'down' once again, but the controls on transition are annoying.  \n\nThe camera angles are wasteful, because it's clear they put a lot of effort into some of the scenes.  The detail and artwork are occasionally quite impressive.  Unfortunately, you never really get to take in the whole of a room at once.  You might see the south wall of a room on entry, then the scene will do something stupid like switch to a fixed camera on the south wall that shows most of the north wall, part of the western and eastern walls and most of the floor.  It really is a wasted, missed opportunity for immersion.\n\nAside from the terrible, terrible camera angles, the only other persistent frustration in the game is the occasional appearance of the Chupacabra.  In short, this little guy appears  periodically, steals all your items and powers, and forces you into a jump-puzzle bout of hide and seek mid-level to recover them.  It's a pointless time-wasting activity which disrupts the flow of a level and grows annoying very, very quickly.  While not as terrible as the terrible, terrible camera angles, it is nonetheless something that should never have made it into the game.\n\nFinally, Sir Patrick Stewart...  As much as I enjoy anything with him in it, sadly, not even his reliably solid voice-over work can erase the previously mentioned negatives which turn this otherwise good game into one that is simply 'above average'.", "timestamp_created": 1539173760, "timestamp_updated": 1539298428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488599300384521484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45195483": {"recommendationid": "45195483", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993946399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1924, "last_played": 1546957216}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En general buenisimo juego, buena banda sonora, buena historia, buenos graficos,etc....  solo algun glich pero nada importante que afectara al juego y alguna vez el cambio del angulo de la camara en algunas zonas  es un poco molesto  pero como digo nada importante que impida jugar perfectamente, si tengo que ponerle alguna pega seria el control que a veces me dio fallos(tipo cornisas o saltos) y mori varias veces pero como digo quitando alguna cosilla el juego esta genial y me a gustado mucho.LO RECOMIENDO", "timestamp_created": 1539118422, "timestamp_updated": 1539118422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45187338": {"recommendationid": "45187338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059544424", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1539768974}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful story in a video game that I was able to experiment.

It's a solid 8/10. Nothing spectacular but definately a solid video game.\n\nThe amount of effort put into this game is impressive. I can't believe how many chapters there are. This game is packed with content.\n\nThe combat is good. But could have been a lot better in my opinion. \n\nFor starters, 95% of the combo attacks that require a lot of buttons to activate are actually weaker than just holding X? What the heck?? Im not joking\n\nThere are so many things wrong with the light/shadow magic orb regeneration system. It's fun when you have a full bar of light/magic energy.. But when you finally deplete your resources, the system to manually refill them totally sucks! It should have been awesome. But its not.\n\nYou generate yellow orbs by keeping on your toes and not stopping..Yet they vanish in 7 seconds? Not only that but they only restore a pathetic 0.1% of power each.  That is just plain counter intuitive. You also have to stop combo'ing and put your guard down to vacuum them up. On top of that craziness, your orb-vacuuming range is very small. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with it that you end up having to mostly ignore it. Otherwise you will find yourself trying to restore your health after collecting 1 orb at a time like a fiend!\n\nThere are also no invincibility frames while dodging in castlevania LOS. So it's just impractical to expect your players to be able to produce an adequate amount of yellow orbs. You end up having to optimize the time when you activate your powers. And even thats not enough. Oh that reminds me of another thing! They make it seem like the light/shadow energy depletes with TIME. But you quickly notice that it depletes at a pre-set rate based on which move you use. Not cool. \n\nIt's just wasn't worth the mental effort for such a small amount of regeneration. The regen system needs a serious buff. \n\nAnother thing that sucks is that health/powers can only be restored manually. You would think his body would heal naturally on his \"Long journey\" It really sucks having to quit mid level just to go back to play an earlier level just so you could fill your health/energy bars/materials. \n\nAnd if you make the same mistake as me and buy ALL of the skills, it actually makes the game harder because now you will find yourself accidentally consuming HUGE chunks of light/magic energy doing regular moves that were free before. Like double jump becomes \"Holy jump\" (The game claim it blinds enemies but it seems 99% of enemies are immune to it)  So now, even while in combat, i have to watch that i do not accidentally do a doublejump because i know it will zap all my resources. Easier said than done. What i am forced to do now is doublejump THEN activate light magic so that i can do the powerful spinning attack.\n\nAnd the puzzles got annoying. There were parts where the game threw so many puzzles at you that it felt like you were playing a 99cent mobile game like temple run or something. Too many brainless kiddy puzzles. Come on konami.\n\nAnd i really hated the hitboxes. A boss could CLEARLY miss you by a mile and you would still die. If you are going to make a game focused on combat shouldn't you at least ATTEMPT to make the hitboxes somewhat accurate? \n\nAnd it bothered me that the cutscenes were 720p. Nothing takes you out of the immersion more than a pixelated resolution drop.\n\nBut for 3 dollars. I got to see some really nice graphics/environments and have many hours of relaxing fun leaning back in my chair with a controller. So it would be foolish of me to not reccomend this title.\n\nBasically its just your average video game. Nothing special\n\n**Update** DO NOT BUY THE SKILL HOLY JUMP! It uses up a ton of light energy and activates when you are doing something you would do normally (double jumping) This makes it so your light energy mode depletes near instantly at the last boss which you must double jump to hit his head. And if you want to regen HP off his head then you will have to activate light magic only after you doublejump.

I also ran into a few bugs here and there, where the game would either freeze for a minute apropos of nothing, or crash to desktop (but that only happened once or twice that I remember). Those minor blemishes however don't spoil or hold back what is otherwise an engrossing and fun game! The story and the lore are interesting as well, which is more than I can say for many games. \n\nThe art direction is enticing, the voice acting is great, and the gameplay gave me plenty of challenge. Personally I don't mind quick-time events, as long as they don't feel unreasonable, and this game has them in just the right amount for my taste. I also don't mind not having control over the camera, as I feel it gives the game a certain kind of \"Castlevania\" quality to it, but I'll admit that sometimes it can be a smidge wkward. And for an Xbox 360/PS3 game, the graphics are pleasingly pretty on all max settings, even if those seldom-played cutscenes (the ones that aren't in-engine) didn't get the upgrade, but those are very short anyway. There's something to be said for the atmosphere and the music, which are beautiful and par for course for this franchise. \n\nOverall, decent game. I love the concept, and it feels right at home in Castlevania. It is unfortunate however that I found myself scratching my head so often at the game's knack for making you feel stupid; there's definitely a difference between thought-provoking and plainly unclear, and this game straddles the line a bit.

While there are hints to where you are going, sometimes the camera even blocks them. I have actually experienced glitches to the point I have had to reload entire sections because I was correctly solving the puzzle, but the piece refused to either go in place or reflect light properly. \n\nOther notes is the platforming. For some reason the game will normally prevent you from jumping off inaccessible ledges. But if you are at the edge of one attempting to go to the next you will either succeed or fall, regardless of positioning as jumping requires no thought.\n\nThere are alot of quicktime events, and sometimes they do have purpose, such has bosses and the flow. Other times such as for turning switches or rotating cranks, it almost feels superfluous.\n\nGod of War fans will appreciate new scenery for the similarly built combat and progression design. Just be aware this is essentially a poorly optimized adaptation to the God of War series though. My biggest gripe as stated before is the awful camera, and the non-responsive controls. Sometimes the required buttons, and othertimes it gets you killed.\n\nGood for a sale though, which is how I got it.

That lycan 10 meters away will totally hit you when it STARTS jumping at you, and not when it actually gets to you. Same for titans, I couldn't understand why I always got hit by their stomping despite jumping/dodging the shockwave, and that's because you get hit exactly when the fist/foot hits the ground (or even before, even if you're far away ) and not when the shockwave hits you.\n\nThis makes dodging/blocking almost impossible since you don't even know when to dodge/block. It's extremely noticeable when you manage a timed block BEFORE the enemy even moved to hit you. It's complete bullshit.\n\nAdd to that a fixed camera showing you only a portion of the combat zones, you constantly get hit by enemies being offscreen, and during the plateform bits sometimes you don't know/see where to go, or your character isn't even on the screen due to blind spots. And it doesn't help that the direction you're moving in doesn't change with the camera sometimes, like, you're going right, then the angle changes et you're going forward but you still have to press right to go forward.

The game has many good things, but at the same time I can understand why there are fans of the series who did not like the game. At first, I often wanted to uninstall it. I really did not know what to think about it, so I kept pushing and playing and I'm glad I finished it. The game consists of story, combat, exploration (it is linear), jump on platforms, puzzle and repeat (not on all levels but in most of them)\nThe game has a more than decent story, I would say that it is one of the best stories in the series. The problem with this is that at the beginning it is slow, very very slow (this being one of the reasons that I did not liked the game). You\u2019ll need patience, but it's worth it. It's different from the other games, it's not about going to kill Dracula ... again. Which is refreshing and interesting. It\u2019s 14 to 16 hours long on normal difficulty (not including the dlc). The voice acting is incredibly good as well as the sublime artistic direction and an excellent soundtrack. The level design is good and the architectural details in them are beautiful, but some puzzles affect the levels design. These puzzles become frustrating at times, they take a while to complete, there is also the possibility of committing an accident and having to restart it. Something to mention is that looking for the chupacabra is a nuisance later ... .. It's good the first 2 times, and then it's something that is abhorred\nThe combat can be described as a copy of God Of War. There are combos, you have to dodge, block, etc. But not as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. You can  combine many moves and you can experiment, It\u2019s not  a single button. Nothing amazing or special but it works ... but something that does not work sometimes is the camera. The camera already has a fixed angle(Like resident evil) in all the rooms which makes the combat in some parts more difficult than it should be. Also in combat there are many QTE (Quick time events) which consist of pressing a certain button in due time or pressing fast and these are many.The graphics are very good, it still looks very good today, Even with the low graphics it looks very good. We also have our movements to explore. (Some are unlocked in the course of the story, combat moves are the only ones that are purchased.) They are very similar to those of Assassins Creed or Shadow of the Colosus, so you have to climb and move around the walls, among others things. Finally I have to say that the difficulty of the game is somewhat challenging, even in normal.But at the end it's a good game,It has problems but it is a good experience. \nThere are some very good details in the game, the sunlight harms the vampires and when Gabriel grabs something from a dead body he cross himself. Small details that\u2019re cool and give a certain charm.\nCan I recommend this game? I can recommend it but it doesn\u2019t mean that you might like it. As I said, I can understand why there are many who did not like it. If you like Castlevania games then yes, buy it and play it at least once. The story is great. Very underappreciated game.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nCastlevania Lords of shadow es el tipo de juego el cual o le gusta a la gente o no le gusta. El juego tiene muchas cosas buenas, pero al mismo tiempo puedo entender por qu\u00e9 hay fans de la seria a quienes no le ha gustado el juego. Al principio, muchas veces se me dieron las ganas de desinstalarlo. Ha decir verdad no sab\u00eda que opinar de \u00e9l, as\u00ed que segu\u00ed empujando y jugando y me alegro haberlo terminado. El juego consiste de historia, combate, exploraci\u00f3n(es algo lineal),saltar en plataformas, puzzle y repetir ( no en todos los niveles pero si en la mayor\u00eda). \nEl juego tiene una historia m\u00e1s que decente, dir\u00eda yo que es una de las mejores historias de la saga. El problema de ello, es que al principio es lenta, muy muy lenta (este siendo uno de los motivos el cual el juego no me agradaba). Se tiene que tener algo de paciencia, pero vale la pena. Es diferente a la de los otros juegos , no se trata de ir matar a Dracula\u2026de nuevo.Lo cual es algo refrescante e interesante. Est\u00e1 siendo de 14 a 16 horas de largo en dificultad normal  (sin incluir el dlc). La actuaci\u00f3n de voz es incre\u00edblemente buena al igual que la sublime direcci\u00f3n artistica y una excelente  banda sonora . El dise\u00f1o de nivel es bueno y los detalles arquitect\u00f3nicos en ellos son hermosos, pero algunos puzzles llegan a afectar su dise\u00f1o. Estos puzzles llegan a ser frustrantes muchas veces, pueden tomar algo de tiempo en hacer y porque hay tambi\u00e9n la posibilidad de cometer alg\u00fan accidente y tener que reiniciarlo. Algo que mencionar es que buscar al chupacabras es una molestia mas adelante\u2026.. Es bueno las primeras 2 veces, ya luego es algo que se aborrece.\nEl combate se puede describir como una copia de God Of War. Hay combos , hay que esquivar,bloquear,etc.Pero no como Devil May Cry o Bayonetta. Pero se pueden llegar a combinar muchos movimientos y se puede experimentar, no solamente es de presionar un solo bot\u00f3n. Nada asombroso ni especial pero funciona\u2026 pero algo que no funciona algunas veces es la c\u00e1mara. La c\u00e1mara ya tiene un \u00e1ngulo fijo en todos los cuartos el cual hace el combate en algunas partes sea m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de lo que deber\u00eda de ser.  Tambi\u00e9n no falta de mencionar que en el combate hay muchos QTE ( Quick time events) los cuales consisten en presionar cierto bot\u00f3n a su debido tiempo o presionarlo r\u00e1pido y de estos son muchos.Los gr\u00e1ficos son muy buenos, aun se ve muy bien hoy en d\u00eda, Incluso con las opciones graficas bajas se mira muy bien. Tambi\u00e9n tenemos nuestros movimientos de explorar. (algunos se desbloquean en el transcurso de la historia. Los movimientos de combate son los \u00fanicos que se compran.) que son muy parecidos a los de assassins creed o shadow of the colosus ,asi que hay que escalar y moverse por las paredes entre otras cosas.Por ultimo tengo que decir que la dificultad del juego es algo desafiante, incluso en normal.  Pero es buen juego, tiene sus problemas pero es una buena experiencia.\nHay unos detalles muy buenos en el juego ,la luz del d\u00eda da\u00f1a a los vampiros y Gabriel cuando agarra algo de alg\u00fan cuerpo se persigna .Son detalles peque\u00f1os que dan un encanto y cierto car\u00e1cter.\nPuedo recomendar este juego? Lo puedo recomendar pero no significa que te podr\u00eda gustar. Como he dicho, puede entender por que hay a muchos a quienes no le a gustado.

It has not aged well in any respect. It is an isometric action game with some mild platforming and puzzle elements. It handles none of these things in either an innovative or fun manner.\n\nPeople will claim this is a God of War clone. They are correct to a point; God of War's combat was crisper, more fluid, more natural, and more responsive to player inputs. While both had camera angle issues it seemed less annoying in God of War. Castlavania lacks for enemy variety and it's lack of weapon choices makes combat a chore as you progress. Many of the new moves you will learn require magic, and since that is in finite supply you won't be using it much on trash mobs. This just worsens the repetitive gameplay. In the end you are going to stick to a move set that works and simple forget trying to memorize the other combos out there. Basically, X, X, X, roll, X, X, X, block, etc. \n\nThe platforming elements are similar to God of War or the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, but lacks the organic movement of those games. Basically, unless it's glowing you can't touch it. That wooden plank that looks grabbable? Nope, not shiny, can't touch it. That hook 50 feet in the air? Yup, it's shiny all yours. But not that other hook 20 feet in the air. Platforming becomes a 'find the shiny thing' game. They couldn't just do away with it or the game would be impossible as far as progression goes. There'd be know way to tell which way to go, particularly with some levels that have an element of verticality. Lastly, the \"Titan fights\" are ripped straight out of Shadow of the Colossus without any of the atmosphere. These look good but ultimately just take a required number of attempts to learn the patterns, and then it's just one big Quicktime event.\n\nThe puzzles are not much better. Puzzles in video games are tricky - they have to nail that sweet spot of not too easy but not too hard. But Castlevania plots out a new axis - frustrating and unsatisfying. I was able to solve all of the puzzles without a walkthrough, but they were either too easy amounting to a speed bump, or I was spending half hour playing 'find-the-glowing-thing\". You don't get those \"Eureka!\" moments you do in games like Portal or traidtional point-and-click style adventures. What a chore.\n\nLastly the game has borrowed mechanics that gamers have long since grown bored of. Quicktime events were so very 10 years ago, no one wants to see them again. Worse, \"the cake is a lie\" makes a guest appearance as a pickup. Ugh.\n\nGraphically it's a dated game. Gabriel looks blocky. The voice acting is weak (even Patrick Stewart), it's hard to get invested in the story, and I think I will throw up if I have to watch another Superhero Landing after breaking through stained glass.\n\nIt doesn't help that the game is just too long and too padded. Huge chunks of levels could have been trimmed or stitched with other levels and not taken away from the experience. Worse, many levels have areas blocked off in a Metroidvania fashion. These places aren't hidden or secret, they're sitting in front of you, taunting. The only reason for them to exist is to further pad out the play time by forcing you to go back for the collectible after you got the requisite item. I mean you don't [i]have[/i] to but it does feel like a naked attempt to try and increase the playtime with some unnecessary mechanic.\n\nI can't recommend this game to Metroidvania fans because, well, this isn't a Metroidvania, and I can't even recommend it to God of War fans as it's just inferior and does nothing new. It is however a long game.

But the Lords of Shadow series has always intrigued me, and the first chapter is responsible for that. It's honestly a very underappreciated game, and there is some genuine talent and art put into it. The story is quite interesting for its genre, and while it could have used a bit more interactions or characters, I feel like it more or less delivers, again, considering its genre. The highlights of the game are the gameplay, music and art-style.\nIt's a type of hack&slash, God of War-type of game, clearly born on the console. I honestly have no issue with that and I quite liked the idea of the combat cross combos. It's definetely fast-paced, even if a bit repetitive at times. Bosses are a challenge sometimes, though, and they are all original and well-designed.\nThe areas you visit have interesting backstories, and I really liked the fact that not all the game takes place inside the castle, but you actually see quite a bit of the world around it. They are all crafted with great artistic talent and, especially the castle is a marvel to look at, having that special gothic feel to it. Music is also very good, with some of the tracks being quite emotional, and creating an original mood and feel to the game.\nOn the flipside, the main hero Gabriel has an interesting story arc and conclusion, but his personality is extremely boring and could have used more work. Voice acting is top notch, accompanied by the skillful Patrick Stewart, who's a joy to listen to.\nOverall, I'd reccommend this game as an easy to get into, action game with fast-paced combat, good music and atmosphere and amazing gothic art assets.

Similar to Darksiders, this title is a mash-up of a God of War style combat system and a Nintendo collectathon where you solve puzzles and slowly gather items and abilities to make you stronger.  Unlike Darksiders though I'm sort of torn on whether to give this one a positive recommendation.  It's certainly a servicable title but there are a host of issues that make me wonder if this game was rushed out the door at the last minute.\n\nLet's start with the cutscenes.  They look like shit, especially in the few times there's rain.  Granted this game isn't exactly new but the game in motion looks ten times better than the cutscenes which is kind of jarring.  \n\nThe plot has some interesting threads, but they're poorly tied together and a lot of the overarching narrative is as predictable as it gets.  Bad shit's going down in medieval dark-fantasy Europe, and Gabriel is on a journey to fight some Dark Lords and gather their power to bring his wife back to life. Patrick Stewart voices an NPC that sometimes helps you out and reads a brief intro to each stage, commenting on Gabriel's journey.  Unfortunately most of his commentary is \"Gabriel hasn't slept or eaten and he's feeling increasingly angry\" which is odd given that we see virtually no sign of this in game.  We're supposed to believe that Gabriel is taking a journey down a dark path as a anti-hero but the man is constantly acting like a classic good guy. The rest of the actors are hit-and-miss, though I do like Gabriel's accent. A side note: the game's epilogue makes NO sense unless you play the DLC chapters - which is part of the reason I'm convinced this game was rushed out the door.\n\nThe game is divided into chapters, which are further divided into stages.  You can replay stages at any time, and each stage tends to have some hidden upgrades that make revisiting them worth the trip when you've powered up.  It's not quite classic Castlevania but it does the trick I guess.  I kind of wish that there were more hidden upgrades other than \"more life/magic meter\" or \"more sub-items\" though.\n\nThere's a bunch of climbing in this game, and if you've played any of the Assassins Creed/Prince of Persia games you'll hate every second of it.  It's slow as hell, and often clunky in terms of detecting whether you've grabbed a ledge.\n\nThe combat on the other hand is pretty satisfying, though it's very different in terms of pace when compared to other action games.  This title emphasizes dodging and countering attacks rather than constant aggression.  It also has something interesting in the form of Light/Dark magic.  Hitting the bumpers activates magic which will empower certain items, grant access to new combos, and give you healing (light magic) or extra damage/block crushing capability (shadow magic).  If you're low on your magic reserves you can refill the meters by turning magic off and getting some solid attacks/counters in to build Focus - when full, every attack you make will drop magic-fueling orbs for you to hoover up.  Get hit, and your Focus is gone.  \n\nIt's a nice system that flows well... until you get hit by an attack you couldn't see coming due to the camera.  Or until an enemy does an unblockable attack with a nanosecond telegraph.  Or until a ground pound forces you to jump at the same time someone swings at you (midair blocks are not allowed).  Or until you clearly dodge roll but get clipped by the hit anyway.  This game's combat is sometimes as frustrating as it is fun, and I'm not sure if it's because I suck at it or because the game itself is janky.\n\nThere's a few puzzles to solve as you progress.  The game lets you skip them but you miss out on xp.  I'm not sure why this is even an option, given that 99% of the puzzles are braindead - I only got stuck once or twice and it was usually because the game expected something VERY bizzare.  The best example is probably the music box stage - there were some saws over a passage I had to go through and I couldn't figure out how to avoid them.  Turns out the answer was dodge rolling... something that hadn't been used out of combat until then. These moments are few and far between, but annoying nonetheless.\n\nIf there's something I can unconditionally praise about this game, it's the sense of style.  The environments are cool looking, the monsters well-designed, and the few bits of lore you get drip-fed are interesting.  It's a pity that the rest of the game lacks the level of polish that went into the art design because the main thing that kept me playing was the desire to see where I would be going and what I would fight next.  The game has the Castlevania flavor - everything is nasty yet stylish as all hell, brutal yet refined.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this game, but it's alright.

Stupid.\n\nThere are also other cons that aren't as annoying:\n1. The plot is weak, it started with Loki and then they connected them with transitions. Sometimes it makes no sense at all. In the first chapter, we already see everything - glaciers, swamps, village, rocks... then all these locations start repeating themselves, alternating in a completely random way.\n2. The camera isn't very convenient, it sometimes chooses inconvenient angles.\n3. Why have a combo of 5 hits if any enemy can interrupt you on the third hit? I came up with a pattern - block/roll --> strong punch and so on. It's easier to catch weak enemies with the whip and they die with one hit. So there are combos aplenty, but they aren't necessary. IMHO.\n4. The DLC is terrible. They crammed in all the work that didn't make it into the final product. Plus, I encountered a few bugs, had to replay a couple of times.\n\nPros:\n1. Beautiful landscapes, really.\n2. A really cool art book that you unlock with points from mobs. I recommend getting lost in it.\n3. There are really a lot of bosses, and they don't repeat themselves.

Su ambientaci\u00f3n es espectacular, desde el primer momento entra por los ojos y en varias ocasiones he llegado a quedarme quieto absorto mirando alg\u00fan paisaje, junto con la BSO que le acompa\u00f1a que considero que es perfecta para cada momento y situaci\u00f3n.\n\nSu sistema de combate que es un punto a destacar en un juego de este tipo est\u00e1 bien sin mas, es entretenido, tiene muchas opciones: Combos, Reliquias, armas secundarias, combinaciones entre ellas... Creando combates muy din\u00e1micos y qu enos dan diversas opciones a la hora de enfrentarnos a la diversidad de enemigos que tendremos enfrente, cada uno con unas caracter\u00edsticas definidas.\n\nRespecto a los puntos negativos, el mas destacable sin duda, y muy mencionario en otros comentarios: La C\u00e1mara. Es totalmente fija, no existe posibilidad de moverla como en otros juegos en 3\u00ba persona, el juego va cambiando de planos constantemente conforme avanza nuestro personaje, incluso en combates tendremos que apa\u00f1arnos con el plano que en ese momento nos quiera dar el juego para combatir. Sin embargo tengo que decir que a pesar de ser un aspecto negativo, el estilo de c\u00e1mara fija esta bien conseguido porque al final los planos nos muestran lo que necesitamos ver, pero es totalmente comprensible que a muchos esto no les termine de convencer, sobretodo en combates donde se agradeceria tener un control sobre la c\u00e1mara para ser nosotros mismos los que decidieramos donde enfocar nuestra atencion.\n\nRespecto a los DLC's... tengo que decir que especialmente el \u00faltimo, el Capitulo XIV me ha hecho el juego insufrible, con una mec\u00e1nica de plataformeo (que si, es super corta pero ha sido horrible) muy mal conseguida y con un Boss dificil con una mec\u00e1nica y unos combos muy poco creibles y absurdos...

Por no decir que crear niveles separados permite un dise\u00f1o mas cuidado y detenido de los mismos. \n\nLa accion no es para nada mala, aunque el dise\u00f1o de enemigos hace que el combate se vuelva algo obtuso (de que te sirve saber hacer combos si los enemigos no dejan de bloquear? al final solo haces ataque fuerte y esquivar) y aburrido y repetitivo en ocasiones.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de niveles en el aspecto jugable deja bastante que desear, los puzles me parecen acertados, pero cuando el entorno se vuelve no-lineal y te abren varios caminos... ufff, mucho que aprender en este aspecto. Es sencillo perderse y encima la recompensa por encontrar esos secretos no es motivacion suficiente. La exploracion en este aspecto se vuelve torpe y lenta.\n\n\n-Dise\u00f1o/arte: Brutal... cuando quiere. Los capitulos que transcurren en el castillo de Carmilla son insuperables, el castillo se ve brutal y sus puzles, jefes etc. Que pena que no dure demasiado.\n\nEl resto del juego lo veo tan fuera de contexto y poco inspirado que lo siento casi como un relleno, como si perteneciese a otro juego. Por ejemplo los capitulos del bosque son infumables y la parte de la meseta arida no puede ser mas sosa.\n\nAdemas respecto al lore, me sobran muchas cosas. El tema de los gigantes de piedra sencillamente es lamentable y no pega ni con cola, lo peor es que no se recupera nada relacionado con ello en ninguna secuela, como si hubiesen admitido la cagada.\n\nVamos que cuando el juego es gotico su dise\u00f1o es brutal pero el resto del tiempo sobratodo.\n\nLos mejores momentos del juego bajo mi punto de vista han sido cuando gabriel se dedicaba a escalar por edificios gigantes, se podia apreciar bien el dise\u00f1o y realmente se sentia como el protagonista se esfuerza por continuar su viaje.\n\n\n-Historia: la historia general de la saga, y la fase presentada en este titulo, me parecen brutales, pero el problema es que de todos los momentos empleados en narrar la historia en este juego, solo en el ultimo y poco mas suceden cosas relevantes. En algunos capitulos la historia da vueltas y ocurren peque\u00f1as mini-historias, lo cual enriquece el lore, pero al final son detalles que no importan, la historia general se explica en un par de momentos y al final se marca un FF9 y justo antes del combate final ocurre una conversacion de sus 10 minutacos buenos explicando toda la historia que no han sabido como contarte antes.\n\nEncima, en lords of shadow 2, en el prologo del juego, te explican en cuestion de 5 min toda la historia acontecida en este juego y no te pierdes nada en lo absoluto.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal, que es un juegazo, lo recomiendo, lo que ocurre es que se puede mejorar practicamente por todos los lados y abundan las carencias. Es ese tipico juego que no puedo disfrutar al 100% porque estoy constantemente pensando que otra cosa se podria haber hecho", "timestamp_created": 1525868174, "timestamp_updated": 1533385350,

It was originally released in 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and ported to windows in 2013. Considering its age, it holds up quite well both in game mechanics and graphically.\n\nBeing a reboot this game starts right at the beginning. You control Gabriel Belmont when an end of days\u2019 event happens. The Lords of Shadow are threatening the alliance with heaven, and human souls are now unable to pass into judgement. Werewolf\u2019s, Vampires, Necromancers and other evil creatures are stalking the land, destroying town and feasting on the population. Having recently lost your wife, you are sent by her spirit into the Lords of Shadows lands to stop the evil and you are advised you will be able to resurrect your slain wife by the order. Along the way you team up with Zobek, a hero of your order and its longest surviving member who knows many secrets and you meet a few other helpful souls along the way. I thought the plot was really well done, and paints a very tragic story for Gabriel. After everything that happens, it still didn\u2019t explain how Dracula came about, or why the order would want to kill him after everything he has done (especially with how many knights you find dead through the game). This is resolved in the 2 DLC that are included in this edition of the game, which continues Gabriel\u2019s story. Gabriel\u2019s sacrifice to protect humanity (or what was left of it) was very well done, as was his corruption into Dracula to save humanity.  \n\nGameplay is consistent with others in the franchise, with a lot of time being spent solving puzzles to proceed, fighting enemies, swinging, jumping, rolling and collecting upgrades which improves your chances of succeeding. A fair chunk of upgrades require replaying a stage at a later time after you have collected a different upgrade, this might put you off but it isn\u2019t required to finish the game (it just means you won\u2019t have full magic power or secondary weapons). The combat cross is Gabriel\u2019s main weapon (its design makes you question the church), and it has plenty of combos to keep combat interesting and entertaining. You have a few secondary weapons that provide different bonus vs different enemy types, a crystal that summons a bound daemon (not sure why the order has these) to deal massive damage to anything on screen and light and dark magic as well (one which heals as you do damage, and one which does extra damage). The 3D platforming was good, if you mistimed a jump you simply restarted on the last area with a health decrease instead of at the start of the stage so it wasn\u2019t frustrating. Combat was good, varied and provided visual cues as to when an enemy was going to attack. For the easy/medium run this was very helpful (this is turned off when playing Paladin mode), so I can imagine that for hard you would need to know how each enemy attacks (though you should hopefully be plenty upgraded by then).  There are quite a few QTE button mashing events, these are very prominent with the larger bosses. The stage length is quite varied, some stages are quite short, some of the latter stages are very long to complete.\n\nI thought the game was excellent visually, with the world really looking decaying and uninviting. Living in fear, most of the humans shun your approach (even if you are the only thing that can save them), and nearly everything is hostile towards you. The Vampire castles are frozen gloomy places, the caves where the werewolves stalk are dark and forbidding, while the area of the Necromancers are blasted deserts where nothing lives. The monster design was well done, and I think praise is deserved for the werewolf boss and the vampire boss, both were designed very well (if a little lacking in clothes). I would advise having any young ones around when playing this, there is a fair amount of gore and a bit of female nudity (Pixes, the crystal daemon, Carmilla in her Kim K dress)\n\nThe orchestra score used for the music was amazing, it really fits the dark world that you find yourself playing in. I can understand why it won awards. The voice acting was top notch, with Patrick Stewart narrating each stage and also Zobek. Gabriel, Cornell, Carmilla, Laura and even the forgotten one are also very well voiced.\n\nIf you are chasing 100% achievements then you are going to be in for a very long run. It will require at least 3 runs of every stage (the first run unlocks Paladin difficulty and challenges). Some of the challenges are very difficult to do, and you will want to be fully upgraded to do Paladin difficulty. An easy run took close to 30 hours (there was fair bit of exploration the first time around).

game for the most part if you can put up with some horrible decisions in its design.\n\nPrincipally the biggest issue for me have to be the boss battles, they try and resemble, to not say replicate, the boss fights from shadow of the colossus, you climb on top of massive enemies and then you have to attack their weak points, the problem is that everything has to be mediated, and, or, scripted somehow, so in order to progress through those fights, you have to allow the game to let you do so, rather than something that actually falls under your own judgement, and ability, to decide.\n\nThen there's the fact that the game prolongs its stay for too long, the game has twelve chapters, with 46 missions in total.\n\nAfter a while of doing the same thing over and over again the game feels as if its artificially extending its lenght rather than it, being something necessary for the game.\n\nThis game could've, should've, been a heck of a lot shorter...\n\nThe first chapter or so it's also terrible, the whole chapter it's practically an extended tutorial in which the game consistenly takes the controller away from the player to explain the most basic, and rudimentary, mechanics, and systems, that you can think of.\n\nPair that up with the horrid dependance of the quick time events that the game is plagued with, and well...\n\nThe quick time events in this game seem to be (to me) a petty attempt at replicating, through a very narrow, and short-minded perspective some of the fundamental and otherwise satisfying mechanics of games such as God of War.\n\nThis is a game that you can tell it practically tried to go through a series of games to conform its own design, instead of designing its own unique aspects.\n\nThe game constantly takes systems, mechanics, and even controls from other games, Shadow of the Collossus, God of War, Uncharted...\n\nIt is as almost the devs went out of their way to borrow as much as they could from a series of Sony exclusives, and as end result, at times the game it's constantly bouncing back and foward between a series of mechanics, and systems, that ended up destroying whathever pace the game already didn't have.\n\nIt is not all bad of course, the game holds up visually incredibly well, the games aesthetic its diverse, and unique, playing it at 1440p, and at over 60 fps ended up offering a flawless experience in regards of the technical aspects of this game.\n\nNot only that but after the first chapter, the game really offers a lot of freedom for the player to explore, run around, collect power ups, and level up some of his skills to run around murdering an onslaught of enemies.\n\nThe skill system, I found, a bit disappointing, the game only allows you to upgrade combos, for the most part, and the rest of the upgrades that you can level up are simply upgrades for equipment that you probably will never use, simply because at times there really isn't any need for it, although this might change with different difficulty modes.\n\nBesides that though, this is one of those games that to me it isn't bad, but it isn't really that good, or great, or decent...\n\nIt is a bearable, mediocre experience that allows players to witness a time from not that long ago in which developers, similar to a lot of the ones you'll sadly find right here on Steam, try to borrow from some of the \"success\" from other games.\n\nI understand taking inspiration, but one thing is to take inspiration, and another one it's to try and recreate exact moments from other creations.\n\nAs if somehow just by doing so the game might end up as much, if not more, than the original product already did for people who are currently playing it.\n\nI'm looking at you Minecraft, and the series of clones that people ended up producing from the originality of your idea...", "timestamp_created": 1522266919, "timestamp_updated": 1522266919, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

adventure game.\n\nThis is the game that the dark, Gothic Castlevania mythology always deserved.\n\nI played through this game about 2 years ago, and I still think about it often, some of the best boss fights and combat I've ever seen.\n\nEven run-of-the-mill enemies can prove a challenge,  and you can upgrade your characters skills to meet that challenge.  \n\nIn classic Castlevania fashion, there's platforming that provides a reasonable challenge, and also requires upgraded skills in order to Traverse certain areas which inevitably make the player return to Maps they've already defeated in order to finish upgrading their character....  I normally find this metroidvania style of gameplay to be annoying, but in this case it wasn't a problem at all.\n\nThe addition of mini games and puzzles with a nice touch.\n\nYou won't do any better than this game for boss fights, they run the gamut from very challenging enemies of your own size, all the way up to gigantic Titans hundreds of feet tall.  The boss of the final DLC is perhaps one of the most challenging boss fights I've ever seen, even on the easiest difficulty, he's almost impossible to defeat.\n\nThe story is a deep, tragic tale of Supernatural, medieval misery,  gray morality, and fate. It takes an interesting look at Humanities struggle with powers Beyond its scope, and the reality that we are often the greatest villains in our own existence.  The developer doesn't leave you in any doubt about the world you play in or the lore contained therein, you are given a codex which unlocks as you progress, helping you understand the characters, the story and certain strategy elements to help you defeat the enemies you encounter.\n\nThe voice acting is absolutely top-notch, if you read the description you'll see what a great cast Konami manage to round up for this title. In particular Robert carlile's performance is absolutely unbelievable, if you know him from his previous work, this game will show you an entirely different realm of this capability is a performer,\n\nThe graphics look gorgeous, demonstrating all the best that the PS3 era had to offer.\n\nI thought about this game today, and though it's been awhile since I've played it, it's on my shortlist to revisit and I wanted to let everyone else know how great it is.\n\n\nAbsolute 100% must buy, even if you were to pay its full price right now, I don't think you would be disappointed.\n\nIf you pick it up on sale, you'll be guaranteed to get an absolute steal.", "timestamp_created": 1521214334, "timestamp_updated": 1521214536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569709122180938721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40841396": {"recommendationid": "40841396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005859218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1690, "last_played": 1519363091}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this game has some really cool looking features and concepts.

You just have so little control over the game that its insulting. \n  The game is like a windows media player file and all you do is hit play. There is a cutscene every 20 or so seconds and when you get to walk uninterrupted for a few minutes (which is rare) I wished there was much more of that. On screen prompts harass you all the time to tell you obvious things like \"get out of the way!\" or \"hit the enemy's weak points\". And at that point you realize, all you do is pressing the buttons you are told to. There is no initiative at all given to the player, which destroys the sense of satisfaction, discovery, and challenge you get in good games; like the 2D Castlevania games or a masterpiece like Prince of Persia: The sands of time.
