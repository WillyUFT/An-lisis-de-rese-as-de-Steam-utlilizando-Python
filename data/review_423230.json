Secondly, the parry mechanic was fair and very enjoyable. Plus, the long range was well implemented. Thirdly, most of the bosses were challenging and unique, as they required you to play in a certain way to be able to beat them. Additionally, the setting and the storytelling made the experience intriguing.\n[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]\nOn the negative side, the walking scenes sometimes last too long while not being that special. Besides, the dash mechanic is horrid, feels very bad when using it, and makes all the gameplay unresponsive. The reason is that the developers decided to activate the dash when you release the key, which in practice feels very bad. Also, the DLC doesn't add that much content; it would have been better if they added a few more bosses.\n[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]\nIn short, the gameplay is great, especially the parry mechanic that is well implemented with so many different unique bosses that they force you to play in a certain way to ensure that you are not just utilising the same mechanic over and over. Too, the story telling was intriguing, revolving around the freedom concept. Sadly, the dash mechanics were poorly implemented, and the DLC could have been better.

of \u201csize doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s what you do with it\u201d couldn\u2019t be more true with Furi. This game hardly lasts more than an evening, yet it has been permanently lodged in my memory for years now. A seamless combination of banging tunes and tight gameplay over an awesome boss rush will have you killing the same 10 enemies over and over again without ever getting bored. If you\u2019re even remotely interested in Furi, I implore you to grab the nearest credit card and buy it. You\u2019ll thank me later. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\nI Actually finished with Furi a very long time ago now, and have been sitting on this for ages since. Ever since my first clear of this game I\u2019ve known it deserved a perfect score, and even after putting the blood, sweat, and tears into the 100% run, I\u2019ve struggled to find a single thing wrong with the game. The reason then that this review has taken years was not that I couldn\u2019t decide how I felt about Furi, it was simply that I couldn\u2019t figure out how to describe how good it is. \n\n[b]The size of your Furi doesn\u2019t matter.[/b]\n\nVideo games in the last decade or so, especially the AAA side of the industry, struggle with a scope problem. Games are always trying to be the \u201cbiggest\u201d, \u201clongest\u201d, \u201cmost innovative\u201d. In a society where we are time strapped as is, it\u2019s always amazed me that marketing a game to have over 100 hours of playtime is seen as a valid strategy. Even some of the best games in the last 5 years even have this issue (cf. Elden ring, a near perfect game that was just too long). Furi, however, does not. \nIf you didn\u2019t glean it from the store page, Furi is a boss rush. There are 10 boss fights, plus a couple of DLC fights, and that\u2019s it. Every second of Furi\u2019s time is accounted for, like the game went through an overly harsh edit over and over before finally releasing. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to go into how much of a breath of fresh air this is. If you want to experience Furi, you\u2019ll need to dedicate at most a couple of evenings to get the game over with, instead of removing yourself entirely from the outside world for a month. With how short, even compact it is, you can be sure that every second of Furi\u2019s playtime has been accounted for, made use of in some way. The game even manages to tell a somewhat compelling and well thought out story, something the average 100-odd hour Ubisoft game struggles with. It might be initially surprising to you then that a large portion of Furi is simply just walking, walking that can be done automatically so that you can just set the controller down to watch and listen. These sections give the game space to slowly build up each boss fight, giving them the introduction they deserve, while the music works on introducing you to the next song on the legendary soundtrack. \n\n[b]Furiwave.[/b]\n\nI normally try to avoid talking too much about the OST in my game reviews, the soundtrack of a game is massively important to me, but my knowledge of music rarely goes beyond \u201cit\u2019s good or bad\u201d, only becoming important to my review if I feel like it drastically affects the game in some way. That said, I can\u2019t talk about Furi without talking about this game\u2019s soundtrack. Normally in a game, the gameplay takes priority over the music, and the latter is molded, bent to fit the former. Furi does this the opposite way. Sometimes this game feels like it was designed specifically around each track, almost as if it was just a clever interactive way for the artists to show off their songs. Those boss \u201cbuildups\u201d I mentioned earlier? They introduce you to the boss, but more importantly they allow the soundtrack to slowly set the scene, allow it to build up and reach the biting point as you slip into each fight. I\u2019ve never seen a game that manages to hype up each boss in such a way, while giving you a subconscious idea of what you\u2019ll be expecting. It\u2019s great. The music also changes mid-fight, flowing and changing from each phase to the next, mirroring the action perfectly. During my personal favorite boss fight, the high speed synthwave track slows to a slow grinding beat when you enter melee portions of the fights, while during another fight, a slow, dark, and simplistic track suddenly gains a powerful beat as the boss enters the \u201cdesperation\u201d phase of the fight. Even if you\u2019re skeptical about the bullet hell/parry gameplay style of Furi, if you like synthwave/electronic music, you NEED to play this game, just for the music. Luckily the game has some very well-tuned difficulty settings so that you can just enjoy the music and story without having to worry about the fighting if you choose.  \n\n\n[b]Furier.[/b]\n\nOn the topic of difficulty settings, I wanted to talk about the hardest one. I\u2019m sometimes a little skeptical of difficulty settings, as I think too many can often just undermine the quality of balancing (although I appreciate the accessibility, they provide to people without the time to git gud). Furi is one of those cases that proves difficulty settings can be amazing if done right. Furier, the highest difficulty in the game, is absolutely nuts. The bosses aren\u2019t buffed in the classic sense, instead they\u2019re almost entirely new bosses. The highest difficulty feels exactly like it should do \u2013 a much tougher challenge destined for those who\u2019s mouths are watering for more Furi. I 100%ed this game, as I tend to do, and the run to complete Furier on S rank was a grueling, tiring one that took countless hours of practice. What it wasn\u2019t, was frustrating. I\u2019m sad that this game flew so under the radar as I think even juggernauts like Fromsoft have something to learn from how Furi handled it\u2019s balancing. Furi is a game that gives back as much as you put into it, and the devs themselves understood this: As they put it: Furi is an instrument, and it was designed for players who practice it till mastery. \n\nI hope by reading this little love letter disguised as a review you decide to give it a go. There\u2019s really little more I can do to sing this game\u2019s praises other than buying the game for everyone who seems remotely interested, and I\u2019m a little too broke for that. Furi won\u2019t have you immersed for hours, but if you\u2019re aching for a challenge, a new soundtrack to listen compulsively to, or a little of both, then this little hidden gem has you covered. Just remember, the Jailor is the key, kill him and you\u2019ll be free. \n\n\n[h1]6/6[/h1]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/GentleHoovy/recommended/][b]More of my reviews here![/b][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1698171572, "timestamp_updated": 1698171782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148794296": {"recommendationid": "148794296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161518924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1700098524}, "language": "english", "review": "feel the furi", "timestamp_created": 1698165329, "timestamp_updated": 1698165329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148761421": {"recommendationid": "148761421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311920541", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1623000792}, "language": "english", "review": "it was ight but like mhm", "timestamp_created": 1698106990, "timestamp_updated": 1698106990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148744198": {"recommendationid": "148744198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075162411", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1698164180}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una boss rush con peque\u00f1os segmentos de paseo.

No matter how you look at it, it sucks. It works on the release of the button, thus allowing it to be charged for greater dash distance, but 90% of times an instant, fast dash is required and there's just no time to remain still for a second or two while charging it- you can't even shoot while dash charging - therefore the player has to bear a constant half-second delay for the dash input to be executed. In a fast action game like this, this is an artificial difficulty barrier that makes fights more difficult than they should.\n- The bullet hell sections are often plagued by a terrible camera perspective that makes extremely difficult to understand the distance between the player model and the incoming bullets/waves. This combined with the delayed dash creates very frustrating situations, that reach a peak of absolute vileness during the final battle against [spoiler]The Star[/spoiler].\n- Perfect parries, which are supposed to be rewarding since they leave the enemy stunned and open for a flashy counter animation, are actually useless since said counter deals less damage then a regular sequence of normal slashes. Really stupid, if you ask me.\n\n[h1]\u25cb NEUTRAL:[/h1]\n\n\u25cb All the fights are basically structured in the same way: each boss has their unique attack pattern that the player has to figure out in order to understand when they are vulnerable, but there's always a first phase more focused on shooting and ranged attacks, where the player has to reduce the boss' \"shield\", followed by a phase where the characters are forced in melee battle and an actual life bar can be removed. Rinse and repeat until the final phase, which always involves a hard bullet hell section during which the boss is invulnerable and the player can do nothing but dodge the attacks until they stop and the boss is ready to be taken down with a finisher. Out of the 10 different boss battles, only a couple make the exception of being exclusively focused on melee and bullet hell fighting, respectively. Whether this particular game structure is good or bad is up to personal taste.\n\nI strongly recommend to buy this game on sale while keeping in mind that the issues I've pointed out can be very annoying and frustrating, to the point of ruining the experience for some. I will also make a separate review once I'll have the chance to try the \"Onnamusha\" DLC that adds a new female counterpart of the protagonist, with a different moveset.", "timestamp_created": 1697046400, "timestamp_updated": 1697154020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147986652": {"recommendationid": "147986652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016164200", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1696959121}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck you man who realize Dash system in this game anything else is good", "timestamp_created": 1696959246, "timestamp_updated": 1696959246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442028999328613281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147984303": {"recommendationid": "147984303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350317822", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1697146717}, "language": "english", "review": "holy its hard QwQ", "timestamp_created": 1696956192, "timestamp_updated": 1696956192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147973662": {"recommendationid": "147973662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026920563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 473, "last_played": 1597634264}, "language": "english", "review": "A Neon Symphony of Swords and Struggle: Navigating the Visceral Challenge of FURI\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd3a Furi: A Neon-Drenched Descent into Vengeance \ud83e\udd3a\ud83d\ude80\n\n\u201cI was nothing more than a weak rabbit, yet the path of vengeance molded me into a sword-wielding harbinger of freedom.\u201d\n\nIn FURI, your journey is forged in the scorching crucibles of incredibly arduous battles, where your initial vulnerability morphs into a lethal precision, born from necessity and crafted through repeated, brutal failure. From the initial moment, when you, a prisoner, decide that freedom is worth any cost, the game throws you into a ravaging maelstrom of combat, where every misstep is ruthlessly punished, and every victory feels like a hard-earned triumph.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Unyielding Difficulties and Trials: The game\u2019s remorseless difficulty is not merely a barrier but a meticulous teacher, forcing you to hone your skills, to understand each enemy, and to transform from a vulnerable captive into a relentless force. It's in this meticulously crafted difficulty where FURI transcends mere action, becoming a deeply personal journey of perseverance and evolution.\n\n\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f The Path from Weakness to Power: The game begins with you as nothing, a captive with everything to gain and nothing to lose. Your journey from a \u201cweak rabbit\u201d to a being of potent vengeance is as much a narrative transformation as it is a mechanical one. Through each duel, your own skills sharpen alongside those of your avatar, turning every slash and shot into a visceral, satisfying impact.\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f Veiled Narratives of Vengeance: Amidst the chaos of battle, the story unfolds like a shadowy tapestry of mystery and vengeance. The nuanced, concealed details of the plot are not mere context but are the heartbeat of your quest, driving every clash, every defeat, and every victory. The vagueness of your path only makes each revelation more potent, each discovered detail a precious shard of a deliberately obscured narrative mosaic.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Euphony of Combat and Soundtrack: As your blades clash and bullets fly, the kinetic soundtrack, featuring artists like Carpenter Brut and The Toxic Avenger, becomes a vital part of the experience. It is the pulsating rhythm to every encounter, a simultaneous manifestation of the aesthetic and the emotional journey within FURI, creating an indelibly immersive synergy of gameplay and music.\n\n\u201cMy path was not merely an escape, but a relentless march towards retribution, crafted through the grueling anvil of each duel.\u201d\n\nIn FURI, every defeat is a lesson, every victory a milestone, and your path from captive to avenger is a narrative wrought not just in the game\u2019s story but in your own development as a player. It\u2019s a challenging, enigmatic, and supremely satisfying odyssey through neon landscapes and formidable foes, where your evolution mirrors that of your avatar, transforming each clash into a personal and deeply satisfying tale of triumph.\n\n\ud83c\udfae Overall Rating: 9/10 \ud83c\udfae\n\n\ud83d\udddd\ufe0f Here, in the vibrant shadows and intense battles of FURI, freedom is a journey through your own evolving skill, where the key is not merely victory, but mastery, understanding, and relentless perseverance. \ud83d\udddd\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1696942699, "timestamp_updated": 1696942699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147951966": {"recommendationid": "147951966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844572254", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1699758450}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Casi me quedo sin pelo\n\nRecomendado si quieres alopecia gratis 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1696897665, "timestamp_updated": 1696897665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147904130": {"recommendationid": "147904130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133103308", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1697770689}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game years back and semi recently revisted it; fucking fun game with buttery smooth movement. highly recommend", "timestamp_created": 1696818656, "timestamp_updated": 1696818656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147895250": {"recommendationid": "147895250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059600166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1082, "last_played": 1615401478}, "language": "english", "review": "Elegant.

On the 2nd half of the game it got much better, the walks were shorter and the plot was more involved and left me wanting to play more.\n2. The final boss of this game completely swapped out your mechanics. you still had dashes and guns, but that's it. Charged shot is completely different. No parrying to regen health. No melee attacks, You're much slower, etc. It didn't feel like a test of my skills, when i died it felt more like i wasn't prepared for this challenge properly than i just messed up. I didn't enjoy it at all. I finished it because i wanted to see the end, but i hated every second of that boss. It was honestly the only straight up unfun part of the game.\nOverall this game was good, I'd give it a 7-8/10.

It kind of just starts and ends with no real twist, turn and or question. This can be really good, dont get me wrong, but it wasnt just my cup of tea, and i believe it could have been better with a bit more time put into it!\n\nI did enjoy the diffrent \"boss arenas\" but i still believe a bit more time could have been put to great use to make the enviorments larger and more expanded to give the world a bit more lore and intresting designs and i also felt like alot of the textures were either really simple or downright missing like i know its a artstyle choice but it felt to simple and beta like, it didnt feel like the one designing the artystyle had any real passion for the project. With this said i have to say its alot better then what halo infinte did with its \"unreal 4\" feel with lacking explosions and craig!\nI just personally believe a bit more should have been placed in makeing the areans change, with the degredation of the bosses. \nMaybe have some sort of \"easter egg\" where you can be in awe of the design, with this said i thought the walking segments were pretty enjoyable change of pace and did somewhat give me a bit of what i wanted i just think a bit more time in those segments or segments filling their purpoes would be intresting, like a DMC minion arena or something like that (Im a DMC3 lover i know sorry!)\n\nThe boss design, there are good bosses, poor and just stupid\nMost bosses of the game lack story or lore which makes the fights lack incentive on your part, most of the bosses boil down to you killed xyz and now im mad, there are good bosses dont get me wrong but they come in too late and or in my opinion lack the stuff that made bosses in DMC 3 or Metal gear revengence special. Like we do have a Samuel/Vergil fight but he isnt a reacuring caracter which made those so iconic they lack charm overall. With that said they did have some really good bosses. (sors for spoils)\n \nBeating bosses dont earn anything after the fight. I know that every single boss doesnt need to drop a new mechanic, weapon and or thing for the game to still be intresting but compair this to the DMC series. In DMC every single boss leave a new mechanic for the player to explore after the fight which in turn increases the mechanical skill celing and gives the player a chance to make their own style. If we compair it to something like \"Enter the Gungeon\" which is also a bullet hell they even give alot more tools for the player to explore which in turn makes the combat more varied and intresting!\nAs of now you have access to a dodge, parry, gun, and sword and their charged versions but it really just boils down to spamm with no thought what so ever, and or a slog of trial and error without the good stuff that souls likes bring!\n\nOverall a critical review but i was underwelmed by the positive reviews and found the game to be overated.

A bit short and kinda easy for people who are pretty good at parrying, wished they let me unlock Furier mode from the start, but would recommend for a short ~2 hour session.  The story was bare bones but it does at least explain a bit behind why you're here along with where you are and who you're fighting most of the time, but the main focus is half on the combat and half on the bosses.  The combat is snappy and satisfying, the bosses were punishing, fair, and I thought they held up pretty well, but the with the Burst and the Edge were phenomenal and are probably the best bosses out there, just wished some of the other bosses held that same bar of quality, particularly the final boss. \n\nEverything past this is my small rant on the bosses, for the final boss;\nIt strips you of the fun melee/shooter hybrid combat you had for the entirety of the game, [spoiler] forces you inside an exosuit, which would sound cool, but it [/spoiler] disables your melee attacks and forces you into pure bullet hell bossfight.  Not saying that the bullet hell gameplay wasn't fun prior to the final boss, it is fun, I just wanted to play the same way I played until then.  Not only that, but I thought the boss wasn't all that interesting to fight, sure it was difficult, but every boss prior had some unique gimmick or a particular fighting style to set themselves apart from one another.  The final boss just doesn't have an identity, and instead just feels like the game is just throwing attack at you.  This part might be a nitpick, but I also thought it was a bit artificial as well [spoiler] pun intended  [/spoiler], aside from the first 2 phases, there is no opportunity to heal, and even then you could only recover 1 or 2 bars from the rare parry.  There's also the caveat in the 3rd and 4th phases where the only way to do damage is nearly blocked by the orange projectiles that block your shots ([spoiler] save for the beam, but your again forced into a fighting style you might not like[/spoiler]).  Maybe the final boss wasn't supposed to have an identity, but it's still a disappointment whenever I think about all the bosses before it.  Also, this was the only boss I got a game over on and I accidentally hit my nuts with my controller.  Worst final boss I've ever fought, physically hurts me.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the other bosses;\nI thought the Hand was a bit too easy and could have offered a bit more ([spoiler] I expected a bit more out of the guy who captured you. [/spoiler]  Perhaps he could have been attacking less and somehow forcing you to attack him while having his moveset and attacks centered around defense?), the Beat didn't put much of a fight to begin with ([spoiler] I get it's supposed to question your morals, but [/spoiler] it's the fight before the credit roll), instead I think her position could have been swapped out with the Song instead since [spoiler] it would make a bit more sense narratively [/spoiler] and she could also be upgraded to be a much more fitting boss while being a fun, competent semi-final boss fight and there really wasn't much to her boss fight aside from her appearance and being focused on range attacks, while still [spoiler] making you conflicted on whether or not you're the bad guy [/spoiler].  Other than that, I thought thought the Line was a bit slow in the beginning (I'm nitpicking here), and I thought it would be cool to have a rematch with a revamped and powered up Chain.\n\nSo this was my review based on my first playthrough of the Furi, finished at 2.3 hrs on normal mode so I haven't fought the dlc boss yet so I may change my review slightly after another playthrough", "timestamp_created": 1692764776, "timestamp_updated": 1692808626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144799894": {"recommendationid": "144799894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043897734", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1692596855}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esquivar bolitas brillantes, disparar y pegar espadasos.

Every single fight feels like a final boss, each one requiring focus, studying, timing, trial and error to defeat. You may find yourself angry, overwhelmed, hopeless or even fascinated, with enough optimism; by the various and continuous challenges that appear infront of you. Perhaps even all of them, as if going through multiple phases, just like the battles you face.\n\n[u][b]I highly insist you stay on the normal intended difficulty[/b][/u] even if you feel the urge to switch to easy because a certain boss is whapping your butt. You cannot change the difficulty back once it's on easy. So just hang in there and try to master the boss's attacks until you nail that bastard.\n\n[b]But now, the real hero of this game is the music[/b], like gah damm it hits hard with the vibe and theme of this game. And once you beat the game you will hear that beautiful credits music in the menu from then on out; hearing it after booting the game up again just made me feel rejuvenated, made me want to tackle this beautiful game again, and again and again...\n\n[u]Some in-game knowledge.[/u]\n[b]- Some battles include healing orbs (green projectiles) which you will have to attack and pick up if you want to restore a tiny bit of health, some bosses do not provide these, instead you heal by successfully parrying an attack.\n- You have 3 lives in each battle, defeating 1 phase of a boss will restore 1 life, and defeating a phase will also restore your current health to full. When you die, the current phase you were on will reset. Upon losing all 3 lives you lose the battle and must restart.\n- Holding your dodge will further increase your teleportation range.\n- Sometimes staying close and personal to the opponent is easier and safer than letting them perform their ranged attacks.\n- A few exception of attacks cannot be parried, and must be dodged/avoided.\n- You can increase your attack damage in close combat by charging your Right Click.\n- Attacking projectiles is often easier than trying to dodge them.[/b]\n\n\n\n[b]I'm ranking the battles from best to worst based on my enjoyment and experience:[/b]\n\n1. Paddle guy (The Edge) - Hard at first but becomes pretty enjoyable when you learn it. It's purely close combat so if you like that you will love this fight.\n\n2. Fish face (The Scale) - It was pretty unique and cool concept, the music choice could have been better but I still enjoyed this fight a lot, it requires you to really think about where you step.\n\n3. Torturer (The Chain) - Classic one, definitely deserves a decent spot in the list. Now it's definitely one of the easiest fights, or well easiest to learn I'd say because of the simplicity it introduces. But as a beginner it felt awesome.\n\n4. Prisoner with anger management issues (The Strap) - A little too dank with the character design. I really enjoyed the concept of walls and them getting destroyed as you fight it out in the arena, it adds this cat and mouse feel to the battle when you have to hide out if you're ever in a pinch.\n\n5. Main protag Knight (The Hand) - The battle relies mostly on close combat, or well a lot actually, so if you weren't good at close combat before, this boss would surely put you in your place to make sure you learn. Personally I think the battle is too repetitive, but I guess it goes out of it's way to teach you the mastery of parrying in a pretty effective way.\n\n6. Sniper girl (The Burst) - Definitely the hardest battle in general out of all the guardians, as its requiring insane focus and reaction time. It's basically just a copy paste of The Strap battle but extra annoyingness. The character choice and design is a very stereotypical and mainstream sniper chick, [i][strike]cough widowmaker cough cough[/strike][/i], which I just find a bit cringe and unfitting in this game. Could have put a little more effort into the character itself.\n\n7. Nice woman (The Song) - Everything feels like a cluster and intentionally annoying, that and you always fall off the map trying to dodge the bullet hell. I just wanted it to be over.\n\n8. \"MVP\" Girl (The Beat) - [spoiler] She is so easy that you will feel bad for beating her[/spoiler] but definitely better than the crap boss below. \n\n9. Old geezer (The Line) - The fight has too much stalling, it feels very slow and boring, every time I had to restart the battle I felt like I was wasting my time significantly, because the battle wasn't even interesting.\n\n\nRankings in terms of difficulty:\n1.

It definitely does have some things that hold it back, so I hope to give a comprehensive and realistic review of the game for anyone looking to pick it up. \nPros\nSpectacle - This game looks and sounds fantastic to play. While the model quality isn't hyper-realistic triple A gold, it gives the game a distinct style that sets it above. The characters are a diverse in their designs, ranging from revamped embodiments of classic tropes(eg The Hand, The Song), bizarre new looks(eg The Voice, The Scale) or literal horror movie monsters. Looking at you, Strap. \nControls - Yep, this game is responsive and gives you just enough variation in your moveset as to not overwhelm you with options but also so that you can find new stuff as you progress. Interesting stuff like boost and charge dodging can actually come in handy a lot, but if you want to stick to shooting and slashing, you'll be successful.\nFights - Some fights are more focused on parries, some are focused on shooting and dodging, and some require you to think outside the box completely, there's something for everyone whether you're a fan of Touhou or Sekiro.\nFINAL SPOILER WARNING \nCons \nStory - Story? What story? This game does very little in terms of worldbuilding or character development, as your silent protagonist just sort of gets up one day and chooses violence. The Voice was so nebulous and confusing that I was fully expecting him to either be the actual Jailer or a figment of The Stranger's imagination, alla Ninja Ninja from Afro Samurai. He gives you a bit of exposition before each fight which does an alright job characterizing each boss but just creates more questions as to what his true relationship is with the Guardians. The jail in general is never explained, only that the Guardians built it somehow to contain miscellaneous threats to the Free World, led by The Architect(aka The Voice). The twist at the ending showing that the Stranger is actually a member of an alien race who prolong the survival of their species by assimilating other worlds, and he was part of the Rider program that scout out the planet's surface before he was captured. Huh? What? The only time this was ever foreshadowed was The Line's dying words to look up to the sky, and some vague lines from The Song.\nOverworld - The levels before fighting each boss would have worked much better as skippable cutscenes. the rigid 8 point movement and the constantly changing camera angles make traversing them boring at best, and actively confusing at worst. If they were simply cutscenes that play out, it would solve the issue of getting through them and allow them even more freedom with the camera. Although I suppose not having your movement free would make the Voice's ramblings even more unbearable.\nDifficulty - The difficulty ramp up in this game has no rhyme or reason. Some bosses increase in difficulty from their predecessors, as they should, but some are significantly easier than the ones coming before them. I was very let down with the low difficulty of the Hand, Edge, and Beat fights. The Beat is especially offensive, as she is supposed to be the last guardian of the prison. The Voice makes it clear that she's actually quite weak compared to the other guardians and simply wanted to be the final obstacle out of some naive hero complex, but in that case I think the fight should have played out with her trying to fight you at first before realizing she has no chance and running away until she can't anymore and you finish her in 1 hit. That would have actually gone to lengths to show that she's pitiful as a warrior but her control of the area and its technology is truly unmatched. If she had really been the final boss, that would have left a terrible taste in any gamer's mouth. I sure hope the actual final boss stuck the landing...\nThe Star - It really baffles me how the final boss of the game takes away your sword, limiting you to just shooting. The fight in general felt very frustrating and restricting, which is the opposite of how I was expecting it to play out after I recieved a spacesuit mech. The difficulty was very well executed, as it was a significant challenge to overcome, but overall this fight did very little to carry the feel and spirit of Furi into its ending. Additionally, if you chose to assimilate the planet, you will have your save file reset and be unable to fight this boss(the same for if you choose to stay with The Song, but that's much earlier in the game).\n\nOverall, Furi is not a perfect game, but it is super enjoyable.

I could see how someone could enjoy this game, but that someone isn't me. If you don't like bullet hells, probably best to look for something else. Part of the fault lies on me using a mouse/kb setup instead of a recommended controller, so keep that in mind.\n\nGameplay - 3/10 (8/10 for melee, but I do NOT like bullet hells. This will be different if you do.)\nPresentation - 5/10 (Like the art, don't like the animation and the cutscenes are a slog)\n\nWorth the Time: Yes.\nWorth the Money: No. (I would buy this on sale/HB for $5-10 - this game does not have enough to do for $20)\n.\nI bought this game because I heard lots of good things about it and really liked its soundtrack. I wanted a single-player game and thought that this would be a fun challenge. I played through the entire game twice, once on Furi difficulty and again on Furier difficulty. My first playthrough was blind, I used speedrunning footage as a guide on the second playthrough. I have no interest as of right now of playing again, although it might be fun to revisit as a speedrunning challenge down the line.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but I found it hard to do so. I agree with a lot of the other more detailed negative reviews you can find for this game - it has TONS of stuff that I really love, but there's just a bunch of small issues that hold it back in my opinion. The combat system is incredibly fleshed out yet incredibly one dimensional at the same time, and the boss rush format of the game is tightly focused on what this game lives and dies by: the combat.\n\nThe core gameplay for a majority of the fights revolves around switching between a ranged bullet-hell type gamemode that lets you switch between your gun and your sword and a CQC phase that locks you in with the boss and forces you to get close and personal with your melee. The two phases feel very distinct, and offer a good bit of gameplay variety. The melee elements in the ranged mode... exist, I guess, but my main complaint lies in the interactivity of most of the ranged fights in the game.\n\nA lot of them end up feeling tedious, especially on Furier, and for a game that really leans into being a fast pace game about dueling that was really disappointing. There's a couple really bad offenders here - especially on a first time playthrough - and it just felt like wasted potential. I love this game's melee combat - when I can actually do it. Most of the time I'm running around hoops trying not to get tagged by some orb or power wave and fighting my dashes. Again, this is really my fault for playing on MnK, but dashing on KB feels kinda awkward, especially in CQC phases. I understand that the game was designed around having a controller, but having the need for incredibly precise analog dashes is annoying and the workaround using the mouse to set direction in CQC feels really bad. I found myself just interrupting sweeping attacks instead of trying to dodge them since the odds of me just going in an unintended direction felt too high. Dodging via reticle can also be a chore, and the option to toggle between that and dodging based on movement was in a really unintuitive spot in the menus, so I didn't find it til like fight 8 of playthrough 2.\n\nLike others before me have also noted, the risk-reward for using melee in ranged modes also feels... off, somehow. Even when you land parries, it just tends to be better to keep holding shots throughout the entire fight instead of trying to challenge bosses head-on with your sword. The game really doesn't like it when you try to hit people when you're not supposed to in both modes of combat, which feels really bad to me? I understand wanting to avoid letting people just mash attacks through a fight, but I wish this was played better, especially in the ranged fights. Maybe buffing the sword's effectiveness and changing the AI to favor melee attacks slightly more when mixing up their attack patterns would be enough, but as it stands, I really dislike how a lot of the combat feels.\n\nHOWEVER, CQC feels ****ing phenomenal. Inputs are super tight, there's a notable push and pull between you and the boss, risk reward for options like powering up your sword is tangible, and dashing around to dodge attacks would feel great (MnK problem, YMMV on controller). You could make the argument that it's really just a rhythm game in disguise (doesn't help that the game gives a super noticeable \"PRESS F NOW!\" prompt that makes parrying a lot easier for most bosses) but it never felt like that in a fight. It felt like I was trading blows with formidable opponents, learning how they fought and slowly overcoming them. I wish the whole game felt that tight throughout - it would have alleviated a lot of the frustration. Ranged mode feels like the homework I have to get through in order to play these incredible segments of gaming.\n\nI think the most honest way I can describe this is that the elation of beating a boss was not a \"I did it\" feeling but more of a \"Thank God I don't have to do this again,\" which is not a good sign for a game that is centered around running the same boss rush over and over again. I wanted to give this game a fair shake, so I replayed it on Furier, but I'm not sure if I feel like that's time well spent. I guess I could spend time going through and S-Ranking the game, and yeah, maybe I'd get more of an appreciation for the game's mechanics and learn to love the bosses I don't like, but I would rather spend my time doing other things, playing other games.\n\nWhen it comes to presentation, there's things that I like and things that I don't. This game has a nutty OST (it's how I found the game, I'm a sucker for anything with Carpenter Brut on the side) which is easily worth the listen, even if you never plan on playing the games. The graphics are... fine, I suppose. They're stylized in a way that alleviates the things I don't like partially, but the weak out-of-fight animations don't really do much for me. I think some more expressive animation on The Voice and less clipping and stilted feeling animation on the main character would have done wonders for my enjoyment of the game. That being said, the art for the game is really nice. The character designs are all interesting, the levels themselves are really cool conceptually, I like the kind of surreal feel of all the different worlds, so on that front, this game is a success. \n\nPROS:\n+ Strong OST\n+ Melee Fighting feels wonderful\n+ Game is very tightly focused on what it wants to do, which I can respect\n+ Good Art Direction\n+ Satisfying to complete\n+ No artificial difficulty\n+ I hear thunder (pitterpatter)\n+ Fights are beautifully animated\n\nCONS:\n- Game sometimes doesn't let you play the fun bits\n- Game doesn't let you play the fun bits a lot, actually\n- Game took the fun bits out of some of the fights :(\n- Animation is wack outside of fights\n- Controls on MnK are very unrefined\n\nI really wanted to like this game - and it was so, so close to being a really fun game. Despite that, the combat is bogged down by its unfun segments so I don't want to replay the game, and the game is so short and so small that I don't feel like I got my money's worth out of this game and wouldn't unless I really wanted to grind out better ranks. \n\nThis game feels like it was mostly a bullet hell, so keep that in mind.", "timestamp_created": 1691351533, "timestamp_updated": 1691351533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453955888748168945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143536223": {"recommendationid": "143536223", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064618316", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1691261804}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the longest game, and it can be hard to be fully immersed, but I still had fun.\nIt's got a legendary soundtrack and a combat system I don't know how to improve", "timestamp_created": 1691343036, "timestamp_updated": 1691343169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143439407": {"recommendationid": "143439407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258136989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 580, "last_played": 1690146834}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buenisimo", "timestamp_created": 1691221829, "timestamp_updated": 1691221829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143396216": {"recommendationid": "143396216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198951093305", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1696307312}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, this music album also has a great game in it!", "timestamp_created": 1691164285, "timestamp_updated": 1691164285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475543469190597534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143350089": {"recommendationid": "143350089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086661782", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 692, "last_played": 1693328054}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc96", "timestamp_created": 1691097961, "timestamp_updated": 1691097961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475543469190597534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143299838": {"recommendationid": "143299838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025308498", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1697231389}, "language": "english", "review": "Poor game design decisions.

The game has one of the best EDM soundtracks you'll find and some very stylish battles done in full anime chique with some brutal combat animations.\n\nFights go down in roughly 3 different segments. Firstly you have some freedom to move around as the boss pursues you. Then there are the close up sections where you're forced into tight quarters with the boss. Then there are the bullet hell segments where the boss unleashes a lengthy volley of attacks at you which you need to learn to navigate using your gun and dashes to carve a path.\n\nEvery fight has it's own unique gimmicks and challenges - they become as much puzzles as fights in that sense. The difficulty is punishing though it is possible to recover some health through perfect performance. The fights are long and arduous requiring you to memorize different patterns and make use of very sharp reflexes, so it can get very challenging quickly.\n\nWhile I love watching the game be played it's stressful to experience first hand and by the time I got to the 4th boss some of the patterns can get real wild, requiring twitch reflexes and perfect inputs otherwise you get badly punished and have to restart long sections over again. Personally I wasn't into that sort of repetition and called it quits - considering how intense the game gets later on I'm not mad that I did.\n\nHigh points for sheer style and presentation, the gameplay is fun and intense but probably best suits a more resilient and persistent player, unfortunately that isn't me.", "timestamp_created": 1690301844, "timestamp_updated": 1690301844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142706819": {"recommendationid": "142706819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155854135", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1690031259}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard as hell but has naturally engaging progression and cool aesthetics.

Because I was so bored in the first two hours that I decided to refund the game on steam.\n\nThe game just plays like a really long quick time event. As other negative reviews have mentioned, fights are scripted. You're only allowed to damage the boss at certain times. Either the boss will just have an incredibly long invulnerability phase while you wait for them to get over their temper tantrum, or they'll just dash away immediately until it's the correct \"time\" in the script. \n\nThe game was hyped to me by a friend years ago. It's been on my wishlist since and I've been binging all those games in my backlog. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I've played many amazing games in the last month as part of this cleanup process, but Furi does not fit in that category.\n\nGameplay feels unrewarding and boring. It's a boss rush only kind of game, so there are no little minions on the path to each area. And the \"bosses\" are boring and unrewarding. Instead you have this terribly slow walking transition between each boss with boring commentary that doesn't add to the atmosphere at all. Finishing a fight is unrewarding because the only thing after is more boring transitions. \n\nAfter an hour and a half and 6 bosses (according to online lists this is half the game) I was having no fun and decided to refund the game. Every boss is more or less the same thing and you're just sitting there holding whatever button they're asking you to hold during that section.

Bosses are usually a mixture of bullet hell which demands precise dash-dodging and melee combat which demands well-timed parrying, with some bosses leaning heavily towards one aspect or the other.

The difficulty can be frustrating, but it also makes the the moment you defeat a boss all the more satisfying! Once you beat a boss in story mode, you can replay it anytime in practice mode under any unlocked difficulty.\n\nThe default difficulty mode is Furi (normal). Once you beat the story on Furi, you unlock Furier (hard) mode, which is supposedly the 'intended' difficulty of the game. There is also a Promenade (easy) mode where the boss fights are significantly easier and shorter (from what I've heard as I've never tried it), but that mode doesn't unlock anything and is intended solely as a way for players to experience the story without having to grind through difficult boss battles.\n\nAll I've done so far is beat the story once on Furi mode, which unlocked Furier mode as a result. I won't be attempting Furier anytime soon as I need a break because the game is pretty intense and I'm not really a hardcore gamer, but I gotta say beating it on Furi mode itself was a unique and worthwhile experience.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1687939618, "timestamp_updated": 1687939618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140790288": {"recommendationid": "140790288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086674940", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1019, "last_played": 1679572992}, "language": "english", "review": "Utter banger.", "timestamp_created": 1687872800, "timestamp_updated": 1687872800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140682351": {"recommendationid": "140682351", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026890847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 530, "last_played": 1653494332}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and challenging boss rush game", "timestamp_created": 1687709901, "timestamp_updated": 1687709901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140676820": {"recommendationid": "140676820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167351259", "num_games_owned": 1002, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1696179954}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1687703679, "timestamp_updated": 1687703679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140675825": {"recommendationid": "140675825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066457495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1688302828}, "language": "english", "review": "really fun and easy to get into the controls and every time you defeat a boss it feels so rewarding that you defeated another boss.

"language": "english", "review": "Furi is so close to being amazing, but it slips up on the most crucial step to making it there. (To note, I played this game on Furier mode my first time through, as I wanted both the developer's intended experience, and I love a good challenge.)\n\nFuri has some of the best, most engaging and challenging bosses I've seen in an action game. Each boss carries their own personal flavor and style, tackling different parts of the games mechanics and combining uses of them together in continuously interesting ways. Even in the fights themselves, there's constant variation going on, such as constantly changing and evolving attacks or unique arenas, while still keeping true to and expanding upon the bosses core theme and mechanical focus. I think it'll be a long time until I see an action game with bosses this good. That makes it all the more disappointing to say that this game is taken down by a health system that's far too forgiving. Leniency and making things easier not inherently bad, but the way they implement it is what does it in. \n\nThink about how Dark Souls handles health and healing. Every fight, you only have a very limited amount of health. The only way to gain it back is via health vials, which gives back a limited amount of healing and stops you dead in your tracks. This creates a risk reward system to using vials, while also adding an extra layer of strategy. When is it safe to use it? Should I wait to take a bit more damage so I get to use this vial to it's fullest potential? Should I heal now that a phase change is coming up I've never done? Etc. This is constantly going through your mind each step in battle in Dark Souls. The vials make a system that creates strategy, resource management, and forced mastery of every boss. You have to learn all the bosses by memory to get past them, which helps lift up its admittedly repetitive boss design.\n\nNow, compare to Furi. You start every fight with 3 lives. Every life lost fully heals both you and the boss, but the boss stays on the current phase they're on. Every phase beaten will replenish your health and give you an extra life back. Parrying also grants you some bonus health. See the issue? When the game gives you health (which you could theoretically heal infinite of) and lives, it creates gameplay that focuses not on mastering the bosses, but on getting to the final phase at the same state you were in at the beginning. You can die on each phase in this game but suffer zero actual punishment by the final phase. This sadly undermined most of the combat in the game for me, and turned bosses into just getting past the fluff to get to the real challenge. The fix is so easy too, it could literally be made in a patch.\n\nI can't hate Furi on the whole because, even despite the major flaw, pretty much everything else is perfect. I mentioned the boss design before, but the music, story, visuals, writing.. all of it is really fucking good. I could never not recommend the game because of just how good those aspects are. And at the end of the day, I still had fun. I just wish it could've made that final step.", "timestamp_created": 1686986827, "timestamp_updated": 1686986827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140196289": {"recommendationid": "140196289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081914397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1687889872}, "language": "english", "review": "good game.

It has some serious issues. The combat is fun, skilled based, and challenging and all but after the second boss it just felt like an unfun slog. Subjective I know but I doubt they could have made a more annoying boss than the third. Furthermore what completely killed my interest was the storytelling. They integrated story and gameplay the same way that a parasitic wasp integrates its brood into the writhing, terrified corpse of a caterpillar. It starts strong with a simple, kill your jailer and earn your freedom, but as soon as you finish him off you forced down these long sections of simply moving forward on this cripplingly slow pace with no run button or skip button to get the next boss. Again this could be subjective but what might build anticipation and excitement for some slowed the pace to that of a snail with fetal alcohol syndrome to me. The environments where you walk might be pretty but theres no exploration of it to engage with the scenery and as such it serves as little more than wallpaper engine with an exposition dump from a hee hee hoo hoo look at the goofy bunny man with slightly sinister sounding implications.

You get 3 lives, they get like five, if you die, you get all your health back and begin the phase from the very start. If you beat a phase though, you get all your health and a life back. (God forbid you loop a boss's last phase though ((see above)))\nThe story and dialogue was either written during a gas leak or poorly translated, but I'm inclined to believe the latter with all the awkward lines and first-take deliveries.\nOh and between every enemy is a year of walking while your definitely-not-insanity-personified gives you the most vague and awkward lore on your next opponent or history possible.

The game dares to blend two distinct play styles and, in doing so, manages to redefine both in an exciting, fresh manner.\n\nThe soundtrack is an absolute standout. In fact, to merely say I \"loved\" it would be an understatement. The music engulfs the player, creating an intense ambiance that harmoniously syncs with the fast-paced action unfolding on the screen. It amplifies every moment, transforming each encounter into a fever-dream of lights, colors, and beats. The score is nothing short of an audio masterpiece that resonates long after you've put down the controller.\n\n\"Furi\" is not a game that compromises on difficulty. It is genuinely challenging, even on the most basic level. The game continually pushes you, requiring a blend of strategy, fast reflexes, and perseverance. But rather than feeling unfair, the challenge is invigorating. It instills a deep sense of accomplishment with every victory, a testament to the well-designed gameplay mechanics.\n\nAll things considered, \"Furi\" is a marvel, seamlessly combining seemingly disparate game mechanics into a coherent, thrilling experience. Its top-notch soundtrack and demanding difficulty curve make it an unforgettable journey for those who dare to engage. Undoubtedly, \"Furi\" is a treat for both bullet-hell enthusiasts and melee-combat lovers alike, a testament to innovative game design and a benchmark for future titles in this genre.\n\nVive la France, merci \u00e0 toute l'\u00e9quipe, les programmeurs, les infographises, les musiciens !", "timestamp_created": 1685743474, "timestamp_updated": 1685743474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139398889": {"recommendationid": "139398889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273703540", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1686363142}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10 v good", "timestamp_created": 1685665933, "timestamp_updated": 1685665933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139379578": {"recommendationid": "139379578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388797272", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 895, "last_played": 1686432300}, "language": "english", "review": "why there's no tweak for ReticleMaxDistance in UI?\nwhere's modding support? \nwhat the fvck is Galak-Z mouse control type?\nI have so many questions....", "timestamp_created": 1685637783, "timestamp_updated": 1685637783, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139346188": {"recommendationid": "139346188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352869937", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1630358595}, "language": "english", "review": "The concept is great but I wish if it had balance balance and control", "timestamp_created": 1685578893, "timestamp_updated": 1685578893, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015263080596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139336915": {"recommendationid": "139336915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214224095", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1343, "last_played": 1687090683}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a challenging action game.

What it is, primarily, is a bullet hell game.\n\nEach stage of the game features a looooong stretch of expository dialogue, followed by a showdown with a boss character who has some new arrangement of flying projectiles to dodge.  Once you've learned the patterns to dodge each attack, plinking away with an [i]Ikaruga[/i]-esque handgun, you get a fleeting chance to close the distance and do a timed melee sequence that's not unlike a quicktime event to knock the boss' health bar down, before the boss resets its health bar and the pattern repeats, sometimes going faster or adding additional phases/mechanics.  It's a gameplay loop that demands patience and trial and error, working your way up through several mistimed prompts and bad dodges until you finally get the perfectly-timed combo that allows you to progress to the next stage.\n\nThis is fine, but it didn't really cater to the badass samurai feeling I wanted from the title; handling the Stranger really feels more like flying a spaceship through an asteroid field than it does like controlling a samurai duelist.\n\nConsider this review a thumbs-up if you're really into [i]Touhou[/i], [i]Jamestown,[/i] [i]Danmaku[/i], and the like, but learning patterns by rote to mimic the perfect timing of button inputs just wasn't quite what I wanted from a title selling this kind of fantasy.  From a technical and artistic perspective, everything is super cool, but it just wasn't the kind of game that I was told it would be like.  Bullet hell games aren't really my jam, and it doesn't have the endless replayability for me that it seems to have for other people.  Once I felt I'd 'solved' each boss battle, that was the end of my engagement with it.\n\nAt only a few hours long, it's also a pretty steep ask for $20, but maybe it'll vibe with you better than it did with me.", "timestamp_created": 1683068206, "timestamp_updated": 1683068206, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46749386191368103", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137609041": {"recommendationid": "137609041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287054404", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1695510409}, "language": "english", "review": "Best adrenaline rush a game ever gave me", "timestamp_created": 1682937571, "timestamp_updated": 1682937571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137595400": {"recommendationid": "137595400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145526120", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1682914172}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, very intense", "timestamp_created": 1682914188, "timestamp_updated": 1682914188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137560333": {"recommendationid": "137560333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220318387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1654096796}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing boss rush and the music slaps.", "timestamp_created": 1682870418, "timestamp_updated": 1682870418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137509318": {"recommendationid": "137509318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208206247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1683312988}, "language": "english", "review": "Contains ADVICE --------> USE A GAMEPAD", "timestamp_created": 1682801063, "timestamp_updated": 1682801063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137468271": {"recommendationid": "137468271", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983579723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 509, "last_played": 1682840126}, "language": "english", "review": "The whole game is great especially the music.

Entre combate y combate hablara un personaje contigo, no sabes quien es pero es ah\u00ed, aunque al cabo de un tiempo empiezas a percibir quien, o por lo menos me paso a mi.\n\nCombate\n\nHaber el combate a grosso modo, es usar una pistola y una katana como ver\u00e9is, cada enemigo tiene una barra de vida pero debajo de esa barra hay unos cuadritos, pues esos cuadritos, son las barras de vida de ese enemigo, al igual que las tuyas, solo que las tuyas siempre ser\u00e1n tres \u00bfentonces cual es el objetivo y la dificultad al mismo tiempo?\n\nCada vez que tu le quites una vida a cada enemigo, el combate se complica, porque cada vez acabas con una barra de su vida, tendr\u00e1 unas nueva mec\u00e1nica y tendr\u00e1s que descubrir como hacerle frente con lo que tienes a tu disposici\u00f3n, porque no hay ataques especiales, no hay perks con los que te puedas equipar, dir\u00eda que tus \u00fanicas habilidades, son el ensayo + fallo y error + el parry  !!o amado parry\u00a1\u00a1 te alabamos gloria al parry. \n\nPorque alabo al parry, porque cuando lo ejecutas adecuadamente te da fragmentos de vida, vamos que si o si tienes que hacerle frente al enemigo aunque hay otra forma de obtener algo de vida y es que depende del enemigo puede que te dispararen de tal manera que tu piensas que no juegas a Furi, si no al Space Invader de la Atari, porque disparan a veces orbes, que dependiendo de su forma, podr\u00e1s romper, bloquear o devolv\u00e9rselo al enemigo de turno, la cosa es que entre esos orbes est\u00e1n los verdes, esos, son lo que te dan vida. \n\nPor lo tanto te puedes alejar, para ver si dispara algo, porque claro, cada enemigo porta armas diferentes, desde una espada, una francotiradora y hasta uno que usa el agua para emborronar la pantalla y que no puedas observar bien que sucede. Algo que puede dificultar mas los combates es que cuando tu le quitas toda esa barra de vida que tu crees que ya todo a acabado y no queda otra debajo, y te queda una parte fundamental de los combates, los duelos, porque al tu quitarle toda esa primera capa de vida el enemigo se aturde, pero al atacarle entras en ese modo duelo sobre todo no en los primeros compases si no casi al final de estos y cuando ya ye acuerdas de la descendencia de los creadores de Furi, es cuando queda solo una barra y el enemigo se vuelve tan loco, pero tanto que no hay ataque que cubra la pantalla. \n\nDiversidades funcionales\n\nHaber no se como empezar este bloque, porque una de las cosas peores y mas obvias pero a la vez mejores que tiene fur\u00ed, son los pingasos que te vas a comer, si Youtube, desmonetizame, pero es que real que te vas a comer ostias gratis, encima es que hay dos logros que se basan en las veces que perder\u00e1s y tendr\u00e1s que volver a intentarlo, te hartaras y dir\u00e1s, \u00a1bueno, hasta ma\u00f1ana! cierro el mel\u00f3n de la rabia por hoy, lo s\u00e9, porque ma\u2019pasao.\n\nRespecto a las diversidades funcionales, por lo menos en mi caso, son los destellos, claro, cada vez que tu tengas que hacer un parry, veras un mini destello en los enemigos, no se si a bote pronto, que no veas bien puede que sea un poco dif\u00edcil de detectar, porque, pues porque cuando hagan una sucesi\u00f3n de ataques, tu como buena funcionaria de los Guitar Hero, te terminaras dando cuenta que en esa sucesi\u00f3n de ataques, siempre, pero casi siempre hay uno, que te rompe el ritmo, por lo tanto, comer\u00e1s pene, te gustara, no, pero es lo que hay si quieres un reto. Te recuerdo que tambi\u00e9n tienes otro reto mas grande que Furi y es tu vida, si te la estas pasando, intentalo con Furi.\n\nPero te tengo una buena y una mala noticia amige, el juego tiene un modo invencible, yo no lo use, yo fui a pelo, no cambie nada del mando ni mape\u00e9 los botones del mando tampoco, que te da ese modo, pues la capacidad de centrarte en la historia y una serie de comandos que te ayudan en los combates, tambi\u00e9n hay un modo practica, que te ayudan en los combates y un apartado de como se juega, no lo use, porque con el principio y las tres pinceladas del tutorial lo pille, pero cada enemigo es diferente eso si.\n\n\nM\u00fasica \n\nEn su momento la banda sonora de este juego fue muy alabada, porque esta compuesta por Danger, quien ya colaboro con ellos en Haven, banda sonora compuesta por el directamente y tambi\u00e9n esta  Lorn, entre otras personas de la escena indie del mundo de la m\u00fasica electr\u00f3nica, date una vueltita por su banda sonora, porque lo merece.\n\nConclusiones\n\nEl juego me ha durado unas 8 horas, es rejugable, eso nadie se lo quita porque tiene un modo de dificultad mas elevado, pero como en Grindr, next. El juego cuesta 20\u20ac y escuchame, que los vale, Fur\u00ed tiene dos DLC, llamados One More Fight y Onnamusha, el primero como bien dice, una pelea mas, y el otro, es otro personaje, que tiene diferentes variantes de combate, la verdad es que esto yo lo pille en oferta, est\u00e1n muy chachis, igual mas adelante me lo paso con esta otra personaje, ya os dire, que igual por la plataforma morada. Uff, que casi se me va la flapa, el juego esta en todas las plataformas.\n\nEspero que os guste mi contenido, os suscrib\u00e1is, lo compart\u00e1is con otras personas y nos vemos en el pr\u00f3ximo video maripino.", "timestamp_created": 1681335931, "timestamp_updated": 1681335931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136589940": {"recommendationid": "136589940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077096264", "num_games_owned": 1813, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1681326874}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.\nGetting to the last stage of a boss, dying and needing to restart is frustrating and the block and dash having a hold action means that they aren't 'on press' but rather 'on release' which can ruin you enough times to be irritating\nbut it's a good bullet hell/boss rush game with a good OST\nprob get on sale\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1681327064, "timestamp_updated": 1681521320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593470871448516846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136564949": {"recommendationid": "136564949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027148860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1681210174}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat the story in 3 hours, 100%'d the game in 10 hours, very smooth combat with very few times it felt like things were out of my control", "timestamp_created": 1681291100, "timestamp_updated": 1681291100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136550564": {"recommendationid": "136550564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302886317", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1973, "last_played": 1675966400}, "language": "english", "review": "Has some of the finest synth music available.\n\nYou can beat it in a few hours, but the music keeps me coming back for more.", "timestamp_created": 1681258932, "timestamp_updated": 1681258932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564340054988861084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136541468": {"recommendationid": "136541468", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241273848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 4618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4595, "last_played": 1695047745}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]a boss rush game done right[/h1]\n\nso basically this is how each fight works : the boss will go through several phases and within each phase there are two sections of battle, one that utilizes the entire arena dodging bullets or whatever they throw at you and another that is a close melee section, you have three lives and if you die you have to start that phase from the beginning and if you lose all three of your lives you'll have to do the battle all over again from the start, and also you get a life back for every stage you beat, sounds simple, right? well the general idea is simple, but the battles are FREAKING HARD AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.\n\nyou can attack with your sword and your gun which both can be charged up for higher damage and for defense you can dodge or parry, but let me tell something, just learn parrying bro, you'll get the hang of it after like 5 minutes, trust me there will be bosses that you can only parry their attacks, you can't run away all the time (also you regain a little bit of hp after a successful parry). the parry mechanic is where this game truly shines, there is just something so satisfying about parrying in this game, if you time the parry closer to when you would get hit it initiates a cutscene which not only looks and feels cool to pull off but it gives extra damage to the boss, each boss is a huge challenge that feels amazing when you overcome it and none of the bosses are similar to each other, you'll have to master all of your abilities in order to defeat the bosses and finish the game, some bosses are purely melee focused while some other ones literally fly off to freaking nowhere and you must shoot them.\n\nwhen you finish the game once it unlocks the furier mode and unlike most other hard modes in games, all the bosses now have completely different and much harder attack patterns than before. you're gonna have to relearn how to take each down in new ways, also they have a speedrun mode which is a blessing (seriously though, why can't all games have a dedicated speedrun mode?! ) \n\nother than the gameplay there are a tons of more great things about this game, like the aesthetic and graphics, the cutscenes you get after defeating each boss, even better the soundtrack, OMFG I LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK, it's definitely one of the best OSTs in the video game industry, also it has a japanese VA which is amazing, they hired better voice actors than most of the AAA companies do, and about the story, while it might look simple at first, trust me, there is a lore and meaning behind it ...\n\ncouldn't ask for a better game, thank you Game Bakers for this amazing masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1681243635, "timestamp_updated": 1683472748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664420485496520996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136532705": {"recommendationid": "136532705", "author": {"steamid": "76561199442478951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1681750094}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Acci\u00f3n fren\u00e9tica pero inteligente, cambiando mucho el estilo de combate de un jefe al otro.

Pasa por los mundos c\u00e1rceles y mata al carcelero cueste lo que cueste. \u00bfLibertad o redenci\u00f3n?. Dentro rese\u00f1a!\n\nOtro m\u00e1s pasado en Steamdeck y es que nos encontramos ante un juego con mec\u00e1nicas soulslike y una vista cenital. Somos alguien que quiere escapar de su c\u00e1rcel y para ello deber\u00e1 matar a todos los carceleros hasta conseguir la \"libertad\".\n\nEl protagonista, que no habla, porta una especie de katana espada y una pistola. El moveset, aunque corto, es directo y suficiente, con un dash (que se puede mantener pulsado para alcanzar distancia), un parry para bloquear destellos blancos, con el joystick dispararemos o dejaremos cargado el arma y poco m\u00e1s. En esencia es un boss rush donde cada boss tiene unas mec\u00e1nicas diferentes en mundos diferentes. Cuando pasamos entre boss y boss ser\u00e1 un sendero para andar donde una especie de conejo loco (a lo Alice) nos contar\u00e1 m\u00e1s sobre nosotros y sobre el mundo de los carceleros. Y ah\u00ed se basa en toda la historia. Voces en ingl\u00e9s o japon\u00e9s y texto en castellano. La historia, aunque justa, es suficiente para querer saber m\u00e1s de este mundo. Pero donde reside la gracia es en el gameplay y la dificultad.\n\nAntes de entrar al tema, tenemos 3 dificultades, paseo (a la que tuve que cambiar a mitad del juego) donde los bosses tienen menos vida y te quitan menos, normal y dif\u00edcil que se desbloquea al pasar. Adem\u00e1s tenemos ranking mundial imagino de tiempo a modo de \"online\". Tambi\u00e9n contamos con un modo invencible para aquellos que solo quieran saber de la historia. Es decir, de alguna manera es adaptado a cualquier p\u00fablico. El normal me pareci\u00f3 muy dif\u00edcil al cuarto boss (habr\u00e1 como 9-10) y a\u00fan en paseo, alguno me cost\u00f3. Si te gustan los soulslike y los juegos dif\u00edciles entonces prueba en normal o siguiente, si lo tienes y quieres saber la historia, pues prueba en paseo y si no el modo invencible. Cada pieza de m\u00fasica cambia seg\u00fan el boss.\n\nY ahora vamos a las mec\u00e1nicas. Tu tienes un n\u00famero de barras de vida. Y el boss igual (va aumentando seg\u00fan avanzas). Y consiste en llegar a 0 cada barrita antes de que la tuya lo haga. Si uno de los dos llega a 0, el otro tendr\u00e1 toda su barra llena y el que haya perdido tendr\u00e1 un slot menos de vida. Y para ello tendremos que adaptarnos (no al escenario, pues son \"arenas\" circulares al uso) si no a las mec\u00e1nicas. Todos tienen varias fases as\u00ed como los famosos bosses de fromsoftware, atacar a distancia, bloquear parrys seguidos o esquivar.\n\nSi bien todo es en vista cenital, y esto no me gusta en exceso, se hace muy entretenido y un reto a batir. Cuando le quitas una vida, tendr\u00e1s que quitarle la misma vida pero en un modo \"tercera persona\", c\u00e1mara al hombro, golpear, esquivar y atacar. Cuando bloqueas o en otras situaciones encontramos \"finishes\" o alg\u00fan QTE como mover r\u00e1pido los joysticks para librarnos de un ataque. Al pasear entre boss y boss no podremos interactuar con nada.\n\nEn cuanto a rejugabilidad, bueno puedes mejorar tu puntuaci\u00f3n, probar una dificultad extra, alg\u00fan personaje de pago con otro moveset y poco m\u00e1s. Si te gustan los retos, un boss rush siempre entra bien. Tiene un modo pr\u00e1ctica tambi\u00e9n. En definitiva, encontramos un batiburrillo de cosas que si bien no se hace pesado, no destaca en nada. A veces parece un street fighter, otras una fase de Nier Automata, en otras una novela visual con fondo y en otras un juego hack and slash o de acci\u00f3n. \n\nMe gustar\u00eda otro juego del mismo mundo, explicando m\u00e1s del lore, que sea m\u00e1s largo (este puede durar 3-5 horas dependiendo de la dificultad la primera run), con un gameplay m\u00e1s definido y no tan generalizado, con un mundo abierto y con los mismos gr\u00e1ficos que si bien a d\u00eda de hoy van justos, es colorido, as\u00ed como vi\u00f1etas, d\u00e1ndole un toque personal y atractivo. Lo he jugado en 1080 60fps en steam deck y no ha habido ning\u00fan problema.\n\nY hasta aqu\u00ed, probad Furi tanto si os gustan los retos como si busc\u00e1is una historia dist\u00f3pica y rara, o simplemente algo r\u00e1pido para echar partidas cortas, porque FURI no os decepcionar\u00e1. Encima debe estar barato de narices.

Getting 100 hits in a row isn't hard; but it takes forever. If you miss at 60 and have to restart, the next try is substantially less fun as you work back up to 60 again. Furi feels just like that. It tries to convince you its [i]'hardcore difficult'[/i], when in reality it's '[i]challenging-ish'[/i] and needlessly time consuming.\n\nEven though I cleared most bosses in fewer than 5 attempts, Furi felt like a janky, monotonous time-sink that relied too heavily on artificial difficulty to drive the experience.  \n\nI understand I'm in the minority, but I recommend skipping this title. If you are looking for examples of polished boss rush/bullet hell games that pull off what Furi couldn't, I'd recommend looking to Enter the Gungeon or Eldest Souls first.\n\n----------- [b]More Details / Full Review [/b] -----------\n\nAfter playing Furi, I reflected on all the positive reviews that influenced my decision to try the game. Many of these reviews touted Furi as one of their best/favorite games of[i] all time[/i]. Personally, I don't get it. I'm not trying to [i]trash[/i] the game. It's just that the game I read about, and the game I experienced seem [i]wildly[/i] [i]different[/i].\n\n[b]----- Qualms with Difficulty -----[/b]\n\nI have qualms with the difficulty, but [i]not[/i] because the game is 'too hard'. I love bullet hells & boss rushes, and completed Furi with very little trouble. It wasn't 'easy', but seeing credits roll didn't instill a feeling of accomplishment, either. Furi attempts to cater to two disparate player groups at the same time: those seeking a punishing, intense, skill-based crusade, and more casual players looking for a tough but [i]forgiving[/i] one. It feels like the game was afraid of isolating either player group, and so it didn't commit to one or the other. The whole experience felt so shallow as a result. Allow me to explain...\n\nEven on the hardest difficulty, you'll recoup health + lives after finishing boss phases. Successful parries heal you, and health drops are everywhere. You can't die unless you fail the same boss phase twice in a row. I don't know why they wouldn't save [i]some[/i] of this for easy mode instead. I get the feeling that these health systems were retrofitted to accommodate how 'artificially difficult' the game is. The game is only 'frustrating' due to lame systems that increase the time it takes to move through phases of a fight.\n\n[b]----- It just takes too long -----[/b]\n\nBosses have between 4 to 6 'phases' which are comprised of 2 health-bars each. A full combo will deliver at most 20% of a single health bar. Scripted animations for executions and parries take 3 to 4 seconds, and you aren't rewarded with extra damage for the effort. There are even more animations between each boss phase. Fights are scripted in such a way that if you swing at the boss before you are 'supposed to', they get magic invulnerability frames or the ability to teleport away instantly. Taking risks or trying to be creative in combat wont pay off, because it's a matter of 'go here, wait, and attack when you're allowed to attack'. Certain bosses will run off mid fight, forcing you to wait up to 10 seconds for them to return. New combat phases don't introduce anything new or exciting, which left me wondering what the point was in having 6 phases (12 health bars), if not only to extend the length of the fight.\n\nAll this to say that fights are so much longer than they need to be. Reaching your previous point of failure is tedious and punishing, but only because it takes so much time. This game loop doesn't test your skill. It somewhat tests your memory, but mostly tests your patience.\n\n[b]----- Lack of Variety -----[/b]\n\nI was let down with how 'samey' every boss felt to one another. In a game with 10+ bosses, I'd have hoped to get something different out of each boss... But outside of the environment and bullet hell sequences, the fights all boiled down to the same pattern / formula. As mentioned earlier, each of a boss's phases aren't different enough from one another to make new phases feel fresh and interesting. Again, it felt like they were too afraid of making meaningful changes that would subvert expectations of players who memorized attack patterns of the current phase. I wish they went full-send, and instead made each phase truly special and unique.\n\n[b]----- Story -----[/b]\n\nI wasn't interested in the story at all, but the game forced it on me via painful walking intermissions that I could not skip. I got so used to putting 'auto-walk' on, that my character went AFK at a certain point in the story, triggered a secret ending, and I had to start the whole thing over. This was a huge turn-off, and I almost put the game down right then and there.[list][/list][list][/list]After sleeping that frustration off, I decided to finish the game I paid for so I could progress in the story. There's not much for me to say on this front. The writers needed a reason for a guy to be fighting a ton of bosses, so they worked backwards from that and it serves its purpose well enough. The voice acting and script were well done, but the pacing, timing of character dialogue felt off to me. The story is just not why you'd play this game.\n\n[b]----- Conclusion -----[/b]\n\nI felt pretty blindsided and uncalibrated by all of the positive press that didn't match my experience. I understand I'm in the minority of reviewers and if your experience was better than mine, I think that's fantastic!

The music has the same 3 second loop over and over and the gameplay well... \n \nThe gameplay is occasionally fun. The melee attacks feel a little choppy at times but you can force yourself to be fast and have more fun. The only issue is the enemies will just auto parry or block your attacks with no indicator saying that they can or can't take damage. One boss in particular has a counter animation where if you win the QTE it does literally nothing. Basically removing an entire mechanic from the game because it does nothing but waste time.\n\nThe gun is one of the most boring things I had to interact with and the first playthrough boiled down to hold right stick in the general direction of the enemy and avoid slow moving projectiles.\n\nIf you want good melee combat with cool fluid movement play Metal Gear Rising or if you like challenging games play Sekiro.

faltering interest towards them in recent years due to a personal effort to put distance in my life from stress factors, I still find myself bouncing back to some of the ones I've seen as integral to my completion rate as an achievement hunter. I've never played a game that I didn't feel I'd at one point or another complete.. but Furi? I'd almost given up hope. \n\nI started my first run half a decade ago, to this date. I gave it a few odd attempts \"The Line / The Scale, The Burst / The Edge and The Star each posed a challenge, and each caused me to put the game down for long periods of time.\" There'd always been some itch to come back to this game, I couldn't tell what it was, but no other game plagued my thoughts for not finishing it like this game did. It's not as if I had anything to prove in beating it, none of my friends have even played Furi. So there was no accolades or bragging rights in beating this game, let alone completing it to 100%.\n\nBut on my fourth attempt, something clicked. I didn't notice it initially, but I was entering the next chapter of my life as I had picked up the game. I'd gotten better at not giving into the rage that hard games used to fill me with, and I had new-found purpose in my life where I previously had nothing to strive for. This game served as my internal hurdle to bridging that gap in growth. If I could beat the game I considered to be one of the hardest I've played to date, then I could set out and achieve greater things in my life. I refused to take failure as my ultimatum. \n\nComing back into it and shaking off the dust, I had to boot up a new run before I could even attempt to conquer The Star. Challenges that were massive hurdles in my previous runs showed their ugly faces once again. Yet it wasn't like the previous attempts. It was a slog-fest like the others, but I persevered this time, came back into my first save, and beat The Star. By a stroke of luck, I'd gone for my speed-run attempt next and didn't expect to get very far. However, holding those fights fresh in my mind, and the residual droplets of knowledge I'd gained over the years from Furi, I managed to smash both out in the same run. Suddenly it felt like I had a fighting chance to actually beat this game.\n\nOne of the greatest personal challenges I had aside from the general difficulty, was walking between each fight, and the dialogue that existed as nothing more than ways to get under your skin. But when I was doing my practice run for Furier, my relationship to these two events changed. The walking served as a way to detox from the stress of the last fight, as well as a means to come up with strategies towards the next fight. I began to harness not only that, but my new-found appreciation towards the dialogue for giving me clarity that I was the ultimate preventive factor to my success. (Quotes Below.)\n\nWith everything else under my belt, and the practice attempt now done, it was time to use the cultivation of everything I'd learned. It was tough, it was unfair, I was internally screaming and thought I'd have to attempt it a third time, but I did it. I got the S rank.\n\nI've never felt a stronger catharsis and greater sense of self than I did getting to where I am now. Aside from my personal gripes in the two aforementioned factors, Furi delivers on every other element you'd want out of it. I still listen to the soundtrack despite no longer playing the game. I can only hope I'll have another experience like it in the form of a sequel, but in the event it never happens, I'll cherish the fact that it's had a strong role in shaping me to be the person I am now.\n\n(You're fighting yourself, can't you see that? - The Line.\nMad little soldier. So much power. But so much pain. - The Scale.\nYou can fail, that's okay. It's the best you can do under the circumstances. - The Burst.\nExcellence is not an art, it's pure habit. We are what we repeatedly do. - The Edge.)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1678036336, "timestamp_updated": 1678036336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52370452880859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134093499": {"recommendationid": "134093499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295829393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1696678698}, "language": "english", "review": "sick as hell", "timestamp_created": 1677988925, "timestamp_updated": 1677988925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134089469": {"recommendationid": "134089469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063712159", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1671324365}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, but very hard.

Maybe go the \"codex\" route and add lore pieces collected by playing the game because currently it feels too forced and doesn't add enough value to the overall quality/enjoyment of the game.\n\n- Between levels you are forced to slowly meander through linear paths with some exposition along the way. These portions very well could've and should've been cutscenes, especially since you can auto-walk through them anyways. There's very little reason to explore during these transition periods.\n\n- The transitions are too long; it feels like the developer is begging you to look at the scenery, which is nice, don't get me wrong, but it definitely overstays its welcome at times. How many times do I need to watch the same floaty bridge be assembled as my character trots along? This is even more evident during long pauses between dialogue. If the dev wanted the player to be able to appreciate the environment at their own pace, make a separate exploration mode that consists of just the transitions or a video library that loops the transitions accessed after beating a section. If the dialogue was said at a normal cadence without long pauses, and the scenes were shorter to compensate, this would be a non-issue.\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nBase game completed:  YES\nDLC completed:  NO\nRating:  6 / 10 - Above Average", "timestamp_created": 1675968914, "timestamp_updated": 1675970696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132452375": {"recommendationid": "132452375", "author": {"steamid": "76561199249577932", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1696339017}, "language": "english", "review": "great visuals and music. difficulty is somewhat higher than what i'm used to but i eventually beat bosses. i would recommend this game for anyone who likes fast-paced battles.", "timestamp_created": 1675912592, "timestamp_updated": 1675912592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132447252": {"recommendationid": "132447252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124269900", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1091, "last_played": 1675902052}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a marvel in game design.

It's fast paced and combat includes melee, bullet hell and shooter aspects. I will get it out of the way and say, this aspect of the game is handled well. It flows, bosses have patterns of behaviour you can learn and ultimately master to progress onward. Each boss feels unique from each other and forces you to reconsider your approach to the fight, and the driving, electric beat of the music makes every action, every swing of your sword and dodge feel impressive. i can't really fault it too much.\n\nBut it's a game that feels as though it relies on combat to the detriment of the rest of the game. In between fights you let the game walk itself, intermittent dialogue being read out to you that tries to create this air of mystery as to who you are, yet for me never really managed to engage me due to its detached style of storytelling. This builds throughout to a conclusion which is the only non combat element of the game that I enjoyed, or rather thought was well done, where you walk the earth you have been trying to reach only to find that your very touch kills the plants beneath you.\n\nThe game itself is short and other than a brief trial with speedrunning certain bosses I didn't find much enjoyment in the idea of replaying the game so ultimately it was a rather brief experience.\n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that if you are someone looking for a fast paced gameplay focused game, go for it, it certainly has that, short though it is, but other than that, I think it's fair to give this game a miss.", "timestamp_created": 1675714483, "timestamp_updated": 1675714483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132298988": {"recommendationid": "132298988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801111280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1675735069}, "language": "english", "review": "great\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675651944, "timestamp_updated": 1675651944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132291989": {"recommendationid": "132291989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355430154", "num_games_owned": 1259, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1668221656}, "language": "english", "review": "really makes you feel like spider man", "timestamp_created": 1675640394, "timestamp_updated": 1675640394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132268782": {"recommendationid": "132268782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440680168", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1700507091}, "language": "english", "review": "wow", "timestamp_created": 1675613938, "timestamp_updated": 1675613938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132263885": {"recommendationid": "132263885", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046593624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1270, "last_played": 1654345588}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Levanta prisionero, el carcelero est\u00e1 esperando para atraparte de nuevo.

Core Gameplay\nthe gameplay consists of two cores.\nthe first one being the hack and slash elements which are\nnormal attack, charged attack evading etc.\nfor evading you can dodge or parry but the game wants you to parry and rewards you when you do it by healing you, and if you parry in the last second you enter a \"perfect parry\" which deals damage to the enemy that are equal to a 4 hit combo!\nalso you can parry almost every thing in the game and even reflect the bullets like a badass.\nthe other one are the bullet hell elements which are:\npistol shots and charged shots\ncharged shots can knock the enemies down from a very far distance which makes them quite useful sometimes so make sure to use them\nB.Bosses\nThe game consists entirely of boss fights.\nWhich leads the player to expect each one of them to be unique which the the game does to a certain degree\nfirst I'd like to talk about the bosses in general\nevery boss has more than two phases and each phase has two segments , I like to name them 360 segment and one-on-one segment.\nthe former being the segment where you can move freely and put as much space as you want between you and the boss the latter being the segment where there is a highlighted area which you can not leave\nevery boss uses in different way.\nNow lets return to our main topic, remember when I said: \"Which leads the player to expect each one of them to be unique which the the game does to a certain degree\" the reason I said 'which the the game does to a certain degree'\nis that in the last 3 bosses you feel that the games has no more ideas because the bosses mostly consists of the same attacks and moves which isn't too bad but of course is a problem.\nother than that the first 6-7 bosses are very fun and test the player's skills.\n2-Story\nYeaaah.... The story only makes the game longer and more boring so if you want something with a good story definitely don't buy and play this game, if you want an excellent story with an interesting set of characters I recommend playing Xenoblade 3!!!\n3- Music\nThe game music type is one that I don't usually prefer a lot but it has some decent tracks.\n4-art style/graphics/Animation\nI absolutely loved the art style, it was cartoonish and very unique also there was a successful attempt to display the prison's several environments and atmosphere , the animation was good too\n8/10\n(subjective rating, based on enjoyment)", "timestamp_created": 1675596821, "timestamp_updated": 1675596821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132203612": {"recommendationid": "132203612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393594394", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1675008974}, "language": "english", "review": "Furi is action-packed with challenging combat.

"language": "spanish", "review": "Intro \nBueno realmente Furi no es un juego que me pase por primera vez ahora al momento de escribir esta rese\u00f1a sino que es un juego que ya me pase en Origin Access por el lejano 2016 sin embargo aquella vez lo hice con amigos y nos \u00edbamos turnando algunos jefes por lo que quise darle otra vuelta ahora haciendolo completamente por mi mismo.\nGameplay\nDise\u00f1o de niveles: El dise\u00f1o de niveles de Furi es muy interesante ya que se plantea desde un punto d\u00f3nde el jefe tiene la ventaja m\u00e1s no es imposible de vencerlo, varias de las arenas se limitan a \u00e1reas circulares vac\u00edas en la que es un enfrentamiento sin obst\u00e1culos de por medio sin embargo cuando es requerido los desarrolladores se pusieron ingeniosos con las arenas de combate.\n\nCombate: El combate de Furi es EXCELENTE, el personaje responde de manera r\u00e1pida y precisa, cuando mueres no es que el juego haya fallado en hacer tal o cual es enteramente tu culpa, no fuiste suficientemente r\u00e1pido o no usaste los medios que el juego te da de manera eficiente.\n\nAmbientacion\n\nLa banda sonora: La banda sonora no es una memorable m\u00e1s cumple con creces su prop\u00f3sito, la m\u00fasica de los jefes transmiten parte de su personalidad, no tiene nada que destacar pero hace un buen trabajo.\n\nEl apartado art\u00edstico: El apartado art\u00edstico de Furi si que me deja un poco frio, si bien sus graficos como tal no son (ni fueron) la gran cosa tampoco es que se haga demasiado con la direcci\u00f3n art\u00edstica como para compensarlo, considero que es suficiente pero se podr\u00eda haber hecho mas.\n\nLos di\u00e1logos: Los di\u00e1logos que tenemos en su mayor\u00eda son del \u201chombre conejo\u201d que nos ayuda a escapar desvelando y anticipando un poco la historia de lo que ira adelante y sobre todo nos da contexto de quienes somos o a quien nos vamos a enfrentar.\n\nLa historia: La historia es algo simple nada que no podamos dilucidar desde la primera hora de juego sin embargo entiendo que no se podr\u00eda haber contado algo mas complejo es un boss rush de corta duraci\u00f3n.\n\nLos jefes: Obviamente los protagonistas de este juego, Furi es un boss rush, los jefes son lo mas importante, desafiantes y con una curva mas que aceptable (hasta el 8 boss que pega un salto de dificultad bestial) todos tienen su arena que transmite parte de lo que son si bien en todos los juegos los jefes suelen tener la \u201cventaja local\u201d ya que luchamos contra ellos en sus territorios Furi lleva esto al gameplay (salvo excepciones como la de la francotiradora que aun me cuestiono porque hay muros que le hacen counter abiertamente como si quisiera perder) las arenas normalmente favorecen a los jefes pero como dije anteriormente aun permitiendo que se les pueda vencer (claro, duh).\n\nComentarios extras: Una pega personal que tuve con Furi es que no me gusta el rol del protagonista mudo que contempla y ni si quiera es capaz de cruzar una palabra con los jefes, siendo un boss rush y por su historia considero que se desaprovecharon muchos di\u00e1logos que podr\u00edan haber nutrido a la situaci\u00f3n aunque considerando lo que es el protagonista al final entiendo que quieren reflejar que su personalidad es asi por lo que es, aunque considerando el final verdadero esta teor\u00eda se cae un poco a pedazos.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n: Furi es un juego que aun a dia de hoy puede darte unas 5-6 horas de diversi\u00f3n o aun mas si decides rejugarlo, es un juego muy solido que se controla exquisitamente y obliga al jugador a mejorar en si mismo y NO a mejorar el personaje.\n", "timestamp_created": 1673729444, "timestamp_updated": 1673729444,

That's what got me into Crystal Castles, CRIM3S, \u2020 C\u039bIN \u2020, and other similar artist. Not to forget, I've also was bewitched by the works of Revolver Studio and loved the Hotline Miami series, so naturally I also adore Carpenter Brunt, M.O.O.N, and similar music artist. You could not and should not mention talk about talk about the game's without talking about the OST. FURI's OST, especially \"My Only Chance\" by Toxic Avenger is possibly my favorite video game OST. If the music recommendation and the emotions it comes with doesn't sell you my reasoning why I recommend this game, well I'll tell you where I stood at when I finally decided to blow the dust off this and give it a try. I like hard combat video games. I've played the hell out of the Dark Souls Trilogy and had around 400 hours in Elden Ring. /V/tards now this feeling, \"having all this games but growing increasingly bored with gaming itself\". This game hands down rekindled that flame in me. With only 10 Hours into this, I can see myself chasing the  achievements and combat mastery of such a indie title that gets my blood pumping again. On a personal level, I don't like playing the race game, but the Story Creator and Lead Artist, Takashi Okazaki, is into black culture as much as black men are into Dragon Ball Z. Attempting not to prattle on about representation, The Stranger quickly grew to become one of my favorite video game protagonist, not just through his bad ass actions, relentless attitude in a harsh environment, and riveting mystery that surrounded him; The Stranger enchanted me as a protagonist, and he gets extra points because he did this without playing the race game. Anyways, I loved, and continue to love FURI, and highly recommend taking up the challenge to escape the Jailers.

No hits on the boss during their attacks, only parry. You dodged the boss charged attack and want to hit them? Too damn bad. Range shot a bit to chip away at their health? Sorry this is the dodge part and the boss is shielded. I really wanted to enjoy this game because it looked great and had a pretty great soundtrack to go with the battle. But I cannot deal with something that refuses to let you play how you want. You either have to do it their way or you lose. \n\nAlso your character has 3 lives. When you lose all of your health you hit the A button and you lose a life but you regenerate your heath so you can keep playing. But the boss also regenerates their health fully. These are bosses with 3, 4, or 5 different forms you have to beat, so if you're thinking hey it's ok that I died at this tough boss I'll use one of my lives and keep at it because I've taken a bunch of his health already, well you're in for a bad surprise.\n\nThe dodge option is delayed slightly but it is enough to cost you some cheap hits. The parry section will not let you doge and attack. You can only parry in that section, if you try to dodge and get behind the boss and get a couple of hits it, they will just disappear and reappear behind you and start their move set again.\n\nOverall the game could be fun but it is just to frustratingly annoying by locking you into certain play styles and not letting you experiment and find your own way to win.\n\nVERY PAINT BY NUMBERS", "timestamp_created": 1672841876, "timestamp_updated": 1672841876, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462868750095367432", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130095844": {"recommendationid": "130095844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267709237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1672860502}, "language": "english", "review": "\"You will enjoy the adrenaline of combat\" is what the game states when you start a new game, and it makes good on it.", "timestamp_created": 1672825679, "timestamp_updated": 1672825679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130088772": {"recommendationid": "130088772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279354955", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1672815331}, "language": "english", "review": "The music slaps but thats about the only fun I had.

To be honest, half the reason I even started this game was because of the absolutely amazing synthwave soundtrack, which I had been listening to on night drives long before even buying this game.\n\nThe game initially made a good, but not great impression on me. I love the aesthetics of the world the devs have created --- again, the music makes a huge difference here --, but I didn't really care for the somewhat aimless and angsty dialogue of both the narrator and of some of the bosses. Not that it really matters all that much: the walky bits and the exposition seem designed first and foremost to give you a breather in between the incredibly intense (and quite difficult) boss battles. And in that sense, they get the job done. \n\nTo be honest, the reason this game initially put me off a bit was due to the timing of the blocks and parries. It's a classic case of simply needing to practice more, I will admit, but something about the way the timing for the blocking works in this game never really clicked with me, even by the end. I feel like I'm missing something with it. There is a visual and audio cue that says there is a blockable attack incoming, but you need to press the button a half-measure after that cue, [i]I think.[/i] But I somehow felt like this timing shifted from boss to boss, even though that's probably not really true, and I was just panicking pressing the button. I never really got the hang of it, and this led to some frustration with a number of bosses. \n\n[spoiler]Funnily enough, the one boss that is just literally a parry boss, the samurai dude near the end, was the one where the timing did somehow make perfect sense to me, and I beat him with ease on the first try. Some of the bosses before that, who had final phases that required a series of blocks lest the player be reset to the beginning and lose 10 minutes of progress, gave me a lot of trouble with the parrying though. There were a number of bosses I would have beaten the first time, if not for the required blocking chain at the very end of their encounters. Ah well.[/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, regardless of this small gripe, I did really like this game. In the latter half, I think I even started to genuinely love the combat. The mechanics in this game feel tuned perfectly nearly 100% of the time, and so the game is fair in its toughness. I had never played a bullet hell game before, and in games like Dark Souls I tend to stick to rolling through everything, though I did beat Sekir\u00f4 and felt I was pretty good at the blocking in that game. But in any case, Furi for me represented a pretty unknown type of gameplay experience, and the tightness of the controls combined with the visceral action and the absolutely amaze-balls soundtrack made me fly through the last 3 or so hours. In the beginning, I got tired of the game after one or two bosses, but by the time I had taken down the fourth one I was in my groove, and couldn't really put it down. I literally physically pumped my fist after beating some of the more intense battles as well.\n\nCome for the soundtrack, stay for the heart-pumping action. I bought this game on sale, but if you like challenging but fair games, like so many of us do in the Dark Souls era of games, you can't go wrong with it for the full price either. It'll give you anywhere between 3 and 7-to-8-ish hours of satisfying punishment. (And potentially a lot more still if you get into the speed-running or the extra challenge content, I suppose.)

It's told in a solid way and kept me engaged all throughout with many well done twists and turns.\n\nVisually, its no showstopper, but for a small team, its really good. The environments are really gorgeous and the games art-style is really cool.\n\nTo talk on sound design, the music in this game is pretty phenomenal. It fits the sci-fi space aesthetic really well and almost every single track slaps.\n\nGameplay wise, its a bullethell game with some twists thrown in. The game primarily takes place in two different styles, overhead combat with you dealing ranged damage whilst dodging waves of projectiles. When your enemies have been weakened, the game will enter into a close camera mode and will shift its focus to a more close quartered, melee oriented fighting style. Here, the game focuses a lot more on parrying and reading enemy movement. The two styles work well enough and combined with the music, makes for some high adrenaline and fun gameplay.\n\nAs for the difficulty, its far from one of the most difficult games I've played. For your average player, I would say it sits somewhere in the middle. Generally, its not controller breaking difficult, but if you lose focus and let your guard down, this game can whoop your ass. If I had one critique for the difficulty, its that the curve it presents is all over the goddamn place. Rather than the game starting easy and getting harder as it goes, instead Furi just kinda does whatever the hell it wants. Some fights are hard, where's others are total push-overs. The final two boss fights in the main campaign I found to be both extremely easy, although for the late one, that might've been done on purpose. But then there's a secret boss which is fought only via an alternate ending, and this boss in particular completely dumps on every other boss in the game and is extremely difficult. Part of this is why I personally opted out of doing the alternate ending.\n\nI beat the game in about 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it quite short. In that playtime I found the game engaging, but its challenge was inconsistent and I didn't find myself struggling that much. The alternate boss however, is a massive spike in difficulty and I wouldn't say the game prepares you for it at all as nothing in the base game comes even close to it. Oh yeah, and if you do plan on playing this game, I would highly recommend taking the games advice and playing on a controller. All in all the pc controls aren't awful, but after beating the entire game with them, I can say they aren't as intuitive as they should be.\n\nEDIT: To add an additional point, I did decide to make an additional attempt at beating the alternate boss and I've decided, yeah, it isn't worth it. To put it in perspective, I've spent probably close to an hour and a half so far attempting to beat it, not far off what it took me to beat the entire game and I still haven't gotten anywhere near defeating it. Ordinarily I'd just chock it up to me being too impatient to beat them, but in all honesty, its kinda just a bullshit fight. Its incredibly long and you're given barely any additional health at all throughout, basically meaning if you wanna beat them, you gotta do each sequence almost dead perfect, which really isn't fun or satisfying. I don't consider it a fun or productive use of my time spending hours upon hours on a single boss fight tbh, so yeah I'm not gonna bother doing it.\n\nAll in all, this is a unique and highly engaging game. If you are to play it, I'd probably recommend it on a sale, seeing as you can beat it very quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1671697658, "timestamp_updated": 1671792005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128943631": {"recommendationid": "128943631", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997025876", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1671590449}, "language": "english", "review": "I just don't think a three-hour game is worth 20 bucks, especially with a weak final boss and slow pacing between fights.

Some extra things like challenge fights, more difficult mode, practice mode and speedrun mode provide more entertaining for certain players. Besides the challenge fights (or extra fights w/e) there's not much to do. The base story itself is challenging enough and if you (SPOILERS) choose the \"good\" ending, the last boss will be tuff as hell even with the \"Furi\" difficulty. This is purely from a players point of view. There's a lot of other things to enjoy f. ex. the soundtrack (which I highly recommend to check out) and art style.\n\nTL;DR\nSo basically there's quite a lot of game to some1 who wants challenging fights and learn the mechanics of the game but besides that there's not much so keep that in mind.", "timestamp_created": 1670647152, "timestamp_updated": 1670647152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128254329": {"recommendationid": "128254329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160118054", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1670628065}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es feo, le faltan la mitad de los efectos de sonido y se controla como el ogt", "timestamp_created": 1670628100, "timestamp_updated": 1670628100, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128249687": {"recommendationid": "128249687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419565318", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1644914655}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1670622114, "timestamp_updated": 1670622114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128248189": {"recommendationid": "128248189", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095404882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1630024242}, "language": "english", "review": "Es Bueno", "timestamp_created": 1670620305, "timestamp_updated": 1670620305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128202481": {"recommendationid": "128202481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341249859", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1698309267}, "language": "english", "review": "The jailer is the key, kill him and you\u2019ll be free.", "timestamp_created": 1670558983, "timestamp_updated": 1670558983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128184620": {"recommendationid": "128184620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180686962", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1626028325}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo, increible juego con su final", "timestamp_created": 1670532665, "timestamp_updated": 1670532665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128181308": {"recommendationid": "128181308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136793868", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1670528779}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't buy thiis game, it lies to you.

You cannot beat this game without becoming a master of its base mechanics.\n\nIf that is intimidating, good, that means you are human. As it turns out, Furi is also a game about humanity. \n\nFuri is an excellent game, but not for everyone. If you can find value in the intrinsic pursuit of mastery, and the creeping corruption of compassion, this game is for you. If you can't imagine yourself devoting time to learning to press buttons at the right time in a computer game, then this game isn't for you. \n\nYour character is set up as an unstoppable weapon of destruction, one who has already mastered killing. You are alien to the other characters of this game. None of them really stand a chance against you, every challenge they pose can be triumphed with time and effort. And unfortunately for them, they stand in your way.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are beautiful in their simplicity. You're given a big fuck-you sword and a quick eat-this gun. With the sword, you can parry and attack (and also boost or charge but that's optional). With the gun, you can fire, which damages foes or destroys their projectiles (you can also charge it but that's both optional and inefficient). You can dodge. With just these tools, you can beat the game.\n\nIt's more nuanced than that, of course. You don't just use these tools, you master them. You feel your toolkit as intuitively as you breathe, you parry as quickly as you blink, you shoot at subconsciously as your heart beats. This comes with practice, with success, with failure. Each boss's challenge becomes more layered and complex as it progresses, such that you'll be surprised how easy the beginning phases are when you replay them, despite them handing you your ass only minutes before. You figure out what works and what doesn't, and you apply it of your own volition to succeed. \n\nWhile you continue your slaughter, you start to understand why you started the game in prison. You realize these people in your way have deeply personal reasons to be there, depriving you of your freedom. You begin to feel humanity poking through your cold, machine-like exterior. Only once you reach the ending will you realize you already lost, your enemies accomplished their goals without even meaning to. Through example, they restored your humanity.\n\nFuri's gameplay is punishing. Failing to be perfect will take away your hit points, and losing too many hit points will take away your lives, and losing too many lives will take away your progress. This is all baked into the design philosophy of Furi. Failing to be perfect is only an issue when you do it continually. Otherwise, being perfect actually restores your hit points, allowing you to be imperfect more. Losing a life allows you to keep practicing, to keep improving and mastering the challenge. Losing progress takes you back to the beginning of the boss, where you face the same challenge but less complex, and see for yourself how much you've improved. You're not meant to be afraid of these outcomes, as both you and your character are set up to keep trying for as long as it takes. \n\n\"Excellence is not an art, it's pure habit.

The health/parry mechanic makes it so that you are truly never out of any fight and makes it possible for you to completely turn the tide of any given battle with proper focus.  \n\nIt also doesn't overly penalize you for losses on the standard difficulty, given the learning curve, its nice you are allowed to continue from the existing boss instead of run it all back.  Given how long each fight can last, this is definitely a boon to the learning curve.  The difficulty increase across each boss is also extremely balanced, at no point has any defeat made me feel the boss is unfair or unbeatable.\n\nThis won't ever be a 1000+ hour game for me, the combination of a shorter game + how demanding it is to play will cap how much time I put into it.

I'm in my sophmore year of high school. I hop on my PS4 to see what were the free PS+ games of the month. Furi was one of them. It looked super interesting and so I downloaded it. \n\nLittle did I know that I'd still be playing this game 6 years later. \n\nTo say this game made a huge impact on my life is an understatement of the highest degree. \n\nTo this day this has been one of, if not, my favorite game of all time. The artstyle is simple but effective and colorful. Easy on the eyes too. The gameplay is fun, fast, challenging and exciting (and sometimes mildy infuriating lol). And to top it all off, this soundtrack led me to a synthwave rabbit hole. Now a good 50% of all of my songs on my personal playlist are just filled with tracks from Waveshaper, Carpenter Brut, Danger, and many others. \n\nThis also started my descent into a game rabbit hole. This game led me to other gems I never played before. Hotline Miami and Katana Zero to be more specific. These games are exactly what I was looking for; challenging gameplay with banger soundtracks. \n\nAnd none of this would've ever happened if it weren't for that fateful day in July 2016. \n\n6 years later I'm still trying to beat my personal best records (and I have, but I still want to get better.) \n\n6 years later I'm still playing the soundtrack everywhere I go.\n\nAnd the Onnamusha update gave this game a breath of fresh air that I didn't even think it needed, but it basically made my mentality go back to where it was on the first day I played it; ultra excited, wanting to get better at it, begging for more. \n\nIf you haven't played this game, you're doing yourself a disservice. \n\nHere's to 6 more years. \n\nTLDR; 10/10 will kill jailer again", "timestamp_created": 1667674843, "timestamp_updated": 1667674843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811971485614776611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125002246": {"recommendationid": "125002246", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036990830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1693252393}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the hardest yet most fun games ive ever played 10/10 great sound track", "timestamp_created": 1667673600, "timestamp_updated": 1667673600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124998238": {"recommendationid": "124998238", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981816407", "num_games_owned": 1018, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1589742903}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like No More Heroes except instead of a meta-commentary on the sanctity of life, the relationship between player and game and the pressures and expectations of male virility it's [spoiler]the literal apocalypse.[/spoiler]\n\nI couldn't beat the true final boss.

There's just no way to fine tune the difficulty of this game so that you can practice more and get better. All the boss fights are essentially the same. You character doesn't evolve in any way so you just have to use the same limited attacks to knock health off the boss and use dodge/block/parry to survive. Bosses can be tedious and take a long time to beat if you are not great, and you often have to grind through the early phases of each fight that are too easy in order to practice the harder, later phases of each battle. I really think they could have done a better job fine tuning the difficulty modes in the game.\n\nUnlike other difficult games (e.g. monolith, hades) where there is some reward that carries over for playing the game and failing, there is nothing to this.

If you judge a game on it's highs this game is really good, but if you judge it on its lows Furi is quite tragic. \nI can only recommend this to people who don't play hard games or bullet hells because otherwise it is too easy. the issue with the difficulty is that it takes too long to beat bosses once you solve their gimmick, this is why the edge is the best boss in the game because once you solve his gimmick you can beat the fight within 2-3 minutes.\nAlso the \"secret\" ending shouldn't delete your save, this would unironically just make the game better because otherwise you have to refight two of the three bosses i would say are just outright bad and literally just elongated cutscenes. (the line and the scale). I got it by accident on furier mode after going to eat lunch and now my save has been deleted, it is gone. I lost one hour of progress for no reason. Fighting the line is like tearing off your testicles with a rusty spoon then you have to fight the scale which is like if your balls grew back and you had to remove them with another rusty spoon.\nOn a positive note some people will really really enjoy this game, so if it is on sale you should probably just buy it and try it out, there is a lot of combat depth which is a shame because it dosn't get even close to hard enough to force the player to even experiment with it, but if you have enough patience you can be rewarded by being good at furi.\nOh yeah and I get that the beat being easy is the point and I understand tha, that's fair, but why do they then give you the star, who is just a glorified cutscene immediately after???? like you literally just went through the beat and the entire credits before being able to fight them and then you just sit there sucking your thumb as you are softly cradled to sleep over the 10 minute fight.

Except while I skipped over TSB because of the title, I skipped over Furi because of the description. \"The jailer is the key, kill him and you'll be free\"? Why am I in jail, why do I need to kill someone to get out? Pass.\n\nAnd of course, just like in the case of The Sexy Brutale, this was a criminally bad decision. Because not only Furi is an amazing game, the description is actually very apt and sets the tone quite well. Granted, it's not very descriptive of the game, and the screenshots just show a bunch of neon anime fighting and flashing lights... so I'll describe the game for you instead, hoping that you won't end up making the same mistake as me.\n\n[h1]Well, what is it?[/h1]\nIn one sentence: Narrative-driven boss rush alternating between top-down bullet hell and close up melee sections.\n\n[b]Narrative-driven[/b] means that the game not only has a story, it's also quite directly woven into the very core of the game. The driving question is \"who are you, and why are you locked up?\" - and the characters, that is your opponents (and your singular unlikely ally) talk to you a lot before and during the fight (not after, since they're dead). Most of it is banter, but eventually you start to form a picture of what's happening. And it's a very emotionally potent story where narration, combat, environment and music come together in a powerful way.\n\n[b]Boss rush[/b] means exactly what it sounds like. You only fight against bosses, although the fights are separated by a bit of a walk between the areas, during which you get to take in the scenery and listen to some helpful exposition from your friend.\n\n[b]Alternating between top-down bullet hell[/b] - each boss has several health bars. You deplete each one through two sections. The first one consists of the boss shooting stuff at you, while you avoid their projectiles and shoot back, occasionally getting in close for a melee strike. It's more bullet purgatory rather than bullet hell, it's not so bad. This one is played in top-down perspective for obvious reasons.\n\n[b]And close up melee sections[/b] - once you've finished a bullet hell section you get to get close and personal, and you exchange your gun for your laser blade. The camera zooms in, the effective arena shrinks to a small area around your opponent, and the fight becomes all about parrying, avoiding ground-based AoEs and counterattacking, occasionally charging your blade for a power attack. Top ten anime fights: the game.\n\n[h1]Okay, but is it good?[/h1]\nI mean, I obviously like it. Can anything be considered objectively good or bad? Gah, fine, I'll cut the crap.\n\n- It's rather challenging; I've played harder games, but Furi is harder than most. I found it just right, considering the subject matter.\n- it's very fast! Do you like fast games? This is fast. \n- the fights are varied, and generally don't reuse mechanics. No boredom here.\n- the music is some great French electro/synth made by Danger, Carpenter Brut and The Toxic Avenger.\n- the story is suspenseful, emotional and keeps you guessing until the very end. It's mostly given to you piecemeal by boss dialogue, but there's also some quality visual storytelling.\n- it's pretty, at least I think so. Cyberpunk afro samurai.\n- and of course the fighting is tight and satisfying.\n\nWould you say that those things are good? Then yes, this game is good. \n\n[h1]My Only Chance to Make This Right[/h1]\nThis sentence - when you understand its true meaning - does an excellent job of showcasing the aesthetic symmetry and general theme of the story. Also, if you haven't played this game, I'm hoping that this review will make this right, and convince you to play it. Yeah? Okay, that was a bit too pretentious...\n\nAaanyway, as a closing statement I'd like to bring the attention that the game's developers - The Game Bakers - are French, but they cooperated with Takashi Okazaki, the mangaka behind Afro Samurai. He's the one who did the character design, and it shows. So Furi is a result of an unlikely French-Japanese cooperation. I wouldn't mind seeing more of such team ups.\n\nSo yeah, go ahead!

I don't like bullet hell shooters, the story seemed deliberately obtuse and pretentious, and the way the game calls its base difficulty 'Promenade' as if it's mocking you for not being immediately godlike at it as soon as you pick it up all added up to a hard rage quit five years ago. \n\nHowever upon revisiting it this year I found one of the most simple but rewarding and impactful gaming experiences in the last few years. \n\nThe bad first: \nThe second boss. A huge difficulty spike from the first, it's a tremendously long fight in a visually bland environment against an uninteresting opponent with a multitude of poorly-explained mechanics. No wonder I stopped here on my first crack at the game.\nThe third boss. How do you make 'a master of time' boring? Like this! Do almost nothing with the fascinating premise and chalk it up to standing almost totally still in the back of the arena endlessly shooting at an unmoving bullet sponge. \nWalking. Why isn't it just a cutscene? I get that it gives us an auto-walk button for between the fights, but if anything that underlines how bad the controls for these little jaunts are. They're effective ways to build up the bosses through intriguing exposition but either give us controls that aren't shit or take control away altogether for a few minutes. It's good for de-stressing post-battle anyway.\nMy cat. Won't stop jumping in my lap when I'm playing. >:(\n\nNow the good: \nEvery other boss I haven't mentioned yet is a banger. Each one feels unique and challenging (some more than others), but epic enough that by the time the fight's over you feel accomplished, like you really got to know your enemy. Blending bullet hell shooting with lightning-fast melee combat means that each boss demands a variety of skills, from dodging to blocking to sniping to shooting out enemy projectiles to simply being the fastest one on the draw (for both your sword and your gun). \nThe visuals. Not just the unique art design for each character and environment, not just the wildly varied color pallette, not just the well-rendered graphics, but how all of it comes together. This could have come dangerously close to being a visually messy game, but I was consistently impressed by how crisp and clean everything was. By drawing sharp lines between soft colors, Furi never loses clarity.\nThe sound. A soundtrack as pulsating and vibrant as its gameplay but surprisingly never distracts you from the action works hand in hand with brilliant audio cues to immerse you in this game's bizarre, action-packed world.\nThe story. While a little obnoxiously cryptic at first (well, at least to someone who doesn't like David Lynch movies), Furi's narrative becomes more solid as it goes along, and in a rare case (so rare in fact I haven't seen it since Spec Ops: The Line), I found each ending equally satisfying, even the bad ending. There's a surprising amount of story to tell here. Throughout the game you are constantly verbally (and of course physically) bashed by everyone you meet, so do you sue for peace, do you prove them wrong, or do you show them that if you treat someone like the villain long enough, they'll eventually become one?\nMy cat. She calms me down after boss 9's stupid turrets piss me off again.\n\nOverall, 8/10. Solid recommendation, especially if you have my cat, which you don't. I'm not giving her to you.

But PLEASE do not let that discourage you whatsoever. It will be hard, but it will get harder step by step. I never noticed a sharp difficulty spike. Impressively, playing on the Furier difficulty was also a smooth transition- the first fight on Furier gave me just as much challenge as the last on Furi difficulty.

If it weren't for them my review would be something along the lines of \"music great, visuals fine, campaign okay\" and that is because I didn't find the maingame all that hard, atleast not as hard as people said. Sure the bosses are hard at first but there isn't risk to them, if you die you can immediately try again which can annoying but not stress inducing. Same goes for if you finish your first run, you'll get a crappy score but no real incentive to improve that score if it wasn't for one thing. This is where the achievements come in. They unlock the full potential of the game. They give me the pressure to perform well and the intensity/stress in a bossfight I was looking for.

The art style and controls are interesting enough, but with 3 hours in I found the difficulty curve was too high to be enjoyable and I was not at all motivated by the almost zero plot or story the game was pushing. It is clear enough to me that developers did take some time to create some kind of \"edgy\" world, I just didn't care for it or how much I had to practice the game to get a few crumbs.\n\nTo be clear, hard games can be a ton of fun, but I prefer to have the difficult increased over some time or to at least have some more variety in how I practice playing the game (i.e. just replaying the same boss again and again with literally nothing else in the game is frustrating and boring).\n\nWhen the fundamental structure of the game is the problem, time to uninstall this and be bummed I missed the

my first complain is that there is input delay on your dash, because for some reason the devs decided to change how the dash worked for her boss fight. so now if you hold down your dash it'll dash you across the whole arena. problem is that this creates input lag which gets you killed by the absolutely nonsensical amount of clutter the boss throws at you. by the time she's done shooting orbs at you, she's got 4 laser beams firing nonstop before the bullets have even left the arena. and with the input lag on your dash it's downright impossible to dodge any of that. if they just made your dash slightly longer and got rid of the charge function, it'd be a lot more fair and would overall actually be a fun fight.", "timestamp_created": 1659469973, "timestamp_updated": 1659469973, "voted_up":

None of them feel distinct from one another, and when fights can last upwards of 10 minutes that begins to be a huge problem. For instance, one of the bosses has wings, and instead of doing anything unique or fun with her flying mechanic, all that's really different is that she can fly off of the map to where you can't deal any damage.

If they had allowed you to sprint, then I think it would've felt a lot less frustrating, even if they took the same amount of time.\n[*] In the aforementioned walking sections, the camera jumps around to fixed points rather than following you. This sets up some cool shots, but it makes me feel disconnected from my character, and it makes walking around annoying since the direction that the camera is facing is constantly shifting. There is an auto-walk button so you don't have to deal with that, but that just makes me feel even more disconnected.\n[*] When you beat the game on Furier (the harder difficulty), the game gives you a message thanking you for playing it \"the right way,\" which may be the single most pretentious thing I've heard from a game.\n[/list]\n\nNow for the good stuff. \n\n[list]\n[*] The combat is super fast, responsive, and satisfying.

Here, the new character is not something I see much reason to compare to and call superior to the original protagonist's gameplay style: it's an equally-good different way to play that stands on its own two legs. Better still is that it accomplishes that while building nicely from a base of the same mechanical groundwork that makes Furi so damn fun in the first place.\n\nI love this game, and if the original is Kanto, the DLC is like the Johto revisit, a fresh walk down a beloved backdrop.\n\nWhere in this case, said backdrop is an aggro, cel-shaded, twitchy-responsive, pulse-pounder of a twin stick shooter/arena combat hybrid.

Furi seemed like it would be up my alley, as I like \"stylized\" games as well as hack and slashers, but it slowly drained what good will I had as I continued to grapple with its broken mechanics. \n\nFirst of all, the good stuff. The games has fantastic visuals, very unique boss designs (and fights), and a stellar electronica soundtrack. While I know many have complained about the long walking sections between boss fights, I don't mind them so much as they provide a quiet contrast that is needed against the bombastic duels with the jailers. While the camera can be a problem, with just one button press you can have your character \"auto walk\" through the environment. \n\nUnfortunately, the bad stuff is the core of the game itself: the mechanics. The dodging, parrying, and shooting are all flawed. The dodging acts as your moment of invincibility as well. Since certain attacks can only be dodged through, you will be using this a lot. However, the dodge can be very finicky and often times I have found myself dodging in a wrong direction or overshooting my mark with it. The parry is even worse. When a parry is done successfully, you recover some energy and can even break the bosses combo. The problem is that your guard to parry lasts barely a second and every boss will often hesitate before melee attacking. This has led to me most of the time seeing the boss attack, hit the button to parry, only for it to end right as the boss attacks. I have always hated parrying in games. Just make a \"guard\" where if it is done at the correct time, you can parry. Otherwise, the enemy should do less damage while your on guard. Lastly, the gun is VERY awkward to use. If using a controller, you have to hold down R3 to use it and move the stick in the direction you're firing. This makes the 3rd boss of the game very awkward since the gun plays a major role in that fight. \n\nDespite these flaws, it didn't keep me from enjoying the boss fights. Most of the times, the gun was not needed and I had plenty of room and time to prepare a dodge. I used the gun when I felt like it and I could often \"run away\" from the bosses melee attacks. Their is a measure of mercy in these long boss fights. Bosses will often have multiple phases which can wear on a player as they are learning the patterns. When the players beats a bosses phase, they will receive an additional life if they have lost one and have their energy filled up, but the opposite is true as well. If the boss depletes your energy, you have to start the phase over again. This provides a good balance between being hard and being far. The bosses have a \"top down\" view and focus on both melee and bullet hell which is a fun an unique experience. \n\nIt's just too bad the game flushes all of that down the toilet with the \"duels\" at the end of each boss phase. It is here where every single problem with the game become exponentially worse. \n\nWhen you deplete a bosses life bar, you will enter into a \"duel\" with them where you are in an enclosed field and the camera shift to a closer view, and the boss gains their health back. I cannot tell you how many times I finished a normal boss phase with little to no damage, only to lose it all and have to repeat the whole phase because of these duels. Generally, the boss will either melee attack you or do an arena attack with only a small sliver of the arena being safe. This is where the game falls apart. Everything is so chaotic and blends together and the \"signals\" for the attack usually blend in with the more stylish backgrounds. You will likely lose most of your health due to the melee attacks and not full dodging the arena swipes since the red that shows their trajectory can often blend with the color of the arena. Whenever I won these duels, it was usually luck rather than any sort of skill. And of course, if you lose your health, you have to repeat the boss phase AND the duel. \n\nDespite liking a lot about this game, those duels killed any goodwill I had for it or desire to continue going. While I do enjoy hard games, I play games to unwind and not to get stressed or angry. Whenever I lose in a difficult game, I want it to be because I made a mistake or got cocky, not because the game stacked the deck against me through faulty mechanics and screwing with my senses. \n\nIf you want a stylized, difficult, boss game, go with Cuphead. It is much smoother and satisfying in its gameplay and mechanics. Oh and PS: having trophies earned for dying numerous times with the message being \"git gud\" is one of the most pedantic things imaginable, especially if your game has poor mechanics and cheap difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1657505083, "timestamp_updated": 1657505083, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118553768": {"recommendationid": "118553768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317760021", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 646, "last_played": 1657431845}, "language": "english", "review": "ANNOYING BOSS FIGHTS ARE FUN WHILE YO UCRY", "timestamp_created": 1657431912, "timestamp_updated": 1657431912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118551870": {"recommendationid": "118551870", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132985618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1700157252}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those games that is magnificent.

For a game that is all about learning attack patterns and muscle memory its an almost unforgivable oversight. Of course, if it weren't for that feature, the game's run time would be comically short. So maybe that is why... \n\nI could say other things, as I do have other complaints about the game (ie my favorite boss is the strap because she doesn't talk, and so cannot be smug in my direction for 3-4 hours while I learn her patterns) but these are personal, secondary, and a little noodle-y.

The game is a boss rush with nothing in between but brief respites filled by traversing an otherwise empty world. A lesser game would feel the need to try and hide the lack of variety in content by making each boss as radically different as possible. Furi doesn't do this. \n\nThere is a consistency in the rules of the duel oriented world of Furi that compliments it's rigidity in a way that makes you not care that your character never really develops in terms of it's abilities. You as a player evolve, and the later bosses aren't easier because all of a sudden your character is a super high level, or because you have 8 different kinds of rocket launchers, it's because you've become so educated on the anatomy of the adversaries that learning a new set of timings and dodging patterns has grown trivial.\n\nOften this leads to an anti-climatic end. The description I've given has probably already led you to draw comparisons to Shadow of The Colossus. Another fantastic game, but SotC, at least in my opinion, has an anti-climatic end from a gameplay standpoint, as you've just become so well versed in the art of defeating these titans that the last few have less impact. Without spoiling much, I will just say that the true final boss of this game is such a pure test of everything you've learned up until that point that even with how quickly you likely dispatched with the couple of foes before it, you will still be asked to demonstrate yourself so adeptly that it gives the games conclusion the kind of satisfying feeling it deserves. That in conjunction with it's difference in what it's relevance is to the story is leads to it being exactly the right kind of hair raising final boss a game like this needs.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike SotC, the intermittent passages of land traversal are not the kind of atmospheric, perspective building set pieces they are in that game. Obnoxious camera angle changes, less than sluggish movement in the sections, and a complete lack of any sort of feeling of connectivity to the world itself make it easily the worst part of the game. It's truly a shame, as I find the dialogue provided by your companion character to be well written and interesting, and there's not much that hasn't already been said about how fantastic the soundtrack to the game is. So, any excuse to get to listen to that more should be welcomed. It's really a shame, as I think the developers were right to think something like that is necessary in a boss rush game like this, but this just wasn't the way to do it.\n\nAll in all, a masterclass in how to make the most out of a single concept.", "timestamp_created": 1656559868, "timestamp_updated": 1656559868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56204378604888916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117864977": {"recommendationid": "117864977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879210776", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1577232885}, "language": "english", "review": "A bullet hell game where you memorise patterns and make zero mistakes instead of thinking on your feet. \nThis game is literally the equivalent to learning how to play classical music pieces on a instrument, some might find it fun but I don't.", "timestamp_created": 1656514954, "timestamp_updated": 1656515043, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117839231": {"recommendationid": "117839231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040135301", "num_games_owned": 998, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1530248478}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really good.

It's a shame too, because behind the veil of slipshod controls, filler \"cutscenes\", and easy, often tedious boss fights, there's a legitimately good game. For the sake of transparency, I am writing this review after playing through the entire game on normal difficulty.\n\nI'll start with the positives:\n\n- The music is fantastic. This is pretty much a given if you've watched even one trailer, but this game legitimately has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while.\n\n- None of the boss fights are samey; each boss has their own attacks, gimmicks, arena, and personality. I can only think of a few moments where two bosses shared a similar attack, aside from simple attacks that most of the bosses have, like where they just shoot a couple bullets at you. For the most part, they're all unique, and I like that a lot.\n\n- The visual style and voice acting are decent. They could both be a bit more polished in my opinion, but they're certainly nowhere near bad.\n\n- The parrying, melee combat, and normal gun firing all feel and work great. The mechanic of regaining health when you parry is honestly a stroke of genius, and the game would be completely different without it. Because of that, it feels legitimately rewarding when you do a chain of three, four, or five parries in a row and lay down a powerful melee counterattack that knocks the boss on their ass, and getting a perfect parry feels especially good. The gun firing isn't anything special, but it does the job and it does it well, and I'm not really looking for anything more than \"bullets get fired\" when it comes to a basic ranged attack.\n\nAnd now, for the negatives:\n\n- The controls suck, at least on mouse and keyboard. The game tells you flat out that a console controller is highly recommended, but I don't have one, so I had to stick with the default PC control scheme. The dodging is the most obviously flawed control since it's controlled by where your cursor is positioned rather than what direction you're moving in, which consistently screwed me over. I was able to get accustomed to it, but just barely, and even with that more subjective issue it's still an objectively bad design choice since where you aim your gun is also controlled by your cursor. So, if a boss is to the north of you, and you're getting hit by wide attacks from east and west that you can't strafe around, you have to take your cursor off the boss, dodge sideways by aiming sideways, and then refocus your cursor on the boss and start firing at them again. On paper it doesn't sound terrible, but in practice it's a serious nuisance.\n\n- The dodging is also terrible because, for some inane reason, they decided to implement a charged dodge. This move is literally never useful, at least in the base game on normal difficulty, and because they added this, your dodge only comes out once you let go of the spacebar rather than when you pressed it. This causes pretty noticeable lag regarding when you actually dodge, and can screw you over if you're not careful. Also, charging a dodge locks you in place, for some reason.\n\n- There are charged versions of the melee attack and the ranged attack too, and they're only slightly more useful than the wholly useless charged dodge. I can count on one hand the number of times I used the charged slash throughout the entire game, and the charged fire is literally only useful on the last fight in the game, where it's changed from a mediocre charged projectile to a goddamn laser beam that ends up being the most consistent way to damage the boss out of everything in your arsenal. Of course, the game does not inform you that you now have this surprisingly useful laser beam; I figured this out accidentally, when I mistakenly pressed and held the charge shot button.\n\n- As good as melee combat feels, you pretty much exclusively use it for counterattacking, such as when you manage to parry an attack, or after a boss does a big sweeping attack that makes them let their guard down. If you try to hit the boss while their guard is up, they either just won't react, or they'll try and punish you for it, which you can usually parry if you're fast enough. This design choice does make sense to an extent, so I can't get too mad about it, but I still found it annoying.\n\n- Despite the downright horrible dodging and the fact that half of your abilities are generally useless, this game is still REALLY easy. I think I lost to a boss twice throughout the entire game, once on the third to last boss, and once on the final boss. Outside of those mistakes, I had virtually no trouble beating every boss in this game. \nAs a side note, both of these bosses are notable for changing up the style of gameplay completely; the third to last boss is a strictly melee/parrying oriented fight, and the final boss is a strictly gunfire oriented fight.\n\n-Despite this game being REALLY easy, it's also REALLY tedious, to a genuinely unacceptable degree. The biggest offender are the \"paths\" you walk down after beating every boss, which are really nothing more than mangled, maddeningly boring, unskippable cutscenes. All you have to do is press the spacebar, and the game automatically has your character traipse through these huge swaths of empty nothingness while a man wearing a rabbit mask and holding a microphone stand teleports around, spoon-feeding you exposition about whatever threat you're going to be facing next. It's boring, it's unnecessary, and it makes me actually dread beating the boss I'm currently facing because I know another five minutes or so of waiting around and twiddling my thumbs is all I have to look forward to next.\nThe boss fights are admittedly less tedious, but they still have their moments, such as when bosses do these huge bullet hell attacks on their last life that they're completely invincible for the entire duration of. If you're looking for a boss fight that IS tedious from start to finish, the sniper boss is by far the biggest offender, and it makes her fight easily the most annoying, exhausting fight in the game.\n\nThose are the biggest negatives, but there are still two pretty egregious offenses that I'll talk about here. They might be a bit spoiler-y to some people, but there really isn't much to spoil story-wise or otherwise in this game, so I'm not going to bother hiding them with a spoiler tag.\n\n- Right before the sixth boss, you'll be asked to stay with a female NPC rather than continuing on your quest to escape the prison. If you do decide to stay with her (by waiting around and doing nothing for a minute or two), THE GAME ENDS. This gives you one of the three endings of the game, all of which you will need if you want to 100% the game, and you are required to play through the entire game again if you want to face the four or five bosses that come after this scene.\n\n- In the post credits sequence, after having this entire game hand me nothing but slow overworld travel through fixed camera angles, Resident Evil-style, the game finally shows off that it was in fact capable of fast, fun overworld maneuvering with a freely controlled camera all along, and that it could have made it work wonderfully. This isn't so much a mechanical issue as it is a flat out insult. You're telling me I could have been dashing my way between the bosses like this the entire game, and instead you made me move like a snail and deal with fixed, jarring cameras just so you could \"build more suspense\" and have your funny rabbit man teleport around like his name is Sans Undertale? What a joke.\n\nSo yeah, there you go. Furi is a game with a ton of potential and some legitimately thrilling combat systems, all hidden away behind this big veil of mediocrity, tedium, and bad design choices.

Well..., I was right this time. It's short in length, large in width, and intends to spend some quality time with your sanity, concentration, and level of dedication. Prepare yourself for a rough route, and don't let the stylish art style play its magic on your expectations; you are up for a challenge.\n\n[h1][b]\ud83c\udfae Single-player[/b][/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 Prison Break[/b]\n\nThe jailer is the key, kill him, and you'll be free. It's the Stranger's only way out of the celestial, impassable prison specially built for him and him only. Heh..., imagine that! Anyway, you play as the Stranger, whose main objective is simple: get away and slay anyone standing in the way. Who sets you free at first is a wacky weirdo wearing a fluffy fancy version of the bunny mask from the movie Donnie Darko. He'll be your walking-talking radio, aiding your escape with useless tips (my opinion) and valuable info regarding the story lore, as you both share the same goal. Overall, he's a compelling companion.\n\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 Guardians of the Galactic Prison[/b]\n\nThey are the jailers standing in the way, the best of the best. Floating in space is the prison with a surreal set of spatial worlds linked by mystical gates. Each world has a unique atmosphere that well defines its jailer's attributes. Each boss is sui generis in character, appearance, and fighting style. I think they deserve more lore and a multilayered depth in the game's character-driven story. The plot is engrossing as the characters are, and the excitement builds up as you progress to unveil the fruit of the tale. It's not the type of story that will lay its cards at ease after the curtain falls; it will require some deep thoughts to reveal its true meaning.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2822121139\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 Freedom Fighter[/b]\n\nYou are a samurai armed with a lightning Katana and a laser pistol. As for the guardians, each has a special weapon that defines their combat style. There are two gameplay modes: duel fighting and walking sections. You go to a segment, defeat its jailer and move on to the next. Each fight has various phases, each consisting of two portions (with some exceptions). First is the usual open arena encounter, where you can move freely and use both weapons to deplete the enemy's shield bar. After the health bar is exposed, you enter a close-range personal duel in which you can drain it using only melee combos. Defensive options are dashing: appropriate for evading bullets; and parrying: more suitable for countering melee strikes. Power attacks range from charging your gunshot, slash, and boost; also, charging your dash increases the evasive range. In summary: the combat is simple, satisfying, and responsive.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2823927307\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 Furi vs Dark Souls[/b]\n\nWhile they both focus on difficult bosses, their methods differ. Unlike the slow-paced strategic gameplay in Dark Souls, Furi is a fast-paced game that will punish you for not taking risks; also, it has a small room for errors and reconfiguring your plan while fighting. Don't get me wrong, though; planning a strategy is crucial in Furi, but it has to be after learning your enemy's attack patterns and before going into battle; there is no time to think during a fight. It all hinges on your reflexes, muscle memory, and knowledge of the attack patterns.\n\nThere is no weapon variety or any form of upgrades in Furi. You'll always play as the same character you started with regardless of the difficulty mode or the level you're playing. The only upgrade you're getting is you. It will show you your true power of adaptation. You'll be astonished by how drastically your skills can evolve by practicing, making you a grandmaster in Furi, and when that happens, you'll become the boss all the guardians fear. An obvious difference is the bullet hell phases in Furi, where it pushes your concentration and reflexes to the limit. In conclusion: they differ much more than they have in similar.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2821692697\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 You Can Do It[/b]\n\nAs hard as it gets, it will always be fair. Rarely can you blame the game for losing or even getting hit. The levels are well-balanced; they only require gitting gud. But don't let the heat of the challenge push you away. In my first playthrough, I had a D rank with 2000+ hits and 100+ KOs on Furi difficulty. It went from there to an S rank with 158 hits and 0 KOs on Furier difficulty. All it took was some practice. Good news: there is a mode for practicing where you can fight any enemy in any order and access the invincible option, which allows you to focus on different aspects of the fight. It offers becoming invincible, exposing an enemy's health bar, and skipping or locking phases. Another mode is the speedrun, which records your time and hit count, and there are no walking sections while you fight all the bosses in sequence.\n\n[h1][b]\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Technical[/b][/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 S Rank for the Ep!c Soundtrack[/b]\n\nEach boss has an exclusive soundtrack that not only sets the mood to blend with the atmosphere but somehow manifests the enemy's appearance and evokes his character in the player's imagination, making him see them with his mind before his eyes. In addition, the music's rhythms are well-integrated into the fight phases, inducing a fervor feeling that ups the enthusiasm to 11. Furi's aesthetic utilizes a colorful minimalistic approach with cool particle effects to define its art style. I can't say the same for the mediocre shadow quality that can often reduce the overall visual appeal. More than one executive animation per boss could've added much more to the cinematic aspect of the game.\n\n[b]\ud83d\udca0 Controller Highly Recommended?[/b]\n\nYes. Why? Mainly because you can't get that sweet 360\u00b0 directional movement with a keyboard, which you'll do a lot, BTW. Sure, you can get that radial movement using a mouse, but it'll follow your aiming direction. As for a gamepad, there are two analogs, one for shooting and the other for movement, so it'll be much easier and more comfortable. Mostly, arenas have a radial design, so you'll be moving in curved directions most of the time, which can get strenuous using WASD buttons. So is it playable on a keyboard and mouse? I've S ranked the game on Furier using only keyboard and mouse. For me, the best layout was to change the reticle mode to radial and the movement mode to reticle, but when I have to dodge and shoot in different directions, I change the movement mode to directional.\n\n[h1][b]\u2696\ufe0f Verdict[/b][/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nIt's a brilliant mix of swordplay and bullet hell that never fails to make you hold your breath. It's under an hour of content that will take way more for you to learn each boss, adapting to their patterns as you witness your skills grow; it's an substantial success of showcasing what you can achieve through the sheer force of practice and commitment.\n\n[h1][b]\ud83d\udcaf Score[/b][/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\n[quote][b]\ud83c\udd70\ufe0fspects[/b]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Aspect[/th]\n[th]Multiplier[/th]\n[th]Score[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Single-player[/td]\n[td]40%[/td]\n[td]10[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Technical[/td]\n[td]60%[/td]\n[td]8[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]\ud83c\udd7e\ufe0fverall[/b]\n\n[quote][b]9[/b][/quote]\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1655912979, "timestamp_updated": 1669573056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792681276798248291", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117394770": {"recommendationid": "117394770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987310893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1693162231}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is worth it for the OST alone.

Originally I picked it up for free with PlayStation Plus a long time ago but was very bad at it and couldn't get past the 2nd boss. But after I got it on PC... I still sucked :D\n\nBut I kept trying and trying and really got into the rhythm of the game and soon was able to beat it, and I can say that Furi is in my top 5 favorite games of all time list. Thankfully this is one of the games none of my friends who are actually good at games play, so I can happily say I'm the best Furi player in my friend group :)\n\nThe combat feels great in this game, I love the chaos of trying to find the right time to hit or shoot an opponent while avoiding their onslaught of attacks. This game also boasts a beautiful soundtrack created by a handful of very good artists, and I find myself listening to these tracks on repeat, even replaying fights with no sound on but the music.

It's bright, its fast paced but the mechanics make it easy to keep up with that pace, it's polished, everything about it works and every level transition makes you feel like youre staring down a final boss.\n\nCons: At the time of writing, while playing the new female character, I feel like the fights lag on a bit too much because of the enemy health. You deal chip damage while not in the super mode, and for fights that don't have much of a sporadic nature or many actively changing mechanics, like the 4th and 5th fights, things get monotonous and boring quickly.\n\nOver all, I know you guys said that a sequel isnt planned a long while back, but I would love to see one. I don't think anyone else could have handled this as well and creatively as you did.\n\nThe love and effort you guys put into this game is clear, and for the last time, thank you.", "timestamp_created": 1654236348, "timestamp_updated": 1654236348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116382943": {"recommendationid": "116382943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153935586", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1097, "last_played": 1654185353}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with fast paced combat, nice visuals and excellent music, albeit somewhat short.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, the game features a smooth learning curve throughout the main game, starting off easy and ending with some tough fights towards its end.

In a way, I can see it being inspired by Afro Samurai... and the mechanics looked really cool from the video! But from my time with Furi, that's really where the good part ends, just mechanics. \n\nYou're tossed into a world with zero clue, which can be a way to make people curious about the world, but it does not provide any opportunity for me as a player to learn more about it. This is a game with little to no world. You wake up, walk to an arena, slay a boss and walk through a door to slay another boss. I don't find there to be any exploration available here. The story doesn't seem to be cohesive either. Your mission is to escape prison and get your freedom, but you have to fight another prisoner to make progress. For some reason, the prison is constructed in such a way that the prisoner obstructs your path to another prison chamber.\n\nI have shared that the mechanics are great, but they do feel a little clunky from my perspective. Changing camera angles (during combat) makes it very odd of an experience, and I suppose it's because it is an aged game. There's also mechanics that prevent you from fully taking advantage of staggering or downing an opponent, by making your opponent invulnerable. \n\nRight now, it's just a game that looks cool, has a nice idea, does the combat well, but held back by some ideas. Paired with lack of information about the world to keep things interesting, and a lack of cohesion in the story, it just makes it not really that great of a game in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1653307425, "timestamp_updated": 1653307425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.374825477600097656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115889722": {"recommendationid": "115889722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018348498", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 687, "last_played": 1680366766}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Music, Great Gameplay, Cool Concept.", "timestamp_created": 1653301987, "timestamp_updated": 1653301987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115881670": {"recommendationid": "115881670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431244835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1696159863}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first played this game I barely passed Line and got stuck on Scales. \nTwo years later I decided to try again and suddenly it got way more manageable.

One of the only hiccups that I've ever had with the original character is that you can't just tap the dash button to do a fixed range dodge, you have to hold the dash for like half a second before you even do a short dash. This one gripe with the original character made the final boss ultra frustrating for me so I put the game down until more recently when Onamusha launched. The dual forms are not only a lot of fun to get the rhythm down with, but the speed form doesn't require charging the dash.

This game focuses on fast-paced boss fights only and each one of them has from 4 to 6 stages. It literally takes every aspect of an action game and merges it all into ten boss fights. From bullet hell to hack and slash, you have it all. The player will make their way through trial and error so expect to feel frustrated. However, it is one of those games that makes you want more; you always come back to it. You start off by dying a lot at the beginning of the fights but you slowly progress to the late stages of the boss. You take a break and then come back because you're just so close to defeating the boss! And once you get it, the cycle starts again.\n\nStory-wise, Furi is about a mysterious man (The Stranger, later Rider) that has been jailed and their mission is to find and kill the jailer. They're the key. As The Stranger walks to the bosses arenas, the player will see vibrant and intriguing surroundings along with someone known as The Voice, who wears a rabbit disguise and acts as the narrator. However, none of these areas are available to interact with. The Stranger only walks forward or backwards, in a linear path.\n\nIt is visually stunning, I love its sci-fi setting and the retro/synth soundtrack is amazing. It really puts you in the mood.\n\nFuri's replayability is high. There are three endings and one secret boss fight. The levels are all replayable, if the player is interested in getting a better score.\n", "timestamp_created": 1652317846, "timestamp_updated": 1652317846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115318250": {"recommendationid": "115318250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212836867", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4496, "last_played": 1694486176}, "language": "english", "review": "Year 4 of waiting for community mod support.", "timestamp_created": 1652305795, "timestamp_updated": 1652305795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115310221": {"recommendationid": "115310221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966717498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1670184787}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game", "timestamp_created": 1652292679, "timestamp_updated": 1652292679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115290373": {"recommendationid": "115290373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161303992", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1652260749}, "language": "english", "review": "Great boss rush!

The difficulty is mostly tuned to perfection (apart from a couple of bosses), like I mentioned, it makes you learn about the game and master the combat to defeat the bosses. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1651916752, "timestamp_updated": 1651916752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115078640": {"recommendationid": "115078640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048429358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1652414900}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is pretty lit yo", "timestamp_created": 1651907670, "timestamp_updated": 1651907670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115068707": {"recommendationid": "115068707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419160701", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1651954705}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10", "timestamp_created": 1651889039, "timestamp_updated": 1651889039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114987066": {"recommendationid": "114987066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057518861", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1635845381}, "language": "english", "review": "Graceful game", "timestamp_created": 1651758526, "timestamp_updated": 1651758526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114979050": {"recommendationid": "114979050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016973148", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1532284575}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome combat and music", "timestamp_created": 1651744722, "timestamp_updated": 1651744722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114968165": {"recommendationid": "114968165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049742928", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1731, "last_played": 1682795324}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, awesome soundtrack.

The gameplay is fluid like water and responsive like lightening, couldn't recommend enough.\n\nI've put 28 Hours into Furi, gotten every achievement, completed the story-mode on Furi and Furier difficulty (both later completed with S ranks). I've gotten an S in the speedrun gamemode, and achieved every ending, including secret ones. To say I put in the effort to get the most out of this game would be a understatement.\n\nAnd after all that, what do I think of the game?\n\n[h1] I Really, Really, REALLY, like, no- LOVE, this game. [/h1]\n\n[SPOILERS AHEAD, KINDA, I RANT ALOT IN THIS BUT THERE ARE STILL A FEW]\n\nI have never replayed a full story based game more than Furi. Putting myself into the shoes of \"The Stranger\" for the fifth time and exacting sweet, sweet revenge towards those who imprisoned me never loses its initial rush. While the story did seem at times bare-bones through my first playthrough, I realized I was too busy trying not to get sliced, shot, burned, punched, or drugged (looking at you \"The Scale\") that the deeper elements of the story breezed past my head. I was too on-edge throughout even the basic difficulty, praying that the next guardian I'd fight wouldn't be worse or as bad as the one I just barely survived getting past; only to be wrong, each, and every time. Thankfully, however, the incredible replayability factor this game has provided no other need for an excuse than to just, hit new game again.\n\nUpon my second and third playthrough, it all started to make a little more sense, bit by bit. (This is speculation from what I gathered) The man who frees you, known simply as \"The Voice\", is a broken man, shrouded in mystery, like the protagonist. The Voice, however, remains on the opposite side of the moral spectrum, for it was The Voice who created the prison you dwell in. Vast, vast planning, years of building, all done by The Voice, in order to keep you locked away, and yet suddenly, you're freed, by him. The Voice dedicated himself to his craft, and as consequence, isolated himself from his daughter, in pursuit of his work. Eventually, he was locked away too, now forever sealed away from her face, her laugh, forever- unless..\nThe dynamic between The Stranger and The Voice is something I haven't seen done in many videogames, in a way you're both the same, you both need to escape, you need eachother, and yet, the toll weighs heavier on The Voice in the grand scheme of things. The Voice uses you as a last ditch effort at freedom, when all is lost, every other planned failed, The Voice reduces all of his life's work to nothing in order to see his daughter. The Voice bets everything on one ideal, that humanity is worth saving. He knowingly sends out the one thing capable of annihilating Earth to obtain freedom, and bets on his ability to convince The Stranger that Mankind is worth saving. I understood all of this by simply playing the game, I've never searched for Lore on a fan wiki site or anything. When paying attention, the game's story really begins to shine in depth, and puts a new spin onto each action and word said by The Voice. Now like I said, the thought process during my first playthrough was only one thing: \"The Jailer is the key, kill him, and you'll be free.\", that's because everything else in my head was screaming at me to dodge, run, dash, shoot, and parry my way to survival, because trust me, this game's gameplay IS NOT EASY BUD.\n\n Of course saying something isn't easy doesn't exclude it from being fun, incredible even. The tight-knit combat of CQC interactions partnered by extravagant bullet hell/laser sections had me yelling in surprise, and  screaming in delight as I laid waste to my foe when delivering a perfect parry or charge slash. Dashing, however, is quite possibly the most intense part of this game, ESPECIALLY ON FURIER. Moments when you must be what feels like mere pixels away, just to barely zip past the object unharmed is satisfying every, single, time. Or when faced with an attack that puts the enemy fully invisible, causing the player to make split second blocks and parries based solely off auditory queues. (Calling out The Burst, huge piece of tresh.) \n\nFuri is one of the best games I've played in a while, and I can safely say will never be forgotten by me.\n\nHere are some words I'd like to say before I wrap this up\n\nTo all those who are still trying to beat The Star on Furier, may God Rest your Soul\n\nThe Scale is the worst boss in the game, he's not constructed bad, he's just [b] The worst boss in the game. [/b]\nThe Edge is my favorite boss, so much in that fight still gives me trouble to this day and I love it.\n\nThat's about it, all in all, I recommend this game :)", "timestamp_created": 1651049436, "timestamp_updated": 1651049852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640173554420471191", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114531508": {"recommendationid": "114531508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250101514", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1656901859}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest experiences I have ever had.

It isn't for everyone, but it certainly is for me.\n\nThe game isn't without a couple of flawed design choices, but it exudes so much love and care and thought that it more than compensates for it's few mistakes. There are so many good ideas here, implemented so very neatly. Notably, lore elements tie into gameplay with a subtlety and cohesion few games achieve, from re-spawning all the way to the order in which the guardians are presented to The Stranger. In the end, [spoiler] you are forced to kill The Beat[/spoiler]. \n\nThe soundtrack is a blast, it has never left me since the first time I played through the game; the character design by Takashi Okazaki is simply stunning, the concept art a true delight to stare at wide-eyed; the dialogue is brief and stimulating, filled to the brim with quotable one-liners; and, for my fellow sweaty weebs out there, the japanese dub is pure ear candy. But what's perhaps most important for a game like Furi, it simply feels [i]good[/i] to be The Stranger. Except for the part where [spoiler]you are forced to kill The Beat[/spoiler]. That aside, the moving, the slashing and the shooting all feel amazing.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Furi is how shockingly replayable it is. If you beat this game once, you [b]must[/b] play through it [b]at least[/b] once again. The second time through, fuck fugg fuck shit peepee & also caca, it feels [i]so good[/i]. It's like that fabled first nut, if the first nut came second. The reason why it's so good and so shocking is that you'll no doubt be overwhelmingly surprised by how much you've learnt and improved from having faced the challenge of beating the game for the first time.\n\nI also love Bernard as a final challenge, I loved the feeling of achievement I got the first time I finally beat him, and I love the requirement of raw skill, not just pattern recognition, to do so. Worth the effort, fellas.\n\nOne of my only complaints (and surely my deepest-felt) about the game is that [spoiler]you are forced to kill The Beat[/spoiler]. Notably fucked up.\n\nNot much more to say for me, I think. Not much said, either. Certainly more of a love letter than anything else. For quality, much less biased reviews of the game, I deeply recommend you watch Joseph Anderson's and Matthewmatosis' reviews on Youtube. \n\n[spoiler]You are forced to kill The Beat[/spoiler].", "timestamp_created": 1649988293, "timestamp_updated": 1649991003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113819016": {"recommendationid": "113819016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060854250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 2380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1418, "last_played": 1675557024}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]We all have choices to make. We all have to decide what's worth fighting for.[/i]\n\nTo say that Furi is one of my favorite games is simply an understatement. It's fully cemented itself in my mind for the past year now, as I've recently come back to beat it the full way through on normal difficulty.\n\nThere really is so many strong suits this game comes on with. A game just about boss fights? Sounds like it'd be pretty hellish and would keep beating you down, but the game finds a way to keep urging you forward to get the next piece of the puzzle, a bit more of the plot.

This is of the last category. The Game Bakers have put one hundred percent into Furi, and its magnificence reflects this. If you have ever touched a combat game, especially of the boss rush variety, you must play this.\nFuri's soul is simple: you are a Stranger, a silent prisoner in a weird scifi jail being held for an unknown crime, and you want to no longer be in jail. Several people object. Armed with a sword, a two-firing-mode gun, body armor, fighting skill, and the wisdom of a mysterious rabbit man - without even SHOES - you must overcome: the jailer is the key; kill him, and you'll be free. Without wading into spoilers, suffice it to say escaping a prison can represent quite a journey. Some of your foes hate you. Some of them will be hated back. The story is sparingly told, with inference and visuals doing a lot of the talking: the Stranger sees a new jailer and instantly shoots him, a jailer completes a personal ritual before facing the prisoner, the rabbitty companion recounts an opponent's crimes in a hiss. Eventually the question goes from \"how do I escape?\" to \"what does my escape mean, exactly?\" What it means, in short, is Something Memorable.\nYour goal: survive a run-on of high tension hack-slash-shoot encounters, HOPEFULLY with a controller on hand. Usually these will have not only multiple stages but multiple phases as well: boss loses the first blue health bar after dodging missiles and trading blows and pistol firing, then a red one pops up underneath and you\u2019re drawn into a close range melee-only affair. Behavioral rules get laid down for the most part in your very first fight - you can parry about half of what gets thrown at you, flailing out of turn will goad the boss into breaking pattern and painfully countering you, green shots yield health when attacked, and so on. When you fall, you\u2019re not dead; each fight gives you several \u201cretry\u201d health bars as well, and passing a stage will refill a retry if one\u2019s used up. Technically, it means that canny gamers can make a few terrible fumbles and still get through a stage on the first shot. This doesn\u2019t convey the speed of the action, though; even the normal difficulty tutorial is something like shootshootgrabfacewhackwhackelectrocutionbigpulsefaildodgedead. It\u2019s punishing and relentless and fun and the sort of challenge that makes you slam the table and snarl \u201cYOU WILL NOT BEAT ME\u201d through your teeth, and when you win against the first foe you\u2019ll feel like ripping your shirt in half with a rebel yell and wrestling a bear into submission. Most enemies have quirks, like arena obstacles or unique responses to certain moves. Every one of them is showy and resilient and is basically an atomic bomb with legs. It\u2019s not terribly easy the first time, and when you unlock Furier difficulty you\u2019ll suddenly realize it\u2019s throwing attack variants and double lasers and why does the Scale\u2019s basic close-range combo now do an area-of-effect discharge? Despite all that, if you\u2019re willing to stick with it, it\u2019s got the primal beat-the-end-boss high essentially constant through the entire game. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s also worth it.\nThe game\u2019s production stands on the peak of Olympus. Visually, it\u2019s a standup showing how to do less with more. Much of the design comes courtesy of Takashi Okazaki, whose art brought us some child-unfriendly-but-tremendously-auteur work. Everything is abstract or simplified in texturing, but from the environments to the characters it\u2019s still got \u201cI recognize that t-shirt\u201d down pat. Old meditation dude with headphones and a modified clock hand greatsword? Check. Weird repetition of U- and equals-shapes across many models\u2019 and locations\u2019 motifs? Check. Vast machines of obvious power and opaque purpose? Check. Man who will beat you to a pulp with an oar? Regrettably, check. This one stands out from the crowd. It\u2019s complimented by a functionally well-designed soundscape. You don\u2019t know what that hat lady does when you meet her, but when you mistime an attack and she counters you\u2019ll recognize that sour nauseous ring immediately. Melee techniques which you can parry to regain health have a weirdly satisfying mechanical wheeee to them, and a metallic rattle precedes the big fanning attacks that you need to entirely avoid. After you get through enough enemy projectiles that can\u2019t be shot down you\u2019ll realize they have a distinct pop when fired. It means you can face a boss the first time and sight-read (hearing-listen?) many behaviors, though dealing with them is trickier. Similarly, the voice acting is above par, though for some it might get a tad distracting after a while; it\u2019s not quite so impressive until you see how many different languages they put together for their roster. Some characters land on bland, but others sell you utterly - \u201cFinally!! \u2026\u2026 Revenge.\u201d says one guy\u2019s words, and the delivery is chilling. If you cut Furi, it will bleed style.\nThe music, now, that\u2019s an echelon above merely \u201coutstanding.\u201d The music\u2019s one for the ages. The developer decided that they wanted to invest in this project, and so they picked up a whole squad of electro-techno geniuses to do the score. Names like Lorn, Scattle, Danger, Carpenter Brut. There are no bad songs in this soundtrack and to be frank the game\u2019s worth buying on the music\u2019s strength alone, and every artist who contributed is worth searching up and giving a listen in their own right. The throb of the beat turns the feel of a loss from frustration to psychotic persistence - because you may have gotten your head handed to you, but listen to that baseline and try to convince yourself to not get up and give it another shot and you will most certainly fail. Full disclosure, the author\u2019s had moderate interest in game soundtracks in the past but Furi lit a fire for looking at them as art in their own right. If you get the game then absolutely grab the tunes as well.\nSome faults. If you look elsewhere you\u2019ll probably hear about how the walking outside of combat is bleh, and yes, that\u2019s somehow so awkward they added an automatic walking feature. It\u2019s\u2026 baffling. The movement and responsiveness and action has an animal joy to it when you\u2019re fighting but if the Stranger walks over an angled curb his whole body tips back like a drinking bird toy. There are also a couple times where the camera is less a help than a hindrance due to the fixed angle; more angles, please! Perhaps the biggest complaint is not a defect, but rather how much is left unsaid by the plot\u2019s reveals. There\u2019s a few thousand tons of interesting backstory that doesn\u2019t get a moment in the spotlight, and though most of the big questions get answered by the final curtain call, it still leaves something to be desired.\nUltimately, Furi is an animal that has been streamlined and crossbred to exactly one purpose, and that is delivering a gameplay experience whose quality makes it one of the author\u2019s favorite games of all time. Your vision gets tinted a little golden when you encounter the good times and upbeat story elements. It gets dashingly dark when you start to see the whole picture and start to fight for something in addition to simple love of the game.

It has a great art style, smooth and satisfying looking animations, an interesting yet mysterious story, and a fantastic soundtrack. The only downside is that a controller is practically required as the keyboard/mouse controls are kind of janky. \n\nOnce you beat the game, you unlock Furier, the harder difficulty. This isn't just a \"you take more damage and deal less damage\" type of thing, everything is the same except for the bosses' moves. For the most part, these bosses are only slightly different in Furier difficulty, but you will soon find that these slight differences make a big change in terms of difficulty. Some are relatively easy to adjust to, others force you to adapt strategies you wouldn't normally use, or hadn't thought of, in the normal difficulty.\n\nAs far as achievements go, I got most of them unintentionally and only had to go out of my way for a few of them, and a handful of them are just hidden cutscenes or different endings, so they're relatively easy to get with a spoiler free achievement guide.\n\nOverall I recommend this to anyone who's searching for a challenge or loves bullet hell, because this game has a lot of that.", "timestamp_created": 1647122926,

beginning with barely any information about what's going on there, changing to a walking simulator afterwards and to another boss with nothing in between, I'd say it's either lack of creativity or time.\n\nThe combat itself is also not intuitive, it's not very clear when the boss can be attacked, has to be parried or dodged and the dodge feels clunky, especially on keyboard probably, with either control mode so it's more about memorizing the boss which means just repeating it or watch someone else do it perfectly and follow his steps, which again is not very fun for me and even with

Strongly recommend to anybody with a controller.\nPROS\n- Banging soundtrack. Carpenter Brut, Scattle and Kn1ght are at the absolute top of their game here. You're Mine is an absolute masterpiece.\n- Great gameplay. Mix of Touhou bullet hell, and hack and slash. Great stuff, goes together suprisingly well.\n- Story is out of the way, but abstract enough to let you think about it.\n- Cheap. \u00a34 on sale. Do it.\n\nCONS\n- Cameras a bit iffy at times, especially if you happen to be at the top of the arenas. Minor issue.\n- Some bosses last phases are pretty wild. Challenging.\n- The game has the No More Heroes structure of a bunch of distinct bossfights, but the down time is spent walking. A little lame, but I get it. Just press A and you automatically walk to the next bossfight.

Yet it's never unfair, wether you win or lose a battle depends entirely on your skill, which the game will make sure you can naturally aquire. Both the bullet hell and the hand to hand combat sections of every boss fight is so carefully and satisfyingly designed that by the end of it you'll become so unstoppable it'll leave you wanting a bigger challenge (of which there'll be plenty to test your strength).\n\nNot only does it have possibly the most addicting combat I've experienced, but it's also full of interesting ideas, amazing and memorable characters both in personality and in design, an intricate story full of twists and thoughtful questions, and that's not even to mention what might legitimately be one of the best videogame OSTs of all time, seriously, some of its songs may actually be more popular than the game itself, they're THAT good.\n\nI've beat this game about 10 times purely because it was fun to, it's the first game i've ever wanted to replay and beat on a higher difficulty and the first game to push me into getting the highest score on the highest difficulty. Perhaps it may be too hard for some people, and that's ok, but if you want a challenge, Furi will give you all the tools you need to overcome yourself. (at a game that is).

The artwork is very stylish and pretty to look at though. The gameplay itself felt like a chore. \n\nThere's little room to improvise strategies and the bosses (assuming this is just a boss rush mixed with bullet hell game) sometimes feel overpowered. Knock the boss down, they get iframes. Attack them as they're charging up an attack? They can dodge and attack you. Didn't get a parry in the fraction of a second? Be ready for your punishment. Had to use a continue? You'll get your full health back...so does the boss and they already had more to begin with. Boss performing super powerful attacks? Can't hit them til they're done. Mind you, this last longer than you would expect. The first boss acts more of a tutorial but plays pretty cool. After that, be ready for long drawn out battles unless you're just really, really good at this game.\n\nThe story could've made the tedious fights worth it but I have no clue what the story is. Maybe if I beat the game I would find out but that's just bad story-telling. The jailer is the key. Kill him and you're free. That's all I know and that's from the store page. Your companion (or jailer for all I know) is telling you some things but it's not cohesive or engaging. People with powers get locked up and something or other. I get that the point of the game is more boss rush than story. So is Cuphead and that game establishes the story early on and sprinkles details as you go along. It still focuses on boss fights but we know why Cuphead and Mugman are collecting deeds for the Devil. Why is this guy trying to get free? Yes, yes, he's locked up in prison but most people want to be free if locked up. What makes his case so special? I don't know. I guess if I finish the game...\n\nThen there is the bloody auto-walk feature! Why does this exist?! Just press a button and the character will mosey on over to the next boss. I'm assuming this acts as a transition scene. You can move the character yourself between boss fights but there is no exploration or npcs. There are no collectibles. There are no alternate paths. The guy just walks in one direction while your companion (?) talks to you. Cutscenes would be much better than having the character move at a snail's pace to the next boss. He doesn't run. Guess he has to save that spectacular energy for a boss fight? Don't know. Not explained in the story.\n\nI know this game got a lot of positive reviews and I might get flack but I don't care. Again, I enjoy games like Cuphead, DMC, Salt & Sanctuary, Celeste and even Ikaruga! I wanted to like this game but I was largely underwhelmed.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1641870805, "timestamp_updated": 1641870805, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441337406635284424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107768504": {"recommendationid": "107768504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191363511", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1667848862}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait, am I the bad guy?", "timestamp_created": 1641869623, "timestamp_updated": 1641869623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107767595": {"recommendationid": "107767595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087548200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 416, "last_played": 1641868160}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played.

Furi is not the organic action game like how some reviewers here make it to be, it is very much a scissors paper stone game. \n\n[b]MECHANICS: 4/10 [/b]\nUnlike DMC or Nier where you can learn and react accordingly or with multiple approach, in Furi when boss throws a rock, you must throw paper. You can't just slash boss when you are near, they will teleport away instantly and have instant block or instant counter, so you must wait till they finish all their special movements and there is a small moment where you can slip in an attack. When they are throwing bullet time at you, it's all dodging till they finish. Unfortunately, the controls are also not sharp, dodging has a very slight delay that makes you miss most dodges, it's just not as instant as Nier or DMC, imagine there's a half sec delay each time you press dodge. So dodging consecutively is impossible here, you either know exactly the pattern when to dodge, or you will get hit when they throw consecutive range attacks. \n\nThey have a parry system, but also unfortunately, there is no cancel input, so if you press parry twice and decide to dodge, you will have to parry twice first. Then, the parry timing is EXTREMELY tight, tighter than Sekiro, but if you miss the timing, you don't go into a block like Sekiro, you get hit instantly. They have a perfect parry, where you parry at the very last second and get a counter, but you won't be able to execute this consistently at all, because it all depends on luck, you only have 0.5 sec to react, whether you get that 0.1 sec it's all luck.\n\nThe 4th samurai boss is a great example of this, it is a forced close combat, where you must parry and CANNOT dodge. You memorize must his parry pattern, or you will never pass this boss ever. The moment your parry finishes, you must immediately press attack, if you accidentally press another parry, you will miss your chance. No button mash, one press for every attack. \n\nSo in reality it doesn't matter how fast you are, it's all about memorization and scissors paper stone. Because no matter how fast you are, when it's time for the boss to attack, you can only dodge/parry.\n\n[b]STORY: 2/10[/b] \nWhile I understand this is low budget game, there is no reason not to put some effort into decent writing. It's basically all nonsensical talk spoken in 10 different ways. After every battle, your companion will talk a bit about the story, but it adds nothing at all, it keeps on saying how you have to escape. Instead of perhaps elaborating the backstory of the next boss you fight, he keeps on spewing the same nonsense over and over again, what a waste of words. \n\nThe way they handle cut-scene is also terrible. They let you press walk in 1 but it's all 1 direction, and you can press 1 button and let him walk automatically, but the camera is static all the way, you really just watch him walk from one end to another in a static camera, this is such a poor cinematography, one of the worst I've ever seen. They spent all this time to build some of the environment aesthetics and they can't even put in the effort to make a moving and slightly more cinematic shots. They could strip away all the walking and just put in camera cuts to let the story play, but they rather let you watch someone walk. \n\nCinematography students would have been given an F for this kind of execution. \n\nSUMMARY: There's a reason this game never took off despite all the good reviews, because it's not good, terrible mechanics, and even worse story. I bought this for about $4 during sale, so I don't feel too bad. But if you have $10 to spare, spend it on Hollow Knight or save it up for DMC 5. \n\n [h1]Additional edits: [/h1]\nDidn't realize there's so many incels defending this game. To potential buyers reading, just look at the most helpful review here by Winter Wombat, in short:\n\n\"It wasn't about thinking on my feet anymore, but memorizing patterns and making zero mistakes. I'd encounter larger and larger stretches were the \"difficulty\" of a stage came from the increasing amounts of time I'd have to go without tripping up.\" \n\nThis is what Furi is about, memorization. Then look at their comments: incels insult him for playing for TOO SHORT, so he must not know anything about the game. Then look again at the comments here, saying i took \"TOO LONG, so I must suck\" even if I beat the game.

The game knows exactly what it wants to be, and a sense of creative commitment shines through \u2014 just what you want from an indie. Despite not being to my usual taste, I was compelled by it and committed to seeing it through to the end.\n\nWell, it ended up taking me much much longer than it was supposed to, and stirred up a lot of frustration and annoyance on the way there. Your mileage will vary with your skill level at this kind of gameplay. On scale of 0 to 10, I think I'm probably about a 4. That apparently put me into an awkward gap between \"clearly need to switch to easy mode,\" and \"able to make steady progress,\" and the game didn't know what to do with me.\n\nWith most of the bosses I did in fact make steady progress, and had a lot of fun. The ones that drove me crazy were the ones with six stages. They demand that you play perfectly through ten minutes (!) of fighting just to earn the right to spend 20 seconds trying to figure out the nasty bullet hell pattern in the final stage. \"Nope, that approach didn't work: play flawlessly for ten more minutes so that you can try something else.\"\n\nMore than once, after sinking hours into some sixth-stage roadblock, I resorted to watching playthrough videos on YouTube, to see if I was being clueless or lacked some kind of essential skill. Nope! I was approaching everything exactly right, and my overall accuracy seemed not much worse than the players in the videos. I was just not QUITE making it... over, and over, and over, and over. \"Git gud,\" I know, I know, but that's exactly what I was doing. Isn't the game supposed to make it rewarding to work on gitting gud?\n\nIt ALMOST does. Furi is really really close to hitting the \"hard game\" sweet spot, of being thrillingly-unforgiving-but-secretly-forgiving. It's intensely demanding, but once you learn its rhythms, the demands turn out to be more than fair \u2014 generous, even. Care has clearly been taken with exactly the issue of frustration balancing. I admired and appreciated that. It's why I kept going back for more, and why I'm giving this a thumbs up and calling it \"satisfying.\" It was. \n\nBut it also wasted a lot of my time and pissed me off. It's both at once.

The campaign consists of walking through a very pretty environment while the rabbit man force feeds you vague exposition, a multi-phased boss fight, then repeat. Do this 9 times and then the credits roll. Then you unlock a speedrun mode that cuts out all the story and a practice mode where you can play specific bosses. [spoiler]There may or may not be an optional 10th boss and hidden 11th boss.[/spoiler] Boss fights are composed of ranged phases, CQC phases, and desperation phases. Ranged phases consist of the boss prancing around their arena while you chase after them to shoot and stab them. In CQC phases your ranged attacks are disabled but the boss is trapped inside your circle of spankings and left to the mercy of your ability to parry. Desperation phases have the boss turn invulnerable and unleash bullet hell only to drop their spaghetti in the end. All the bosses pull from the same bag of tricks but the way they utilize them is pretty varied. There's a hard mode if you enjoy being hurt as much as you enjoy dealing hurt. The soundtrack is dope but I can't speak to the quality of the Steam release since I bought it on Bandcamp. I have no real complaints about the game outside of how the dodge dash can be charged, and thus only activates after you let go of the dodge button instead of immediately when you press it which makes my butt hurt on certain fast boss attacks. Besides that it's pretty solid. 11/10 but not quite a 12.

Usually I\u00b4m a fan of Bullet-Hell elements in games but I really dont like how it got implemented in this game. Fighting with the sword was more fun to me, especially when you switch the combat style to the style where you are closer to the enemy (when the ring around the enemy appears, idk how to explain it). Another thing I didn\u00b4t like, was how the phase of the boss replenishes all of his health when you lose a life, I get that it\u00b4s supposed to be challanging, but at a certain point it just got annoying and frustrating. The last thing I wanted to mention is, that every boss has at least one phase (except for the edge boss fight, i really liked that one) that just doesn\u00b4t feel good to fight against. Especially the final boss since that fight is only shooting and bullet hell (the two things I like about the gameplay the least).\n\nVisuals: I know that it\u00b4s a game from 2016 so I can look over some things, but in some shots in some cutscenes, you can see for example how the sword of the main character goes through his cape. I know that sounds kinda nitpicky but it just kinda ruined it for me. That also isn\u00b4t the only thing that clips through other objects. (other examples are: the hair of the main character and the bridge segments in the 2nd area). Besides that I really don\u00b4t have a problem with the visuals and I actually like the different character designs. Oh, and I liked the cutscenes in the fights, when you parry.\n\nOther things: The one thing I enjoyed 100% was the music. I still listen to the soundtrack on spotify so yea, I really like it. I really liked the voice acting too. \n\nin general: I personally didn\u00b4t enjoy the game, but I can see why the game is so popular as it is. So don\u00b4t take this review like: \"You shouldn\u00b4t play this game at all.\" It\u00b4s just not for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1640780775, "timestamp_updated": 1640780775, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471145480871200562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106807021": {"recommendationid": "106807021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253577678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1680161311}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm shocked more people haven't played this game yet. \nFuri is a short boss rush bullet hell with tons of fun and challenges to keep the player engaged. \nMost of the bosses have fresh new ways to approach them, and you'll never find yourself bored with a fight.", "timestamp_created": 1640764769, "timestamp_updated": 1640764769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106795710": {"recommendationid": "106795710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132019127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1644207675}, "language": "english", "review": "i reccomend snerting a line before playng", "timestamp_created": 1640749476, "timestamp_updated": 1640749476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106755389": {"recommendationid": "106755389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073255057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1499383793}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game, too bad it's short but you could always replay it.

I like to go for exploration challenges and the like, and giving me freedom during those inbetween bits made me think there was something to find. As far as I can tell the only thing that does is waste one's time. If there's a reason to explore I didn't find it. I'd also say the movement speed for these bits is too slow. Finally, during the inbetween moments during the ice level the main character's feet clip through the ground.

The way the game works is so very obviously meant for controller, I dont know why they even offer use of keyboard and mouse for actual gameplay. When I dodge, its literally never in the direction I am going. Ill be moving forwards and when I dodge, I dodge backwards or to the side. Also the parry is just super janky, but I dont know if its just the game, me, or keyboard lol. \n\nI forgot to add, but the game doesnt allow you to change the controls for parry/dodge or anything else to keys such as ctrl or left or right shift, at least not for me. I dont know why, but it wouldve helped a lot seeing some people use shift/ctrl for dodge or block/parry.\n\nSadly the way it works for dodging it applies to the sword attacks too. Ill run towards the enemy and click attack, and the character will just suddenly do a 180 and attack to the side and then the boss just hits me instead. It feels so incredibly uncomftrable. I am stuck on the weird boss of the lady with the halo and wings, and the level is like this floating island, with an inner floating island and outer floating island. She has an aoe attack that covers the whole inner island, and its obvious you need to dodge across the gap to the outer island, but when i try to, my character just dodges backwards farther into the inner island, and the attack is literally impossible to dodge lmfao.\n\nObviously this is just unlucky for me seeing I cant use controller, and I am not going to give the game a bad review because of it, I just wanted to point it out for anyone else who might be in a similar situation to me. \n\nThe game itself though is amazing. The music, the style, the bosses. I really do love it.I got it because of the ost, and I still continue to play it despite the janky keyboard controls because of the music. I might pull out my old controller and compression gloves and try to give it a go.

The characters in this game are quite mystical and not much is known about them, but i think this work in the games favour as it allows the player to come up with their own ideas as to who these individuals are and what their past may have entailed. I really love the Voice as he gives you snippets of information regarding your goal and his as well as giving you vague information of the enemies that you will encounter  and speaking in somewhat of a riddle form from time to time. The story itself is simple enough, but is great in the fact that it both moves the game along pretty well and gives some room for the player to interpret the events that happen in the game. \nThe settings that you come across are incredible as each section takes place in some ethereal land and holds a lot of mystery in itself, while also adds to the enemies themselves as an extension of their character. From a swamp ridden abandoned city, to the open, vibrant landscapes, this game gives a lot of variety for the player to look at and also keeps things consistently fresh instead of have a stale setting that could dull the experience. \nVisually, its quite impressive. One thing i really want to highlight is the design of the characters themselves as they all look gorgeous and intriguing in their own way. Not once did i think that they ever looked boring or weren't that nice to look at. In fact i love how they all have a distinct style to them that matches the environments that they reside in. Graphically, its pretty good as while it may not be the most realistic visuals that i have seen, the art style manages to carry the whole look of it making it somewhat ageless and could still rival games of today with its own unique look. \nThe Sound and Audio are fantastic with the soundtrack feeling like an electronic odyssey that in itself carries its own mysterious vibe which integrates well with each segment of the game. The audio is very satisfying as each swing of a blade, shot from a gun or attack of an enemy attack just fits perfectly which the overall theme of the game. \nIn terms of Gameplay, its both challenging and satisfying to play. The main thing you will be doing in this game is fighting bosses which removes any filler that the game could have had if it were laced with standard enemies and makes it more of a consistent experience. You have loads of moves in this game such as as swinging your katana, shooting your pistol with either weak or strong attacks, a dash mechanic (which you will be using a lot) and a parry which both heals you and deflects enemy attacks. While it may seem like there isn't a lot of moves to perform, the game balances this out with the enemies and their attacks as each one has their own approach as to defeating it and prevents the game from being repetitive. One thing i really like is how some of the projectiles that the enemies fire have their own unique way to counter them. Some you can shoot to get rid of them, some you can parry, some where you simply just have to dodge them and some where if you shoot them, can grant you health. I really like how the fazes of the enemies really do both differ from the last but doesn't stride away from their main way of combat which is nice. The final thing i would like to mention is the healing as if you being a faze of an enemy, if you are missing a life it can grant you another after beating one of its waves which is really good. Not only that, it fully heals you after a section which i think is really fair. \nOverall, Furi is a amazing, consistent action, bullet hell game and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a futuristic challenge or a world that holds many secrets within itself.", "timestamp_created": 1640271051, "timestamp_updated": 1640343727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106322461": {"recommendationid": "106322461", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972720093", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1567, "last_played": 1693792073}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful hidden gems in gaming.

Attacking, shooting, dodging, blocking, parrying - every aspect is well thought out and works together beatifully. Sure you don't have crazy combos, but every tool you have is designed in a clever and meaningful way. For instance, you can finish your combo and knock down an enemy only if you perfectly beat an enemy attack. If you hesitated, or made a mistake, you won't be given an opportunity to do a full combo and a boss will start evading and blocking your last attacks. Then as a reward you have enough time to charge your next attack. Brilliant. Then bosses have parries so you can't always rely on memorization even in most straight-forward attack sequences. Another brilliant mechanic.\n\nDevelopers mention DMC and Platinum titles in the credits and while I love games like Devil may cry or Metal Gear Rising, or Nioh, etc - all of those are great games - among my favorites, but in my opinion the student has long surpassed the teacher, and those games lack some things here or there compared to Furi. Not enough stress on positioning (those games are mostly about timings, Nioh (2) being most position heavy among such games), or some mechanics or design philosophies in those game break the tension of combat, like how in DMC being in air is so safe, you tempt to never use aerial moves at all. Or absence of a real INTENSE challenge on higher levels (increasing hp of enemies so they become walking tanks cerainly ups the difficulty, but it's not the difficulty I'm looking for). Or not realized enough core combat, making a game too difficult and not difficult enought at the same tine.\n\nFuri makes this right. It focuses on INTENSITY of the combat (this is where Furier difficulty shines becoming the epitome of combat intensity) rather than just upping bosses' hp and damage, playing around it's core combat to extreme. And at the same time it stays really forgiving - developers could easily strip you from the ability to regain life after you complete a phase, but they didn't. They didn't take away your heal through block either. Unlike games like Nioh that like to throw oneshots at you, punishing you for every little mistake you make, Furi gives you a lot of space to make mistakes while staying extremely difficult. This is really brilliant design. \nSpeaking of intensity, attack and projectile patterns are so inventive (and they become even more elaborate on Furier difficulty) that they create level design by themselves. Each attack shifts arena so much that you forget that you sometimes fight on a round arena.\nI don't like bullet hell in many other games where you just need to hover through horde of small projectiles. In Furi each projectile type requires different answer and when combined they always keep you on your toes, constantly making your switch between tasks in your head. This is where dash mechanic comes in with a lot of depth and decision making behind it. It's always thrilling when you stop amongst the chaos on the screen charging your dash to fly through the broadest wave sent at you.  \n\nLastly I want to mention the presentation and that a lot of moments are truly enhanced through the right choice music as well as voice acting giving us really memorable moments and experience in general.\n12/10", "timestamp_created": 1638677457, "timestamp_updated": 1638678680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105259405": {"recommendationid": "105259405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301788643", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1640156704}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellence is not an art, it's pure habit.

It introduces the basics to you, such as what buttons to press and when to perform them. What it doesn't teach you outright, you get to learn the good ol' fashioned way: experience. Certain bosses present a spectacularly harder difficulty than others, and yet, not so difficult that you can't complete them after 5-10 minutes of failure (at least Furi mode). This game doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to bullet hell segments. While they might not be particularly long, about every other boss has a section with it towards the end. Even then, it's on the simpler side of bullet hell, so it is not exactly infuriating. What was initially infuriating were the \"walking-simulator\" sections that most poor reviews attack. While the sections are unskippable and some are rather long, I enjoyed the narrator's lines enough that I quickly forgot I was even in these sections. I learned to embrace them instead of hate them, as I got to see the graphics that were designed for the game as well. As I will touch on later, the dialogue even offered a new perspective upon the second reading. At my third time through the story to grab another achievement, I did get a little bored watching them, however. If they were skippable, I would rate gameplay at 10/10.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nFor an indie game, I believe that the graphics were done quite well. At first, the blocky edges were a bit hard to look past, but after playing the game for a couple hours, it's an acquired taste. The colors pop brilliantly, unfortunately a bit too brilliantly at times, as I felt a bit of discomfort in my eyesight during a couple sections of bullet hell.\n\nStory: 8/10\nDang, did not expect this kind of story from a bosh rush game. As to not leave spoilers, I will say that it is simple yet refined. For those that have played the game or are looking to purchase it, please play the storyline through again, even if just in Furi mode again. The narrator throughout the story makes several remarks that hint to a greater story underneath, and it adds complexity to each of the characters presented. There are even 2 endings as well as a secret ending sprinkled within the story. While some basic tropes were present, they were important nonetheless.\n\nSound Design:\nI had to give this it's own category. The voiced dialogue of characters [English] was phenomenal, the lines were delivered excellently and it really made me invested in some of the characters. Not only that, the sound design within combat is great too. Sword slashing sounds right, lasers sound simple like they should be, nothing ever felt out of place. 9/10\n\nOverall:\nThe achievements were fun to collect as well, really brought out the more minute details within the game. Props to the devs for creating a great game, I could easily sink WAY more hours into it to complete the last two achievements, but I'm gonna take a break for now. I attempted Furier mode and got rather frustrated with my failings on the *first* boss. I was rather impressed with how much more difficult Furier mode was, I'll have to return to it another day. Getting this off my chest: this game definitely does not deserve an M rating. While there is combat and one particular cutscene within combat that's pretty gruesome (The Scale's fight where he impales you), it's no worse than the likes of movies like Black Panther (yet it is only rated PG-13). As for language, there's one instance of the F word but that's kind of hard to avoid anywhere on the internet these days. I suppose if you fail the fight, you would hear it again, or if you quit to the menu it would also present that dialogue yet again, but that particular fight was rather simple and I only heard it used once. I think the Teen rating would fit it better in today's circumstances.\n", "timestamp_created": 1638409639, "timestamp_updated": 1638409639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583314895629882813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105041265": {"recommendationid": "105041265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962817610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1662509833}, "language": "english", "review": "When i first got furi i expected it to just be a fast paced action game with cool bosses, and it is that.

The figurative bullets come out quick, but so is your character, and the game color codes each of them so you have an advantage through that familiarity.\n\nWhat did draw me to the game was the idea that this game looked like a satisfyingly, stylistic challenge, of which I am drawn to in gaming; deriving satisfaction from souls, and souls-likes, and that inspiring urge to rise to them. Furi effectively being a boss rush meant that I felt that particular sense of fun would be there and wasn't too disappointed in that regard.\n\nAll in all the game is fast-paced and requires some quick timing and reflexes to overcome, and I think most of the time a player is able to adjust to the pace of a game when it's consistent, but if you feel like you've struggled to adapt to a faster-pace in the past, the game may not be your speed, literally and figuratively lol.\n\nWhat was more of a surprise was Furi's story. I never really thought much about it having one in all the time I'd peeked at it from the corner of my eye, but reading some of the steam reviews just before my purchase confirmed it did have one; seemed like it was well-liked, but no one gave any specifics, so I figured I'd shed a little more light on it without revealing spoilers, because it did more for my enjoyment of the game than what I expected, and might also encourage someone else who enjoys that side to play it as well.\n\nFirst and foremost this game's story is simple and subtle in its delivery, pretty much all of what you discover about it is through the snippets of dialogue from the game's characters, and lightly sprinkled in the environments you're auto-walking through between each boss fight. Overall pretty standard for a game with its core being combat, but the interesting part is the mystery surrounding your silent character; how he ended up where you start the game and why all of the other characters you encounter interact with you the way they do as move forward. \n\nMy expectation was that the bosses were going to be fun to fight and look at while doing so, but didn't realize they'd go beyond that, which they do; now again, the game moves quickly for the most part and these interactions do as well, but most do well to add to the airs of intrigue and mystery about you and them, as they think and feel a bit more than you might've anticipated for AI bosses in that slash, slash, pew, pew game you bought lol.\n\nThe big reveal and answers to some of the glaring questions happens specifically AFTER the credits, so be sure to stick around til' then, but again the same applies as before, it isn't some brilliant sight of all these puzzle pieces clicking together, the revelation comes quickly and is easily understood, but it does well to satisfy the reflection of why it all happened the way it did, and could inspire another playthrough with that newfound understanding. Also helped by three different endings to witness if you're willing. There may be the unanswered question or two if you get to thinking about the details too long, but I didn't feel myself frustrated by that, as I always had an imagined one myself to put in place of those holes I found, and gratified that I had the option to do so when my ideas worked. \n\nI've had this game on my radar for years, always giving it another glance when I saw it on sale for cheap, but felt I knew what to expect and understood that it ended quickly so I left it lying, and much to my regret; this game is equal parts satisfying slash simulator as it is thought provoking and artistically delivered. The play time is my biggest quandary with this one, if money isn't an issue I think that this game is worth the asking price of $20 (at the time of this review,) but as someone who doesn't always have it to throw atcha' consoles and knows the consumer's condition it may be better to wait for the sale even if the devs deserve a little more for it. \n\n[spoiler] \"A prison within a prison.

There's only challenge here - nothing else to keep you going. You gotta love that and be in the game for that. The game is tough and you will curse.

It is a rare instance of a game being good/tight enough to validate you REALLY engaging with it. There are a lot of small optimizations that allow you to be just a LITTLE bit more aggressive and take just a LITTLE bit less hits. Mastering all of this turned out to be a huge fun. I should mention that after all this, I have so far concentrated on speedrunnning Furi-difficulty but not even beaten Furier-difficulty, yet.\nThe point of this edit is - this game turned out to have huge replay value for me, offering both a massive quality and quantity of gametime. If you think you might find fun in really studying a game like this and mastering its mechanics, then I revise my \"BARELY-recommended\" to a wholehearted one!\nGame devs - I salute you for an

I decided to try it out and had read some very mixed reviews about it but player hype gave me the impression stuff was exaggerated on all accounts, especially with the very positive score. Thus I finally tried it out and... I was completely disappointed.\n\nThe art is good, if not for some caveats with the quality of some of the art. The music is acceptable. The rest is... very mixed to bad. In fact, it was so outrageously bad, with some caveats, that I actually did not get far into the game before quitting and writing this review and I will try to be unbiased in my presentation because in most circumstances a very incomplete review can be unreliable and often biased.\n\nThe dialogue, and what I was seeing of the story, is bad. In fact, it is so bad it almost warrants being illegal and its own meme for bad, and then furi bad. Surely I'm exaggerating right? YouTube it if you don't believe me. Even worse, the game's boss fights are split up in such a way that you are forced to deal with it as only a few tiny segments can be skipped while the rest you must hunch back old man style slow walk as the awful dialogue spews out, with the horrible camera angles, and uneventful snorefest commencing.\n\nThen you have the combat... This could absolutely change later on so keep a reserved opinion about it but from what I've tried the game is not at all \"difficult\" and, in fact, calling it difficult because of actual designed difficulty would be an insult to the concept of difficult games. Keep in mind this is on the default Furi (normal) difficulty because, for some reason, the game locks Furier out until you beat this bland game at least once. Counters and boss patterns are incredibly forgiving. In fact, 90% of the combat is just knowing the boss patterns (which explains why they supposedly change it up some on Furier to give new patterns and why it seems the consensus is that, from what I've read, furier isn't much harder just new patterns...).\n\nThe game throws out some artificial difficulty by things like... The patterns change and the boss will simply enter an invulnerable (yellow) state and then jump off screen and then moments later teleport on top of you in a cutscene style pounce animation where she then hits you for multiple hits to your health bar. There is no visual cue playing out after she vanishes. This isn't clever design. You simply are almost guaranteed to eat the hit and then you have to \"guess\" and \"test\" at a possible risk of being hit again, or dying, and guess correctly with half random timing. Ta-da! You found out if you wait an estimated 0.5s and press dodge you dodge the ability! You likely took damage during this process at some point learning this pattern! This is just poor design. Fortunately, at least in Furi difficulty the game is very lenient on health, even ignoring the ability to heal in right conditions, and it even heals you up after beating a phase of the boss (one of its life bars, I think you have some as well under your own it looks like but never confirmed). Still this is not good design and if it happened during the end of a life you would simply die to it and along with other stuff it can add up. The physics detection is very bad with dash which causes another artificial difficulty increase. I don't have an issue with the delay like some, nor am I making a mistake and getting hit by bad dashing. The dash, in fact, is definitely taking hits at times when you've cleanly dodged and it is very visible because your body isn't anywhere near it especially if you record and slow down and watch the non-existent contact. In addition, it should grant invincibility frames during the dash but it definitely does not to certain attacks which can, I found in testing, consistently hit you even with very long range dashes vastly overstepping their collision area but the game tells you otherwise and there is no way to know what can be dashed and what cannot without trial and error similar to the prior complaint, free dmg potentially being built up and thus purely about patterns and information of quirks... The parry, at least on Furi, is cool and very forgiving with a noticeable delay and white glow when it is something that can be parried but, again, a boss might have a phase where it does 3 hits and then suddenly it will do 3 plus a very fast 4th hit in its pattern. This isn't a pattern mix-up but simply it shifts to the 4 hit pattern and exclusively uses it from then on but nothing visibly obvious like a phase shift leads into this change so it is... once again a really odd free source of dmg from the boss.\n\nThere are other sources of frustration with the mechanics that just make it less fun and more ideal to play in safer manners. The Strike charge is rarely worth the effort in normal movement phases, and often in restricted still feels like a gross waste (especially since normal attack combos are so effective there anyways) due to the boss often breaking it with a teleport or gaining instant invulnerability because it is pissed you took the effort to make this strike charge and found an opening to land it on them. The AI, quite literally, cheats to avoid it making it often not very effective in my testing compared to normal combos. There are odd cases in the melee restricted phase of the fight where the enemy uses its 4 hit combo pattern but then will stop after 1-2 hits randomly like it had an actual brain freeze and just stand there which is extremely jarring and lets you get free hits on it, though it often then breaks out of your combo (which is also jarring) in anywhere from 1-4 hits (even if you land all 4 hits for dmg it often will not take the mechanic knock down that is stated to apply and simply teleport...).\n\nThe first boss was easy enough, but the second boss was really bizarre. Due to its art design I initially thought it was a random turret type mob and not a boss and was very confused until I confirmed its health bar and then it changed patterns after losing its first life. It was excessively weak until its final life at which point it was still absurdly weak but some of the physics collision issues with dash came into play which was a bit annoying but not a big deal. The fight felt very wasteful. I also noticed a significant issue with the melee in the game which is that it randomly whiffs the air which caused some phases to take a tad longer than should. It seems like it typically tries to somewhat intelligently melee at the boss when you are near but there are times it forcibly melees at an odd angle going past them and no matter how you try it can take several random angle whiffs before it starts going back on the boss. This was very bizarre and outright annoying.\n\nThe final phase of the boss is just you dodging until its pattern ends (you aren't allowed to hit it due to permanent invulnerability) and then after its pattern is survived you hit it once for a cutscene and win which is very anti-climatic tbh. It is basically the game's final rush attempt to make you auto lose with a large scale frenzy spam of insane attacks, that are more intimidating than bite. This occurred on each boss I tried and was lackluster finale.\n\nThe game isn't something I'm going to say is outright terrible, but it isn't something I can readily recommend to others, either. I would prefer a neutral rating than a no but Steam does not allow this and I do not feel it warrants a yes without being informed for the average consumer.\n\nWhat I came in expected was a boss rush type of experience with a it of dialogue in between. What I got was excruciatingly horrible between battle cutscenes/story and slow walking that took way the heck longer than I was okay with (and I love Metal Gear Solid and Xenosaga scenes, but at least they aren't awful) and then battles that were often very bland, well overstaying their welcome as they have like 12 phases", "timestamp_created": 1635715925, "timestamp_updated": 1635715925, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.348745048046112061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101981951": {"recommendationid": "101981951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347318126", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1654394428}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me gusto el juego", "timestamp_created": 1635705676, "timestamp_updated": 1635705676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101968900": {"recommendationid": "101968900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321434099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1635693052}, "language": "english", "review": "Clunky mechanics, extremely incoherent combat system that does not feel rewarding at all, the default buttons make little sense/make poor use of a controller layout, and in case you were hoping for a good story line or something to fall back on - there isn't one. \n\nit's like a weird mash of rhythm game and fighting game, in that there is fighting - but the game wants you do handle each of these fights in a very specific way which is not rewarding.

This game was made by people who actually cares about their product and community, and even after 5 (five) whole years it still holds up to be one of, if not the best indie game out there.\n\nFirst and foremost. Its gameplay. Unlike any other fancy stuff you see out there, it's plain simple. And that's the best part - YOU do your fancy shit with the game's relatively simple gameplay. And it's satisfying to beat the goddamn hell out of your enemy. And speaking of them - you only fight bosses. How many are there? I won't spoil. But for each and every single one of them, excluding DLC, will give you a complete workout, and it's a lots of fun. And it's pretty clear that they weren't just normal everyday bosses you fight, each of them has their own uniqueness, and combine that with speedrunning, will requires the best of your skill to defeat all of them within the designated time limit you set for speedrunning. This game has a built-in speedrunning mode, so you can become a real Furi professional\u2122\u2122\u2122\u2122 player, and flex on your poor friends who thinks they can get away with everything by holding a single button or spamming a single button for several thousand times.\n\nFor story, oh yeah this game has a story, albeit it's told through another person, not you. You are not the narrator. The game is your narrator so you can focus on the world around you, the inhabitants, to figure out what the hell happened. It's simple, but very enjoyable. And if you can't figure out the story... eh I think you can still do fine. The main focus is on characters, gameplay, and music afterall. \n\nSpeaking of music, did you know that this game has a walking section, for both narration purpose, and for taking a break from beating the crap out of the bosses? Normally I'd be discarding every single forced walking section ever created by man, but holy shit, they know how to make it. They're made to make the atmosphere changes depends on the next boss you will encounter, and combine that with the narration, it truly one of the best part in the game despite being a forced walking segment. The game's short, hey, so give it a break.\n\n\n\nFinally we talk about other stuff like graphics and controls. Graphics is of course, alright, during that time. But the way they make lighting, environment, makes it looks more beautiful than normal. And they literally showed it off right at the beginning of the game, the first boss. Controls are fine, of course relatively simple as the gameplay goes, and I've beaten the game on mouse/keyboard just fine. Controllers are ok, but I prefer mouse/keyboard and I had no problem with it besides the cancerous keybind for the charge shot.\n\n\nOverall, BUY THE GAME. How the hell can you NOT buy the game after a bunch of words I spitted out for you to inspect? The game is AWESOME. GO. BUY. IT. \n\n\"On a scale of 1-10, the game's 11, and I'd give it a 12.\"", "timestamp_created": 1635131890, "timestamp_updated": 1635131890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824334979057312012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101541502": {"recommendationid": "101541502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111145709", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 819, "last_played": 1636495061}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fun.

Some sections of the game really push the limits when it comes to tight-space manoeuvring; requiring you to dash through multiple projectiles and even parry some of them.\n\nWith that being said, I loved it. Yes, it's frustrating at times but the game doesn't punish you too harshly and really, aside from combat there isn't a single thing you can do in this game, so gitting gud is extremely satisfying since you can feel your skills getting better in every minute of the game.\n\nThe only complaint might be about how they managed some of the difficulty spikes between some phases of a couple of the bosses but I'm okay with that since every fight feels different and requires you to be equally focused. \nMy last praise for the gameplay will be about controls, they are extremely snappy, responsive and accurate. Considering how much trouble would a single miscalculation or bad design about controls cause, this game frankly has no issues on that part.\n\nWell, without a solid purpose none of those elements would matter, and I think this is a good point to mention the story. In Furi, we're basically fighting our way out from prison with a bunny-masked man guiding us. I don't want to spoil anything but I found the story powerful in a way that cause me to wonder about my character and our guide as I progress.\nThe presentation is also very Shadow of the Colossus, since the game consists only of boss fights, our character basically just walks from one boss to another and these walks are really a beauty to look at with gorgeous synth music in the background. \n\nThis game has a distinct \"character\" which I think is the most important thing about an art piece, especially considering that we live in an age where hundreds of 'stuff' getting published every day. Standing out as a memorable experience is getting harder each day but I think Furi is a very memorable and beautiful experience that everyone should give a try.\n\nside note: Character designs are made by Takashi Okazaki.

The game is essentially a boss rush with a walking simulator in between fights. \n\nThe boss fights themselves are incredible, each having its own twist on the formula to help keep you on your toes. The gameplay is a mix between bullet hell and close quarters combat. The structure of each fight along with the health regen helps make the fight feel like it has rounds to it. \n\nThe story is cryptic and will be drip fed to you in between each fight. Its mysterious nature helped keep me invested in it and made me want to finish each fight just to find out more. It also has multiple endings which I found to be a nice treat.\n\nThe music, besides the gameplay, is one of the best things about this game. Each track ebbs and flows with the fight to really get you pumped up.\n\nMy only real complaint is that there isn't a fight with a certain major character in the game, but I can see why there isn't for story purposes. The game is kind of short and really can be finished in under 10 hours, so I would recommend getting it on sale if you can.

I would call it, with some exceptions (like the dodge mechanic, the weird counter timing or the seemingly malevolent fixed camera), rather good overall. The melee combat, while certainly not close to the best I've seen, feels quite satisfying and the twin-stick shooter sections are pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Unfortunately, Furi also does what I think is the worst thing a game can possibly do - it wastes your time. If you don't mind that - and that's a big \"if\" - I'd say give it a try, but I'm about to go into why I don't think this game really deserves it.\n\nFuri is structured as a series of duels with a number of bosses. Each boss is divided into multiple stages which usually alternate between bullet hell sections and melee fights (the later duels have far less focus on melee combat, sometimes dropping it almost entirely). Between the fights, you walk [i]very[/i] slowly through what amounts to unskippable cutscenes as the narrator bombards you with what little story the game has to offer (curiously, there are also real cutscenes that [i]are[/i] skippable). And here is the game's real problem: [u]you only get checkpoints between fights[/u]. In other words, if you die at any point throughout a fight, be prepared to replay up to, say, about 15 minutes of gameplay. And since this is a game mostly about pattern memorisation (which is to be expected from a melee/bullet hell hybrid) with unforgiving difficulty (in later fights, some enemy attacks are literal one-hit-kills), unless you are a true expert at this kind of gameplay already, you [i]are[/i] going to be replaying huge chunks of Furi. Get ready to see the same animations, hear the same handful of voicelines, repeat the same patterns of attacks potentially dozens of times.\n\nIn essence, I think Furi would be a perfectly worthwhile game if it didn't have its difficulty artificially skyrocketed by an unreasonable distribution of checkpoints. I do think, however, that it is quite easy to guess why this decision was made - [u]there is very little game in this game[/u]. A walkthrough on YouTube puts Furi's real length at about 2 hours - and that's [i]including[/i] all the long sections where nothing happens and you can just press a key to have the game play itself. So I think it's not unreasonable to assume that rather than being a legitimate gameplay-driven decision, the cruel save system was implemented to pad the game's laughable playtime as much as possible. And don't think Furi plays fair, either - the final sections of most boss fights seem specifically designed to kill you unless you've already played them and things like being respawned in the middle of an enemy attack or having to hide behind off-screen cover that might not even be there at the time are not uncommon. The earlier fights also use QTEs that are both extremely tedious and sometimes seemingly random in their outcome.\n\nAnd while this is relatively unimportant, I'd also like to point out that on a technical level, Furi is rather subpar. While the overall look of the game may be appealing depending on personal preferences, I found it very distracting how models perpetually clip through themselves and everything is bathed in a terrible blurry haze that cannot be disabled, as far as I can tell. The game is also incredibly adamant that you should play it with a gamepad, but that's actually not that much of an issue - in case you do want to play it with a keyboard and mouse (which may very well be preferable for the shooting mechanics), the only problem you'll face is that you can only move in 8 directions due to the fixed camera, so the dodging will feel even more awkward.\n\nIn summary, Furi would be a fine - perhaps even genuinely good - game in my eyes if it didn't go out of its way, more than any other game I have ever played, to waste my time. If you're the type of person who enjoys playing the same thing over and over again, you may very well enjoy your time with Furi as well - but despite having completed several difficult games (including ones that do require countless repeated attempts, llike TrackMania titles), I gave up on Furi towards the end, since I came to the conclusion that this game simply doesn't have anything in it to justify putting so much effort into beating it, especially when it seems so determined to waste as much of my time as possible. One last thing I should mention is that there is, in fact, an easy mode - which I admittedly haven't tried - designed to let players experience the story without the fights presenting a challenge. However, I am absolutely convinced that the game's 2-hour-long story, which I found to be rather unengaging and delivered in a remarkably mundane manner, does not justify purchasing Furi just to experience its narrative.", "timestamp_created": 1630868467, "timestamp_updated": 1630880939, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522271633148193359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98838736": {"recommendationid": "98838736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047130087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1630858876}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has the usual Dark Souls issue of what is happening on the screen not really correlating with what damage will be done to or by you.

To elaborate on what the game has to offer:\n\n[*] An eye-catching, neon aesthetic that oozes sci-fi vibes despite being relatively minimalistic.\n[*] The soundtrack, courtesy of several very talented artists who worked together to bring an insanely good score that oozes with futuristic energy. It really has to be heard to be believed, but it's both incredibly memorable and always evocative of the challenge the game is currently throwing at you.\n[*] Since the boss fights are basically the only thing in the game, they had to go all-out for them - and they delivered. Each fight is stunningly well done, full of character matching your opponent, and strikes a very thin line between very difficult and very fair. The bosses have loads of health and relentless attacks which seamlessly integrate both bullet-hell and close-quarters combat, but rarely punish you to such an extent that making mistakes is fatal, as long as you can learn from them - omnipresent telegraphs and predictable attack patterns help with this. In addition, the fights are pretty generous - not only do you get multiple lives per fight (which only restart you at the start of the phase unless you lose all 3, and recover one life every time you beat a phase), you can parry or shoot down most bullets, and you can also heal by parrying melee blows or shooting down certain attacks.\n[*] On that topic, the combat system is insanely satisfying. The combination of ranged shoot-em-up bullet hell segments, fast-paced melee combat, and an extremely agile character is masterfully done (especially with your combat tools, which can be exploited to ridiculous degrees if you take the time to learn them), and the game makes it very clear early on that this isn't a game where you can spam everything to death. You can punish a boss' openings just as easily as they can punish you if you get too overzealous, making for combat that manages to be frantic yet calculated, lightning-fast yet methodical.\n[*] Each boss has their own unique design and distinct personalities, and considering how little you see of each of them, the amount of characterization the game gives you for each is impressive.\n[*] The story is very short and very open-ended, but still more than meaningful enough for one to stay invested, which is pretty impressive considering it's almost all exposition.\n\nIt does, however, admittedly have a few shortcomings:\n\n[*] Dodge and parry timing in this game is a little unintuitive, as in dashing happens after you release the button instead of when you tap it, and parrying has a noticeable delay. While I got used to it pretty easily, it can take some time and trouble getting used to it, especially if you've played other games without said quirks. The fact that I played the game on keyboard instead of the recommended controller might have had something to do with it.\n[*] For some reason, the walking segments in between battles - basically glorified cutscenes - can't be skipped. They're very memorable the first time you do them, but can prove to be infuriatingly long on repeat runs. To add insult to injury, the regular cutscenes are skippable.\n\nAll in all, though, this is a must-play for players who want a sci-fi, adrenaline-riddled combat gauntlet with a side of good game design and absolutely banging music.", "timestamp_created": 1629327328, "timestamp_updated": 1629327328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97814111": {"recommendationid": "97814111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094371842", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1663274109}, "language": "english", "review": "engineer", "timestamp_created": 1629309670, "timestamp_updated": 1629309670, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.313516557216644287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97787104": {"recommendationid": "97787104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304370154", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1653363304}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1629275281, "timestamp_updated": 1629275281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479797959327697754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97782726": {"recommendationid": "97782726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388973421", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1628828583}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, just wish there was a way to skip the walking sequences.
