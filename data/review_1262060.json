Well, look no further, because Battle Ram has quickly become my go-to game for thrilling battles and strategic victories. Let me tell you why I can't get enough of it!\n\nFirst and foremost, the graphics in Battle Ram are absolutely stunning. The attention to detail in the character design, landscapes, and battle sequences is truly commendable. Every swing of my sword, every thunderous roar of my army charging into battle, is brought to life with incredible visual effects. It's an immersive experience that truly makes me feel like I'm commanding a legendary army.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay itself. Battle Ram's mechanics are easy to grasp, yet challenging enough to keep me engaged for hours on end. The combat system is well-balanced, offering a wide range of strategies to master.

Games like these live or die by their central mechanic, since that's what they are all about, and I found that to be tedious in this game.

You often had to ram into enemy types later on upwards of 10-20 times, so it became monotonous for me. Timing attacks with no wind-up also means you kinda just end up clicking enemies a safe number of times, and then move away, move in a circle, rinse and repeat. Also, enemy variety seems to center around the same enemies but more bullets and much more spongy.\n\nA game like Hayai is far superior imo, which boasts a nuanced and yet similarly simple system.

Let's just make a list:\n\n1) All of the enemies' shots end in an explosion with ENORMOUS and unreasonable splash damage\n2) You have no idea where the shots are going to stop\n3) There is no cue (visual or audio) as to when enemies are going to fire...you just have to time it in your head\n4) All of the graphics are large, and when things get busy, there's literally no room to move\n5) You're trapped in a sumo-like ring, and if you go outside of it, you die\n6) The enemies are not limited by the ring, and you can't kill them by bumping them outside of it (note: this would have actually been fun gameplay)\n7) Literally everything one-shot kills you, while you have to hit everything else many, many times (all while dodging the no-warning shots and all of the splash damage)\n8) Movement is done 100% by mouse twitch, and you'll either be moving too slowly to get away from stuff or go flying outside of the ring because you attempted to dodge quickly\n9) Horizontal \"ram\" attempts will miss at least 50% of the time because of the way hit boxes are designed (and they strongly favor your opponents, who do not share the challenge due to the splashy weapons), so you'll spend your time constantly trying to line up enemies vertically to hit them rather than just go rushing past them (and probably out of the stupid ring)\n\nAny one or two of these factors on their own, alongside more interesting gameplay, would have potentially been ok. Lots of splash damage from shots landing everywhere? At least give me the whole screen (like the enemies have) so that it truly can be a dodge-em game and I can run until I have an opening for an attack. Want to have a ring of death? Cool! Let me fight enemies that I can also bump out of the ring! You really, really want the ring of death plus splashy weapons?

Even if I still am, it's not hard to see some of the issues with the game. First off, the ram isn't your mouse, it merely follows it. So at all times, you are effectively controlling the right-most side of the character, and of course, the rest of the hit box is on the rest of the character. In a bullet hell game with dodging as a primary mechanic, I don't think the player should have such little control over the positioning of the character. In a game about precision, your Ram also dashes further than where you clicked, so you have no real way to know where it'll end up, including out of bounds or into a bullet. The next big thing is the later levels. Instead of making the game genuinely difficult as you progress, it just swaps the color palette of previously seen enemies and gives them double or triple the health. It wasn't difficult anymore, just really tedious to wait, attack a few times, wait again, attack a few times. Tedium isn't difficulty! I tend to love smaller rogue-lites, with a cool gimmick. I have 15 hours on such a game, Lost Potato, which I truly recommend. I'll most likely beat this game, maybe come back and change this review, but as of now I'm not really having any fun.

And as a result of numerous experiments, scientists brought out a powerful creature - the Battle Ram. And now the ram must be tested at a military training ground. He has to fight robots.\n\nSo what exactly is Battle Ram? This is a lamb that runs around the arena. The character is controlled with the mouse. And all he can do is butt, he has no secret weapon. Actually, this is his main and only skill. The character runs around the arena, colliding with opponents. The musical accompaniment in the game is very cheerful and rhythmic. The game supports Russian.\n\nThe environment in the game can be attributed to the style of animation. You can choose the following characteristics: puzzle, arcade, sports game, single player, difficult game.\n\nThe game currently has only eight levels. Despite the small number of levels, the game is difficult. The difficulty of the game is that every time you lose, you start the battle from the very beginning.\n\nThe game gives quite a lot of emotions, both positive and negative. Because the game is built according to such a scheme as \"easy too liarm\". That is, we easily understand the rules by which it must be passed, but it will take a lot of time to hone the technique and pass the tests. A lot of games on Dendy were built on the same principle.\n\nLet's consider in more detail the game by levels. The first level is training. In the second level, opponents are trying to hit the character with bullets. The next level is rocket, when missiles explode when hitting a player or just hitting each other. This is a fairly simple level, because the player just needs to dodge missiles. In the fourth level, you can be not only hit by bullets, but also pushed out of the field, which is also considered a loss. You need to be opponents in this level from the middle of the arena, after they have fired shots. Level with lasers is quite easy to pass. As in the third level, the player will need dexterity to dodge in time. In the seventh level, robots are passive, which shoot with just one shot, but there are quite a few of them. In the last level, a hardcore carnage begins.

You're forced to stay within a circle and fight robots who try to blow you up. Ramming them repeatedly will kill them.\n\nTouching the robots doesn't kill you: just leaving the area or getting shot/blown. All robots also explode on death. Every few levels the game mixes it up with \"environmental hazards\" like rockets and burning laser beams to dodge while fighting at the same time.\n\n[i]EDIT: Originally played and reviewed in Jan 2021, a recent update has allowed me to change my review to a positive recommendation.[/i]\n\n[h1]About enemies and gameplay[/h1]\n\nThere's several sorts of enemies from simple moving blocks to walking shooters and flying machines that shoot multiple times in a row.\n\nWhen three robots cluster bomb the area, it can get pretty involved. The screenshakes from the explosions make it particularly hectic, and it's easy to die to a stray bomb you didn't account for.\n\nThere's some tactics involved, as the enemies may shoot each other if you maneuver smartly. As all robots might not shoot at the same time, attacking requires proper timing and patience, which I liked.\n\nJust don't ram too eagerly or too far - it's easy to accidentally blast away from the level or bump too far backwards.\n\n[h1]Controls and settings[/h1]\n\nIt's played exclusively with mouse. Ram follows the cursor, and left-click is for ramming. Sadly, the speed of the ramming didn't seem to matter for damage.\n\nSettings involve muting sounds+music, switch between fullscreen and windowed, as well as clearing the save file (be careful not to do so accidentally, though - there's no prompt).\n\n[h1][strike]But why not recommended?[/strike] EDIT: Fixed[/h1]\n\nGame used to contain an achievement requiring the use of cheating software. This, and two broken achievements, were recently removed, so the game can be completed and perfected. Thus, I no longer have any problem recommending the game! (Thanks, dev!)\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nGraphics are cute, and sound effects are a blast from the retro past.\n\nMy first playthrough lasted a bit over an hour, and I played it again right afterwards.\n\nIt's certainly a decent action game, and an easy recommendation for me!

While it has charming looks, it's missing a few crucial elements that would make the game much more than it is now. I would think that a base price of $3.99 is a bit high for a game that has such little content that has no variability. After 20 minutes or so I have reached a wall--so far insurmountable for myself. There is very little replay value in its bare-bones game at this time. So while I think the game has merit, the developer could take this as a building block to make something that's a lot more complex and exciting, thus enticing more audience members. 5.5/10 if you can get this on sale for about a dollar. Otherwise a bit of a let down compared to the screenshots and the trailer, which got me more excited than I felt actually playing.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere's a story, it's not really something that makes sense, and you have to read it on the store page. The game just starts with no explanation, but for such a simple game, explanations are not necessary.\n\nPlay as the little ram, move him around using your mouse cursor. Click anywhere to perform an attack that shows the ram putting the head down and striking with its horns. Strike the robots that come or avoid the traps, and a single hit by anything, and you lose.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are three different enemy types, benign-looking gray acorn-shaped robots that do not attack, blue meanies that remind me of a three-legged Shovel Knight that shoots one bullet at a time, and green drones that shoot series of three bullets. There are two different traps, rockets and light beams. Overall, your goal is to kill all of the enemies and avoid all of the traps in each level.\n\nThe individual levels consists of a single-screen arena where you goal is to survive to the end. There's a circle on the ground that you cannot step out of or get pushed out of, otherwise it's game over.\n\nThe levels save automatically so when you die, you start the same level, and if you hit a wall like I did with a particular level, that's it--expect to die repeatedly with no hope of survival after hitting this wall.\n\nThus I said above that this game is lacking in variability. You can play and have fun for a little while and when you hit the wall, it's the same level coming at you on repeat and all of the enemies move in the same pattern, and come in from the same angles every single time. there's no randomization of enemy types, spawn locations, etc. Each level is pre-made, making it seem really bland after losing the same level 15-20 times. \n\nThe ram also only that one attack that I mentioned. So you can imagine, after not too long, you start wishing for a different way of attacking the enemies. \n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nMouse for movement and left click to perform your attack.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nCute hand-drawn artwork, though there's not too much in terms of what to display.\n\n[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]\nWork fine, no special sounds as far as I can tell.\n\n[h1]Audience[/h1]\nVery targeted audience who enjoys a good arcade-sim challenge and doesn't care about those above-mentioned things.\n\n[h1]Pricing[/h1]\n$3.99 US isn't not a high number, but high enough for anyone to hesitate in a game that lasts probably somewhere around 20-25 minutes before you hit that wall. Would probably seem rather short if you paid full price.\n\n[h1]My First-Look Gameplay[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/NUFZbuQlQeA\n\n[h1]Potential Improvements[/h1]\n-Randomize starting locations of enemies, so it doesn't feel like you are avoiding the same patterns of bullets each time.\n-Add different weapons/attacks for the ram.\n-Add a score reporting device--all arcade games should have a score tracker, with the scores or something only counts if you start from the beginning. \n-Game starting at the same level over and over again doesn't bode well. After not too long the game starts to feel a little old, especially if you hit that wall.\n-All for resetting of the same file to at least replay the beginning parts. Best to just have a level selection screen where you can choose any of the levels that you have already progressed past.\n-Having multiple save files would also be useful.\n-Randomize some levels if possible, at least that would get you out of the same rut that you are stuck on on serial repeat.\n-Hit boxes of the explosions seem a bit too large for me.\n-Character modifiers would be cool to see how the gameplay may differ from run to run. Right now it's just a bit bland.\n-Adding rooms to make the game varied as well. Currently there's just this one circular-room used. Enemies come in and try to take you out, either through the bullets/explosions, or they can push you out of the ring. \n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]Battle Ram[/i] is intrinsically not a bad game. I do think that there's a lot of areas of potential improvement that would make it a lot better from its current barebones self. With no variability and such little content, I think I would get it on a deep sale, otherwise you might feel that the gameplay time is not good compared to the price.
