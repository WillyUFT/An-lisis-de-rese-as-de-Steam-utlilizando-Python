It is more akin to a (mostly) side-scrolling action RPG, with a big world and linear area progression with a bit of open-world questing and exploration in each area. Some have compared it to classic Zelda games and it's definitely got that vibe. \n\nPros are nice presentation, some lovely character designs and animation work. The music mix is deceptively variable and some of the tracks are fantastic. It is a really nice world to explore, full of flavourful NPCs. This is a game I really wanted to like as it is clearly a labour of love... which may be the problem. \n\nReason why I don't recommend it is combat and platforming difficulty on 'challenges'. It is not 'hard' as such, but it is unforgiving and requires a certain level of technical skill. The player is expected to experiment to learn the techniques that you won't find out about in game until after you need them (yes, you can go wiki-diving instead). Uneven difficulty jumps encountered in only the first two areas do not help. Difficulty options are available (if a bit obtuse to understand initially) but they do not help the fundamental areas that make it feel so frustrating for me. Veterans and devs have clearly spent a lot of time polishing this gem but in doing so they have overtuned things to their (high) ability. \n\nI have not finished this game and have given up in frustration in the second area (bandit combat trial). Yes, it is possible to 'master' the game to proceed but if you lack the technical and precise skills that this game demands then, like me, you find find it frustrating rather than challenging. If you do enjoy or are able to overlook the skill demanded then there is a lot to like.

It really seems kind of poorly made.\nGetting this out of the way, there really isn't a story. So, it doesn't even have that going for it. The platforming is kinda of shaky, as you can miss what seems like a small window hit box and miss the platforming. The puzzles itself doesn't appear it was tested well, since due to the window to connect to an object you can miss it.\n\nLet alone, the timer is too short. If the intention was for repetition, well, this was poorly done. I got through it, but it just felt like a slog.\n\nThe battle system is by far one of the worst I have dealt with. You're pretty much just dodging with no really creative way to get through situations. Just basic stuff.\n\nThere was also a part that required you to know the hair color of someone to proceed. Two issues here.\n\n1. Did not account for players who might have a problem differentiating colors.\n\n2. If it is a story quest, then why doesn't it default? This is such a poor choice.\n\nThere is also another one that is quite annoying, where you need to find five children and they blend in so well that it was difficult to find them. Let alone one of them, you are recommended to use a lamp, but they don't tell you where to get one. So, I navigated that one blindly. There is another puzzle, where you can't even see the switches that triggers the trap. It was just guess and check. Some of them you have to get hit to get through, it is just bad.\n\nMusic isn't anything to remember, and all in all? I just cannot bring myself to play anymore of this game. I see the effort, but it was just poorly done. This game felt like a chore to get through, each and every moment.

Really a shame!\nPhoenotopia looks amazing, I couldn't help myself but take dozens of screenshots while I was playing. Last time I did that was when I played Gris.\n\nThe gameplay is simply fantastic, there are tons of smart interactions in the game design, the puzzles really test your spatial perception: whether it's activating a switch by angling your slingshot the right way, using projectiles to knock moonstones off their platform, piling up boxes and bombs to gain barely enough height to reach a platform, or completing parkour sections full of arrow traps with well synchronized jumps.\nThe puzzles where you need to play the correct song with your flute gave me Zelda Ocarina of Time vibes. I liked how musical notes were often hidden in the background, and I had to spot them to know what I would need to play with the bandit's flute.\nThe GEO dungeons especially had really different kinds of puzzles. One time you'll have to solve a jigsaw puzzle, the next time it'll be a sliding picture puzzle, then it will involve switching lights in the correct order. There's even a puzzle similar to sudoku.\nThe game always managed to hold my attention with all its brainteasers.\n\nCooking mechanic is based on reaction time, it's simple and engaging. I noticed there was a frying pan on display in the Antique Shop near Daea city, but I never managed to obtain it during my playthrough. I suppose it would have modified the cooking minigame in a certain way?\nBtw, I like how we immediatly drop cooked meat when we kill a mob/animal with an explosion (bomb or spear). Pretty cool that they thought about that!\n\nThe Gear Ring allows you to quickly switch up between 8 different items, it's always a good thing to have a weapon wheel in any game I play. It's very ergonomic and it saved me a lot of time from navigating through the menus.\nAnd I'm thankful that we can use all our weapons as much as we want, without having to worry about ammo.\n\nIt's very satisfying when you struggle while exploring an area for the 1st time, having to use your gear in a clever way, dealing with all the enemies and barely surviving. And then when you revisit the same area later in the game with a new ability, you can make it through in a much simpler way. The abilities that you get for traversal exploration are really game-changing. I was so excited to backtrack everytime I got a new one.\n\nPhoenotopia Awakening is very charming, and has a lot of light-hearted moments. I never got tired of listening to \"Merry Fellowship\" everytime Gail came back to her hometown after a mission, checking in with her brothers & sisters to see if they're okay. The game even manages to be funny sometimes. For example, when Gail and Fran use the teleporter for the 1st time, and Gail thinks Fran died during the teleportation as she watches the pile of dust on the ground, before Fran immediatly appears out of nowhere with a big smile on her face.\nThe game also managed to do the exact opposite on several occasions. I was very anxious during that moment in EDEN's Lab, when you're quietly exploring the rooms and reading notes about those harpys in their stasis chamber. As you progress, you suddently hear glass breaking, and when you turn around, you notice all the harpys broke out.\n\nThose moments, whether tense or joyful, are always accompanied by excellent music. My personal favorites are \"Merry/Mellow Fellowship\", \"Boss battle\", \"The White Towers\", \"Katash's theme\", \"Wheat Road\" and \"Caves of Mul\".\n\nYou can't put markers on a map to remember points of interest. So I had to write down informations on a notepad regularly to not get lost and not forget things like treasure chests, entrances to dungeons, or song stones. There are tons of stuff to do and optional content, so having a quest log and a map available at all times would have been useful, but it was definitely manageable without it.\n\nI loved the last part of the game that consists of 3 Boss fights back-to-back. The first one against Mother Computer was the most challenging fight in the entire game. Then you have this amazing showdown with your own shadows, and finally the duel vs Katash.\nI have to say this last battle felt a bit anticlimactic. I had encountered Adam earlier in the lab, and I thought I would have to fight this monstrosity, but instead it was a second duel with Katash.\nI'm pretty sure (and I hope) that I will have to fight Adam when I'll come back to this game to get the true ending, and I can't wait for it.\n\nI unlocked the first ending after 60 hours with a completion of 62%. I played enough and I don't want to push myself, so I won't go for 100%. However, I will surely come back to this game in a few months to do some more things. Notably exploring Aurantia, beating Katash' 2nd encounter, and accessing the locked room at the top of Pristine City to fight Phalanx.\n\nI don't know how they did it, but the game was never boring, never frustrating, never too hard, never too easy, never repetitive, never bad. There was the right amount of everything: fights, exploration, puzzles and platforming.\nReally, as I said earlier, the only thing that people could have a problem with is that it can be difficult to keep track of everything. But it's really not that big of a deal if you pay attention, and of course if you write things down on a notepad or a piece of paper.\n\nThis is why I give this game a perfect score. This is one of the best games I've played this year!

But, it only feels so complete unfortunately. The story is somewhat compelling, the game contains some snappy events that made me chuckled, but nothing outright blew my mind or made me feel like I was playing something revolutionary. That's a high bar to set, but after seeing so many good indie games, it does feel pretty average. If anything,  I would say this game does well at re-visiting the olden days. It feels more like a GBA game moreso, with all of the rose tinted glasses busted out. Some of its frustrating aspect did not make the game too enjoyable at certain points.\n\n\nWhat's the good?\nThe story, while containing fairly average writing, does have a good concept! Without spoiling direct story, something clearly unnatural is happening on this world. The game made it obvious what sci-fi themes are present early on, but did decently pace other elements over time. I will say, however, the story does not end too well. Upon further reading, it appears the devs do want to continue an overarching story in another game that will likely be in development for a while... It doesn't fall absolutely flat; however, the ending left me with more questions than answers. If that was a mystery met by a dlc and had a story as trippy as Katana Z, maybe I'd understand it. But this doesn't feel like that type of story. It lands average, with more told through dialogue and some early story exploration intriguing you, but it didn't go far enough.\n\nGameplay:\nBoth ok and occasionally bad (more of the annoying rather than difficult variant). \n\nThe bat? The melee attack mimicking most modern close combat oriented metroidvanias? Is a toothpick. By the end of the game it is probably the last weapon you should be using to even have a leg up. The game revolving every item around a single stamina bar was not a good idea, especially how any action that depletes it resets the timer to recovering any.\n\nThis part isn't hard to explain. You Metroidvania. It's as simple as that. It works until it doesn't, as while fighting one enemy is farily good, fighting large enemies or multiple enemies gets bad really quickly. The bosses in this game needed way longer in the oven considering they seemed designed to work against a much faster character type. Getting a no-hit run would feel like luck, if I could put it bluntly... \n\nThe other stuff:\nThe game does ok on theme. The pixel art does alright, but it's not mind boggling.\nThe music is fairly ok, but some of the mid-game themes you'll probably want to get out of your head after a while. The main theme is a good 5 stars.\nDev interaction: I have no rating here. I didn't hear if there's enough story surrounding the game's creation. All I know is that this is technically a remake of an original game that drops its subtitle. It was much more inconclusive. But by the word of how long I heard it would take to make, it seems pretty unfortunate. But they don't sound like a focused dev group. Some of that's just life. I hope they're able to put their best foot forward at it!\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt's alright. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692500015, "timestamp_updated": 1692500015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523352205753326416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144573301": {"recommendationid": "144573301", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124664610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1694136982}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the exploration, puzzles, collectibles, various skills/weapon/equipment and the followed-up backtracking and discovering hidden area.

There's a ton of stuff in this game for such a small amount of money, and unlike the vapid, shallow padding you find in most AAA titles, this game's content is so lovingly crafted. Collectibles are cleverly hidden, and I found myself going to the fortune teller to find out more heart gems and moonstones are in that dungeon I was certain I scoured from top to bottom. The puzzles are great (though I found one or two of them were a bit TOO hard), and I found myself writing down notes and diagrams to try to figure some of them out.\n\nAnd that's without even touching the story and the world-building, which is top notch in my opinion. It's involved enough to be interesting, but not so dense that it bogs itself down, it really hits that sweet spot that a lot of other titles miss. The mood is often lighthearted and wholesome, but it has a bit of a dark side too, especially when you start learning about what happened in the past. The characters and dialog are charming and delightful, I found myself falling in love with so many of them. It got to the point where, when I was told that two of the characters had been sent off to be killed, I immediately went around talking to everyone nearby to see if there was a way to save them. \n\nMy only real gripes are with some of the controls, and maybe the symbols used for the songs. You have to use the quick select menu by moving the right stick over the item you want to equip and then clicking the right stick down to select it. It's not terrible, but it's easy to mess up when you're in a tense fight. The symbols used for playing songs aren't really intuitive, you just kind of have to memorize which symbol corresponds to which direction, which is fine once you've got it down, but even near the end of the game I was still struggling with it just a bit.\n\nAlso the sprint is a bit weird, because it's not like a Mario style game where you hold down the sprint button and you'll always be sprinting, you have to be touching the ground and if your feet leave the ground for any reason, even if you're dropping down a very small ledge, you stop sprinting and have to manually press the sprint button down again. It's not the worst ever, I was definitely able to complete all the free running challenges, and even got the Lunar Key (even if I had to watch a video of someone doing it first). In fact, I nearly got all the items in the game, save for one energy gem. I just couldn't beat the last shooting gallery challenge.

In general, the game's got it all: an interesting mixed-technology world like something outta Star Ocean with an intriguing plot, charming characters with amusing dialogue that never felt cringe, refreshingly actual challenging combat and puzzles, a huge world to explore with tons of sidequests and places that give great rewards to keep track of and come back to, an addictive sense of progression with new gadgets and abilities, and so on! Like I said, it's the total package and anyone looking for a great Zelda-esque adventure should highly consider picking this up.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n1) Combat works, and does have a lot of nice things to it like no old-school contact damage (enemies can only hit you with clearly telegraphed attack animations), but it can be a bit frustrating due to 1) stamina constantly running out and taking so long to regenerate 2) your melee attack being very short and stubby which forces you to get right in enemies faces to not whiff 3) no iframes, even for the dodge roll manuever, which makes defense feel very awkward 4) enemy attacks feeling overwhelming as they can send you ragdolling around and can wombo-combo you due to no post-hit invincibility. As said, it's balanced for this, there are a lot of great fights, and there are accessibility options, but even when I accepted it for what it was, it still felt so annoying at times.\n\n2) The game doesn't have any sort of marking system or a quest log to keep track of all the stuff you're doing, so if you play this, I highly recommend you have a notepad handy like I did. I enjoyed this prospect, but it can be difficult to keep track of everything if you leave the game.\n\n3) The cooking system seemed nice at first, but I was sick of it by the end. Cooking food is practically always a net positive compared to raw food, and there's no sense of expression through recipes or customization or whatever, so it just becomes tedium you always have to go through the motions to do, killing the pace. It's kinda like how, unlike most survival games which have cooking be a challenge at the start but eventually automate it to let you focus on greater goals, in this you always need to make time for cooking and fishing and are never free from it (some people may like this though, I suppose!)\n\n4) The moonstone currency system can be a bit frustrating in that I thought it was only used for unlocking fast travel, but suddenly the game pulled a fast one mid-way and offers upgraded gear which costs moonstones as well, meaning I felt cheated as now I had to decide between convenience and fun in a battle where both choices felt bad until I eventually get enough stones for everything I wanted.\n\n5) I enjoyed the journey and everything so it didn't sour me too much, but the ending did fall a bit flat to me as many things were handwaved offscreen or left unresolved.", "timestamp_created": 1688240772, "timestamp_updated": 1688240772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546436309814453125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141066966": {"recommendationid": "141066966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029745154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1695367603}, "language": "english", "review": "So far i had only made it to the Ouroborous trials, so maybe later some upgrades will change some of the problems game have for the better, but, nevertheless, problems there are.\n\nThe game is very good in terms of visual design, music and exploration.\n\nBut, unfortunately, it is full of questionable game design decisions.\n\nFirst - it is controls. It is overcomplicated and, through that, somewhat irritating. I can understand stamina management, it was in many games like Secret of Mana. I can understand, that charge attack is supposed to slow you down. But there are many enemies, that move incredibly abruptly - and that invalidates using charge attack for anything but crushing the crates.\nSecond - cooking minigame. It is fun on it's own, but you either have to tediously do it with every next item, reequipping each next stack, or stay with inferior healing items.\nThird - incredibly high health of many \"random encounter\" enemies. It is not, that you cannot just escape them, it is when you are going to get some ingredients/money from them - each of this encounters feels like it is miniboss at least.\nFourth - VERY strange dash and dash jump. Dash itself just stops, when you jump, when you fall to the lower surface, any second you are disconnected from the ground - and it does not continue/start, if you still hold dash button. More than that - it is not a modifier button as in \"hold dash and right to run right\", it is a movement button, that moves you in the direction, that character is faced - so, in several platforming moments, when you need to dash jump betweer branches quickly, because they break under the character, in many cases you just fly away in the wrong direction. And because of all of that, dash jump itself works equally bad.\nFifth - most enemies and enemies combinations are designed with intention to trick you - beginning with mentioned earlier  abrupt movement and attacks, followed by combination, when there is \"sniper\" enemies, that throw their projecties aiming at you - not just in your direction as in left-right-up-down, but actually aiming. And this enemies are usually go in packs of 2 to 4 or combined with melee's, that actively and very aggressively follow you.\nShooting is also quite questionable - aiming the crossbow just feels wrong - combined with much less predictable and abrupt movement of enemies and high stamina consumption with not that high damage against said enemies.\nTowns - they are overloaded, It is cool, when there are details, when there are lore NPCs, but there are just too many of everything. Maybe developers had tried to create the effect of \"lost in the city, exploring\", but it just feel tedious.\nSo, the game itself is not that hard on it's own, yet combination of controls, enemy behaviour, overuse of minigames, too many NPCs, that look like they are quest ones, but actually not, makes this game somewhat tiring. It have many puzzles involving crates, jumping, using the sling etc, but the gameplay itself just feels wrong. Again, should at least controls would be less strange, this game would be much better and less irritating, but so far it have very good world, but very bad means to explore it - unique experiment, yes, but not a good one.", "timestamp_created": 1688232316, "timestamp_updated": 1688232316, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569528400897979736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140990034": {"recommendationid": "140990034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041275698", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1687271583}, "language": "english", "review": "I would love to recommend this game, but sadly I can't.

Has some light tones and a little humor but doesn't overdo it.\n- World: Really cool design for the different areas. A lot of detail ranging from fields, forests and swamps to cities and their cluttered design (Intentional to give off that cramped city vibe). Many areas utilize doorways on both sides (Basically front and back to give it more depth). I'll also put the quest and sidequest content in here which gives you a lot to do with the collection of things and puzzles. The overworld what I relate to as the Zelda 2 with enemies spawning on a map and if encountered you get a small sidescrolling map with a few enemies and maybe an item or two.\n- Music: Very nice overall. I put the volume down pretty low so I may not be hearing it on most maps but the boss music absolutely slaps and really has that \"It's go time\" vibe (It's on Youtube!). While gameplay related there is a music component in the game (Key Item) and the notes are icons which are mapped to directions. It's cool that they have these notes to give more immersion but it does make a little hard to remember what you have to push to remember the note on top of the sequence (I just put together a reference that I can go off of instead of that).\n\n- Combat: This is the part I actually dislike the most and it's a shame because there is so much combat involved. Read some of negative comments and some point out this too.\n- Combat Movement: Your character movement is oddly clunky but it seems intentional. Most movements or attacks you do have to fulfill their animation which seems to carry on for a few frames too many and that is what leaves you exposed. This means you have to account for that extra delay at the end and consider even doing it. Another component to this that puts you at a disadvantage is the controls which I'll cover seperately since it also involves non combat.\n- Combat Difficulty: Enemies can absolutely juggle you and some attacks sends you bouncing off walls and it's kind of ridiculous. I've been playing this on easy but really the difficulty spikes with some area and bosses you're really playing on a higher difficulty whether you like it or not. Bosses have a noticeable progression but where I am at the time of this review (3rd storyline boss) was absolutely off the walls absurd (If you don't avoid one particular attack you're paralyzed for nearly 10 seconds - The boss doesn't attack during this time but it's just frustrating). \n\n- Controls: Some control input seems to have poor response ingame. I've been playing with an Xbox controller but for things like crawling prone or cooking I switch to the keyboard for that. With combat though I would not even dare try a keyboard with all teh other things you have going against you in combat. Using some ranged weapons that has aim is also limited and doesn't seem to accept the full 360 range of a joystick so you will have difficulty aiming to fire accurately (Of course enemies do not have to worry about this and will fire ranged attacks with better precision than you).\n\nOverall: If you want to try this because you like the genre just know you will most likely get a little or very frustrated with it's downfalls.", "timestamp_created": 1685853623, "timestamp_updated": 1685853623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139428523": {"recommendationid": "139428523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146150437", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1685719925}, "language": "english", "review": "The game starts well as a \"there's frustration but good to be had if you can push through this\" but once you leave the first couple of areas even that's gone.

Still, it's not really an RPG, there's no leveling, and there's a lot of platforming, but it's not a platformer either, and while there are many puzzles, they're mostly optional, but still very good, so you get the idea, it's a lot of things, and they're well implemented.\n\nIt seems not many people know this game, which is a shame, because I thought it was very good, I had a blast with it, it has a charming style, the music is great, the gameplay is fun, and it has some interesting mechanics, I played it at the highest difficulty, which I found out later it's the original difficulty, but was later given the option to be tuned down, still, I would recommend playing it that way, the way the devs intended, because that makes it stand out from other games, it's its own experience.\n\nThe only thing I would \"criticize\" is the fact that the game seems to be longer, and then it suddenly ends with things unresolved, that is not to say the game is short, it took me 31 hours to finish and I still only got 51%, so there's plenty of game here, but it really left me craving for more, mainly because the premise of the game, the thing you set out to do in the first place, doesn't get done by the end, but it's clear that this was planned as only a part of a bigger story comprising one or more games.\n\nAnd that's also part of why I'm making this review, because apparently the game didn't do so well unfortunately, so the devs went on to other projects and the possible sequel is not a priority, which is a shame, because, again, the game is very good, so I hope more people find out about this game and give it a chance.", "timestamp_created": 1685573524, "timestamp_updated": 1685573524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138906318": {"recommendationid": "138906318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198224407632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4692, "last_played": 1686526064}, "language": "english", "review": "The long wait for the full release of this game after returning to the Newgrounds flash original again and again was absolutely worth it.

But somehow, it totally sucks to play, in a way that's hard to pin down. Most obviously, the combat feels off, and there is a TON of combat. The controls feel like you're fighting your character, and struggling to get your attacks out, more than facilitating your skill. It's very hard to avoid getting pinged by the numerous traps and enemy ranged attacks, which are all over the place.\n\nAs a result, you're constantly getting drained, chipped-away at. This leads to the murkier problem: The math is just off. You take too much damage, there are too many sources of damage, and healing is too little and too far between. You have to be constantly hunting up food items, and then spend time cooking them, just to stay at a safe level of health. The inns are very few and far between, and save points don't restore you. I can easily see getting stuck in the middle of a dungeon or cave, not able to move forward or even back out, because you've run out of food, your health is low, and there's stuff just pinging you all over the place.\n\nThe end result is very strange--this seems like mostly a kids' game, by tone, by story, by graphics. But it's far too long and complex to be fun at that level, and the frustration at getting constantly battered about and desperate for health sources is far too aggravating to appeal to a young player. Even the challenges are too closely-timed, considering the muddy controls. Players, especially young players, don't like being confronted with constant failure.\n\nIt would take a nigh-total overhaul to fix this. Hopefully these problems can get tuned for another game, because what's good here is very good. But the bad makes it borderline unplayable.

I'm tired. This game took me almost 40 hours to finish, I'm not about to start all over again this soon. But someday. And, I hope, not after too long. One thing that could help with that, though, would be a New Game+ mode, but maybe the New Game+ is the stuff we collected along the way. :P\n\nI don't know if I should hope for a sequel. It would be difficult to balance the game considering the big reveal at the end. But who knows, maybe it's possible.\n\nA simple binary yes or no system makes reviews like these difficult to say. Do I recommend it? Yeah, absolutely, if you're into this kind of game, you will adore it. Not 100% sure of the criticisms either, like bad combat; felt pretty desperate at times, if you ask me, but a larger weapon variety, especially in the realm of ranged weapons, and more upgrade paths might improve it. But I probably haven't play enough games of its kind to really know why people had problems with it.\n\nI did like the combat difficulty accessibility system, and I will probably be utilizing it more in my next playthrough.\n\nThe story was....almost *kind of* Undertale-esque, in like it has a surface level narrative, but the backstory and lore both contexualize the plot, but also give some pretty dark, unsettling, and depressing implications. I like those kinds of stories because they play on those feelings.\n\n==Actual Spoilers beyond this point==\n\nTo elaborate on the ending, I didn't realize that the awakening of the Deus Ex Machina (the Phoenixes - grammar bro in me is disappointed they didn't use Phoenices, but what're ya gonna do \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af) would actually *end the story.* I don't know how they could have finished the game in a better way, mind you, and I'm not really in a place where I could offer an alternative.

AND when I take 15 min to go get food and come back the tunnels reset part way. Cool. The core of this game is great, art, exploration, platforming, puzzles, upgrades, stamina gauging combat, music, and even the dialogue at times, but wow are there some glaring basic issues that a game designer should have seen. I sure hope a nice QoL patch comes out for this game that adds a mini-map, as well as ways to acquire more food in the difficult tunnel sections. Sadly I don't expect that to ever happen.\n\nThe more I think about this game, the more I love it and wonder what happened with the \"dungeons\". The first dungeon, [spoiler]The Temple of The Frog,[/spoiler] was PERFECT, well.. it just needed a map, that would have actually made for a cool item to find. But anyway, this first dungeon, it wasn't linear, there was food to find, it had a central saving point, unique rooms, lots of lore details, stuff to come back to when I had upgrades, oh and even multiple bosses. If the other \"dungeons\" were this good, I'd be giving the game an ez nine. All in all a really eye opening game for me, and hopefully the metroidvania genre at large. Shout out to Zelda II and, shout out to Legend of Swordia VIII.\n\n7 / 10\n\nPhoenotopia gets 1 point off for no mini map, and 2 full points off for the multiple linear food desert \u201cdungeons\" that made me quit the game for good.", "timestamp_created": 1684533688, "timestamp_updated": 1689386396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138528047": {"recommendationid": "138528047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360136580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2574, "last_played": 1684537981}, "language": "english", "review": "Was not expecting this game to have such badass sci-fi lore.", "timestamp_created": 1684473678, "timestamp_updated": 1684473678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138202925": {"recommendationid": "138202925", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018204891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2750, "last_played": 1683922468}, "language": "english", "review": "Like a good book.

After a few years I happened upon the news of the remake and followed its development with cautious optimism, and I'm happy to say I think it turned out great. This was one of the most enjoyable games I've played recently. It was the kind of game that I enjoyed beginning to end, I was always looking forward to coming back to it. I 100%ed and then went for the finale, and I was left with that bittersweet \"satisfied and happy it happened, depressed that it's over\" feeling, and I went back and scoured the game for every last drop of content.\n\nThe game world is full of charm and sincerity; well animated pixel graphics and smooth weighty movement, loads of different in-game environments, lots of amusing dialogue throughout the game (more the kind that makes you smile, rather than the kind that makes you laugh), a cool setting with lots of satisfying world-building to be found in exploring, talking, and item descriptions, and a well told sincere story that is lighthearted and optimistic but also doesn't undermine itself with silliness. The game has a great balance of lightheartedness and seriousness, and the music is fantastic and catchy with loads of variety; I was always looking forward to hearing a new track in every new environment.\n\nPuzzling and platforming gameplay are very enjoyable; there's a huge number of puzzles and challenges all over the map, lots of different types: logic puzzles, timing puzzles, riddles, some well hidden ones involving background details and such. The platforming is usually tied to the puzzles, and while it occasionally requires some dexterity, the game rarely calls for pixel-perfect finger-crunching platforming (I recognise this [i] may [/i] be seen a mark against the game). I will note however: For people who enjoy acquiring new movement abilities in metroid-vania style games; that isn't a huge feature in this game. While you [i] do [/i] acquire abilities that let you traverse more environments and move around in new ways, the majority of your character's acrobatic abilities are available to you right from the start of the game and aren't altered or upgraded significantly from their original form. \n\nDungeons in-game somewhat resemble puzzle dungeons in some Zelda games, rather than the more maze-like dungeons you can find in some metroid-vania games. While the dungeons and levels have several optional off-shoots and hidden areas (and the same is true for the world map), most dungeons are fairly straightforward in design. The game lacks in-game maps, but in my opinion it doesn't need any as the dungeons aren't sprawling or confusing enough, and the cities are also often quite well signposted. The world is big enough that you might forget the exact location where you found a specific item/puzzle/room/npc you couldn't reach or interact with before, but you'll probably know which area it was in, and I'd say you are very unlikely to be completely lost at any point.\n\nThe combat gameplay is the most common point of contention in reviews, but I found it pretty enjoyable in most encounters. In my opinion, the gameplay in general feels very tightly designed, and I think that the claims of ultra-difficulty are extremely overblown; the game isn't anywhere near as crushingly difficult as many reviews (positive or negative) imply. The combat is often negatively compared to Hollow Knight (another game I enjoy), but the two games are only superficially similar, both in combat and other design and gameplay aspects. Compared to something like HK, the combat is slower paced; enemies move slower or more clumsily, both their and the player's attacks have more wind-up and wind-down, most enemies have no collision damage so you can move in closer and stay there longer, most enemies can be knocked back/interrupted if you hit them with a charged attack, there isn't any mercy invincibility after being hit so a single big strike can put you on the backfoot, and you have less aerial control than in something like HK. Then there's the stamina system where basic movement (running, jumping, crawling) costs nothing, but most other moves - sprinting, rolling, melee (both fast and charged attacks), and secondary weapons/equipment - cost stamina, and you can't be relentless with your attacks and must manage your stamina. Finally, there's healing, which typically has to be done mid combat without pausing  so you have to quickly stop and eat a healing item during a lull in the fight, with a choice between quick low healing items and slow high healing ones. \n\nAll this combines to give the combat a slightly slower pace, so for example after a few short bursts of sprinting you'll dodge with a jump or roll, then get only a few hits and a charged hit in and run out of stamina, then focus on dodging/healing again, and so on. As you get used to the combat, you learn how best to use up your stamina and which weapons/items are most effective against different types of enemies, when you can sneak hits in during the dodging periods, and when it's best to use the faster or slower healing items. You'll rarely need to hyper-focus on intense stamina management, since most attack dodging doesn't require much (if-any) stamina so there's less pressure if you run out.  I found that most combat encounters were designed well with all this in mind, especially when alongside Gail's (the player character) really well animated and weighty movement and combat motions, so you get lots of cool and satisfying moments where you're rolling under enemy attacks, smacking multiple enemies with charged hits and sending them flying, or being sent flying yourself but using a smooth recovery cancel and getting right back to the fight.\n\nI will say that there are a few cases where the game puts too many of one type of enemy in too tight a space or too many aerial enemies and only small platforms to stand on, so due to your relatively limited aerial control it can make for some frustrating moments where you're forced to just tank a lot of hits and burn through healing supplies fast, but these moments don't come along often and the game is reasonably generous with save points so you can usually try again pretty quickly if you fail.\n\nThe game is quite slowly paced and one could probably say that around 90% of the game is optional content, so if you don't have time for long games or you prefer to jump in and play something to completion in a shorter time, then this game is not ideal for that. I found the game to be extremely engrossing and satisfying, and if you enjoy long form games with lots of exploration and are the type to go around talking to everyone and looking at everything in games then I'd say I can recommend this to you.", "timestamp_created": 1683474945, "timestamp_updated": 1683571015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137829303": {"recommendationid": "137829303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953943810", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47862, "last_played": 1683479943}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is honestly criminally underrated.

It has an interesting plot, awesome art style, some really cool puzzles and mechanics, and a very simple combat system. It is, by all objective standards, a well made and fully produced game.\n\nHowever, as much as I would recommend people getting this game, I also equally have to express immense annoyance with it. It seems to push. Every. Single. Button. I have. It has parkour challenges that are designed to be pretty simple and easy, yet are incredibly difficult purely due to one of those simple mechanics being super weird timing that clashes with the slightly clunky movement of the character. It has fights that are cool, very interesting boss fights! Until you figure out what the pattern is you need to use to attack them. Then it's just a matter of sitting there, bored and annoyed, as I annihilate the boss in a long and boring period of time. There isn't a large amount of skill or timing that's necessary for most of these bosses, it's just figuring out where your character should be positioned for any given attack, and being patient. I am not a patient person. Being required to wait like three seconds between hits doing nothing but jumping over easily dodged attacks and then my hits doing minimal damage because you can't really effectively upgrade your gear, that's not fun to me. That's annoying. I've gotten lost as to where I'm meant to go many times because there isn't any real solid way for you to know what the next plot thing you've got to do is in multiple points in the game. A lot of the places you have to travel through to progress aren't even really designed in any interesting way: It's not a \"challenging fight\" or a \"difficult parkour\" or a \"beautiful path,\" it's just an amalgamation of the three that makes for me being distracted from the beauty of the path by the enemies, all while being knocked off the parkour and having to start all over again because one of them broke the thing I needed to bring with me.\n\nAll in all, this game, more than most, makes me annoyed and frustrated.

Not only is there a lot to explore (and re-explore), but there's also a huge diversity in each area. When you have a game set in the post-apocalyptic future of a scientifically created fantasy world, you can have the best of all settings. Whether it's a pastoral town, a futuristic city built underwater, a village deep in the woods inhabited by trolls & harpies, a bombed out hellscape, or a cave full of giant mutant bugs, this game has it!\n\nAnd the gameplay is pretty fun too, I guess. There's one extremely overpowered boss in the middle, which was infuriating. Plus the difficulty to execute attacks that seem like they should be standard can be a bit frustrating. But the limitation of movesets can offer fun unique experiences, too. (You're never able to double jump, for instance, but you can hover laterally for quite a long time.)\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure-heavy RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1681335838, "timestamp_updated": 1681335838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576045095920562744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136481594": {"recommendationid": "136481594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993533129", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3346, "last_played": 1680494641}, "language": "english", "review": "I had cautiously-optimistic expectations for Phoenotopia: Awakening, and it blew those expectations out of the water. I don't understand how I haven't heard more about this game. It's a really fun, engaging, and challenging Zelda-inspired adventure with a TON to do. The playtime estimates in the official description are accurate: my first completion-ish playthrough took me 35 hours, and full completion took me a total of 55 hours.\n\nI really enjoyed it!\n\n- The game has a bunch of varied challenges, and they're all pretty great. Besides combat it's got logic puzzle challenges, observation challenges, jumping challenges, timing challenges. A few puzzles required me to take notes, but no puzzle was a complete stumper.\n\n- I really enjoyed the combat, both against normal enemies and bosses. Your movement feels good to play, you get a bunch of fun tools and items, and the types of enemies you encounter are varied. I know there's plenty of folks out there who really dislike an aggressive stamina system, but I really appreciate how the stamina system makes you consider when to strike and when to back off and rest (and there does exist an accessibility setting to let you attack without using stamina, if you truly hate it). In all, the combat comes together in a super enjoyable way.\n\n- The bosses were intimidating and challenging in a way I really enjoyed. More than once I'd fight a boss and get destroyed, and wonder how the heck I'd ever possibly be able to defeat them, only to learn their moves over another three or four attempts, and beat them without much frustration.\n\n- The platforming's great. Running around as Gail is fun, many of your tools have traversal applications as well as combat applications. There's even a small Breath-of-the-Wild-ish aspect, where I was able to figure out how to combine my tools in interesting, probably-not-intended ways to sequence break a little, but in a way that felt like the game was rewarding me more than it felt like I was breaking the game.\n\n- The level design is fantastic, and really elevates both the platforming and exploration. In particular the towns: every town is fairly large, but every town past the first one is dense and layered and just, very fun to run around in and search for secrets.\n\n- There's a ton to explore. In addition to zones being dense, there's hundreds of upgrades to find, with unique quests and requirements for finding them. I was playing pretty completionist, and I only found around 2/3s of the upgrades without the use of the in-game hint system.\n\n- The plot is on-par with a Zelda: every beat has good stakes, with plenty to keep me engaged.\n\n- The setting and worldbuilding are very cool and deep without being overbearing.\n\n- The characters are all fun, and the game knows when to be a little serious and when to be a little silly with them (and importantly is able to pull off both effectively).\n\n- The pixel art is quite nice: simple and clear but intricate enough to hide cool secrets in. And the animation is very strong: it's all totally expressive, and every so often it flexes with something super impressive.\n\n- There's a bunch of different minigames, and they're all very cute, and just the right amount of challenging and engaging. Mostly I just want to call out the cooking minigame, which you'll probably end up doing a lot. It's the perfect amount of engaging, with real risks (burning your healing items) and real rewards (better healing items), while being short enough that it's a nice brief bit of downtime between fights and exploring, instead of being a huge chore.\n\nIt's good! Again, I don't know how this one flew under my radar for so long! If you like the idea of a Zelda-adjacent sidescroller adventure, Phoenotopia: Awakening is better than any I've seen.

In short: the platforming is godawful and finicky, there is not a single enemy in the game that was enjoyable to fight, everything is designed to waste your time, and the story gets resolved in a text box at the end of two rehashed bosses.\n\nEvery dash jump resets your dash, when you land you'll be in walk mode again even holding down the button. The direction you jump gets locked in strange ways I still can't grasp which matters when trying to lob bombs at things. There's very little room for error in a lot of the platforming. It's not quite pixel perfect nonsense but the timings get kind of strict and this also carried over into COMBAT with jumping over charging enemies and holy hell there is a LOT of charging and jumping enemies.\n\nEnemies. Every single one is designed to be as absolutely annoying as possible, even the bosses. ESPECIALLY the kobold bosses. Combat in general was clearly designed around the stamina system despite you being able to turn that off which then turns bosses into \"go ape on them and they die immediately\", and even with that crutch they are just zero percent fun to deal with.\nTowards the end of the game you get a regen ring which lets you pretty much ignore overworld danger and just sprint through traps, mobs, everything, because you'll just regen it back during the next segment of reading or puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, the design is... okayish. Push boxes, play music, at a couple points they just make you do Sudoku which is a weird choice and further cements the \"everything here is wasting your fucking time\" category. Especially the rewards. Oh boy you went out of your way to get this hidden chest? Enjoy 45 coins. If you're lucky its a stamina gem, which lets you not have to waste slightly time waiting for that to regen after regular platforming or minor combat. Sidequests are the WORST, item fetching nonsense that gives a pittance of a payout. By the way you often have to talk to an NPC multiple times before they give you the quest, and no indication that they have a sidequest so enjoy talking to EVERYBODY multiple times just in case!\n\nGetting to what is now apparently the final two bosses, both were just rehashes of two bosses you fought earlier! So clearly that was filler before the actual resolution of the game, right?\nWRONG. The moment you finish it off, the game ends and you're left with several text boxes explaining how you and your friends save the world. Not even cutscenes, or animations. Just text.

It has a Dark Souls style stamina bar as well, and songs a la other Zelda games. But it brings plenty of original ideas too: most items have to be consumed in real time, though you can mash the button to eat them faster, so healing in combat requires waiting for an opportunity. You have a wide variety of tools available and even your mobility techniques are often usable for fighting too.\n\nThe game is also gorgeous (Moonlight Ravine in particular) and has an amazing OST. It's good about providing save points and does give you a fast-travel option for getting around more easily later. It's well-written, the fun sort of difficult, and rewards exploration - the game is stuffed to the brim with secrets and items for you to find if you go hunting around for them.\n\nThe biggest downside is that there's no map, but I'm sure you can find some online if you really need them.

Unless your lacking a bit in the head then maybe this game will be a little too frustrating for you. \n\nIt looks like the cutest casual game ever but it\u2019s surprisingly hardcore. This is absolutely a \"puzzle game\", tons of well hidden secrets, punishing platforming, stamina/resource management and bosses who ragdoll you around the stage.\n\nThe game will charm your pants off and make you love the world. The secrets are well hidden and the game strongly encourages you to research old areas after you've gotten a new ability.\n\nIt really bugs me this game isn\u2019t as talked about as it should be. Incredible puzzles, unbelievable charm and five-star soundtrack.\n\nIt's deeply cozy for real. I love how much work went into making the cities actually feel bustling and populous, while still clearly having their own identity!\n\nI often look up guides when gaming despite not wanting to spoil the experience, but something about phoenotopia made me more patient, more willing to keep trying. It might be because of that fun, quaint atmosphere that I wanted to keep exploring, keep experiencing without ever slowing down. And the moment when you first enter the big city (forgot its name) is probably one of my favorite gaming moments. It\u2019s the most fun level to explore in the whole game, at least.

I remember playing the flash game for hours with her, trying to get further into the game, and seeing her fight the bosses was truly amazing. I couldn\u2019t wait to relive those same memories with her again on this game. Of course, unfortunately she now mostly plays with her boyfriend, but it was still a great nostalgia trip.\n\nAnd I find the harder difficulty of the game as a huge plus.

The challenge is what makes a game addicting, and I\u2019m so glad the devs gave us that challenge. \n\nIt's a beautiful game, and the early patches resolved the combat balance issues that put off some.

You can tell that a lot of care was put into the world. I really enjoy the platforming and puzzle aspect to this game. A lot of the puzzles are really clever and fun to try and decipher. \n\nThe biggest issue for me is the combat (I played on 4 stars until after the castle). There just isn't enough precision to do a lot of things the game is asking from you on the higher combat difficulties. Turning the character around is such a battle and sprinting is such a huge commitment. When there are 1-2 mobs on the screen it generally works fine, but as soon as more enemies come it turns into a huge cluster. Moves have too much self stun to really avoid a lot of attacks coming from different directions. Damage repeatedly comes in chunks equaling 30% of your health pool due to lack of i-frames and enormous recoil. Game was much more enjoyable when I just turned all the combat perks on.\n\nA few minor annoyances are the controls and the rarity of money. I get confused trying to remember what buttons to press to do certain actions. Money seems to be extremely hard to come by and a lot of the side quests require large amounts of it (plus buying gear upgrades).\n\nOverall, solid game.

Its a  bit like Zelda 2 in its style but also its got some really good flare of its own\ntheres a lot of enphasis on puzzle solving and exploration and by that i mean theres lots of stuff to explore thats very fun to explore. The first dungeon is a good example you go in the first time, you beat  the boss, get the thing and notice that theres more beyond the boss arena like more stuff to get afterweards. All throughout the dungeon there are things that you cant get past at that point in the game and you arent required to come back to the dungeon later at all but if you do youll find some more treasure, harder varitions of the types of puzzles you solved your first time around and at the end youll find another boss and some... interesting loot. The loot is actually worth a lot more lore wise than as a \"tangible rewards\" (though you do get a good reward later by giving it to someone).\nAlso, that last boss fight at the very very end of the first dungeon? Entirely skippable if you have the right tool by that point.\n\nThis brings me into the other thing i loved about this game. the progression in terms of its exploration is actually not that strictly to what you have on you. Theres lots you \"cant get to\" that you actually can if you use your tools in a tricky (and a bit convoluted) way which the game never tells you and that I just figured it out on my own and that felt really great!\n\nIt goes both ways too. you can get to certain places earlier both by getting enough of a certain collectible early enough in the game or by exploting your tools in clever ways and actually if you have other certain tools by the time you tackle some exploration segments you can use those to both skip puzzles and or solve them differently (more than once i actually just used the tools in a way to solve the puzzle in an entirely different and easier way that just felt right for me).\n\nIts somewhat like metroid where you can do a similar thing at some points but it felt distinct and memorable enough in this game since what you were bypassing or \"outsmarting\" were often times actually puzzles and not just traversal/platforming challenges.\nThe world and lore as well as some characters are very very enjoyable as well! The art  is charming, the soundtrack very memorable and the combat...\n\nWell thats one of few things i have issues with. It has a stamina bar that gets used by pretty much evertyhing except jumping (unless its out of the water) and if its empty you cant do anything until it refills past a certain point. this does get annoying in combat and specially in puzzles where your tools and attacks are used for sovling stuff but you gotta sometimes wait 2-3 seconds till it recharges which is a bummer \n\nAlso the game could definetly use some form of quest log or something. I sometimes lost track of certain quests I started and some quests I kinda knew were avaible but I didnt start them since it required to like talk to the same character 3 times to start it. Kind of a bummer but the wiki kinda saved me through all that so meh, its fine.\n\nAll in all this is an amazing game thats extremely easy to recommend and very enjoyable! Not perfect, there are a few issues but none that soured the experienced for me at all.

Here's my TL;DR- This is a Pseudo metroidvania, exploration, and puzzle game with unmatched atmosphere, solid gameplay, and solid combat. While the story is linear and it's not \"technically\" a metroidvania game, every ability you get unlocks a massive amount of new exploration, puzzles, and upgrades to find.\n\nAtmosphere: Simply unmatched. The artwork is unique, vibrant, and super charming with each and every area being unique & distinct, accompanied by music that is downright mouthwatering, some of the best I've ever heard in a game. The world is huge, dense, and incredibly alive- there are hundreds of NPC's that populate the gorgeous locations and every single one of them has a minimum of two lines of dialogue that directly contribute to the world in some capacity, no throw away lines.\n\nStory: Fantastic, but a little distracted. I love the concept and every aspect of it, but the main story (your entire village getting abducted by space pirates) is more-or-less ignored and instead you work to save the world from a separate force of hostile aliens. I think it works well, but it's a shame that this game wasn't popular and probably wont get a sequel following up on that \n\nCombat: Subjective. I loved it, but it does earn some criticism from most people and it's not undeserved. Unlike most 2d games, your character has momentum. You can't turn in the air, and once you've started moving in a direction it takes time to slow down and change directions. It lends meaning and weight to the movement system which I enjoy a lot, but others hate. What I do agree is kind of bad is that when you get hit there are no i-frames, and you REALLY bounce halfway across the room. Its very punishing for getting hit, although  the difficulty settings do let you adjust this combat quite a bit to make it much easier (which I recommend most people do). Overall, I think the combat is solid and people who nit-pick it are trying to work against is and play as though it's the same as other games when its not. You need to learn it and work with it before you see how well it actually works.\n\nExploration: Phenomenal. There are upgrades to be found in every single nook and cranny, and every single movement ability you get will unlock dozens upon dozens of new items to find. Some of these are VERY difficult to find, but if you like exploring I think it's more than worth your time.\n\nFinal verdict: One of the best games I've ever played. The amount of love the developers poured into this game is clear in every single scene and the experience absolutely reflects that. For me, this is a classic that I'll never forget. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675816766, "timestamp_updated": 1675816766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132314402": {"recommendationid": "132314402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165676512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2860, "last_played": 1675797952}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good visuals for a remake of a game that was formerly played in Flash, a lot of love was put into it.\nThe story ended with a cliff hanger to say the least.

But, within the first 10 hours of the game, I found myself constantly stopping to appreciate the extensiveness, charm and quality this game has. Every area is varied and full of life, the beautifully composed music scores range from sombre to exhilarating, the NPC's all have unique and interesting dialogues that make them worth stopping to read, every corner is full of secrets to find. There's a reason to explore and take in the world Phoenotopia has given you, like its an adventure in its own right.\n\nIt wasn't just that it surpassed my initially low expectations, making me give favour to it. It matched the quality of so many other games I've played and loved, on par with titles like Momodora/Minoria, CrossCode, Hollow Knight, Starbound, Katana Zero, etc. While maybe not in quantity, definitely in quality. Even during the down times of being lost for hours, to getting a headache over trying to figure out the puzzles, every second of the game was absorbed, fun, gorgeous, well designed and interesting. From the tight, engaging combat with clearly telegraphed but difficult bosses, to the quirky and adorable animations, to the beauty of the world itself, the multitude of varied and unique areas, themes, races and people. All of this beautifully weaved together without them feeling out of place, forced together or overly inspired (except the few blatant references to other games, which honestly, I'm a fan of it). While it's story was quite simplistic, it still had unexpected turns and twists that lead down paths I didn't think most games like it would, keeping me interested and making it all feel satisfying. Not to mention that the dialogues and events outside the story bits only added to the emotional investment in world itself and the characters. There was never a plain or dull moment.\n\nPhoenotopia is one of those games that occasionally pops up to remind me why I love games so much. The quality, allure and immersion a game can generate, how it can suck you in and take you on an adventure in a world full of life and charm, all from the amount of care, passion and thoughtful design the developers put into it.

The world is overflowing with a variety of secrets to find and puzzles to solve, with rewards ranging from money and common collectibles, to powerful unique items and interesting side quests. The most difficult puzzles (all optional) even required I use a pencil and paper to draw and write on. There is no quest log or waypoints, so figuring out side quests often is quite intrinsically rewarding, as you've got to figure it all out yourself. \n\nThe main complaints I've heard about this game are:\n1) The controls are janky/unintuitive because you can't turn in mid-air, sprint-jumps have a pre-determined arc, and you need to press the sprint button again after landing from a jump to continue a sprint.\n2) Over-reliance on stamina; sprinting, rolling, nearly all of the key items, and all melee attacks use stamina. This, combined with (1), makes platforming and combat overly difficult.\n3) There is no map screen while in dungeons, making them arduous and confusing.\n\nCombat in Phoenotopia: Awakening is relatively slow compared to other contemporary 2D action platformers. Most enemy attacks are either slow moving, or come with both audio and visual tells well before the attack happens. This means that the impact that (1) and (2) have on combat is less than it may appear. You are \"meant\" to take to combat with caution and an analytical eye, making sure you make the correct movements at the right times. Of course, good reaction time is important, it is just not the end-all-be-all. As for the whole \"being unable to turn in mid air\" thing, the aerial melee attack is more of a high-risk, high-reward thing (it does relatively high damage). It is safer to stay on the ground and use ranged weapons to attack things in the air.\n\nEven if you consider the combat overly difficult due to the controls, the game still can be accessible to you. Specifically, as I've already discussed, the main focus of the gameplay is on exploration. Similar to Super Metroid, (another came criticized for its janky controls), as long as you are regularly seeking upgrades, tanking your way through combat encounters is fairly viable. This becomes especially true if you stay prepared with healing food. While food takes time to eat, different foods take different amounts of time. Specifically, taking a dozen of food bits that heal only a little but are quick to eat can be quite easily used to heal in the middle of some of the hardest fights. \n\nThe game also does not have much precision platforming, so the pre-determined arc of the sprint jump is not really that big of a deal. If you want more control, a regular jump will give you that.\n\nAs for (3), most dungeons in the game have quite simple layouts, with many unique-looking rooms. I can see why the lack of a map could be problematic for some, but I personally didn't have any issues with it. I actually found it kind of fun; the absence of a map screen means that the level design has to do all of the heavy lifting to be interesting, memorable, and navigable.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1673846821, "timestamp_updated": 1673846821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130910275": {"recommendationid": "130910275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112669681", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 413, "playtime_forever": 2083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1675688543}, "language": "english", "review": "topkek", "timestamp_created": 1673796242, "timestamp_updated": 1676072377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130705372": {"recommendationid": "130705372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024002686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3156, "last_played": 1673539354}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest Metroidvania games to ever release.

There's a lot of history relating to this game originally being a flash based game and getting a new coat of paint and lots of love for over a decade, but I only wanted to quickly touch on that. \n\nAt it's core, Phoenotopia Awakening is quite the game for those of us seeking a classic experience in a new way. Not quite exactly like CrossCode, Phoenotopia feels familiar yet just different enough to intrigue those chasing nostalgia. The art design in this game is a pure joy with unbelievable amounts of details in small things that you could easily miss. The story & characters are extremely fleshed out and I've been enjoying seeing people from earlier segments in the game in different areas. Exploration in this is remarkable with it's world design.  Any time you see something out of place, make a mental note if you are unable to reach it. You'll be back, I promise. \n\nThis is a solid puzzle game as well, I've had to write down a few things to solve puzzles which is extremely rare these days. Do not google/use a guide until you've completely hit a wall you just cant get over and have come back to a few times to try and solve. The overall game design is extremely well done though the combat is a little janky until you adjust. Some may not like the amount of back tracking in this game, and that's fair. Phoenotopia Awakening is extremely hands off in assisting you, it will give you clues but you will need to remember them and do them at your own pace. \n\nSteam Deck Owners FYI: The game runs extremely well on deck, not sure why it says outright unsupported for it. There is no Sync & Achievements do not work, but the game plays great on it. You will need to adjust resolution up to fit screen but really needs to be set to yellow instead of gray for support on Steam Deck. \n\nTL;DR If you crave that indie feel in the same vein of CrossCode, don't sleep on this. The names hard to remember and doesn't stand out, but the game itself is certainly overlooked and well worth your time.

The overworld, towns, NPC hints, linearity of dungeons, and scattering of optional areas to stumble upon in the map resemble Zelda 2. But more importantly is that at no point over my 6 hours played have I felt like my character has progressed in any meaningful way. There's a general sluggishness and clunkiness imparted into every aspect of the gameplay that comes from several weak designs colliding at once - the lethargic stamina bar is an obvious flaw, but that didn't stop people from loving Secret of Mana. \n\nInstead, every interaction of movement, platforming, resource management, and combat are at constant clash with each other. You move slow, but your enemies are fast and small; your attack has minuscule reach, deals even less damage, and is barely improved by the extremely sparse weapon upgrades; platforming and box-pushing are everywhere, but you never get a ledge grab, or double jump, or wall jump, or anything that would make navigating previous environments easier or more satisfying. You have no block, no dodge, no i-frames, and get thrown around by a number of enemy attacks, despite the abundance of combat. You don't get Link's directional aerial attacks (or variety of spells) from Zelda 2, nor the usefulness those abilities entail - instead your aerial attack and ranged items have uncomfortably delayed responses that share no rhyme or reason. Bosses present bizarre difficulty spikes where they spam arena-covering attacks, simultaneously encouraging heal-item spamming while punishing the default setting of having to eat mid-combat as if it's monster hunter.\n\nLook I could keep going here, but I'll settle for saying that the \"game\" part just isn't fun. It's slow, tedious, limp, and stays that way - it's the first 30 minutes of every mediocre metroidvania when you have 0% percent of your arsenal, except that it never gets any better over the course of 6 hours.

The story is engaging. The world is huge and packed full of interesting characters and rich lore. There are a ton of puzzles, minigames and side quests outside the main story. The constant sense of wonder and exploration is probably the strongest aspect of this game. Even though the rewards for exploring are usually just one of three types of collectibles, it's more about the journey than the destination. The feeling of accomplishment when you finally crack a puzzle or uncover a hidden secret is great and present throughout the entire game.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the art and animations are incredibly cute, both for the pixelated sprites and the backgrounds. Great use of color, too. The dialogue is charming and full of little jokes sprinkled in. Some NPC dialogues change after certain events, which is something that most players won't even notice, but it's a nice touch. \n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I love how some tracks have \"calm\" and \"busy\" arrangements that transition smoothly into each other as you enter or leave a fight. I also love how the in-world flute songs are tied to the soundtrack (e.g. the GEO song and the Royal Hymn) and how themes are revisited in different tracks (e.g. Moonlight Ravine, Boss Battle and Mother Computer all quote the main menu melody). None of this is groundbreaking or anything, it's just done really nicely. (As an aside, I love that the composer went with relative minor instead of parallel minor for the \"sad\" Panselo theme. OK I'll stop nerding out about the music now.) \n\nIn terms of gameplay, I found it to be mostly smooth and satisfying. That said, I can see why most of the negative reviews focus on the controls. The sprint-jumping takes some time to get used to, and the tutorial for this mechanic is way too hard. The awkwardness of the controls becomes even more obvious during boss fights and the target shooting minigames. I played on PC and I found that aiming with the crossbow was nearly impossible without the mouse, which was weird and clunky for a game where I didn't need the mouse for the remaining 99% of the time. Then there was the \"accidentally detonating a bomb I meant to throw\" problem and the \"accidentally throwing a box I meant to put down\" problem. Maybe it's different on a controller, though. I know the game was originally designed for the Switch so maybe there is some unavoidable awkwardness when using a keyboard.\n\nDespite all of that, the controls didn't really hurt my enjoyment of the game. If I had to point out a problem with this game, it would be those stupid sliding picture puzzles, and the one with the screens you have to turn on. I have no idea how you're supposed to arrive at the solution other than guessing correctly. Most of the puzzles in this game are really clever and involve solving a riddle or using your tools to overcome an environmental challenge, and then there's like two or three which are \"hit the correct switches the correct amount of times\". Thankfully, these are optional puzzles.\n\nMy other major complaint is that there REALLY needed to be savepoints in the middle of the [spoiler] Royal Archives [/spoiler] and after the [spoiler] Mother Computer [/spoiler] fight. The first isn't too bad because you can backtrack to the previous savepoint, even though that's still annoying to have to do. The second is atrocious design. If you want to [spoiler] beat Katash [/spoiler] and you die, you have to repeat that entire segment! That's three boss fights in a row!

I usually turn that to zero or almost-zero in these games, but I left it on here (with a few exceptions, like the meeting the kids music that forces me to listen to that tune too long for their too-long conversation).\n\nBeing able to choose your difficulty and change it at any time is great. The game is very customisable in that way, but even the way the difficulties are presented to you are noticeably inefficient. First you are just given a choice of 5 star ratings for difficulty with no indication of what they mean. Then when you select one, the star menu disappears and you are given a character-by-character description of what your choice means for you, and you need to confirm it. You can cancel out of that if you like, and select a different difficulty and then read another character-by-character description. Why is it laid out this way instead of just giving you an instant description in the star menu as you hover the choices? I don't know, but this problem is a sign of things to come, as everything in the game seems to be set up with this mindset.\n\nThe combat is okay but generally below average. The melee combat, which you'll be using most of the time, is fairly straight forward and not super smooth. I was playing on the difficulty level that doesn't require energy most of the time (I tried it with energy being used at first, and that annoyed me a lot). The slingshot aiming is extremely weird - effectively like Yoshi's Island 2 aiming eggs, but the aim is slower and cannot be controlled in any way, and the shots you fire are slow and have a weird arc that I don't think the angry video game nerd would approve of.\n\nThe pacing sucks. This game has a lot of talking to NPCs and at first their conversations don't seem too long, but slightly more important NPCs have a lot more dialog and very little of that dialog is important. You start out just having to talk to your way around the opening town and it is very boring. I found my way out of that town by accident and I was grateful that I did. \n\nThen I had to learn some very complex moves very quickly, notably one that involved sprint-leaping repeatedly across 6 platforms, 2 or 3 of which were timed before they disappeared and I'd have to reset the puzzle. The problem here is sprint-leaping is not a matter of just holding sprint, there is a weird button combination of sprint-leap-land-sprint-leap-land that you have to do consecutively - but on short platforms, that is timed, at the beginning of the game. To begin with I thought this room was optional with some big gold at the top, but it is not optional. The buttons to perform all sorts of actions, not even complex ones are varied, odd choices. If I want to take a week-long break from the game, I will probably not remember how to pick up a box, and while I did place boxes down at my feet instead of throwing them a few times, I am still not sure how I did it.\n\nThe second biggest red flag for this negative review is a big one - there is no map. I got lost, and so will you, and no decent metroidvania should be without one. \n\nUltimately though, there is one last flaw which is going to prevent me playing this game entirely - I cannot work out cooking. I tried cooking about 10 different things over 3 separate cooking sessions, and everything I try to cook turns to poisonous fertilizer because I failed to cook it. I tried googling to work out the cooking minigame but I can't tell what I'm doing wrong. And if I can't cook, I can barely heal, and healing in this game is already not easy as it is.

I loved the first 16 hours, discovering new areas. Going back to the first dungeon with new items to discover new secrets. Doing some relaxing fishing. Doing side quests that are have pretty good dialog and world building. Just chatting to NPCs to get little flavor text that adds character. It is a joy to just experience, sadly that wasn't the whole game.\n\nThe last 10 hours has slowly grown from just annoying with enemies that spam range attacks and challenges that are just a bit too tight for the game's controls. To the last major boss, that was spamming 12 enemies at a time while the boss charges. So it becomes impossible to avoid damage, and the whole combat system falls apart.\n\nI pushed pass that, and into the next visually interesting area, sadly I now had a sense of dread for the game. The enemies have been more annoying flyers, tiny hard to hit enemies, and towers that basically stun lock you if you get close to them. Plus more annoying design elements like platforms that are just high enough that you need a perfect jump to reach them or putting 5 plus enemies into a tight arena with you while you are encouraged to use a ineffective gimmick weapon.\n\nThese harder elements reveal how clunky the controls are, how limited your attacks are, how quickly your stamina runs out, and the fact that you don't have I-frames after being hit so it's easy to eat 4 or 5 attacks from different enemies. The game mechanics don't hold up when the going gets tough, sadly even having the best equipment in the game doesn't help that.\n\nNow I hate playing the game. A single mistake might mean I get juggled halfway across the screen for 60+ damage(you start the game with 30 health). I miss playing the first 16 hours of the game. I don't have faith that the game will get any better from here.

Your movement when sprinting is unresponsive and your movement when not sprinting is slow, but the enemies all move and attack fast or have multiple projectiles (some of which detonate into further projectiles). You have a stamina bar that's spent on every action you perform other than walking, but you have no dodge or block and a very limited parry that only works on specific projectiles with no telegraph. Getting hit by almost any attack locks out your controls for at least half a second and can send you flying if the attack is arbitrarily forceful (as opposed to damaging) enough, but the conditions for triggering mercy invincibility are so asinine that it may as well not exist and the only way to recover from the flying animation is to have previous experience with either speedrunning or playing 2d fighting games competitively. You're expected to hit midair opponents in combat, but your ranged options glue you in place while aiming and the first of your ranged weapons uses a timing-based aiming system like it thought this was supposed to be a Paper Mario clone. You're expected to aim incredibly precisely out of combat, but the targeting reticule is glued to the end of an invisible selfie stick.\n\nSpecial mention to the spear, which you can't even aim but are still expected to hit precisely with it during combat to have platforms to stand on, when it has a delay before you throw it. And if you're within what feels like the entire top third of your jump height it'll be too high for you to stand on it, and you're only allowed two spears at a time and can't just undo the new one without breaking both. Which is especially awful if you're in the middle of a long climb.\n\nThen there are the straight up mean game design choices. Birds in the desert stealing your money in increments of 10 when there are multiple required purchases of over 100 currency; many NPCs with extremely specific multi-stage fetch quests, but no map or quest log; jumps across tiny platforms while being shot at, when any damage at all knocks you down and makes you start over; throwing 4 enemies with different attack patterns at you in a confined space so any attempt to avoid one attack sends you into 2 more, which stun you long enough to get hit by a follow-up from the one whose attack you dodged in the first place; an NPC in the third town who all the nearby NPCs [i]including himself[/i] imply is a scam artist, but actually sells possibly the single highest-impact upgrade in the game... You get the idea.\n\nAnd if you're going to design a boss for an action game that has thus far been punishing enough to make the player want to bring as many healing items to boss fights as they can carry, what you should [b]not[/b] do is let the boss cancel attacks into a dash that, if it hits, locks out the player's controls for almost [b]10 seconds[/b] while he steals one of the player's healing items and uses it on himself while taunting nonstop.\n\nThe accessibility options barely help - you can skip the cast time on healing items and mitigate stamina management issues, but the available healing remains bound to your inventory size and you don't get any new means of avoiding or mitigating incoming damage.\n\nI did mean it earlier when I said I want to like this game.

Every town and area are filled with NPCs and characters that really paint the picture and give it personality. The story in this game starts simple, but there's so much that gets built upon it. In a lot of games, I'm the kind of person to skip a lot of NPC dialogue.. but I ended up reading and talking to every NPC in this game. None of the dialogue is boring. Every line of text I've read in this game has personality. There's just so much life poured into the game and I love it so much.\n\nThe music is fantastic too. The game is loaded with amazing songs left and right. The music gives ambience to each area. I could listen to the OST all day and not get tired of it.\n\nThe boss fights are very fun and pretty difficult. The battle system is simple, but has tons of room for mastery. There's so many ways you can approach the fights in this game and boss theme is a massive banger too. Each boss has their own flavor, mechanic, and environment. Every boss I fought was such a blast and I wish I could fight them again from the beginning. \n\nThe puzzles really make you think too. There's so much to do in this game, and tons of puzzles. The game really makes you investigate or get creative with the puzzle solutions. Sometimes it does get frustrating when trying to figure out the complicated ones, but all of the puzzles in the game are very fair- and it feels really good when you figure out it out and this game does a very very good job at making you feel that satisfaction.\n\nAnd then you have the world and exploration. There's a lot of backtracking you can do as you progress and obtain more tools, and it's not just a simple backtrack and obtain-an-item kind of thing either. Backtracking reveals so many new areas that were hidden even in the very first dungeon in the game. It's as if there's a dungeon within a dungeon, and it's very easy to get absorbed in the exploration.

I've beaten it twice, both times with 100% items, and one of them doing a 0% sub-4 hour speedrun before getting 100%. This is a game that is extremely good and not everyone is going to like.\n\nIt's a metroidvania. Any comparisons to Zelda 2 end at the overworld and random encounter design. The majority of the game is comprised of small areas (and large ones) that are broken up by the large map you move around in. From the very beginning, you are able to run around anywhere you can see and explore it. The sense of exploration in this game is pretty unparalleled. If you can think to go somewhere or try to reach a spot, even unconventionally, there's a high chance you can do it. The only guidance you are given is a general idea of where to go, and you need to talk to NPCs to learn more about each area. There's always someone to talk to who will tell you something to try. You just go do things, and there are a ton of things to do. Related to this: there is no map. This is something that may put people off, but the game is designed tightly. Each area you go to has clearly distinct rooms and doesn't suffer from the lack of map in any noticeable way. If you know where you want to be, you can get there. At most, you may want to note down places of interest to return to later. You explore in the overworld, find small areas to explore in 2D, and that's the formula.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. You can run, jump, crawl, roll, and hit things. Combat involves beating things up by spamming hits or playing it cool and going for aerial/charge attacks, which are more effective. People who run in and spam only light attacks are going to have a bad time. You can also prepare for exploration by cooking food (dropped by enemies or the environment) and buying better gear. Money is well-balanced; if you explore, you get enough money to afford things you want without much issue. If you don't, you're not going to have any. The exploration itself is usually finding a new place and doing puzzles in it, with combat generally scarce outside of overworld encounters. Most of your time is going to be spent looking for things and solving environmental puzzles that are almost all well-designed. Some answers are hidden in the background, some are logic puzzles, but there's always something to see. The pacing of major usable item upgrades is also done really well. You'll be getting a new tool to use in a pretty steady stream.\n\nThe music is extremely good. I don't know why the game has the right to have such good music, but it does. Some of it is stuff I don't care for, but even the tracks I don't like fit very well, with only one or two exceptions. And there's a lot of music. Tracks are generally not repeated and are unique to their area. I bought the soundtrack and kept about a fourth of the music in the game. This is unusual for me, and I almost never keep more than a few tracks out of an OST. The amount of variety in tracks is really bizarre in that I have no idea how the composer was good at creating such a wide spread of music.\n\nFor the graphics, they're pretty nice. Character sprites are more basic than they maybe need to be, but they're perfectly readable and well-animated. The environments all look good, as you should be able to see in the screenshots on the store page. This was originally a Flash game, which I did not play, but all of the graphics are retooled and clean. Visual information is clearly communicated to the player any time it needs to be. I don't have a lot to say about graphics\u2014they're not that important. You can see them for yourself.\n\nThe story and writing itself: every NPC has something to say, and usually it's a joke that ranges from \"okay\" to \"kind of funny\", and that's totally fine. Some of them exist only to be jokes, and some will give you useful information while also being jokes. The presentation of dialogue is good, and there's none of that really obnoxious feeling you get from amateur writing. You know the type, where everything is trying super hard to be trendy and wacky. That doesn't happen here. The humor is enjoyable throughout. The plot beats themselves are actually good. Everything follows a natural progression, beginning with your entire village being abducted and going logically from there as you look for solutions. The scale of the story is a gradual build that's done very well, and while the actual events themselves are nothing incredibly special, it's nice to just have a game that's honest about what it wants to be and do. Phoenotopia doesn't try to be more than it is, and it drops many hints as to where it's going the entire time. It's the kind of narrative that begins small and grows bigger and bigger until it's encompassing some very large territory, but it plays it close to the chest the entire time without completely tripping over its own feet. It's something I wish more stories were capable of.\n\nI can't really overstate how good this game is at letting the player do what they want. You want to go explore something? You can probably do that. You want to ignore the main story for a long time and sequence break to a new area you shouldn't be, detouring for 5-10 hours? You can do that. You want to just go fish for a while? You can do that. There are constant rewards for exploring. There are legitimately only two complaints I can leverage at this game, which are that some enemies can remove your hair dye for absolutely no reason other than causing annoyance (since you can reload the loss away anyway), and the speed of stamina regeneration would probably have been better served as a percentage than a flat value, as lategame stamina regen can take 10 seconds. There are ways around this, of course, but it's still a little excessive. That's it. Everything else I just really like a lot. I've played loads of metroidvanias, and this is up there with the best of them on the merit of its exploration prowess alone.

I don't use positive rating values for games that are meh or just \"not bad\". People don't seek out games that are meh or not bad, they want games that are fantastic, games that are mediocre but get positive ratings dilute the ability to sort through what's great and what's not. In any case, my neutral / bad rating is based on a few of the game's, imho, biggest problems.\n\n1. The first is the checkpoint system. When you die in the game, you can only return back to where you last saved, and if that save point is before a really annoying (though a game shouldn't have really annoying, challenging sure, but not really annoying -- there's a difference) point and you die and there was not a place you could save up to that point, guess what? Yup, you're doing that really annoying part again.\n\n2. The first city you come across after the initial starting city is WAY WAY too big, it's overwhelming the number of people to talk to, the number of buildings you can go in, etc. This would be fine if each building and person had a purpose, but it's mostly just fluff. You're told to come to the city to find someone, so you wander the city for massive periods of time going in and out of each room and building trying to find the person, talking to each person, JUST to find this specific person you're supposed to talk to. It feels like such a damn chore and is torture. It wouldn't be so bad if the city itself wasn't so cluttered with background decoration and it was more obvious who to talk to and the other people and buildings had a purpose but for side-quest type of things. However, to be -forced- into talking to every single person and going in and out of every room in every building is just obnoxious and wears the player out pretty quick. Bad design. Do NOT force a player into your extra fluff, allow them to explore that should they want to.\n\n2 b? . You spend so much time in the city mentioned in #2 that you get sick of hearing the same music and sick of seeing the same motif. Once you've managed to move the game forward a little you're still stuck in that same \"theme\". I think the title of this number could be called \"Pacing is completely off\". If that's not bad enough, just getting TO that second town feels like a real slog. \n\n3. The game is VERY grindy in terms of coins (called Rin in the game). Items, that are abilities, are locked behind purchases at vendors requiring lots of coins. Coins only drop from things like boxes being destroyed or chests. Even then, while the chests don't reappear after being destroyed, the boxes do but they then only drop a single coin.\n\n4. The sprint mechanic. Wow is this bad. You hit shift and your character dashes forward. Continue holding down the direction and your character keeps moving, but jump and land and you go back to walking despite holding down shift still. You have to release shift, land, then hold down shift again. This is absolutely horrendous and becomes obvious how bad that is pretty early on in the game when you're introduced to the spring mechanic and have a timed zig-zag vertical jumping bit. Just imagine that. You hit shift and your character dashes and you can't jump without it toggling back off as soon as you land. This is absolute hell for a tight /small area to move in and a very small amount of time zig-zag obstacle course where you're switching directions multiple times. \n\nOverall, the game really just fell flat for me. The game just wasn't fun for me. I don't know what it was but it just wasn't \"fun\". The story was \"meh\", and trying to at least just get a good story out of the game, and forget about the game not being \"fun\", by moving the game forward was a chore due to the problems mentioned above. What story I could get was not nearly interesting enough to make me want to keep pushing through. (Though, why should any game make the player feel they are just \"pushing through\"?) I feel like the game was missing \"something\" but I can't figure out what specifically it was beyond just saying it wasn't \"fun\". I guess this is one of those times where someone would label a game as \"uninspiring\" and the problems mentioned above only detract from an already very mediocre experience.", "timestamp_created": 1662313456, "timestamp_updated": 1662313456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480314940214157104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121733151": {"recommendationid": "121733151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833491450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2278, "last_played": 1662292656}, "language": "english", "review": "i absolutely loved the game, everything is great. the music are nice, the combat and platforming are great, some bosses and enemies are annoying to fight tho. also going around the map takes a bit of time without teleporters which is annoying too sometimes. the pixel art are cute, so adorable, and just so charming!\nthe story is fine, not the best but i was definitely hooked. some of the areas are just painfully annoying to go through, but like 90% are okay. i really do wish theres a sequel! i hope you guys make it someday! thank you for making this!", "timestamp_created": 1662297042, "timestamp_updated": 1662297042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121629820": {"recommendationid": "121629820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123293662", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 8623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 193, "playtime_at_review": 7853, "last_played": 1700346703}, "language": "english", "review": "Every few years, there comes a game that reminds me why I play video games.

It's that special kind of game that will stick with you for the rest of your life.\n\nIt's quite possibly my favourite game of all time. It's not for everyone, but it's more than worth a try.

There's a ridiculous amount of dialogue for a metroidvania style of game, and the backgrounds and environments are surprisingly detailed.

The quests instructions in the game are pretty minimalist, leaving the player to figure a lot out on their own. And on top of that the combat and platforming can be pretty challenging even when just traveling from point A to point B. There will absolutely be points where you die and lose a significant progress and it feels like an old school through and through.\n\nThe game has a wonderful sense of exploration.

I played the flash version so I was hyped when I heard about the remake. With that said, I can't recommend this game. It feels like the best worst game I've ever played. Much of this review, such as the points about fantastic music and art and the clunky mechanics, echoes other negative reviews so I won't go into much detail there.\n\nThe Good (great, even)\n-Sound and music. Whether lighthearted, cheery, wacky, intense, creepy, or somber, the music and sound fx do a great job setting the atmosphere.\n-Visual design, both characters and the world. I'm a huge fan of the pixel art style. The enemy design is reminiscent of Cave Story, one of my favorite games.\n-Cute characters with endearing and/or funny dialogue. The various antagonists don't do bad stuff just for kicks.\n-World building. There's a lot of interesting stuff going on, like the idea of humanity getting back on their feet and rebuilding after a calamitous war and the existence of a faction that controls the progression of tech so such a war doesn't happen again.\n\nThe Bad\n-Clunky controls, making for awkward/frustrating combat and movement. You have to come to a full stop to charge your heavy attack or to make a ranged attack.\n-Getting knocked around every time you stub your toe. Incredibly painful when trying to do platforming while turrets are shooting or enemies are jumping at you, and the aforementioned clunky controls mean you can't jump while shooting your crossbow or slingshot at enemies, compounding the issue.\n-MASSIVELY disappointing ending. [spoiler]The intro of the game tells you about the Phoenix, a powerful weapon which ended the Great War long ago. To save your world again, this time from a hostile alien force, you seek out the Phoenix with help from a friendly alien faction. You learn more about the Phoenix Project over the course of the game, and there is foreshadowing that some people, such as the protag Gale, have inherited Phoenix powers, making them unusually strong, and it is thusly revealed that the Phoenix isn't a singular weapon, but that there are many Phoenixes, and they are basically superpowered humans. So imagine my surprise when I fought the final final boss and lost to it, and it turned out to be optional because one of the Phoenixes is successfully woken up and saves Gale's butt, which feels like such a slap in the face since Gale is a Phoenix too and didn't need any help fighting to get this far even without awakening (haha) to her true powers. And then in the end credits scene we see her flying around like superman. It seems like a huge missed opportunity to not have her to awaken to her Phoenix powers and beat the snot out of the final boss to give us a taste of what a true Phoenix is capable of. And we never even found Gale's kidnapped family/friends/neighbors which is just, why??? It feels like Gale's original goal was completely forgotten in place of a lame save-the-world-from-an-alien-invasion plot.[/spoiler]\n-A nitpick: [spoiler]The first time you encounter one of the decrepit robots in the flash version it's downright terrifying, but in Awakening it feels underwhelming, and I can't really put my finger on why.[/spoiler]\n\nThis was clearly a passion project.

When the war finally ended, the few humans left decided to move to underground shelters and stay there, while nature recovered, now with its new residents created by humanity. ^^\n\nMany years later, humanity returns to the surface and begins to re-colonize this world, so familiar and yet so different. In this new world lives a young orphan girl with pink hair named Gail who lives in the orphanage in the small village of Panselo, having a quiet life helping to take care of the other children as she is one of the oldest. Everything was going well until one day that Gail needs to go to the forest in search of the other children who went to play, and which some of the children convince her to enter an ancient temple in search of a meteor that fell inside the temple, request which Gail answers, after all she really wants a new stuffed pony. But nothing prepared her for what she and the other children would see as they left the temple, a ship far more advanced than anything they had ever seen, appearing out of nowhere and capturing every adult in the village. ^^\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ A vibrant and colorful world with all kinds of places to explore, from caves to forests, from hot deserts to villages with cherry blossoms, all very beautiful and lived with their own inhabitants and creatures.\n+ Well done Pixelated art, which combined with good animations makes the world even more alive and unique.\n+ Very funny and charismatic characters, everyone always has at least two dialogues to say, so I recommend talking to everyone at least twice and having fun with their lines and ideas.\n+ Music suitable for each environment that combine very well, in addition to being relaxing and helping to set the tone of each location.\n+ Many items to find and use during the adventure, as well as many ingredients that can be cooked to create various gastronomic delicacies, some of the description had make my mouth water.\n+ An unusual and very fun story, which takes our young protagonist to explore the most different corners of the world, encountering dangers and challenges but never losing her good humor and fun.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Achievements need to be redeemed within the game's achievements menu to be unlocked on Steam, so it's possible, as happened to me, to end up forgetting about them until you have several accumulated.\n- Manual save and only at certain points, which can be a little stressful, when we explore many places but we run out of life and because we haven't made a recent save, we have to explore everything again.\n\n[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]\nThis is how Gail's adventure begins, in a mix of adventure with platform, having to leave her small village while the other children take care of the place, leaving Gail free to go to the most varied places, from forests to caves, from sparkling lakes. to scorching deserts, always looking for information about the mysterious ship that took all the adults in the village, always accompanied by his faithful bat to protect herself, after all the world is full of monsters and creatures, but nothing that a few well-placed blows can't solve. ^^\n\nBut this doesn't have to be a solitary adventure, after all along the journey Gail will meet the most varied types of people with the most varied types of personalities, some of which are quite fun, including the vast majority of these people having two options for dialogue, being for so I recommend always talking to everyone at least twice, who knows what they will have to say. It's something as good as good conversation is good food, and Gail can find several ingredients along the journey that she can cook when she finds a fire and make the most diverse dishes to recover life, and I must say that the description of some really left me hungry. ^^\n\n[h1] Art and sound[/h1]\nProduced by the Cape Cosmic studio that produced a very beautiful pixelated art, in which it is possible to recognize each of the characters being some of them very unique, as well as each of the cities with its own charm, and also the animations, many of them pretty and cute, my sincere congratulations to the team that took care of the art. In the soundtrack part we have light and fun songs that in my opinion match the light theme of the story, making a good combination of music with art. ^^\n\n[h1] Conclusion[/h1]\nPhoenotopia: Awakening was a fun surprise for me, I started a short time ago, but I really liked what I've seen so far of this world that has a somewhat dark story at the beginning, but then brightens up in a fun and colorful world where we explore looking to bring back the normality of the village and home of our little but brave protagonist with pink hair, who despite her young age already knows how to defend herself from monsters, and loves stuffed ponies. ^^\n", "timestamp_created": 1660416077, "timestamp_updated": 1660416077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60800856351852417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120175016": {"recommendationid": "120175016", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071751606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3847, "last_played": 1659995434}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encant\u00f3 el dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico del juego, para ser tipo pixelado las escenas son bastante buenas, a d\u00eda de hoy el juego me parece una obra maestra.", "timestamp_created": 1659808588, "timestamp_updated": 1659808588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120149024": {"recommendationid": "120149024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157386812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6540, "last_played": 1659769786}, "language": "english", "review": "Followed ever since the flash game.

There're some difficulty settings to make it less annoying but I wanted to experience the game without them. I would also recommend the devs disable the \"you might want to lower the difficulty\" message post-death after a few times (or make it appear every X deaths), which was one of the reasons I could've seriously dropped it for (it took me a while to find there's a setting that turns it off forever).\n\nNow, imo this game has something not many titles can claim: it has a certain charm of its own. Every character has a personality or quirk that sets them apart. The world might come up as \"tiny\" until you realize there're plenty of places to explore and things to do. Some of the side quests might have you helping a random character and later seeing little changes on some of the areas; or sometimes there's not a noticeable change in the world but they still feel meaningful. There's one particular cutscene on the desert town that is very endearing and I would've loved to see it again later. Thankfully, there's YouTube.\n\nThe music is top tier and I really like most of the soundtrack. The battle pieces are epic and don't get boring, the calm music is relaxing, and each place has its own thing. There're plenty of tracks I got to love, sometimes ending up staying in an area just to hear them for a bit. You later get an instrument which lets you play some of the pieces for different effects, much like Ocarina of Time.\n\nThere're also many puzzles, whether to traverse an area or to get an item. Some are clearly shown as puzzles (a specific type of dungeon), and others are not plain to the eyes. A few of them involve playing specific notes on the instrument, others require moving boxes, and some intended solutions might involve using the enemies. I might've done several of the puzzles in a non-intended way, oops.\n\nWhile yes, sometimes the combat or the platforming were a bit too annoying, the bosses often have a special \"thing\" you can do which makes the fight less brute-forcey. I do suggest going for a max health / stamina run if you're going with the higher difficulty (a hard requirement for the hardest, optional boss), and trying to max out / get most of the equipment available.\nThe main weapon is a melee bat which takes a bit getting used to (not sure I got used to it tbh), and later you'll find some secondary weapons which you might find easier to use.\n\n\nOverall, I think the game is really good once it gets going. There're plenty of places to explore, things to do, people to get to know. I found myself wanting to know what came \"next\", what was at the end of the dungeon, what else to learn about the world. I was surprised when I learned it didn't sell well, but I also happened to found it by accident.

Like a see a few other mention: I really wanted to like the game, but in the end it ended up being a bad experience.\n\nI'll start with the good:\n- The pixel art is wonderful!\n- The music is nice.\n- The game has quite a few interesting mini-games and puzzles that I enjoyed.\n- Has content that makes it more versatile, and not just all combat. \n- The story itself is not too bad, but the execution could have been better.\n- The movement (walking / running) alone feels fluid.\n\nThe bad:\n- The combat is sluggish, and your main weapon, a baseball bat, is borderline useless in many scenarios due to horrible range and a startup lag (especially when trying to use it in air) that really makes it hard to utilize for anything that is not just a sitting duck. You can charge it, but it will make you move in 1/4th of your walking speed, and the charge is gone if you try to jump. I really do like a challenge, but this game is challenging because your lack of control with your character, and not the enemies themselves. I really don't mind dying if I feel like I die because I am simply not skilled enough, but here I feel the frustration of dying due to a horrible combat experience. I ended up rarely using the bat in any combat where the enemies are in motion due to this problem, and in general I ended up just wanting to avoid any combat when possible.\n\n- There are a lot of characters, but they doesn't seem to be relevant for a long time, and most of them are forgettable.\n\n- There is an energy gauge that is required for everything. When you run, or just do a basic attack, you use some of your energy. When the energy is gone you have to wait 1-2 seconds before it starts to recharge.

The towns alone are full with color and motion, and really feels like the world is alive, and keeps you engeged... but unfortunately, games are an interactive media, and you also need to play it.\n\nIt takes moving around after waking up to already have alarms ringing in your head, as you're automatically going to notice a 0.25-0.5 second delay between imput an action, and that's just the beginning. This delay is pretty brutal as the game goes on, since it messes up with the running in small spaces and aerial melee attacks become unreliable at low altitudes. This last part in particular is a serious problem since flying explosive robots like to ram at you at a low angle, which is hard to defend against with melee aerial and takes too much time with the crossbow due to how the reticle is stuck in horizontal position and ignores small increases (for example, if you want to shot at 15\u00ba up, the reticle will remain horizontal until you reach the 30\u00ba, and from there you lower to 15\u00ba, wasting your time in corrections). Also, Gail [spoiler]in spite of supposedly being a super soldier with near unlimited power[/spoiler] lacks iframes when hurt and has a deceptively large hurtbox, which will become a bigger problem in certain rooms as you move on. Been reading some comments after finding myself in this situation, and find it rather hilarious that the game shills even acnowledge this situation by saying everyone's approach to the game is wrong and you're actually supposed to pick an area where you can use ranged attacks and move as little as possible.\n\nProbably the thing that finally broke the camel's back is the last stretch, where you're supposed to fight a gauntlet of 2.5 bosses, in which failing results in having to go through an annoying text each time in the first, and the last one sends you to credits regardless if you won or not. Everything good the game did with it's presentation and flow are basically wasted by the dev's approach to action being about testing the player's patience and tolerance to annoyance. I'm certain that someone with the patience of a saint and undying loyalty to the game will find a way to go against the controls and manage to zero hit run all bosses, that's a given and always happens; but for most people, if the game feels like it doesn't want to be played, trying to tame those bad controls are not a fun activity, and having fun (or rather, lack of it) is what this all ultimately boils down to.", "timestamp_created": 1656814545, "timestamp_updated": 1656814978, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474244594573974609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118087741": {"recommendationid": "118087741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118686066", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1661191029}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cute game with a cute style and animations, and it's one of the games that I really try to enjoy, but it doesn't hit me on the right spot.\n\nSome of my thoughts I had while playing through the first 2 areas:\n- The game feels very generic and lengthy, or at least has a very slow start, There wasn't much going on and you stay with the same equipment for a long while. Several gameplay elements introduced in the first area seem to stay the same over the rest of the game, and in some cases also start to feel redundant. Grinding enemies for money also becomes stale with the same basic equipment over 8 hours.\n- There's only 1 item slot, which you use for all your secundaire items and healing items. The circle helps a little to quick swap them, but that swapping has to be done continiously. I think the game would play much smoother if you had one or two more active item slots.\n- Combat itself also has it's issues, mostly the energy requirement for a basic attack, the main attack been a very short-ranged bat against rather mobile enemies. and the rather beefy enemies that drains through your stamina quick.\n\nThe Story introduction and the music is nice, as well as the aforementioned artstyle and animations, but the rest...idk, they don't appeal to me as much as I had expected from the trailer.", "timestamp_created": 1656796240, "timestamp_updated": 1661192512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117977144": {"recommendationid": "117977144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219146139", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1654, "last_played": 1656657619}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried to like this game, but found far too many little issues to really enjoy it.

I also couldn't do any of the timed puzzles, or the trials in the second area, I have really bad timing and coordination skills, and there's no accessibility options to help with that.

This is a game that clearly had a lot of ideas in production, but the ones they chose to focus on for the final product were all of the wrong choices. \n\nThe first indicator that the game was built on the wrong idea is combat, which is a chore, especially early on. Your stamina recovers so slowly that you spend far too much time running around waiting for a chance to actually attack. Stamina only drains on attacking or dashing, so you can run and jump to your hearts content. There is no dodge mechanic, so your only option is to jump to avoid attacks, many of which are either very fast or have splash damage in the form of very small rubble. Damage can combo up quickly, and with no aerial recovery you are at the mercy of the game if you get hit. To add insult to all of this, most combat in the game gives no real reward. Enemies might drop a small amount of money or the occasional item (which is almost always food), but with a criminally small inventory space you will find yourself either tossing items or leaving them behind regularly. \n\nThe second is made clear by looking at the splash art for the game. The characters shown there are almost all insignificant to the story. Birdy plays almost no role in the game and only appears once. The kobold is the same and only appears twice. Bart is not physically seen until the very last scene of game. And these are the characters they chose to be the front page? The artwork in the game also prominently features characters who all disappear at the beginning. \n\nThis, plus the ending of the game, speak to the devs having a grand idea for an overarching story, but the story we actually play is mismatched and taped together.

Just finished it after 50+ hours and I have literally no idea on how could a gem like this fly under my radar for so long.\n\nThink \"Cave Story\" with better story, better NPCs, more environmental variety, and Zelda-like items and puzzles. \n\nPositives:\n-Great worldbuilding and lore.\nI personally liked how it is exposed to the player: By exploring areas and interacting with NPCs outside the main story path. Collecting tidbits of info from conversations, journals and simple environment observation.\n-Great sci-fi main story. Though it starts deceptibly cliched and simple. \nThe town of the protagonist, a young girl named Gail, is attacked. And everyone in it is kidnapped. Only Gail and the kids of the local orphanage are left, since they were playing in a nearby forest when the deed happened. So she grabs her baseball bat and slingshot, and hurries to seek help at the nearest town. From that point things escalate, and in her search for the missing adults he starts to discover hidden and dark secrets about her civilization.\n-Quirky, cartoony, and yet very well written NPCs.\n-Rewarding exploration and sidequests.\n-Very clever spatial reasoning puzzles.\n-Awesome '16 bit' era music.\n-Great stamina based combat system. Though it requires a bit of practice and is kinda hard to get initially.\nUsing the melee attack or any other combat equipment drains the stamina meter, which recovers over time. Initially only the short range melee attack is available, though the game introduces better and ranged combat items later on.\nEnemies don't deal contact damage, so the short range is not really an issue. Also, jumping or moving has no stamina cost at all, the trick is knowing the attack patterns of each enemy, approach them with the best positioning and weapon, flail at them until the stamina runs out and 'dodge' their attacks by merely jumping or moving out of their attack hitboxes. \nYou can also heal during combat by eating food, though it leaves Gail open to attacks for an instant, or a long while depending on the food.\n- Minigames: There are several minigames and activities, such as fishing or cooking to prepare different healing and boosting consumables. The fishing minigame is specially fun and clever.\n\nNegatives:\n-Pixel art design is kinda hit and miss. Some enemies and environments are awesome, but for some reason the main character has an extremely simple design.\n-No maps at all. Areas are easy enough to remember and navigate, but it still would have been a good feature to have.\n-No journal to keep track of sidequests, good ol' paper and pencil are required. Not that bad, since they also help with the most complex puzzles.\n\nFair warning: The game is old school HARD. Though it has a great panel of accesibility options to enable/disable, so you can customize the experience to your liking. Eg: Greater stamina regen, no stamina cost for the regular attacks, auto-save, etc...\n\nSeriously, if you enjoy story-oriented metroidvanias like Cave Story or Iconoclasts, then give this one a chance, it deserves way more recognition.", "timestamp_created": 1648836172, "timestamp_updated": 1648839146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113102722": {"recommendationid": "113102722", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015772059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2677, "last_played": 1654738423}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this game is good, but not great. [strike]But as I'm a Negative Nelly, I ended up writing too much about my minor issues with the game.[/strike]\n\nIt's held back by a number of small issues that minorly inconvenience the player. Accessibility options can help with some of them, but not all (as someone who played without them, I suggest using them unless you're achievement hunting or always play on hard mode). I think the most annoying issue is the fast travel system, which is much slower than it needs to be and is locked behind optional collectibles that are also used for item upgrades. Another issue is there is no quick way to retry many challenges immediately; you have to see their dialogue from the beginning. These are different ways that the game makes it longer to traverse and backtrack with no extra challenge, and quite frankly it took me a while for the game to click for me. But once it did, I stopped caring about these issues, and just started enjoying myself.\n\nThe presentation is gorgeous. There are some legitimately amazing areas that I had to take in once I saw them, and I'm not the person to do that in games basically ever. The soundtrack compliments the graphics wonderfully. The load times are very fast, as one would expect from a pixel graphics title, but it's very welcome here. Dialogue from all of the NPCs is charming, and the world felt like a standout character. They really made me adore some of the sidequests in this game. There are some fun (mostly minor) sequence breaks that I was able to do, which makes me think this is probably a good speed game for anybody into that. There are goodies all over the place, so you'll find a bunch without having to go out of your way, but there are even more off the beaten path (sometimes even in places I thought the devs would have ignored!). The equipment you get is pretty cool; my favorites were the Bombs, Spear, and then the more late/endgame stuff. There are some really fantastic screens to complete, and there are some really awful ones (mostly optional at least). I loved it, and I hated it. But really, I liked it.\n\nStory spoilers and thoughts on the ending that I'm still keeping really vague:\n\n[spoiler]The narrative starts out very strong and sets you off into the world, where it mostly takes a back seat to the exploration or serves as a justification for going to some place you wanted to visit anyway, which I liked. So for most of the game, the narrative wasn't really a big deal to me. But quite frankly the ending is unsatisfying and a bit rushed. I didn't even realize I was at the final boss since it felt like there should have been more. As the exploration and world is ultimately much more important here, I don't think it's awful or anything but it is disappointing that it doesn't finish stronger.[/spoiler]\n", "timestamp_created": 1648705081, "timestamp_updated": 1648705081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112793399": {"recommendationid": "112793399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144411678", "num_games_owned": 816, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 2576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1684613572}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant, well-balanced side-scrolling action.

Its so cool to explore the same world but so different. If you're here for the atmosphere, you won't be disappointed. The only thing i dislike about this game (though this extends to the original) is how bad combat feels. There is no way to dodge attacks except by using the tried and true method of not touching enemies. But that doesn't work in this type of game. Along with that, your ranged options are terrible, at best, they deal half as much damage as your melee, which i could live with if the enemies weren't also annoying as fuck. Every single enemy either zips around, does 30 million damage, or both at the same time (this is obviously exaggerating, early game enemies are very easy). But its just not fun to fight anything. Another reason for that is your super super short range melee. You have to see the pores of your goddamn enemy to hit them with your bat, its ludicrous. I could deal with that if maybe instead of just a horizontal rectangle hitbox, Gale would swing it in an angle so i could  hit those annoying fuckers above me without having to jump. \n\nPros: Amazing story and atmosphere\n\nCons: Horrible combat and no goddamn puzzle bosses.

It's not as difficult as games like Hollow Knight or Celeste but it is much, much more frustrating. Enemies feel like they were designed around a far more nimble and capable player character, and the Souls-style stamina system generally only forces you to waste time waiting around every so often rather than adding any real tactical tradeoffs. Certain critical combat abilities are hidden behind optional upgrades, which is great if you find them but makes the game even more frustrating if you don't. The difficulty/accessibility options make the game a little less tedious and frustrating in some aspects but they don't address the core problems with the design and controls.\n\nThat said, if you can tolerate frustrating combat and some general gameplay jankiness then there's a lot to like here. There's a huge world that is fun to explore, with lots of secrets to find. The various environments are visually distinct and look great. The character animations also look great. The soundtrack is very good. Towns are lively and full of NPCs that have more interesting dialogue than most games of this type. There's some Metroidvania-like ability progression, where tools from later in the game let you find new things in earlier areas.

It was a game that I kept coming back to and even made a Newgrounds account for so I could get all the achievements. When it was announced that there would be a sequel to it, I knew I would happily pay full price when it was released. It was so good that I wanted to support the creator.\n\nPhoenotopia Awakening expands on its predecessor and offers a lot more gameplay and story.

I still haven't finished the game as life got busy, but I will absolutely go back to 100% it later.\n\nThe art is so cute. The soundtrack is darling. The story and world aren't super original, yet it feels fresh and incorporates twists and new content to a story we've seen before. It's similar to the different games in the Legend of Zelda series that build on the same basic plot points. The controls take a little getting used to. I'll admit that I recall the original Phoenotopia's controls were more more manageable because they were simpler, but I think the new controls aren't terribly taxing; they just need some getting used to. It evolved along with the game and its platforms.

The sheer amount of content, collectables, and stuff to do is outstanding. [/h1] \n\n[h2] Worldbuilding - 9/10 [/h2]\nThe post-apocalyptic medieval world feels enormous and lively, and actually is enormous. There must be hundreds and hundreds of NPCs across all the different towns and locales, each with their own story to listen to and often quests and tasks to help with. Although the game is focused on one \"nation\", you get the feel for a much larger world outside. Within the nation you explore so many diverse sub cultures and social groups that it's hard not to love everything about the world of Phoenotopia. The more \"serious\" questions about the past and the war that reset history are also slowly explored if you put in the effort to seek them out. The tone of the world is a bit lighthearted, and sometimes this is sharply at odds with some of the darker and more serious subject matter, but this isn't a catastrophic flaw.\n\n[h2] Plot - 5/10[/h2]\nThe plot doesn't quite live up to the worldbuilding. When you look back at it from the end, the plot development is very simple and not particularly engaging. In particular, near the start of the game, you are given a task of \"find what happened to your village\", which isn't even addressed or developed until you beat a large 10 hour segment. After that point the pacing picks up, which is great, but there aren't really any narrative twists to add spice.\n\n[h2] Combat - 7/10 [/h2]\nThe real-time platformer-style combat consists of selecting the appropriate weapon, dodging attacks and projectiles using jumps and rolls, and returning fire, all the while managing your stamina bar. Even more advanced techniques are unlocked later that provide a nice variety and power at the cost of difficulty. \n\nMy only issue with the combat is the emphasis on knockback attacks. Many enemies can knock you a screen or two away, often into other enemies who do the same, putting you in a kind of stun lock. There is a technique you learn for avoiding these \"tumbles\" but it's really quite tricky to perform. In addition, being knocked so much [i] often [/i] results in you being knocked off-screen, which resets all the enemies' health and might as well be an instant death. If only there were a system to stop this.\n\n[h2]Collectables - 9/10[/h2]\nThere are truly hundreds and hundreds of useful collectables in this game, ranging from stat powerups, to moonstones, to stashes of gold. The moonstones in particular have very intriguing and fun uses, and unlock items that really impact gameplay. Later in the game you unlock a hint system for finding collectables, which is really invaluable for completionists. I only wish the hint system included some extra collectables not in the \"main three\" such as [spoiler]lunar artifacts, skills, songs etc[/spoiler].\n\n[h2]Music - 9/10[/h2]\nConsistently amazing. In addition to the catchy themes you might expect, Phoenotopia has some creative ambient tracks that really innovate on what you expect say \"beach music\" and \"farm music\" to sound like. Even the music in the final area, which in this genre is traditionally dark, aggressive music is really fun [spoiler]80s synthpop[/spoiler].\n\n[h2] Economy - 9/10 [/h2]\nPhoenotopia has a fully-fledged enonomy, with buying and selling of items, money from quest rewards and chests, and a [i] ton [/i] of things to spend money on. I enjoy the \"simplified\" economy in this game where weapon and armour upgrades are all strict improvements on the previous level, so it's just a question of [i]when[/i] you unlock them, you don't need to optimize your build for different enemies. The same applies for the selling system - you always get the same amount for the same item, regardless of where you sell it (with a few minor exceptions), which helps to keep this simple and fun. \n\n[h2] Graphics - 7/10[/h2]\nCutesy pixel art. There are some phenomenal landscapes in the game: the Moonlight Ravine, and two certain underground lakes spring to mind. The cityscapes too are very detailed and engaging. But the characters themselves aren't particularly inspired. Even Gail, the protagonist, doesn't really have any iconic features.\n\n[h2] Puzzles - 9/10 [/h2]\nThere are some really diverse and mindbending puzzles in this game. Given basic building blocks of \"block pushing\", \"switch toggling\", \"music playing\" etc emerge some really creative ideas. The sheer amount of puzzles in the game is unbelievable, including the main storyline and countless side quests. Even more impressive is that none of them seem repetitive, and every new area has a new type of puzzle for you to try. Phoenotopia uses the rule of 3 quite a lot, whereby it introduces a puzzle mechanic with one trivial puzzle, and then tests your understanding with two harder puzzles, and this consistently works well, allowing you to pace yourself. Particular note goes to the \"GEO\" puzzles, all of which pull this off perfectly.", "timestamp_created": 1638155251, "timestamp_updated": 1638155462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104595860": {"recommendationid": "104595860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064033144", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 3331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2549, "last_played": 1640185923}, "language": "english", "review": "A very gripping zelda-like with a whole lot of heart!", "timestamp_created": 1638127316, "timestamp_updated": 1638127316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104591772": {"recommendationid": "104591772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065438652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4233, "last_played": 1639406018}, "language": "english", "review": "The pixel graphic is really nice, animation is smooth\nLove the music, it's really fit the atmosphere of the game\nThe battle is on the slower side, can't just rely on button mashing, and it's nice there're no contact damage from the enemy\nThe story and the world building is good\n", "timestamp_created": 1638125764, "timestamp_updated": 1638125764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104458901": {"recommendationid": "104458901", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085104860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5475, "last_played": 1638065760}, "language": "spanish", "review": "JUEGASO dale una opurtunidad no seas boludo\n", "timestamp_created": 1638065662, "timestamp_updated": 1651526517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104408256": {"recommendationid": "104408256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309988988", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3524, "last_played": 1695925761}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: I've played flash Phoenotopia and followed the game development for years so I might be a little bit biased/nostalgic. If you've ever played flashtopia before, get this asap, it's 10 times as polished while keeping roughly the same story.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone interested a cute, relaxing metroidvania styled game. Lots of exploring pretty locations, lots of fighting and especially collecting items. The story is rather generic, you are a smalltown girl and have to save the world from unknown danger but it's delivered very well through the course of the game, constantly adding in new faces and background lore about the world as you progress. Ending could have had more work though.\nThe artstyle is stunning and one of the best I've seen in indie pixel games, Some areas really make your forget about the objective and just make you want to admire the view. The soundtrack just adds to this and comes with quite a number of tracks. I don't think I disliked a single track.\n\nOne thing I especially like is how many side areas and hidden places there are to explore. Entirely optional of course but usually they contain a hefty sum of cash or a boost to your stats and sometimes even interesting lore about the world. I also liked how your power level grows quite significally in some parts of the story, unlocking new and quicker ways to deal with enemies or to find hidden areas.\n\nSome people say the movement and jumping is clunky but I didn't notice that at all in my playthrough, you get used to the controls pretty quickly. \nSome minor negatives I would say are some equipment items are pretty unnecessary and cycling through them can be a chore sometimes. Some boss fights are pretty tough and some puzzles could take some time to crack through (if you're really not interested in puzzles there's a community member who has made extensive guides about every puzzle and then some). There is also no map of any sort. Your memory will be your biggest friend here as there is a lot of backtracking. I actually kind of liked this, as I won't be constantly bringing up a map and can instead focus on memorizing this beautiful world.\nNone of these things affected me in a big way though so I wouldn't worry about those.\n\nNow some things that might actually affect you: Farming money can be quite boring but it won't be needed if you explore for money and don't buy random junk. \nSome areas can be particularly annoying to traverse through *cough* Mul Caves *cough* White Towers *cough*, especially if you want to 100% them, but collecting enough stat-boosting items and food will mitigate annoyance levels to a degree.\n\nOverall, Phoenotopia: Awakening definitely deserves more attention, a real indie gem to take your mind off the real world.

(Not entirely sure if it's categorized as a Metroidvania, it's kinda like a side-scrolling Zelda with Metroidvania style mechanics) The game is one I also feel is hard to master with the combat. Some enemies in the game gave me ton's of trouble, partially due to my poor aim and timing of certain mechanics I believe. The game also has an insane amount of content for an indie game. I realize that this is a remake or remaster of its original game, but I still find the amount of content impressive with the variety of enemies, weapons, items and things to find throughout the game.

There is a lot of combat, puzzles, exploration and plenty of backtracking to do when you obtain items or powerups that open up previous places that were once unreachable. I downloaded it because I had a craving to play another pixel rpg and I'm glad I decided on this one.\n\nStory- Alright\nJust like any other zelda-type game, the story isn't too deep. It's simple and it works, not much else to say about it. Conflict happens and your character's goal is to fix said conflict. It would be better to make more of the areas and bosses more involved with the main storyline though.\n\nWorld Building&Characters- Top Tier\nThe world is fantastic, there's a ton of different areas that all have their unique theme as well as type of creatures and people who inhabit it. As for the characters, I usually can't be bothered to read filter text, but Phoenotopia had me reading BOTH lines of dialogue NPC tend to say, and not only because it was sometimes required for some secrets/quests. The writers went above and beyond in this game, and the humor hits where it is attempted. You wont be getting super close with side characters but you'll love them for the lines that they do have.\n\nCombat- Decent with flaws\nCombat is for the most part alright, but it also has most of the games actual flaws. It's typical 2d platformer combat, but where its different is usually for the worse. For starters, stamina is ridiculously bad in the beginning, and I advise anyone who is playing to absolutely go to difficulty settings and enable \"stamina regens more quickly\", and at least for the early bits also enable \"normal attacks dont use stamina\". No idea why some RPGs have you start out as someone weaker than the average human being, but until you get some energy powerups you're exhausted in less than 3 seconds and finding yourself able to do nothing but stare (or walking away). Secondly the knockback in this game is atrocious. There should be attacks that really make you fly back like getting hit by a boar charge, or an orc swinging a club, but you're playing as a human pinball and nearly every attack sends you flying. Thank the lord that they decided to make contact damage not a thing in this game, as it easily could have made all of this 100 times worse and maybe even irredeemable. Ranged attack weapons also really suck till upgraded, but I'm more of a fan of the bat so its not that bad to me.\n\nPuzzles- Great\nThe puzzles in this game are what I wish more mainstream games could also learn from, but they're not mainstream because they require braincells so that wont really happen. Phoenotopia has you actually thinking in order to solve the puzzles blocking extra treasure, and even sometimes for the progression of the story. The main tool for this is usually the flute that is used sort of like the windwaker in LoZ:windwaker, except its not only for songs but also for inputting the codes that solving said puzzles give you in order to open pathways and loot.\n\nMusic- IBoughtTheSoundtrack/10\nMusic is a hard hit, and absolutely fitting to the area it plays for. Even areas I didn't like being in had some nice music to ease that pain. It has a whole lot of different ranges, going from classic 8 bit, to mellow piano, and even synth metal themes. I have some of them saved to my phone.\n\nControls- You might have to rebind\nI started playing it with default keyboard controls. Don't do that. I later changed to custom keyboard+mouse, and then just used default controller. Aiming is really terrible with keyboard, great with the mouse, and pretty decent with an analog stick. One weird part of movement you'll have to get used to is that running has actual inertia. You will have to slow down before coming to a halt, skid if attempting to 180, and if you run jump, you're committed till you land, which is kind of odd because you have free movement in the air when normal jumping. There's also a lack of coyote jumping (being able to jump for a few frames after walking off a platform) so you're conditioned to jump a bit earlier till it isnt much of an issue anymore, but imo all platformers should have coyote jumping. The air attack has a long delay compared to the frame 1 bat swing on the ground, and outside being funny when Gail is stunned and rubbing her head after a headbutt, that attack is absolutely worthless and not worth picking up (you probably wont find it without a guide anyway). Lastly theres different jump heights you can attain from how long you hold down the jump button, but the smaller jumps are pretty strict on frames. Not SSBM short-hopping strict, but you'll get the wrong height jump quite often.\n\nComments\nOne of the biggest flaws to me and my 50 hour playthrough was that there is no option to respawn at the beginning of the room/boss room like other games have. Hell if there's a cutscene at the boss, you have to go through the respawning loadscreen, wake up from the bed at the save area, run to the boss, and then go through the dialogue again before your next try even starts. The biggest QoL would be to respawn at the boss room and have the dialogue skippable 2nd attempt and beyond, and I have no Idea how this didn't make it in to their accessibility patches. It would really get rid of a lot of the unnecessary frustration. Altogether the game is a gem, and I was really looking forward to the sequel, and was sad to see that it may be extremely delayed or even canceled due to lack of funding. This game deserves a lot more attention, and although it may have big flaws, it also has big strengths. 8.5/10, I hope to play Phoenotopia 2 one day.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1637562919, "timestamp_updated": 1637562919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657802343368530273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102954762": {"recommendationid": "102954762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077689905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1637893589}, "language": "english", "review": "Bosses and puzzles will give you a womping.", "timestamp_created": 1637180949, "timestamp_updated": 1637180949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102870995": {"recommendationid": "102870995", "author": {"steamid": "76561199197921086", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1697437494}, "language": "english", "review": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA very cute reminds me of Zelda 2", "timestamp_created": 1637055345, "timestamp_updated": 1637055345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102799855": {"recommendationid": "102799855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003430781", "num_games_owned": 976, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1636933973}, "language": "english", "review": "The jumping and running controls are fine, but the stamina feels really bad and pace breaking to the combat.

In my 3 hours with this game, I thought the art and music were absolutely phenomenal. I particularly loved the boss theme that played at the end of the first dungeon. I felt the first dungeon was decently paced, and the end boss wasn't too difficult or too easy.\n\nAfter this point, I started to see more of the game's shortcomings. The segment that takes place immediately after the first dungeon, without spoiling too much for any that are undeterred, requires you to travel to the next town and do, frankly, far too much busy work. It felt like the pacing of the plot fell to a crawl at this point, and I started to lose interest. My progression was gated behind a series of fetch quests and other busy work before I could move on. Every time I thought I was making progress, the game would find another reason to halt my progress.\n\nAfter an hour or so of fairly boring busy work, I finally had the maguffin that I needed to be able to progress, so onward I went. On my way, I got caught by a random encounter with some brand new enemies I've never seen before which killed me in seconds before I could figure out how to combat them. Frustrating, but alright.\n\nRespawn back in town and turns out I hadn't saved in a while and got set back by about 30 minutes. 30 minutes of boring busy work that I have to do again.\n\nShould I have been saving more often? Yeah, probably. Arguably its my fault. But it just made me so frustrated that I quietly closed the game. I have no desire to repeat everything I just went through.\n\nAm I salty? Maybe. But nice pixel art and great music alone do not a good game make. In 3 hours I was unable to get invested enough to be willing to repeat some tedious tasks I had already completed. I can see that a lot of love and polish was put into the game, and maybe some day I'll give it another shot.\n\nIn summary, Pros:\n-Great art style\n-Phenomenal soundtrack\n-Decent puzzles\n\nCons:\n-Pacing is all over the place\n-Combat can be a bit frustrating because of how touchy it is\n-Story progression gated behind money. If you don't have money for some mandatory story items, you are forced to grind\n-Random encounters are frustrating and tedious to deal with for little reward\n-Movement is okay, but sprinting doesn't feel great with the stamina meter, especially in town. Sprint-leap forces you to jump a set distance, can't adjust trajectory\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1636789722, "timestamp_updated": 1636791597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496240615844726563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102658478": {"recommendationid": "102658478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037277669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1640984458}, "language": "english", "review": "I Grew up with game like legend of zelda 2 NES that game was hard but fun, it is nice to play a game like that with advanced gameplay and a good story so far, it even plays to my love of exploration and love of treasure still wondering if it might punish my greed many games love to do that and i love it!", "timestamp_created": 1636734988, "timestamp_updated": 1636734988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102599427": {"recommendationid": "102599427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368151865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 3080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1212, "last_played": 1676014025}, "language": "english", "review": "A mix between metroidvania and Zelda2-esque game.", "timestamp_created": 1636650312, "timestamp_updated": 1636650312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102366792": {"recommendationid": "102366792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202818839", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2072, "last_played": 1636582537}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very well designed with a vast world to explore and many secrets to uncover.

This is one of those games where everything, EVERYTHING, is fantastic, except for one single element which is absolutely terrible and makes the game a real struggle to get through or even recommend.\n\nThe obvious: God this game looks beautiful. Lineless pixels, colorful and varied aesthetics, smooth animations, it's a delight to look at and that alone makes exploring its many, many areas a delight. The sound design and soundtrack are great too, tons of memorable tunes and a huge variety of styles - maybe not an all-time great, but it was enjoyable start to finish. The game even does a solid job lore-wise; I admit I'd struggle to call the story itself great, especially with its bittersweet and inconclusive ending even in the best case, but the lore of the world and Gail herself does feel worth digging up, especially with how tucked away some of it feels, like you're uncovering secrets best kept buried.\n\nAnd on that note, the gameplay. I'm going to avoid... The Topic\u2122 for now but what this game excels at, it really excels at, and that is: EXPLORATION. This is -not- really a metroidvania in a typical sense - while it's a 2D sidescroller with combat, there are only a small handful of movement upgrades or tools that aid in exploration - most other things are more geared towards combat. But this game has so many diverse areas and so many secrets tucked away in its map, the vast majority of which feel perfectly fair and can be a DELIGHT to work out. Imagine it's late game, you're following a hint that the game's in-game hint system gives you pointing towards one of the last few collectibles you're scrapping out, and that hint leads to discovering an entire hidden area containing some of the hardest puzzles, platforming, and combat in the entire game, rewarding you with a huge lore dump -and- two upgrade items in one. I didn't even -like- that area but it's so cool that it's there! And there's just all sorts of things like that - environmental music puzzles, secrets hidden based on the sound of your footsteps, a map-spanning trading quest that leads to one of the best items in the game, and FISHING PUZZLES. The mad lad put FISHING PUZZLES in the game. On top of that there are so many optional challenges - races, box breaking minigames, target minigames, mazes, puzzle mazes, riddles, combat rooms, platforming gauntlets, often hidden in clever ways and often in completely optional but delightful to explore areas.\n\nAnd every location has its own atmosphere - highly populated cities teeming with life, often containing a dozen or more internal quests, isolated but homely locations, secret dungeons, gloomy sewers, all in what ultimate is a fairly compact overworld that's so nicely connected via fast travel that it really only takes minutes to get anywhere, and despite lacking a map it's rare to get lost. And, again, in-game hint system that has such a miniscule fee it's basically free by the game's standards. In terms of sheer scope and density I could barely name a game that does both this well - Environmental Station Alpha is my measuring stick for density, and Hollow Knight for scope, and while this doesn't quite beat either in their own metrics, Genuinely the only games I can think of that outdo this game's sheer amount of content are the La-Mulana games, and I don't think -any- game could even attempt to best those. We're never getting another game like that again and that's fine. it does both so well the overall result is just as if not moreso impressive. \n\nit's a damn shame that the game plays like crap, then. Like, okay. The platforming is mooostly fine. You move at a decent speed and you have a run option, alongside some more platforming tools you acquire at around the halfway and three-quarters points of the game that fill out your repetoire and make Gail pretty athletic all things considered. But there's so many... nuances to the platforming that feel like they were put in place simply to make the game more demanding, not to make it play better. When you jump while running, you're committed to the arc - okay, I've seen that before in the aforementioned La-Mulana - but when you land, you have to re-press run? And if you land after a longer fall, you have to time a roll or get stuck in place for a second? Oh and you have to re-press run at the end of a roll or you get stuck in place for a second there instead? And a second time immediately after because you're stuck at normal walk speed? So let me get this straight, if I've performed a running jump and land from a high distance, I need to 1. time a roll, 2. time a roll cancel, 3. quickly tap run AGAIN, and if I fail any of these steps it breaks the flow of movement? ...why? Again, it feels like intentionally overcomplicating something that could easily be accomplished in a more simple matter - if it ended at step 1 I'd really have no problem - after the roll, I'm running again, a reward for timing that one button press correctly. The weirdest part is none of this is ever necessary? Every platforming challenge in the game can be accomplished without worrying about this. The hardest room I can think of, the Lunar Key room, is still lenient enough that you can take that moment of time loss every so often and still be fine - the real issue is that any mistake punishes you with like 50 points of damage for no real reason, but, whatever, there's a save spot literally one screen away, not a huge deal.\n\nBut then there's the combat, which has its own annoying nuances, and is THE part of the game that I hated interacting with almost every time I was forced to in any significant way. Gail is just not a good fighter. Her melee weapon is tiny, her ranged options are all very unwieldly - 360 degree aiming with a very short-range reticule never ever felt natural - and the air attack is the most pathetically slow move I've ever seen, you practically have to attack the moment your feet leave the ground to have a chance at landing a hit. So you've got a character who's already kinda sluggish unless you've mastered every aspect of the platforming engine, with slow, imprecise attacks. And damn near every boss requires such fast reactions and near perfect movement to dodge around, while often also being way more mobile than you could dream of being. And there's so, SO many enemies Gail is just not physically up to par with, either. I eventually just stopped using the bat outright and mostly fought with the crossbow and spear because, well, at least I can hit things without taking five billion damage in return that way, even if it's painfully slow and costs stamina.\n\nAnd the unnecessary nuances come into play here, too - you get juggled like a ragdoll from basically any hit unless you can perfectly time a button press the second you land on the ground - and good luck reacting fast enough to taking that hit, because you fly fast! Oh by the way only one NPC in the entire game tells you this, in a weird spot, where you have to pay money to learn this technique. So it's just. Not tutorialized properly. So yeah, expect to get juggled, a lot.  The game tries to have a three-hit limit after which you stop taking damage, but it doesn't always kick into effect, and just makes Gail feel even worse of a fighter than the already low standards she sets the rest of the time. I basically ended up face-tanking my way  with food items through what I'm sure are very well designed bosses for a game where your main character is more mobile of a fighter than Gail - one boss I literally just stood in front of and wailed away at with my bat until I won and it was easier than trying to fight it seriously. Only the one superboss you need near 100% completion to even challenge is relatively immune from this and even then I'd bet you could facetank it with enough top-tier items too.\n\n<continued in comments>", "timestamp_created": 1635065119, "timestamp_updated": 1635065797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101462491": {"recommendationid": "101462491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007022798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1943, "last_played": 1634925720}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like games like Zelda, the length you get from this is definitely worth the price tag.

The mechanics, story, gameplay - everything is well refined and well thought through. there is a lot of environmental storytelling which i love. The game does have a lot of jank, almost too much to ignore.... almost. it is 100% playable through the jank but there are very distinct times where i don't feel like \"I won\" moreso that \"Jank didn't happen so the game LET me win\".\n\nI know this isn't the place to do so but i would like to make suggestions to remove some of the jank...\n\nSpoilers possible pass this point, beware\n\n1. Make random encounters worth something, whether you get a reward for clearing the entire encounter map, or hide a treasure chest with an appropriate amount of rin somewhere.... this would solve the economy and random encounters. Random encounters are useless and i never felt like i had an abundance of money regardless of saving, regardless of money hunting, I did every single optional thing i could, every side quest i found, every temple i went into is 100% complete to my knowledge. I beat the game with 478 rin and i still feel poor. I hunted fish for a couple of hours, I hunted gold dragon scales for about an hour and a half, still couldn't buy everything.\n\n2. The recycler seems like the answer to the money problem but it isn't, you would have to sell your food to get money, which in the mind of the player is pointless. sell food to get money to eventually buy food. there are \"treasure items\" but they are SOOOOO worthless, amberite ore is worth 5 and golem cores are too. neither can be obtained in mass amounts and both take up space. A possible solution could be making any treasure items stack to a high amount, like 99 or something, so picking them up isn't a choice between life and death.\n\n3. remove the \"waking up\" animation from death, it is absolutely infuriating to lose to a boss then have to wait a single second on gail acting like she is above you. might be petty, but i hate this.\n\n4. if you are just under the water's surface, up against a vertical wall, and try to jump out towards the wall you get stuck in this stupid cycle of wasting all your energy and doing nothing. This is jank i refer to.\n\n5. Some upgrades suck, if i could turn off the \"Tusk Strike\" i would, i hate it. jank. dunno if i dislike any other upgrade but this one for sure, wish i never got it.\n\n6. I wish there was a slight coyote time after leaving a platform in order to jump right after leaving a platform. this leads to a more strict game which you miss jumps that you feel like you should have made (regardless if you actually should have)\n\n7. the sonic spear allows you to create a platform to stand on when it is in a wall, you can have 2 of these spear platforms out. Two. it is possible to throw a spear at the peak of your jump and not be able to get to it. the next spear thrown will remove the one you are currently standing on. forcing you to restart a tower climb, immensely annoying and this is simply solved by allowing 3 spears out at one time. whether it being an upgrade or the default amount, this was one of the most annoying things in the game.\n\n8. The crossbow and slingshot are hard to aim consistently during battle, i do not know a solution for this, but i wish they were easier to aim. Any suggestion i could make would have negative aspects to it. Like my initial reaction would be a slight autoaim helper, but that has heavy downsides, i do not know how to fix this problem.\n\n9. a minor annoyance i had when fishing for moonstone fish i would often be at the edge of the water, the moonstone would then sink to the bottom of the body of water, unreachable. every other item you get from fish floats, and i understand that moonstones have physics attached to them for some of the physic based moonstone puzzles so of course they sink, but you could have them just automatically collect when obtained from fishing. it's a minor annoyance but could be fixed easily.\n\n10. you can grab bombable blocks and try to push, pull, or lift them to no success. at the beginning i thought i might get a strength upgrade but it never happened, why can i grab them? what is the point?\n\n11. Cooking kinda sucks, near the end i kinda just forgone cooking because of how long it takes, this has a few mediocre solutions but no perfect solution. I got the frying pan which makes cooking easier but doesnt help the amount of time it takes. Maybe, an answer could be that after cooking the same \"recipe\" several times it permanently removes an input needed until eventually, if you cooked fish 100 times you can cook it with a single button press. Like gail is actively getting better at cooking. This is not a perfect solution, but i personally feel like it is better than the current system. This solution removes a bit of the realism of cooking taking time.\n\n12. As i said in my first post, some enemies can \"attack\" you trough i-frames. I suppose i spoke a bit too fast there. I suppose the \"attacks\" often don't deal damage and are usually status effects. Examples: Stealer birds stealing coins, Katash stealing food, mother computer stunning you. There are also some attacks with less I frames than default which is rather annoying, but kind of acceptable? Personally, I feel you should be invincible to everything when i am flying through the air uncontrollably. Getting hit when i couldn't do anything is absolutely disgusting.\n\nI could probably go on but these are the changes that come to mind at the moment.

On your journey you will travel through a wide selection of incredibly vibrant and unique locations and areas, filled with lovable, funny and sometimes touching characters. The type of story it tells isn't anything new, but the execution makes it feel fresh. Writing, art, tech and music are all amazing at best and still good at worst, so there's a lot on offer here.\n\nHowever...\n\nThis game is fundamentally flawed in terms of game design. Almost every element of the game's core design is busted in a way that makes the exploration/combat sections feel like a frustrating slog to get through. The only reason I (and many others) stuck with this game was because all the exceptional elements I mentioned before kept me pushing forward.\n\nCombat is likely the worst offender. I'm completely baffled by the design decisions behind the combat system, which is completely directionless. Your character's attacks have little reach and you can quickly activate a run to speed up your movement. These mechanics are perfectly suited to a game with 'rush-down' combat, until you factor in other mechanics. You can't attack out of a sprint, instead you do a little roll (which doesn't give you invincibility). You can do a jump attack while running, but the jump attack has a ton of build-up (unlike the regular attack). Everything costs stamina, which recovers very slowly. At the start of the game this can be a major frustration as even the weakest enemy has to be approached with extreme caution to prevent you from running out of stamina and getting hit. And ooh boy, you're gonna get hit. lotsa enemies use charge attacks where they run straight at you at high speed (sometimes while off-screen). If you're charging a heavy attack or using any type of attack that has a build-up, your window to dodge is gonna be impossibly small. A lot of times getting hit feels really cheap, because you had so little time to respond. This is only worsened by the fact even the tiniest amount of damage will launch you backwards, often into another attack. You do seem to get some invincibility after getting hit, but not immediately, making it really easy to lose large amounts of health due to a single mistake. This is fine in a game like Spelunky, where its almost always completely your own fault you got hit, but here it feels mean. All this combines into an identity crisis personified as a combat system. Is it a high-action rush-down fighter? Is it a slow and methodical souls-like? Is it a wacky physics-based game? The answer is all the worst parts of the above.\n\nI touched briefly on enemy design and this is a large part of the issue too. These enemies feel like they were designed for a different game and in general just serve as an annoyance rather than a challenge. Enemies don't have patterns to learn, each of them only has two attacks at most (save for the bosses). These attacks include the aforementioned off-screen hyperspeed charge attack, acid attacks that are fired in wide patterns and leave behind damaging pools that will prevent you from getting close to the enemy, enemies that explode when you hit them, enemies that explode when they hit you, enemies that pop out of the ground when you walk over it without any hint suggesting they're there and then explode, enemies that stun you for way longer than necessary leaving you open to even more attacks, enemies that actively move out of the way of the direction you're aiming and moving while shooting at you, enemies that will fire volleys of projectiles that can take out half your healthbar in one attack (thanks knockback!) and more! They can also knock you out of the room you're currently in, resetting your progress for that room. THIS ALSO APPLIES FOR AN OPTIONAL BOSS. If all that wasn't bad enough, these enemies are often packed close together or combined with platforming. Its not fun to have to tediously jump up a vertical shaft bit by bit only to get your progress reset when a single enemy projectile hits you.\n\nSpeaking of platforming vertical shafts, lets touch on level design. While the various towns you visit are full of character, the same can't be said for the dungeons/levels. Navigating these spaces can be difficult due to the lack of markers placed around the levels. I do my research so I know the dev mentioned he should've just put in a map and I have to disagree. The dungeons are largely a linear critical path with a couple of side branches for key items or collectibles. The lay-out isn't complex enough to warrant a map, it just needs clear pathing/player guidance. The issues with the combat and enemies are partially caused by the level design, too. For a game with such a restrictive stamina system you'd think there'd be a little more space between enemies so you have room to maneuver. This game doesn't agree with you, and insists that enemies be either closely packed together, be close to hazards so they can knock you into it, or be actively trying to stop you from completing what was already not a very fun platforming section. Platforming is generally okay as long as it doesn't involve climbing up vertical walls with a certain item (usually while getting shot at) or if its a timed affair like the parkour challenges. The same can't be said for the puzzles. I don't mind taking out a notepad and doing a Sudoku, quite enjoyed it in fact. But more often puzzles are either complete time-wasters where you have to slowly push several blocks into the correct position, or require perfect execution of several actions on a time limit (which is made very tedious due the movement systems).\n\nYou know what the worst part of all this is? Its so close to greatness, but these fundamental flaws tear what could have been a 9/10 game down to an incredibly frustrating 6/10. I think Quell (the game's creator) did a fantastic job in so many areas, but design is just not his strong suit. My love for the good parts lead me to investigate what went wrong and after reading his devblog I think I have a decent grasp on what went wrong;\nQuell has a hard time looking at the game from an outside perspective. He's played the game so much that he isn't able to objectively look at its features anymore. To his credit he admits to this himself in his devlog. However, being able to do this is an incredibly important trait for a game designer. This wouldn't be as bad if he had a decent QA system but this was also one of his main problems (though I'm not entirely convinced he completely grasped the issue). He mentions the game receiving negative reviews because of its 'high difficulty', which was caused by him only letting a handful of speedrunners test the game. This could be interpreted as him being a little condescending, as the game isn't as much difficult as it is unfair. Lets not pretend people didn't like the game because they refused to gitgud, this isn't exactly Dark Souls. Things like the lack of player guidance, unfocused combat/movement systems and the reverse bell-curve difficulty (or unfairness) lead me to believe Quell lacks an understanding for the fundamentals of game design.\nThat's not to say I think he's a bad guy, or even untalented. In fact, I'm eager to see what he'll create next. I just really hope that he either reads up on game design theory or finds a competent game designer to help him out.\n\nIn the end, this is very negative review was not written out of hatred, but love. This game came so close to greatness only to have the experience be soured by such basic mistakes. I really hope Quell reads this and is able to learn from these mistakes  instead of feeling attacked, because that wasn't my intention. If he does, please get a designer to help you update this game. Don't leave it in this state, it doesn't deserve to be left like this.\n\nPS.

The controls are a bit clunky, menus aren't super intuitive or convenient, aiming ranged weapons is a pain, the melee weapon is short, and the stamina system isn't integrated well enough into the game to really add much, though at least it doesn't get so much in the way that it drags everything down.\n\nBut, Phoenotopia is something I haven't seen in quite a while; the last two games I remember like it are CrossCode and Treasure Adventure Island. It's a game in which the developers' passion and vision drip off every screen of the game. The world feels alive with possibility, there's something for you to do or see around every corner, every NPC has something to say that someone enjoyed writing, every dungeon has little quirks and mysteries that make it feel rounded out and like more than just a series of tasks to perform. Bosses have gimmicks that make you use your head, and despite playing on the hardest difficulty I've only died once to each of them - once you understand the idea behind the boss the fight just kind of comes together as long as you execute correctly, and the game is fairly forgiving as long as you're going in the right direction.\n\nThe music is phenomenally good, perhaps not as ear-wormy as a Shovel Knight but a beautiful blend of ambiance and melody that reminds me of Valdis Story. The graphics are lovingly polished low-res pixel art in a style that's both cute and easy to read. The main character is animated with plenty of personality. Every part of the game feels like it had not just time and attention but real affection put into it, and it carries through to the experience. I'm not as far in the game as my hours (37 at time of review) indicate thanks to leaving it on while I sleep or go out to do things, but the time I've spent playing it has felt engaging in a way that only the best games from my youth did - not a time-devouring, hyperfocused way like a cyclical roguelike or a nail-biting way like a Yoko Taro game, but comfortable, happy, fun, like coming back to an old friend and just enjoying time together.\n\nIf you like pixel games, platformers with RPG and puzzle elements, Zelda games, or anything in that general style, give this game a try.

Most NPCs are good-natured idiots and I found their banter entertaining, but it might be a lot of boring text for some folks (there's *a lot* of optional dialogue in this game). It's all very cheerful even when it's trying to be serious, which is kind of nice in the dark timeline we live in.\n\nThere's a ton of secrets and collectibles to find, and most of the puzzles hit that sweet spot where they're just difficult enough to leave you feeling like a doggone genius when you do solve them. I completed most of them without the wiki and I'm very not smrt (I especially liked the many song puzzles that require you to figure out a specific melody).\nThe game doesn't have a map which makes remembering some of the secret locations tricky, but there's a fair amount of side quests that'll have you traipsing all over and make you stumble back into whatever you forgot (and late game there's an NPC that can give you hints on whatever you missed). The world is also a lot bigger than I thought and unless you're dashing through everything, a first run will take a decent chunk of time (while I've been hunting for secrets somewhat thoroughly, getting to the end took about 25-30 hours).\n\n\nUnfortunately the game has a major flaw and that's the combat.\nIt's not too bad for most of the game, but there are a few combat-heavy areas that are just frustrating to go through due to odd design decisions and controls that are nowhere as precise as the game expects them to be. The boss fights as well range from average to Frustrating\u00ae - as long as you're stocked up on items none of them are particularly hard, you just take damage in ways that often feel cheap.\n\nThere's many little quirks of control that add up to some frustrating fights. For example, you cannot turn your character in midair; you still have air control, but your character will only strike in the direction when you initiated the jump, which is frustrating when dealing with some of the fiddlier flying enemies.\nAttack animations have a few frames of delay between the button press and the action, as well as some frames after, making quick reactions feel clunky and often resulting in taking hits.\nMost enemy attacks (especially later in the game) will send your character flying, and while there is a 'recovery' move, the timing is finicky and you'll often end up bouncing around taking more damage before you even get to use it. You basically get a lot of stunlock damage chains like in Spelunky (less lethal here, but irritating).\n\nThis is all made worse by the Stamina bar, which takes forever to even begin refilling (2 whole seconds, which \nfeels a lot longer than it sounds) and the recharge rate is so slow that you'll spend a not insignificant amount of time just pootling until it's recharged. The game has consumables to help with this, but it feels like a bandaid over a glaring design issue, especially since the stamina items are not that common and you have to go out of your way to get them.\n\n\nSo basically, if you're looking for tight combat, this is probably not the game for you.\nIt's not catastrophically bad and you get used to its quirks, but even then it never feels particularly good (it's a shame because you can see what they're aiming for but it's just not there).\nI highly recommend enabling the 'difficulty' modifiers in the pause menu - I played most of the game without them, and rather than making the game easier, they resolve basic QoL issues. I really wish I'd played the game with them from the start - one of them speeds up the stamina recovery delay, which vastly improves the flow of the gameplay (especially since there is no ingame upgrade to this). The only one I'd leave off is  \"allow instant eating of food\" which kind of breaks what little combat balance there is (healing items are rated by how long they take to activate - like variable speed Estus Flasks).\n\nAnd yet despite all that I still thoroughly enjoyed it and by the end I just wanted more to explore. I'll probably end up trying to 100% because the exploration and puzzles are so entertaining, and it's just got such a wonderful atmosphere to bask in.", "timestamp_created": 1632613743, "timestamp_updated": 1632613800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99929311": {"recommendationid": "99929311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048055565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1632559922}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't quite bad, I just don't think I'll ever bother to finish it. The art direction is fantastic, but it can't really cover for how iffy the game feels to play:\n\n* The sprinting is just weird. It resets when you land (even if you're still holding down the sprint button). And pressing the sprint button causes you to start sprinting in whatever direction you're facing (even if you're not currently inputting any movement). In theory this could be useful, but in practice it just make the running feel really finicky. Sometimes you hit the sprint key too early and start sprinting in the wrong direction. Sometimes you're trying to run and jump between platforms, and you mistime repressing the sprint key so instead you do a non-running jump and fall short. I can't think of a single other platformer that does this, so I'm not really sure why they went with this weird sprinting mechanic.\n* This game has Metroidvania-like backtracking but no dungeon map. So you'd better have a really good memory to keep track of all the places you can go back to!\n* The range on \"sword\" attacks feels a little too short. This makes it hard to maintain any sort of \"safe distance\" when fighting. This isn't bad on its own, but the (early) game also seems to focus on mechanics that slow your movement while fighting. For instance charging an attack cuts down your movement speed significantly, all-but guaranteeing you'll get hit if the enemy is moving even a tiny bit. Another example: one of the standard attacks has a huge amount of input delay (leaving you vulnerable that whole time) so if you don't time it just right you're almost certainly going to be hit.\n* The first projectile weapon in the game has \"bullets\" that are so slow it's legitimately hard to aim. Luckily it's not needed for anything fast-paced (as far as I know), but it's still just feels unnecessarily difficult to use.\n\nThe above aren't really killer in any way. I'm sure it's possible to train up on all of it and eventually have a good experience. But I'd struggle to justify doing so.

The inventory is limited to 8 different items at a time unless you spend a lot of gold to upgrade that (300 gold nets you + 5 slots ooooh!). Which I did the first chance I had... but then I was out of money and realized that I needed to buy a couple of key items to progress but was out of money. There are constant random encounters spawning on the map but fighting them gives no benefits. It just hurts your hp and wastes healing items. They rarely drop money or items. A complete waste of time and makes one wonder why they exist in the first place since you can easily avoid them. Also there are lunar relics that you need to bring to a special collector but that person is in a late game section of the map so for most of the early game you have to run around with them taking up space in your inventory. Forums suggest just throwing them away because they respawn back at the dungeons... because yes that's what I want to do in a metroidvania: reexplore the dungeons I already found all items in because the inventory is artifically limited. And ofc there is not a single chest you could store items for later or anything. \n\nA lot of people praise the game for being very long but that is more due to it being drawn out and grind rather than it having a lot of content. You have to invest a lot of time upfront to get anywhere.\n\nEdit: also late game the combat becomes obnoxious as your ranged attack options are really bad to control. You have to stand still to shoot your crossbow and it does very little damage compared to the spear but its the only thing that can attack flying enemies; and take a guess what is the primary enemy type at the end of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1632235348, "timestamp_updated": 1632566957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680158019065856934", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99718252": {"recommendationid": "99718252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050010022", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1632195033}, "language": "english", "review": "I only played this game for just under two hours and I want to persevere and love it but the controls are infuriating. The character's sprint jump is a commitment, and with all the tiny platforms I overshoot constantly. All I want to do is jump from a couple tree branches to a ledge in one of the first screens of the game and I'm messing it up way more often than I should. After the jump the sprint has to be reset for no discernible reason, and the tutorial for this is incredibly tight; you have to master this immediately, there is no difficulty curve. The roll after a sprint being triggered by the attack button instead of just hitting sprint again has gotten me hit countless times during the first boss fight. If you try to jump and turn to do an aerial attack the character will face the initial (wrong) direction. Since there is a slight animation lag in turning on the ground you may also attack in the wrong direction after pressing the right direction if you're too quick. The aerial attack also has a lag to it and doesn't protect the character's head, which wouldn't be so bad if not for the previously stated issue and the (starting) weapon's very short range.\n\nCombining healing items and alternative tools/weapons within the same system caused me to repeatedly start a heal instead of aiming a slingshot, which wasn't horrible until the first boss fight. In a Zelda game a boss would usually only require one additional gimmick along with the main weapon, so having to work the right stick (therefore momentarily abandoning the jump and sprint buttons) in order to swap to a potato, find an opening to survive the eating animation, then swap back to a slingshot is a lot to process while trying to keep an eye on boss and boss add animations.\n\nInstead of grab grabbing it instead prepares a grab... you need to press another button to actually grab. I understand that this is because there is a push/pull function, but you could simply hold the button to push/pull and press the button to grab.\n\nA very minor and personal complaint is Up can't be Confirm/Talk, as it will cause a conflict in the control check after controls are fiddled with. I admit this is only due to way too many hours in Hollow Knight, but since the doors are Up I don't know why Talk isn't also Up.\n\nThere's also a stamina system, which you can turn off for normal attacks. I beat the first boss once with it on and once with it off. The difficulty changed very little but having stamina off for normal attacks was much less frustrating. It seems like an unnecessary system in a flood of other systems to keep track of during an active battle. Sprinting through town also takes stamina, and frankly I don't understand this design decision in any video game. No player is having fun when they have to take several breaks to let a bar fill up while simply traversing the world.\n\nCooking raw meat is fine but I need flint for a fire that will always be within the same area anyway, which is busy work for the sake of a minor heal, at which point I rather just run with raw berries and herbs only so my tiny inventory isn't full of raw materials being hoarded for a fire.\n\nOh, I also had a bat fly through me and hit me three or four times. I think one of the difficulty options minimizes this, but I don't know why this aspect would be optional. Being juggled always sucks.\n\nEverything else is incredibly pleasant as heck.\nArt is great.\nAnimation is great.\nMusic is great.\nSound effects are great.\nStory I can't say, as I only beat the first dungeon, but the conversations up to that point are clever and often cute.\n\nI want this game to do very well but personally I can't play it further as-is or wholeheartedly recommend it to others as it's too frustrating to traverse the beautiful world.

But there's no true Zelda-style dungeons to speak of.\n\nIt's got some JRPG vibes in how the story progresses through the world, but a lack of story-relevant bossfights and a comparatively low power gain throughout the game.\n\nThe game has a lot of charm and an engaging story. With well-executed but not supremely great pixel art and a good-to-great soundtrack.\n\nThe real tipping point is the combat and mobility. Both of which feel somewhat clunky, with more inertia to your movements than is common, and to a degree punishing knockback/ragdolling. Playing keyboard only didn't help my experience, though putting in more work on finding good keybinds for a Mouse & Keyboard setup might've helped the combat feel a lot more fluid.\n\nStill, combat upgrades like weapons and skills are overall pretty low impact compared to health and stamina upgrades. Not that they aren't impactful, but to a large degree, it felt like stocking the right amounts of healing items and just gaining a larger health reserve did more for combat than half the available upgrades. The lack of core mobility upgrades throughout the game also didn't help.\n\nThe game has a lot of collectibles. More than warranted in my opinion, though a map and better mobility upgrades for backtracking would've done a lot to help as well.\n\nThe world/story and the combat/exploration is what the game is about, and how enjoyable you find them is gonna be what decides if the game is enjoyable overall.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThe setting and story are very unique and well-constructed. Truly the highlight of the game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent, though not overly spectacular. And the soundtrack is overall very good with some great pieces here and there.\n\nThe combat is kinda unique, a lot more measured than the norm, and if you don't master the controls it can feel more punishing and clunky than it maybe should, largely due to inertia and knockback-ragdolling.\n\nThe exploration and general gameplay is for the most part well-executed; there's a decent variety in kinds of puzzles and challenges, some of them felt really frustrating to me (in particular the ones involving enemy AI manipulation) and I expect someone else might be frustrated by something I enjoyed. The game is missing a map given the amount of backtracing for collectibles and secrets, and it's very light on mobility upgrades for it's format.\n\nIt also has a really chill yet engaging fishing minigame.", "timestamp_created": 1630794893, "timestamp_updated": 1630794893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616712212562561035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98247707": {"recommendationid": "98247707", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997046755", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2021, "last_played": 1631931587}, "language": "english", "review": "A real hidden gem metroidvania on Steam.

I bought this game purely off of seeing it in my discovery queue and thinking the artstyle was really good and that it looked fun and I think buying it was one of the best decisions I have made in my entire history of gaming. Giving this a proper review is going to take a while so strap in, this is gonna be long.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe first thing to go over with this game is the story, and without giving you any spoilers, I think the story is really good. The initial driving force to set you out on your adventure of all of the adults in your hometown being abducted after having such an idyllic beginning really sets the tone well and motivates you on your quest. The story elevates and progresses really well over the adventure as you learn more about the world and the history behind it, with some new information as you progress being potentially shocking or awe inspiring compared to how the game's insanely cute art style sets your expectations.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay I think is overall very good with a strong inspiration from games like Zelda 2 with how the world is structured into a top down overworld with side scrolling areas. The combat is definitely much better than that in Zelda 2, but definitely could be seen as mildly clunky with the delay on some attacks. I don't mind the slight delay at all, and combined with the stamina bar, it kind of reminds me of Dark Souls combat, as it shares these aspects. \nPuzzles are scattered everywhere throughout the world and there are some really clever ones that made me admire how cleverly they were put together, with maybe only one puzzle in the entire game I thought was too cryptic, and it was for optional stuff. Overall the gameplay is quite solid and I enjoyed myself throughout, but that's not the biggest selling point of this game.\n\nEdit: I have read some other negative reviews of the game to see what people had problems with in this game to maybe give some extended information here, as most were linked to the  sprinting mechanics. The game does have a bit of a pressy feel with its sprint mechanics as landing from a sprint jump will cancel your previous sprint, and you need to hit the button again to keep running after landing. Some criticized this as being annoying, and the tutorial for this being a little too tight. I can agree with the second complaint, the room that taught this should have had a bit more room for error, but I didn't have an issue with the sprinting working like this. I got used to it pretty quickly and you don't get tested too harshly on it in required areas past the tutorial, which is admittedly strange. I'd recommend trying out the demo before diving straight into the game for this reason if this sounds like an issue.\n\nEdit 2: I figured I should also comment about the game length as that can be an important detail for some people. Phoenotopia Awakening is a fairly long game with a lot of content, with my 100% playthrough clocking in at about 50 hours. I personally am fine with the length as I enjoyed basically my entire time with the game, but I know some may consider that too much of a time investment, and others may think it's good value for dollar to playtime ratio, I'll let you draw your own conclusions if you like as this is entirely subjective.\n\n[h1] Presentation [/h1]\n\nThis is the biggest thing that has gotten me to hold this up as probably my new favourite game of all time. The presentation, being music and visuals, is absolutely phenomenal and had me loving exploring and finding new locations all the more than I already would have.\nThe pixel art in this game I think is probably my favourite I have ever seen with how well everything is stylized and how cute everything is made as a result. It took me about 5 minutes into playing the game before I was already gushing to friends about how the game looks, which is saying a lot considering I don't often get that way over graphics. From the bustling town of Daea to the incredibly relaxing Moonlight Ravine, this game gets atmosphere down so well that it joined the ranks of Okami and the Ori games to get me to genuinely tear up purely off of the atmosphere that the graphics and music provided.\n\nSpeaking of the music, this is one of the best soundtracks of all time to me. SillyTheWilly did a phenomenal job here and has made something I don't think I'll ever grow tired of. The boss theme is one of the best normal boss themes I've ever heard with me cranking the volume up super high whenever it started playing. \nBasically every area has a song that matches the location perfectly, with some as previously mentioned getting me to tear up. I've played many of the area themes as bgm for DND sessions as well and I've had some comments on how good the music was there too. Just overall a phenomenal soundtrack that deserves all the praise it gets and more.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nPhoenotopia Awakening is a true masterpiece in my opinion, and one of the most underrated games I've ever played by a massive margin. The fact that at the time of writing this there are under 1000 reviews is criminal as this deserves so much more recognition. Even before finishing the game with 100% completion today, I was already recommending many friends to check the game out, as well as gifting it to one of them, as I want as many people to experience this magical game as possible. I will absolutely replay this game in the future to likely get all of the achievements simply because of how much I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to any future endeavours of yours Cape Cosmic, you have a loyal fan right here.\n\n[b] Masterpiece 11/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1629695988, "timestamp_updated": 1637804868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753732502460479736", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98069062": {"recommendationid": "98069062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247548758", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1391, "last_played": 1639875239}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been following this game since it was just a flash game and I have never stopped loving it.

The mix of 2D side-scrolling maps that are connected by larger overhead maps gives a lot of freedom of exploration. The level design for each area is very well done both mechanically and thematically. There is an abundance of things to find as well as secret areas sometimes even within other secret areas. And like a true metroidvania, your first time in an area likely won't be your last as you find more ways to explore and platform.\n\nAs you gain more key items that let you explore, the more puzzles will open up to you to solve. You'll encounter many within dungeons and required areas but those are only a fraction of that amount of puzzles that game offers. Some come in the form of environmental puzzles, some are platforming, others are simple minigames.\n\nBut the world itself is actually one of the strongest points the game has. It is, again, exploration but instead of power-up and items, you're learning more and more of the lore. I would say you're heavily missing out if you're not talking to each NPC and seeing everything they have to say as the dialogue is extremely strong in this game (some of the strongest I've seen in any games recently). It's witty, charming, funny, and even thought provoking at times.\n\nAnd as you can already see from the preview images, the game has a very pleasant pixel art style. While, art styles are subjective, I personally really like how the games looks and even has a surprising amount of frames in the animation for a pixel graphics game making everything look very smooth.", "timestamp_created": 1629669628, "timestamp_updated": 1631464821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495298653841018677", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98011366": {"recommendationid": "98011366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115989415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1667045253}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece of a game. \n\nThe puzzles\nI absolutely loved the puzzles in the game. A lot of them are physics based, timing based, and scattered all through out the world that it feels natural and immersive. I also particularly like the puzzles that use your arsenal to solve. The sliding puzzles were a bit meh, but that might just be my preference. Most of them are not too difficult, but they're hard enough to make you feel clever for solving them, either by deduction, skill, or being observant of the clues in the room. Hell they integrate puzzles in their world with the GEO club, which is a very fun idea.\n\nThe dialogue\nI don't think I've consistently laughed at a game in a while, and this game's dialogue got me laughing throughout the whole adventure. It was probably one of the most charming things that kept me wanting to play more. Absolutely delighted when I got to a new area and have a new batch of NPCs I can talk to, and they can deliver some great one liners.\n\nThe music\nOh god is the music good. Sillythewilly did an awesome job, Stone Angel, Panselo, Caves of Mul, Moonlight Ravine, they are all peaceful melodic pieces I would listen outside the game. Some of the chiptune can be a bit annoying at first (like Thomas' theme) but it grows on you as you play the area. The battle music (especially the boss musics) perfectly captures the hectic feeling you get from fighting a new strong enemy, and made me feel hyped as hell to fight the bosses\n\nThe usability of your tight arsenal\nHaving no wall jumps, the spear is the main method for you to gain some verticality. I always like it whenever a weapon is also used for platforming, and the spear can also work as an explosive once you get the explosive upgrade. You can also use your bombs to use as a tiny platform, stacking two ticking bombs to gain some height, with a built in time limit before the bomb explodes. \n\nThe aesthetic\nWhile the pixel work itself seems to lack a bit of polish (for example the character sprites are a bit minimalsitic), the overall game aesthetic is very well designed. A lively desert city is adorned with decorations, colorful pots, carts, goods being sold, and colorful cloths hanged everywhere. They did an excellent job making a usually monotonous brown desert city stage looking colorful and pleasant to look at. A worn down abandoned bridge has tasteful debris scattered everywhere, walls crumbling, old statues falling apart, old mossy crates you can smash to get a few pennies. They create a very believable and natural amount of clutter to make the area look nice and realistic, like what'd you expect from say a club house, a laboratory, or a beautiful ravine\n\nThe cuteness\nThe game overall is very cute. From the frog, bee and slime enemies, characters like Fran, and of course the actions you can do. Crawling gives you a cute pacing sound, and if you bonk your head with a headbutt attack your character will rub her head in pain. And if you failed at cooking, it will blow up in your face.\n\nOther positive qualities I could think of\n-the touching aspects of the story (where Gail first came from, or when you find the young king's deceased parent's gift for him)\n-the accessibility options (because using stamina on normal attacks seem annoying as hell. I prefer eating in real time as it adds more challenge though. A lot of people had complained about the difficulty, and the devs themselves had admitted that they did an error on playtesting, by recruiting highly skilled playtesters (think Smash tourney regulars, and hardcore Dark Souls fans), but with the help of the accessibility options, you can smoothen the experience.\n\nWhat I didn't like much about the game\n-the later parts of the game \nMy favorite aspects of the game, the funny dialogue and the colorful settings, decreased in the later parts of the game. These areas are:\n\nthe Last Wall \na wasteland of a once prosperous city, littered with ghoulish robots of ancient technology. While scary, fitting, and a good testament of the player's skill, I missed the more colorful areas while I was playing it. And zero funny dialogue in that area.\n\nE.D.E.N.\na cold and heavily guarded laboratory. A difficult area of the game (which makes sense because it's the final area). But once again I miss the more colorful and cheerful areas. But at least there are some funny dialogues in the old entry logs. \n\nBetween those two areas there are the Mul Caves and Aurantia however, two more colorful and lighthearted areas, so not all of the late game areas are like that.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game.

The challenge only adds to the experience, making you really feel as though you are putting forth effort to succeed, which pairs incredibly well with the sort of post-apocalyptic setting.\n\nEvery nook and cranny of this game has something interesting and potentially significant to see.

There are secrets to find immediately when you start it up, and every one of them is rewarding once you uncover it.

So here I am, writing about a game that made me curse at my screen more than any other I can immediately recall...which, not only did I finish, but logged 70-plus hours on the game's clock and racked up a 97 percent completion rate to boot. Moreover, afterwards I immediately searched out and played through the original Flash-based Phoenotopia, just to get a better sense of where Awakening came from...oh, and also double-dipped when a DRM-free version came out.\n\nSo yeah, whatever misgivings I might have about Phoenotopia Awakening there's something truly special happening here, and I'll do my best, hopefully without spoiling too much, to explain what it is.\n\nYou take on the role of a young woman who's spent her entire life in a small town, but abruptly finds herself obliged to set off into the wider world and piece together its mysteries; let me tell you, this game makes darn sure that the player feels just as overwhelmed as she does. Outside of the general direction you need to take to progress the story you are granted precious little guidance, not only in terms of where stuff is but how any of it works; there's plenty of space to cover and lots of things to mess with, but you can forget any sort of map, quest log or other such reference to help you keep track of it all, unless you doodle it up on an IRL piece of paper yourself. To figure out which way is up you're expected to constantly and consistently explore, experiment and extract every bit of incidental information you encounter as you wander, and this takes a LOT of time and effort.\n\nThis sense of slow, gradual struggle extends - and how - to the game's combat; while moving about and attacking generally feel solid enough, an ever-looming stamina meter limits how much time you can spend on the offensive, and your range and speed seem almost constantly outclassed by your adversaries, who will ruthlessly ambush you, snipe you, gang up on you and chase you down from the word \"go\". If that wasn't enough, you'll frequently find yourself not only knocked back upon taking a hit but careening helplessly between nearby hazards, damage piling up all the while, before a bit of mercy invincibility finally kicks in to give you a fleeting moment to regain your footing...or, just as likely, mess up your counter-attack timing, eat another haymaker and start the dreadful sequence all over again.\n\nIn so many words, there are times where this game will make you want to yank your hair out; I couldn't begin to list the times other titles got me half as hot under the collar as this one did and wound up swiftly ejected from the disc tray, never to enter it again. But this time around, surprising even myself, I didn't quit and move on to something else; I kept going. Kept dying, and retrying, until I could finally progress. Why?\n\nBecause I don't think I've ever played a game where being able to keep going was just so [i]worth it.[/i]\n\nSimply put, if you're the sort of gamer whose favorite part of a given playthrough is the \"I'll ignore the storyline and just meander around for a while\" part, you're in for a rare treat; as much of a struggle as it can be to make your way in Phoenotopia's world, every last tidbit you do manage to get your mitts on is uncannily satisfying to obtain and renders you even more curious to dig further, no matter what. This extends not only to the platforming and puzzles, but even the often-brutal battles: as elusive as such mastery is, few pleasures can compare to FINALLY learning to spot a once-inscrutable enemy hiding in wait for you, charging up a full-power attack as you approach and sending the cheeky bugger flying across the screen with a perfectly-timed, wonderfully visceral [b]*THWACK*[/b].\n\nWhile this manner of experience is admittedly subjective in nature, looking back on it now I still can't help but marvel at how natural, how giddily organic it felt to open the world up, bit by bit; nearly every time I'd pass through a previous area I'd find myself, at least once, suddenly thinking [i]\"waaait a sec, maybe if I...\"[/i] and it's rather amazing to recall how frequently and endearingly my curiosity and persistence was rewarded. Moreover, despite its considerable length the game very seldom feels like it's padding things out; every new place you travel to has fresh sights, sounds, threats and treasures to experience, and the thrill of discovery never truly fades. To wit, even during my very last play session with the game, before I headed to the final boss I took an \"eh, why not\" detour to a particular puzzle that had stumped me for several dozen hours prior; sure enough, I noticed something I'd missed before, gave it another shot and at long last managed to check it off the list.\n\nOut on the periphery the grueling portions of the journey are further softened by Phoenotopia's uniquely inviting vibe; while many games of this ilk tend to revel in their cruelty, constructing worlds full to bursting with oppressive and foreboding atmosphere, the developer here chose to buck the trend and keep the overall mood light, humorous and cartoonishly charming. Darker undertones certainly do exist, especially if you peer into enough distant corners, but you're far more likely to remember, and be urged onward by, the game's incorrigibly quirky bit players, from important secondary cast members to the countless nameless townies you'll chat up, and the array of silly antics they present for your amusement.\n\nSaid characters, and the world they inhabit, are for their part rendered in a somewhat \"blobby\" pixel art style, which limits the amount of inherent detail present in any particular sprite or setting (and can occasionally make background and foreground elements difficult to parse), but also lends the visuals a strikingly \"gentle\" air, never failing to look anything less than pleasant, and frequently quite pretty. The accompanying soundtrack reflects the game's eclectic roster of influences (note that the game is not a \"pure\" Metroidvania, though I'll leave it to you to experience just how), featuring everything from peppy chiptunes to somber piano melodies to minimalistic ambience to a boss theme that wouldn't be terribly out of place in a Ys title.\n\nAs grand of a time as I had with this game, I must acknowledge in the end that my memory of it is a bit tarnished by my judgment that it does cross the line one too many times from \"sticking to its vision\" into \"refusing to get out of its own way\". If you prefer games that \"get to the point\" this one is obviously not what you're looking for; Phoenotopia Awakening is best experienced by going in as blind as possible, prepared to very slowly immerse yourself in everything it has to offer and re-approach things from several different angles when you find yourself either stumped or unceremoniously smacked to the Game Over screen. If this setup sounds even somewhat appealing to you, do not hesitate: Cape Cosmic has ABSOLUTELY earned Phoenotopia Awakening's full asking price.\n\nIn a nutshell: [i]It's Got What Humans Crave.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1628359646, "timestamp_updated": 1628359805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64934009313583374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96850381": {"recommendationid": "96850381", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094646988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2323, "last_played": 1682186547}, "language": "english", "review": "Got obliterated on the molecular level by Megaliths\n10 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1627965245, "timestamp_updated": 1627965245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96820247": {"recommendationid": "96820247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132579950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1987, "last_played": 1627920385}, "language": "english", "review": "A great zelda-like metroidvania.

It presents a tradeoff vs the regular jump - it gets more distance, but gives no control. As for how the sprinting works, that's another intentional design choice.

I've, similarly, designed Phoenotopia to be very \"pressy\". So to maintain a high speed, you have to disengage and re-engage in the sprint button constantly, knowing when to let go and when to press.

It may start slow, and the combat system may need some time to get used to it, but as soon as I finished the first dungeon, the game got me completely hooked with its very clever puzzle design, charming cast of characters, rich world, and a absolute banger of a soundtrack.\n\nI absolute love the puzzle design, and how it offers a fixed solution, and a unorthodox solution, if the player is creative enough to explore the tools at their disposal. And what impresses me more is the huge variety of puzzles, which even if a section makes use of the same tool as solution, you don't see any kind of repetition elsewhere, which makes the exploration very fresh and fun. I explored every corner of the game, and even after 45 hours of gameplay, I didn't feel annoyed or tired because of a puzzle of platforming section.\nThe level design is great too. Everything is so well hidden, in a pretty clever way, that makes the exploration and backtracking extremely fun and rewarding.\n\nI saw a review complaining about the lack of a antagonist, but I have to disagree. The story present itself in such a manner that a central antagonist is not needed. Without entering into spoiler territory, as soon as you finish the first dungeon, the game tells you what you need to know, and then everything else develops itself around it, and it works greatly because it has a pretty great cast of characters that carry the story without having a central antagonist interrupting your journey every time. Every city or specific location has its own kind of problems, but everything wrap itself naturally without dragging the story around.  \n\nIn short, Phoenotopia: Awakening is the most fun I had with a metroidvania since Hollow Knight. It has content for any kind of players, and even optional content for those who loves to collect anything (including a awesomely designed super boss for those who collected every life and stamina upgrades). Cape Cosmic should be praised for all the love and effort that they poured into the game, and I truly hope that we see a continuation of the story in the future.

Its worth your time, but it isn't for everyone.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n[b] Worldbuilding: [/b]\nThe world and characters for this game are just charming. There isn't much more to say, I enjoyed the one-off villains, the Supporting characters are likable, and the questlines are interesting and unique. Atmosphere is certainly down with the towns and Dungeons. However, there are a lot of filler characters. I honestly could not tell you the names of most of the Bandit leaders, other than the one you go to in order to get some upgrades, despite them all having distinct personalities and appearances. \n \n[b] Exploration: [/b]\nThe best parts of the game is definitely exploring new areas, Gaining access to more and more of the area as you solve puzzles and talk to characters. Its just a treat to put the pieces together, and while it is annoying on a second playthrough to have to retrace your steps exactly, the first playthrough is wonderful. It also ties into the worldbuilding, as the two go hand in hand. \n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n[b] Stamina: [/b]\nThe combat is less than desirable. Its not bad, but its not good. By the end of the game you can demolish any enemy with the right upgrades, so combat isn't necessarily difficult if you know where to look for upgrades (With the exception of the Secret boss, which you need all health and stamina upgrades to fight, and is great). The problem is just that the Stamina mechanic is poorly implemented. Alternate weapons (Which are your main damage dealers against endgame bosses) devour stamina like there is no tomorrow, and it takes an eternity to come back, and using anything during the recharge causes it to stop, and since there is a delay between using a weapon and stamina coming back. Stamina recharges at the exact same rate at the end of the game, as it does at the beginning. This leads to a lot of waiting, unless you constantly stock up on an item that drastically speeds up stamina regeneration for 2 minutes. Its not hard, its just annoying \n\n[b] Difficulty curve: [/b]\nAs I've said earlier, the game isn't very hard towards the end, when you have all the games collectables at your disposal. The hardest bosses (Excluding the Endgame Superboss which is intentional) for me weren't the last ones, but instead the 3rd (Great Sand drake) and 5th (Katash). Because these were both punishing bosses situated a long way from towns, meaning that upgrades weren't readily available, so I just had to ram my head against them until I got good enough to beat them at my current power level. I played the entire game without any of the Combat modifiers that are supposed to make the game easier, and the difficulty felt spikey. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, and everything past the 6th just felt easy (Once again excluding the endgame superboss). \n\n[b] Antagonists(SPOILERS): [/b]\nMy only real complaint with the main story is its lack of a substantial main antagonist. The closest thing the game has is Katash, the leader of the Alien forces searching for the same weapon that the player. And he shows up twice (3 times if you count a brief appearance of his shadow through a window), one for each of his boss fights. And even he is subservient to an Unseen \"Master\" who is hinted through statues and lore text to be the main villain, but is never seen. So the Villains fall into the category of \"Vaguely threatening presence that vaguely does bad things\"\n\nTL;DR: Good story, but lacks a strong antagonist. Combat has a poorly implemented stamina mechanic and difficulty is spikey. Overall, Make sure to search the overworld and towns for upgrades before you go to any dungeon, and don't be afraid to use the accessibility options.

Don't mind me, I can recover my progress later. I lost 50 minutes of playtime, I can use a bit more of my time to give some feedback. Hope the developer reads this and get a better understanding of why the combat mechanics made people (me included) so upset.\n\nIt is a nice game storywise, has a lot of mechanics for crafting/cooking which normally aren't explored by most platformers. There is no map for tracking your current position in an area, but it doesn't affect gameplay that much. Puzzle solving is a plus. No option for petting sheeps and chickens.\n\nThe main problem of the game is the combat mechanic (there are also fewer save points than necessary in the castle, but lets talk about what bothered me the most - I think that for the advancing of this story, combat shouldn't even exist). \n\nYou can check on most negative reviews that the game is kind of unforgiving. Well, I play tons of metroidvania games, and what bothered me the most on this game is how different (in a bad way) the character respond from a tipical metroidvania character. There is no problem in utilizing the mechanics that are nicely done on other games, right? No reason to reinvent the wheel, and to fail in the process.\n\nYou have either a short range melee attack or a ranged attack that requires precisely timed shots (which can be deflected by enemy fire). That includes the following projectiles: stones, javelins or bombs. Short range for melee attack is lame when you have no dodge mechanic, and not all enemies get stunned when attacked.\n\nWhen you get hit, you have no invulnerability frames. That means you can be hit multiple times until you react the ground for Ukemi. I am ok with being knocked back (hello curse of the moon), but being on a receiving end of a combo is not ok. 2D platformers REQUIRE invulnerability frames after being hit. Even Cuphead (which is known for being unforgiving) has it.\n\nMaybe I didn't pay enough attention to tutorial and stuff, but the command normal down+L2 was never presented to me, and it helped quite a lot to dodge (USE RIGHT AT THE LAST MOMENT POSSIBLE TO PREVENT ENEMY AUTOCORRECT). It could be binded on R2 instead of a command normal though, I am currently using R2 only for teabagging.\n\nOnce midair, you can't change the direction the character is facing. Therefore, if you need to intercept any projectile or hit an enemy, you have to wait until you reach the ground.\n\nEnemies have auto correction on their attacks. If they are charging an attack and you go to their back, they follow you instantly (why is it charged if the enemy can change its direction midway?). Projectiles throw by enemies also ignore platforms (but not boxes).\n\nThe basic air melee attack has longer starter time that the ground melee attack (which most metroidvania games doesn't have - this is the reason why jumping and attack midair feels much more confortable than ground ones on games like Momodora, Hollow Knight or Bloodstained). There are some bosses that require the player to hit an basic air melee attack, and the feeling of having a higher startup on the air is awful. The air attack is just too slow to work.\n\nIt also seems that grinding is required if you want to get better armour and weapon. The gold you earn following the main quest isn't near enough to get your upgrades.\n\nI am still playing the game, this list might increase.\n\nI have no hope the developers will ever fix these issues, but if they do, I will be more than obliged to recommend this game.\n\nEdit: I've completed the game after 28h for 32% game completion. Most of the money I got in the game was spent on food in order to survive the bosses, since in some cases it is better to just facetank everything to rush the boss ASAP.

The combat is fun and feels pretty well balanced. The puzzles are good and quite varied. The exploration feels rewarding, with lots of fun things to find and varied level types. Bosses feel well designed, and generally avoid the trope of \"wait around for the boss to do the attack that lets you hit them\".\n\nOn the highest difficulty the fights that are intended to be hard generally demand one or two retries but never pose a brick wall (at least for me, though I consider myself a good player). The only exception was one boss who took me around ten tries. But if you are having trouble, there's a variety of options you can toggle to make the combat easier; the difficulty selection at the beginning just picks from a few default configurations (with the \"max difficulty\" just turning them all off). Some of the optional side content is much harder though.\n\nThere's a variety of side content and minigames, of varying scope. Pretty much all of them are fun, well designed, have appropriate length and reinforce the tone and style that the game was going for. The same can be said for the levels.\n\nThe story is fun and endearing, albeit not award-worthy. Visuals, music, and dialog are all pretty great. Expect a childish tone of adventure despite the high stakes (except in a few specific areas where they intentionally invoke a much darker atmosphere).\n\nIn terms of length, it took me ~35 hour to beat on my first playthrough with 50% item completion. There's two full hidden levels which add a few more hours onto that, and a huge number of smaller side areas/puzzles/quests/secrets which will extend it much further if you're a completionist (even a few optional bosses). Fortunately if you are hunting for 100% there's an NPC who gives hints to stuff you haven't found yet.

It demands that you fight smart. It demands that you pay attention. And it demands that you pursue optional content, if you want to keep up with its power curve. But if those demands don't turn you away, then you should absolutely play it - it really is something special.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPhoenotopia's most-criticized element, by far, is its combat. It's definitely unforgiving, and it punishes reckless aggression with brutal knockback chains. However, it also gives you some interesting tools: light/heavy/aerial melee attacks, a number of ranged weapons for different situations, and some incredibly useful consumables (STAMINA REGEN). The end result is surprisingly strategic - figuring out [i]how[/i] to attack is often more important than skillful execution. One last thing to note: completing side content (collecting life gems, finding Ouroboros Scrolls, etc.) will make you much stronger, and thus, make the difficulty more manageable. So do that!\n\nOutside of combat, Phoenotopia has a lot to offer. Exploration, light platforming, item-hunting, puzzle solving...and the puzzles, in particular, are great. They're demanding, like everything else - you have to write stuff down, figure out patterns, pay attention to background details. But they're incredibly satisfying to figure out, and I didn't find any of them to be frustrating or overly cryptic.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nOn the one hand, the game's central plot is a little messy. It awkwardly shifts focus at its midpoint, leaves some serious loose ends on the table, and ends kind of abruptly. But Phoenotopia isn't really [i]about[/i] that central plot. It's more about exploring the smaller stories of each area (which are consistently great); about interacting with fun, well-written characters; and about discovering more of the world's secrets. The payoff on those fronts is much better - so ultimately, I walked away satisfied.\n\nAlso, despite the weaknesses of the central narrative, the game has very solid pacing, with some moments of great tension and some long, well-earned breathers. If this element was weaker, the game's back-and-forth transitions between cheerful fantasy and ominous sci-fi would feel abrupt. But instead, they work very well, and the game never exhausts you with too much of the latter.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nThe sprite art is great, especially in motion, and the backgrounds are gorgeous. The music is also lovely: it nails the adventurous mood of a desert town, the serene beauty of a far-flung beach, and the looming danger of an ancient lab. Combined, the effect is enchanting, bringing out the same sense of wonder that the best Zelda games do. I have just one small criticism of the game's art direction: sometimes, I can't tell what's part of the background and what's not. Luckily, this problem is mostly confined to non-combat areas, so it's not a huge deal.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nDid you know this is actually a remake of a 2014 Flash game? I played that game back in the day, and I thought it was a flawed gem. But Phoenotopia: Awakening fixes every problem I had with the original, while expanding on everything that made it good.

The games story is intriguing, fun, and beyond fascinating. I love the setting of this world torn between technology and the middle ages, I love the characters that I ran into and more than anything I love this game's sense of humor. I literally fell out of my chair on more than one occasion laughing at some of the jokes that got thrown my way. \n\nMost of all though is the sense of scope and exploration. For anyone that loves the feeling of trying something clever and getting rewarded for it, then this is the game for you. Secrets and mysteries hidden around every corner and most all of them are challenging but doable without a guide. There is the one or two odd ball ones that could be overlooked at times (Like musical sudoku) but even those can be figured out with ease once you have get a small clue.\n\nLastly the games combat is just superb. The stamina mechanic is extremely well balanced, and I love the need to use time to eat food making boss fights frantic and chaotic. Nothing ever feels impossible but it also far from easy. For me the challenge was just at the right level and had me dying for more. But I think what I appreciated the most was the games approach to accessibility and difficulty. Rather than artificially inflating enemy HP or Damage, instead they allow the player to manually tweak the games mechanics in their favor, like removing stamina consumption from normal attacks or allowing healing immediately from the menu. It allows the game to maintain its own vision and difficulty while allowing anyone to freely customize their experience. As someone that overly studies and analyzes game design I could not be more in love with this system.\n\nAll in all 15/10 game, I loved it from beginning to end and by god do I plan to 100% this monster of a title.

I would guess about 3.5 of these 5 hours were spent running around town talking to NPCs just trying to move the story along so I could even experience the exploration and combat aspects of this game. Again, I personally would hesitate to call this a Metroidvania because so far the emphasis is on the RPG elements of dialogue, towns, and wasting time talking to every NPC to find out which one of them in the enormous sprawl moves the game forward.

I particularly appreciate the life put into the characters and the time it takes to read their dialogue and learn about the life of each region. However the amount of time you spend enjoying the story you spend twice or three times as much time getting tossed around like a ping pong ball.\n Basically if you get hit, you get sent flying/ bounce off walls/ bounce off the floors which will inevitably result you getting hit again. Of course if you get hit again you get launched again and the story continues. Getting hit also doesn't have invincibility frames so any multi-hits will all land and nuke your health. Basically this game is brutal and unforgiving when it comes to making mistakes. Can I live with that? Sure, but it's definitely frustrating. What I can't live with is the fact that there are multiple rooms set up to take advantage of this. While trying not to reveal too much, I'll just say there are a bunch of puzzle rooms designed with this ping pong mechanic in mind; meaning that if you get hit once you have to start over from the beginning while also taking a bunch of hits by getting tossed around. \n\nIn terms of the other aspects, combat felt a little clunky or lacking and some boss fights didn't feel that engaging. \nI honestly do love the story and the character this game has.

I love the premise, I love the genre, it sounds great and it looks pretty. I was so disappointed on so many levels though that I just can't bring myself to keep playing it. No other game I've played tries this hard to waste the player's time. It's all just so tedious.\n\nEverything takes forever. Want to sell some items? Go to the menu, equip the item, stand under the machine and use it, wait for an animation, then run and pick up the coins it threw everywhere. You have to do this for every item you want to sell. Almost every system in the game is like this, and it makes everything feel like a chore.\n\nThe stamina system is so poorly balanced. I spent so much time literally just standing in place waiting for my stamina to slowly regenerate. You start with a pitifully small stamina pool, and when you get more your regen speed stays fixed, so you still end up sitting around waiting just as much. Some of the later tools cost tons of stamina to use, too. Trying to climb a tower with the spear is just tediously slow.\n\nThe level design further reinforces this trend of making things as slow as possible. The levels in this game don't really wrap back in on themselves. There are a few shortcuts here and there, but by and large you go through the area to the end, then it warps you back to town. That's great, but it's not there when you backtrack for items, so you end up just walking back and forth through the entire area.\n\nThis is holds true even when it doesn't make logical sense, like at the top of the windmill towers. Despite it regularly allowing you to fall from one screen to another, if you try to jump off the top it just gives you a bit of damage and puts you back up there. You have to enter the tower and walk all the way down. The enemies don't even respawn, so you just trudge back down through the empty tower. Why?\n\nFinally there's the controls. I don't understand why interact and accept are the same key bind. If I want to bind it to A on the xbox gamepad, since A is accept in like every game ever, and have jump on A, again like every platformer ever, then I'm constantly talking to people when I'm trying to jump around town. I either have to move jump or accept to something else. Both go against decades of precedent and just feel super awkward.\n\nAside from that, movement feels stiff and clunky. When you dash jump you're on a fixed trajectory, so it's easy to misjudge your distance and have to repeat jumps or entire sections if you fall. When you move in air it doesn't change the direction you face, so it's easy to end up facing the wrong way and miss an attack opening or miss a switch or something. All of this means that I ended up fighting the controls more than the enemies, and you guessed it, that makes everything feel slow.\n\nThere's a core of a good game here, but some questionable design decisions and some very rough edges just keep it from realizing that potential.", "timestamp_created": 1619289354, "timestamp_updated": 1619289354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498029530048370361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90849032": {"recommendationid": "90849032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976149775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3138, "last_played": 1620484680}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend.

I was checking up on possible upcoming game updates and I read Phoenotopia's developer blog.  It seems that there won't likely be any further major developments or sequels, primarily because there haven't been enough sales to do much beyond keep the lights on over there.  Well, this is a travesty...I say TRAVESTY, sir/ma'am/mx!  So here I am, come to extol the virtues of this game and hopefully help to better reward its creators for their endeavor!\n\n!WARNING!  Very minor spoilers...teeny tiny, really...hardly worth mentioning.\n\nVISUALS: Charming, gorgeous art style.  Its quite colorful, so if you demand moody, limited color palettes and pixel art that is super abstract or realistic, this might not be for you.  This is pretty cartoon/anime, but I think it's well done, especially considering how far it's come from its earlier iteration.  And yeah, it's super cute.  Get over it.  Don't be that machismo that don't do 'cute'.  Make room for a wee bit of cute in your digital diet.\n\nMUSIC:  Solid, catchy, front-and-center, energetic melodies.  I mean, part of the game's mechanics kind of rely on memorable melodies, so you will likely be occasionally humming these as you go about your day after a play session.  There are also a few pieces that go a long way to provide great ambiance as well.  I really appreciated the mysterious and somber, even lamentable tones lent to the early game temple, especially once I leaned a little bit about its former occupants.  It really is rare when a piece of music makes you stop moving and ponder the fate of a people.  My only gripe is I that I found myself yearning for a bit more subtle and subdued ambient stuff to counterbalance the bright and bouncy stuff.\n\nCOMBAT:  Controversial, considering some other folks' appraisal of the system, but I like it and I have it on hard mode.  Mind you, you have to practice (God forbid) to get super accurate and efficient with combat and not get your apples handed to you, but I enjoyed the challenge of this particular blend of combat mechanics.  I also liked that so many weapons have a useful utilitarian purpose essential to the game's platforming element (more on that later).  Combat progression is simple and coincides well with story progression.  You can put a little extra time and effort gearing up to get ahead of the curve if you like, or you can often wade in with sub-optimal gear and still survive if you are patient and skillful enough.  The movement mechanics feel good and the things like dash, roll and special attacks flesh things out.  Energy management is critical, which may annoy some, but to me it just serves as an incentive to explore and grab energy upgrades.\n\nSTORY:  I have yet to finish the game completely, but I am nearing the end and I've liked it so far.  One thing I am a sucker for is a world littered with remnants of fallen civilizations.  If you like that sort of thing, this game should scratch that itch.  I usually dislike the cool-trumps-logic medieval fantasy/sci-fi tech mashups (looking at you, Final Sci-Fantasy), but in my opinion, Phoenotopia makes it quite palatable and gives you a decent logical reason for the coexistence of the two elements. I also think the game strikes a good balance between making the protagonist important, but also sharing the spotlight with other key players and even the people she knows and cares about that can't come on the adventure with her.  I find myself caring about the concerns and fates of various NPC's.  As for the dialogue, it definitely slants toward lighthearted humor, but it does a fine job of it.   Almost everyone has some witty or silly thing to say as a reward for talking to them and those beady eyes everyone has just make it all the more humorous to me.  Plenty of folks drop snippets of history and lore or helpful hints to mill over.  If you are a \"repeatedly check in on npc's and past locations so I don't miss anything\" kind of player, like me, I pity you for you have a lot of people to talk to and a lot of dialogue to go over.  But you know, that's how it goes.  Its one of those things some of us both love and hate about RPGs; It can be genuinely rewarding to be thorough and check back with folks every now and again, but half of those NPCs gots nothin' new to say.\n\nPLATFORMER ELEMENTS:  This game will have you running and jumping every which way, using your dexterity, brains and items to solve puzzles or traverse through the game world in general.  The puzzles certainly aren't the hardest brain-melting, callus-bursting mind teasers I've ever encountered, but some of them can be quite tricky and clever.  Still, nothing unfair.  If you wan't your character fully tricked-out by end game, you're going to have to deal with the cleverest and trickiest of them. \n\nPROGRESSION:  This game is built around progression gates.  You find an item, solve a puzzle or do someone a solid and your world opens up a bit.  You can go more places, do more things, survive new challenges and occasionally return to old haunts.  Tis a pretty common mechanic (if you say 'Metroidvania' out loud while you read this I will slap you through your screen).  What I personally love about this game is you can fudge things a little.  There are more than 1 or even 2 ways to solve some puzzles.  There are unusual (and probably unintended) ways you can use items and push/float/throw/stack things around to get the results you want.  There are a few progression steps I have been able to skip because I was a clever boy and figured out how to get to where I wasn't s'posed to get.  Luckily this didn't result in any game-breaking (a testament to good programming, I'll venture), but I did encounter one odd inventory/menu bug because of it.  Still, the gameplay rewards and sense of accomplishment far outweighed one little bug and a crap-ton of patience.  Speaking of patience...\n\nEXPLORATION AND SECRETS:  I love a game that rewards you for poking around, keeping a sharp eye out and checking back every once in a while.  There are LOADS of secrets to discover and many totally optional areas you can only enter by returning to places you've been before.  This adds depth to gameplay and, sometimes, to lore as well.\n\nINTERFACE:  The HUD looks good is pretty simple to understand, but the menus could stand a bit of polish, especially with respect to navigation.  Something to help keep track of quests might be nice too, but given the fairly linear style of the game, it isn't strictly necessary unless you demand to have your hand held.  Just pay attention to what people have to say and keep a notepad handy for when someone mentions something intriguing or important and you'll be fine.\n\nALL IN ALL:  What I really appreciate with Phoenotopia is its distinctive blend of flavors.  None of its components are new or done in an earth-shatteringly brilliant way, but it is a solid blend.  I get the feel that this is a passion project that has been in development for a long time,  done by folks who are paying homage to some great games by blending their key elements into a coherent, competent and FUN game.\n\nPRICE:  As the cinemas in your area open back up, buy a movie ticket and grab a soda and a popcorn while you're at it.  You will hopefully be entertained for 1.5-4 hours, depending on the movie.  You will likely have spent more money on that than you will on this game.  If Phoenotopia Awakening seems, by this review, akin to your tastes, you will likely be entertained by this game for much longer.  I cannot yet vouch for the game's conclusion and haven't read any spoiler reviews, so I am in no position yet to promise a rewarding conclusion, but $20 buckos ain't much to ask by my measure.

Realizing that you can walk through enemies without taking damage definitely helps, but everything needing stamina just isn't good IMO, especially when getting hit just once is so unforgiving due to how you get bounced around. I turned all of that stuff off and the game became much much more enjoyable.  If you don't like the combat initially, just go into the accessibility options in the game menu and turn it all off, there's nothing shameful about doing it and the game definitely doesn't become too easy by doing that, in fact I think it's just about right considering the fact that you can easily spend 40-50+ hours on this and not 100% it.  \n\nIs it a Metroidvania?  I guess.  Who cares, the label isn't important, It's just really good.  I play Metroidvanias almost exclusively these days and I loved it.

There's only one area (with the bugs) that I could have used a map, but even then the individual areas just aren't large or complicated enough for you to need a map to get around.  The puzzles are very good too IMO.  40 hours in and I'm not even done, and I haven't even tried to get \"everything\", just most things.  Still missing a ton of stuff that I may or may not even get.

It really hits the nostalgia feels. If you like metroidvania type games I definitely recommend it! It's a shame this game isn't reaching to more people that would enjoy it. Retro yet beautiful, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. It's a little bit of 8 bit, but also mixes in modern sounds, some tracks are very beautiful, such as Ava's Lullaby and Wheat Road. \n\nIf you like Hollow Knight and Celeste, why not give it a try? The devs put their heart and soul into making this game so it's hard to see such effort and talent go unnoticed.\n\nHowever, it is inspired by retro games, so therefore it does try to bring back the difficulty of them. It is a very challenging game at times. And I consider myself a pretty casual gamer, considering I don't like to get into the competitive scene or 100% everything but for some reason this game kept pulling back in even when it frustrated me. I think while the devs do intend for a challenging experience, I think they should add more difficulty options to appeal to more players. We do have a fair bit of accessibility options but some still might find it too difficult. Maybe even add checkpoints. \n\nWhile I understand it's trying to emulate that feeling you get when one mistake could cost you all that progress like Castlevania and Metroid did, we are not in that era anymore... newer players don't keep at it if they lose their progress. Back then, there weren't many games, we didn't have a choice but to keep playing since there wasn't much else to do.

It's something like a Zelda title infused with a certain amount of Cave Story and - somehow - a smattering of Dark Souls... but there's honestly nothing quite like it.\n\nPhoenotopia started out as a Flash game on Newgrounds almost a decade ago. I think it's fair to say that the content appearing on Newgrounds during its heyday was... somewhat variable: a lot of games uploaded there were janky, forgettable or just plain bad, with a few gems standing out as interesting proofs of concept. And then there was Phoenotopia: innovative in its own right, but more than just a proof of concept - it knew its influences and could see a gaping void where a game of its sort really *ought* to exist. It felt like cheating to be given that game for free.\n\nI was delighted to learn that a remake was in the works. The developer considers the Flash game a first draft, and having finally played the commercial release, I am once again blown away by the breadth and quality of the vision behind this project. Phoenotopia Awakening provides a fully-realised world with a far more substantial and expansive challenge than I had anticipated, even after fully expecting a far grander work than the earlier iteration of Phoenotopia.\n\nIts dungeons are artfully designed, each one unique and interesting; its puzzles are similarly well-constructed, developing in complexity in a highly engaging manner; its combat, while not perhaps as fluid as I might have initially hoped for, proved extremely satisfying to master, such that I'm not sure in retrospect that I'd want any tweaks to it; there was that special sense of achievement at overcoming each of the later bosses that fans of the likes of Hollow Knight ought to appreciate.\n\nThe pixel art and music are utterly beautiful - I've been listening to the latter fairly obsessively over the last month, while the former shows a facility for colour that left me gawking in sheer wonder at several of the game's environments. In gameplay, world building and aesthetics alike, the level of detail is illustrative of just how much care went into this passion project.\n\nThe difficulty curve of Phoenotopia Awakening is smooth but perhaps a little steep for some. I enjoyed the challenge, but the game does include a decent range of accessibility options for those who would benefit from them.

That was launched mid-2014, and with Flash fading away, that may have inspired the developer to recreate PA for Steam. Looking at the trailers and reviews, it looked like a charming Metroidvania, and with a few years of experience to work off of, I hoped for an experience that would have buffed out any rough spots. Unfortunately, my mood soured with PA pretty quickly, in spite of the interesting premise. \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nThere appears to be some discrepancy on how people would describe PA, whether it is or isn't a Metroidvania or if it's more of a Zelda II kind of game. Personally, I see it as a platformer that emphasizes exploration, dungeon-crawling, and speaking with NPCs, which is what I expect out of most indie adventure titles. However it'd be categorized isn't of much concern to me, as it doesn't change the experience, which on the surface level covers the checklist of things to include in a good game, but not in a well composed way. For instance, I've grown accustomed to chatting with every NPC I can a handful of times, happy to learn more about the surrounding area, rumors going around, and potentially pick up a quest. In PA, the processing of events seems to be fixed and linear, so that a specific NPC has to be spoken to first to trigger another one's dialogue option, which opens another possibility, and so on. This leads to backtracking and doing things rigidly, instead of allowing for more organic exploration and advancement in the game. \n\nHowever, what I disliked most with PA was the game's combat system, which is a common complaint amongst the negative reviews. If you play PA with all combat modifiers turned off, which I see as being how the game is intended to be played, swinging the bat drains stamina, even when only breaking boxes. Worse than that though, almost every action you'd take is based on this stamina bar: dodge-rolling, sprinting, throwing bombs, hurling rocks with a slingshot, etc. Your options in combat are limited, as all of them revolve around the same resource, stamina. You don't have a number of arrows and bombs that can be used as you see fit, using one of these draws from the same pool as the close-range melee attack. The only ones that don't rely on stamina are basic movement, jumping, and eating to heal. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2395994837\n[h1] Controls [/h1] \nThe control scheme gets fairly complicated in PA, so I won't offer a breakdown of them in this case. However, this in part is an issue I have with the game, as I don't think it was designed as ergonomically as it could have been. An example of this is the sprint mechanic, which isn't treated as a faster movement cycle you switch to when you're wanting to hoof it. Instead, it's like hitting the melee attack button, as Gail will sprint a certain distance after you hit the button, and you can't hold it down to make her run faster. Its primary use is for making longer jumps or dodge rolling, which you do by hitting the right button after you've hit sprint. It works, but it's not as satisfying as just having normal control over the PC's speed. \n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nAs the game begins, Gail rounds up the children of the village and dives into a nearby temple to check out a meteorite that fell nearby. Upon discovering what it is and starting to head back home, an alien saucer swoops in and kidnaps all of the adults, leaving behind only the children. It's simple and straightforward, but this is a good hook to establish the plot of PA, as there's important, personal stakes on the line. With so few things explained about the situation, players have enough room to speculate and guess what'll happen, as Gail heads out to follow the few leads available and try to find and rescue the kidnapped villagers. I'm curious how it all pans out, yet won't finish the game to find out for myself. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2395992949\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nThis is another example of an indie game that has great visuals, as I find the pixel graphics of PA vibrant and detailed. It's easy to determine what items are in environments, settings don't look tired and repetitive because the backgrounds have enough variance to look organic, and the layered environments give areas a sense of depth. Out of the graphics, the area that falls flat for me is the character models, as I find them easy to mix up. Were it not for such flashy hair colors, I think they'd blend together. \n\n\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nWhen listening to PA's soundtrack, I'd say it's well composed. It covers a broad range of tones and tempos, which helps build different feelings about the environments Gail travels to. I'm a fan of instrumental music, so I can easily slip into it and enjoy myself. A simple downside is that many of them aren't very long, so they loop upon themselves fairly quickly. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f There are gameplay options that can be turned on and off to adjust the difficulty, to some extent. You won't be able to increase your HP or weaken enemies though. \n\ud83c\udf1f I found the visuals and story went well together, which both drew my interest in the first place and held my attention as I played. \n\ud83c\udf1f Based on the progression stats from the loading menu, there's quite a few secrets to hunt down. \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\u274c Another problem in combat stems from how getting hit by an attack momentarily stuns the PC, and can lead into being juggled for multiple hits with no ability to dodge or respond. You'll only get invincibility frames after getting hit 3 times in a row, and with a starting HP of 30, a sizable chunk can be shaved off due to a chain reaction from taking only 1 hit. Due to this, the number of enemies is sometimes more of an issue than how strong they are. \n\u274c It's not uncommon to find an item that seems pointless and will waste a valuable inventory slot, until you're able to do something with it much later. Also, with how many items there are to buy, some of which are required for progression, PA is rather tight-fisted when it comes to loot. \n\u274c Not only is there no auto-save feature, you can only save at predetermined save points. This makes it easy to lose progress. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d Don't hesitate to drop weak healing items if your inventory fills up, as a cooked item like fish is much more useful than raw berries. Also, when you get to Aria, buy at least 4 inventory slots. \n\ud83d\udd0d Since PA won't track information for you, it'd be worthwhile to either jot down notes or follow a guide to know where you'll want to backtrack and when. \n\ud83d\udd0d You can walk through bosses if they're not in an attack phase. This will be necessary in order to deal with their patterns and counter attack. \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nEven though this is an indie title, I still have certain expectations when it comes to modern-day adventure games. Especially when it draws inspiration from other games and has the advantage of being a remake. Despite this, it doesn't have a map system or item/quest tracking, optional treasure items take inventory slots, you have to speak to specific NPCs at certain times to progress, etc. Overall, I find that the game doesn't seem well designed around its own mechanics. Simply switching stamina use for basic attacks on and off unbalances the game completely, leading it to either be significantly harder and more tedious, or making boss fights a cakewalk. Although it has charming visuals and some interesting ideas, it lacks a level of polish I'd require to stick it out, and isn't one I'd recommend playing. \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/2021/02/24/review-phoenotopia-awakening/][quote]Visit Save or Quit to read my full review, as it was too long to fit here.[/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1614264339, "timestamp_updated": 1614264626, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561699330806732178", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87329865": {"recommendationid": "87329865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054977688", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1330, "last_played": 1615507279}, "language": "english", "review": "Man I really wish I loved this game.

I'm not sure that I've ever enjoyed a game start-to-finish as much as Phoenotopia. The play style resembles a mix of Zelda and Metroid, with a story that is part Final Fantasy and Earthbound, all with a delicately balanced utopian/dystopian flavor... the result is something totally unique.\n\nEvery aspect of this game was done with excellence and care- the script was engaging and humorous (it was actually worthwhile to talk to every NPC, even as each typically had at least 2 layers of dialogue), the music was spot-on for each terrain, and the graphics were incredibly intricate in the pixel style. The physics are perfect- character movement is free and agile, and the ability to smack enemies across the stage with a hard strike never got old. The wide range of weapons, tools, and abilities lent itself toward an even wider array of tactics, and the primary healing mechanism (collection of various foods, which could be cooked to improve properties) was fun and engaging.\n\nPerhaps most impressive is how enjoyable every minute of play truly was- it took about 48 hours over the course of a month or so for me to casually work through to the end without attempting to grind for every achievement (90% completion on the casual run, then another 4 hours to go back and get 100%). With every added ability/tool that allowed access to different areas within old regions, it did not feel like a grind to return; I enjoyed the opportunity to re-explore the past areas knowing there was some reward to attain (even if small). Part of the intrigue is the many layers of rewards possible- in addition to the standard units that increase maximum health/energy that are found in many games, there were a large number of additional abilities, tools, weapons, and side storyline tidbits that made each exploration interesting and worthwhile.\n\nWell done, developers- I'll eagerly await the sequel, and hope you'll have the support needed to continue the story!", "timestamp_created": 1614116958, "timestamp_updated": 1614116958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87303289": {"recommendationid": "87303289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170446642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2129, "last_played": 1612129750}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10, Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado, un encantador pixel art trabajado minuciosamente, y en realidad en todo.\nPersonajes cada uno con su carisma, hasta los secundarios que te puedes encontrar caminando y jefes espectaculares donde cada uno tiene su estilo, ademas de un jefe escondido.

The platforming and puzzle challenges are some of the most interesting I've seen in a long time, and every time I solve one I feel my brain bulging and get the loveliest satisfied high. They really encourage you to look for everything you have to hand, and push yourself.

It's a mixture of stamina management, positioning, and looking for the right windows of opportunity to attack. Some encounters can be quite challenge - the bosses are a stand out!

If I had to guess 3 most important things, I'd say: big world, rewards for side tracking, no hand-holding (i.e. quest markers, maps, navigation). That culminates into you running around blindly, finding areas, solving puzzles and ALWAYS being rewarded. Most similar games screw up in 1 of those aspects.\n\nI mentioned the game is \"big\", but it's done through world density rather than size (although size is respectable). Every area, house, NPC and object feels like it is worth interacting with and so far over half of all areas I visited featured at least one platforming section, hidden area or a puzzle of some sort.\n\n\"Big deal, lots of games do it\" I hear you say. Well, that they do, Billy, but Phoenotopia has few key game design choices that make it feel more rewarding than competitors\n[list]\n[*] [b]Upgrades, Food and Money have value[/b]. Money is scarce and is used for many things(including upgrades). For most of your journeys your HP cannot be recovered in the most difficult sections, so upgrades that save HP, food that can restore it and money that can buy both always feels valuable. That means even if you complete a puzzle to find generic 30 coins or a piece of food it's still not a disappointing reward as it might be in a Zelda or Castlevania games.\n[*] [b]Puzzles are numerous, while most are intuitive and fairly short (1-2 minutes).[/b] This might be a personal preference, but to me that meant I was never strained by them. They felt more like opportunities than 10 minute roadblocks. There are a few more difficult ones, but not enough to make them feel like a chore.\n[*] [b] Game gives general directions, rather than specific instructions with GPS navigation.[/b] This took me years to fully appreciate, but when games have a map, navigation, quest markers and other similar stream-lined crap that makes my brain switch off as I go A to B for 60-100 hours. Streamlined content often makes me feel like I'm doing chores rather than exploring. This game has none of that - you find and solve everything on your own. The game only points you in general direction you should be going.\n[*] [b]Puzzles disguised as metroidvania style ability gating.[/b] If you see a ledge you can't reach metroidvania design will lead you to believe you need an ability to reach it. Well this game mixes it up and half the time, places a puzzle instead. It still looks like an ability gated area, so figuring out that it is a puzzle is rewarding on its own, and solving it is twice as rewarding.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Combat(8/10)[/h1]\nA common complaint is unfair combat, which I can definitely see at higher difficulties. Your basic attacks include short reach melee and various ranged weapons, which all leaves somewhat defenseless for some time. There's no damage on-contact, so you can safely walk all over then as long as enemy attack doesn't connect with you.\n\n[b]Enemies are easy to read[/b]. Main difficulty in fights stems from positioning yourself well enough to attack after enemy attack animation ends (which often leaves them too far to reach in time before next attack) and not get hit when next one starts. So far there was one exception: [spoiler]a teleporting enemy, which was more annoying than difficult due to need to chase and then risky attacks required...[/spoiler]\n[b]Bosses[/b]are just as easy to read as normal enemies, but safely positioning yourself for an attack is significantly harder.\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nTo evaluate combat I first need to address the difficulty, which can range from casual game to unfair souls-like, due to the way difficulty scaling is setup. Honestly, I think these developers deserve an award just for taking the time to design difficulty settings, which are not just stupid enemy HP/damage multiplier.\n\nThere are 5 levels and I've tried 2 of them. \n[list]\n[*] [b]5* difficulty(hardest)[/b] - Most actions drains stamina and food takes a while to eat. As you would imagine this makes the game feels like a souls-like, and if you have to fight multiple enemies it can feel like an unfair souls-like. If you're up against 3+ enemies you are very unlikely to avoid all attacks while attacking.\n[*] [b]3* difficulty(medium) [/b] (what I play) - Basic attacks do not cost stamina and you can eat food from menu to skip the eating animation (this chops the difficulty in half). This makes the game feel more like a traditional platformer. You still take the same damage, but it's easier to fight enemies when you don't have to worry about basic attack stamina, or positioning yourself to eat safely. Both of those allow to play more aggressively, which changes expertise required in fights quite a lot.\n[/list]\n\n[b]So why 8/10?[/b]\nThis 1 enemy type cancerous. You wouldn't call it hard, it just slows you down... a lot. Luckily it's mostly localized in 1 area.\n\nFew areas in game are annoying for combat reasons. In all cases enemies are still easy to read, but I faced a few situations where they felt impossible to avoid due to numbers.\n\n[h1]Humor(10/10)[/h1]\nThis is subjective, but I figured I'd include it, because I loved it. The game features adult humor (contextual humor, no NSFW stuff), which ranges from comical life situations to subtle jabs at similar stories. For example: you find this band of musicians that pass a remark along the lines of \"We found (girl's name) in a forest suffering from amnesia. Can you believe that?\". This cracked me up, because that's exactly how a good portion of games start.\n\n\nOther stuff that might interest you\n[list]\n[*] I love the style, but it's pretty subjective. Sufficed to say people often underappreciate the difficulty of making pixel art look good AND THEN making good looking animations.\nThe first animation I saw in game (yawning after waking up) made me smile. \n[*] Fluid controls. Character never feels awkward as they do in some platformers. It might take you a while to get used to button layout, though.\n[*] Music. In general I don't dislike it enough to mute it, which makes it great in my book. I love a few tracks (like Boss music). Only exception is desert city theme music (often the case in other games too).\n[/list]\n\nFew minor negatives\n[list]\n [*] Few minigames required for full completion (for full completion). Minigames rarely feel satisfying and this game is no exception. Yeah, sense of achievement an all that, but I don't play amazing games just to play some cheap knockoff minigame built into it.\n [*] Combat against multiple enemies (especially if those are flying enemies) can feel unfair. Jump attack has quite a long wind up and aiming projectiles leaves you defenseless against ground enemies.\n [*] 2 achievements that waste time, in this game's setting. It's a game that gives you little reason to play a second time, but achievements require multiple playthroughs. It's TECHNICALLY possible to do them in 1, but not in practice.\n[/list]\n\nIn case my opinion about the game was not clear to this point. I think it's a masterpiece.

It's funny because I went in not wanting to play for more than 20-30 hours and the game is just that good that I ended up doing all the side quests and collectibles without ever once getting bored or tired, I'm still shocked I enjoyed this game that much.\n\nCons:\n-None........Well, the secret extra unlockable Boss-Fight for getting 100% hearts and 100% energy at the end of the game doesn't give you anything for beating it, so it was a little bit of a let down... theres a room before the last boss fight of the game that gives you infinite free food and in my opinion this free food vendor should of been behind the secret extra unlockable Boss-Fight room, but hey you can't win them all. I would like to add however the extra boss fight is the best fight in the game and is incredibly rewarding in itself to complete it, Good Luck!!!\n\n***This game is more for the completionist skilled gamer even though it still can be thoroughly enjoyed regularly.

El juego tiene soporte para mando (probado con uno de XBOX ONE) y utiliza todos los botones del mismo.\nEl jugador empieza en la aldea de nuestra protagonista, donde podr\u00e1 hablar con todos los parroquianos para de ese modo obtener informaci\u00f3n.

It's not really a metroidvania, because the world is broken up into smaller segments connected by an explorable world map. There are also towns and houses other places to find in addition not dungeons.\n\nThe game is chock full of side quests, puzzles, minigames, and secrets to find. Think a side scrolling Zelda, all the upgrades and tools are found, bought, traded for, or won from a game. There are also some Immersive Sim moments, some things can be accomplished in multiple ways, i.e. bribing a guard or finding a secret to gain entrance.\n\nThe graphics and music are very lovely. The little animations of Gail waking up or bouncing off sheep amuse me every time. This is such a massive game with so much heart poured into it, if you are even slightly interested, please give it a try. Yes, it can be difficult, but the accessibility options make things more manageable.

Though it wasn't perfect, it was a good use of $20.\n\n[b] The Good: [/b]\n\n- Pretty sizable map that takes a while to explore.\n\n- A lot of detail and content in a world that feels very lived in, with extensive side quests.  It's also pretty for pixel art.\n\n- The universe merges scifi, post-apocalyptic, and medieval fantasy genres fairly well without taking itself particularly seriously most of the time.\n\n- NPC dialogue is solid across the board and warrants a chuckle at times.\n\n- There's fishing, and it's optional!  There's cooking, and it's... less optional!\n\n\n[b] The Bad: [/b]\n\n- Even basic attacks will throw you across half the screen.  Groups of enemies/bosses will often be able to chain hits or yeet you into hazards with little difficulty, which can get frustrating.\n\n- Even though there's a ton of content left after credits, the actual postgame is poorly implemented.  Basically you get sent back to the room before the final boss and the world you walk around isn't any better than when you last left it.  [spoiler] Nothing resembles the victory cinematic, the people of your village that you set out to save are still missing with no path to rescuing them, the royal palace is still a warzone, etc. It feels like a third of the ending was hand waved away without the player getting involved or enjoying the results.  [/spoiler]  There is apparently a sequel coming out, so this may be alleviated.\n\n- No minimap, which makes thorough exploration a little more tedious when you inevitably run around in circles.\n\n[b] The Subjective [/b]\n\n- Combat is punishing.  Poor timing or putting yourself in a bad situation will get you killed outright.  Bosses are hard.  Most healing can't be done on a whim (unless you choose to enable it in the menu.)\n\n- There's a lot of backtracking as you unlock new abilities, pretty par for the course in this kind of game.\n\n- Plenty of puzzles, ranging from \"move the boxes around\" to \"find the right way to travel through this entire massive area with minimal use of the keys hidden throughout and one map hidden in the background.\"\n\n- If you want tough platforming, you can find it.  For the most part it's not mandatory.\n\n- Money feels precious; the game isn't too generous with it and you'll want to buy food, weapons, even inventory space.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to be in your top 5 ever list, I don't know this is it.

You don't have any options outside of attack, charge attack, or jump attack. The one defensive option you have besides timing enemy swings is a roll and that isn't quick or responsive because you have to crouch then roll. having a dedicated roll button would have been nice and at least made me feel i had another option.\n-player progression is also severely lacking. having the 3rd most powerful weapon in the game doesn't make you feel anymore powerful than your first weapon, the frog basic enemy still takes two hits to die. the armor upgrades feel negligible since the enemies can still wombo-combo you to take massive chunks of life off. \n-The food system is basic and broken IMO.

I don't know what about a pixelated, zelda-inspired 2d platformer, and sometimes rage inducing game that I love so much about, but I do know that it impressed me so much when I first played through it. It was one of the first games where I thought we didn't deserve it for free because it was that good. \n\nI'll be honest, when I bought the switch version the difficulty on there was way too much for me. And even Quells himself admitted the beta testers he hired were mostly highly skilled platforming masters so the standard was set a bit too high for comfort for average players like me.\n\nI still love the game nevertheless. And I'm happy I can finally give it the monetary support that it deserves and is worth. I guess the only thing that's frustrating about this game is the save points. It doesn't have the feature anymore where you can pay in order to restart from the most current save unlike the flash version so dying is kind of a pain especially when you have some progress in your pockets up until that point. But other than that I love everything that's been enhanced, added, and polished from it's flash powered predecessor.

Objectively, this is a decent game, clearly with a lot of effort, skill, and love put in. The graphics are beautiful, the story is rich, the music is good, some mechanics are interesting (e.g. encounter transition mechanics). There are lots of interesting puzzles, good humor, and charm. And there are dozens upon dozens of hours of content (based on research I've done). Unfortunately, this research is second-hand, since personally I've abandoned this game after 6 hours. \n\nWhy did I do so? The little things. There are just too many quality-of-life problems that might be endearing to the old school players of 90s RPGs, but are neither common nor really acceptable for a 2021 game. Such as: no in-game map (very unusual for a metroidvania, where backtracking is very common), no quest markers, and no diary or quest journal system. Unless you want to refer to guides/walkthroughts, you need to play this game with a pen and paper, and pay a lot of attention to the text, to remember where to go and what to do. Some puzzles also semi-softlock and require a full game restart to reset the environment, rather than just revisiting the area.\n\nThe other big issue is the movement and combat mechanics. It's just too slow and clunky. Fighting and dodging is hard (not because of challenging enemies, but because of crude and sluggish controls), the weapons are difficult to use, and the overall pace (both combat and progression-wise) seems just too slow/repetitive. Despite being a beautiful, well-crafted world, it just wasn't fun for me to stay in. \n\nDespite getting a lot of the \"big picture\" things right, the game just has too many small flaws and pain points for my taste. By all means, if you're the patient gamer willing to do whatever it takes to find a solution and overcome obstacles, pick up this game and don't let this review deter you, as you'll get many good hours out of it.

Puzzles were fun, although some were... challenging.\n\nBut at the end of the day this is a video game, a platformer with combat and RPG elements, and to me it fails to mesh everything together in a pleasant way.\n\nTake the dash/run mechanic for example. In most other platformers you have a \"hold button to run\" a la SMBros, or \"tap button to dash\" a la MMX. This game combines both: you hit a button to dash, but then you have to hold it to continue running. This doesn't sound so bad until you find yourself in the heat of battle and suddenly your character dashes headfirst *into* the enemy instead of away from them. This was much less of a problem in MMX because in those games you could animation cancel your dash by letting go of the button and just hit the opposite direction on the d-pad. You can't do that here, as there is very little in the way of animation cancelling. Shot your crossbow? Wait until animation completes before you can jump or run, lol. There's also the very laggy aerial melee attack animation (as in, the time between you pressing the button to attack and the character actually swinging their weapon), the need to re-press the dash/run button after every jump, and the fact that they actually mapped the \"aim crossbow\" button to the dash button (at least on KB, which I am using because I have no good controller). Also, the melee attack range in this game is a joke; apparently you get a decent melee weapon later, but I didn't even get to that point before getting fed up with the awful controls. The end result is a platformer with unresponsive controls, and it really takes away from my enjoyment of the game when half the time I'm fighting the controls on top of trying to fight enemies.\n\nAnd before I forget: it's 2021, I thought we were all past the water = death trope platformers used to have. I mean, I'm a *bad* swimmer, but even I wouldn't flail around like a moron every time I get into water higher than my waist.\n\nTLDR: Great visuals and soundtrack, fun puzzles, but unresponsive controls and questionable design choices sucked a lot of the fun out of the game for me. In the end I uninstalled the game without getting past the second world area (desert), that's how much I was put off by the stupid controls.

Took me roughly 35 hours to finish it and I didn't even get to collect everything. I absolutely loved the minor things that Gail does. The little bop and yawn after you rest, the sounds she makes when she goes for the headbutt, and especially the random teleport collapse. All very cute.\n\nThat said, the game definitely could have played a bit better. I did enjoy playing through it but there was enough mechanics that irked me that made it frustrating at time. For starters, your sprint cancels if you fall off a platform or land a jump. It felt like an unnecessary mechanic and really should have just let you keep sprinting. Jumping was also frustrating at times since the direction Gail is facing is locked after you jump and you can't turn to face the other way mid jump. The game defaulting to no i-frames is also a really weird game design choice. If you aren't careful you could end up getting combo'd until you die. There are gameplay accessibility options that you can turn on and one of them is getting some i-frames after getting hit twice in succession but it really should have been the default.\n\nAs for non-mechanical things, the puzzles in the game were for the most part pretty simple or easy to figure out. There were only a few puzzles that actually required me to whip out a notepad to jot things down for. Nothing a bit of trial and error couldn't fix. The character dialogue was really enjoyable. I found myself actually laughing at some of the things that the NPCs said or did. The story was interesting but a bit lackluster and anti-climatic. I didn't realize the final boss fight was even happening because it didn't really give off a \"final boss\" vibe. I'm aware this is a remaster of the original game and there is an original Phoenotopia 2 so hopefully they'll remaster that as well to resolve the story.\n\nThe one thing that REALLY bothered me was the secret boss. I wanted to fight it but the game locks you out of fighting it until you have max HP and Stamina. There's in-game way to check which HP/Stamina upgrades you've found and needing to find all of them just to fight the secret boss seems like an excessive lockout. I really didn't want to go find a guide to get all the upgrades and go check each spot to make sure I had the upgrade.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10. Despite the minor annoyances the game was still an overall enjoyable experience and I would 100% play a remaster of the second game if they ever did one.

They're by far my favorite genre of game. I own probably most of the metroidvanias on steam. And throughout all of that, Phoenotopia: Awakening is probably one of the best ones I've ever played. It does some things better than some of the greats like Hollow Knight, Super Metroid, Ori. Of course all of those are greater in certain parts than this, that's for sure. But I think the fact that this game that's flown under the radar can-- in my opinion-- compete with the greats of the genre is incredible.\n\nPros:\n+Art strikes a perfect balance between detail and simplicity with the art style. And it's cute as hell.\n+Puzzles are great. There are very few times in the game where a puzzle is actually repeated. It always kept fresh. And for the most part they're good and have fun AHA moments. throughout the game there was maybe 3 puzzles that I couldn't figure out, and had to look up, and with only 1 of them did the solution not make sense.\n+Music is pretty good. Not the best, I'd say others have it better, but they do a great job of setting the mood, and there's some tracks that are incredible.\n+Above just about any other metroidvania i've played, it REALLY rewards exploration. There's been a lot of neat moments of exploring someplace and finding something neat, or exploring all the side paths.\n+Character interactions are great, just about every npc has at least 2 unique lines that you can chat with them with. And there's a lot of NPC's\n+A LOT of stuff. I'm about 35 hours in, and I just finished the final boss with 80% completion. And it's been fresh the entire time.\n+There's a fishing minigame. As time goes on I think any games is incomplete if you don't have a fishing minigame.\n\nNot cons, not pros: Some of these may be cons to you, but to me, they weren't.  But weren't pro's either\no There's no map. Usually that really sucks for metroidvanias for me, but as I kept playing the game I didn't really find that an issue. That's usually a lot of points off for me, but the levels and such are designed in a way it's very difficult to actually get lost (probably mostly because there's an overworld to go to different areas. But even in the most complicated areas i never really got lost.\no The story isn't incredible. It serves it's purpose well, but it's not especially hard hitting.\no Combat. It's very basic. You have smack, heavy smack, and then some side weapons that there's only really 2 that have much function in combat unless there's a puzzle element to a boss that requires using one of the others. There's also an energy system that I don't know if it added to the game. I won't say whether the game is better without it, especially because one can lower difficulty to minimize that.\no Grinding. I had to do very little, but it's still something that I needed to do at one point, and to 100% the game there's more to be done. I'm not putting this as a negative only because i had to do it so little. Otherwise exploration and side quests kept my wallet decently full.\no No quest tracker. This one is very close to being a purely con, but again, it never really was an issue for me.\no A purely personal one, but I think a smidge more lore would have been great. There's just still some questions and or details that I think would really bring the world just that step higher. There's enough details to get a nice bit of lore... but just a bit more would have been great. Maybe in the sequel that's probably going to happen?\no Difficulty. It was a very comfortable level of difficult for me, but I'm very experienced in these types of games, this may differ for you.\n\nCon:\nAside from the ones that for YOU might be a con? None. A couple of things were close, but just... weren't enough of a problem to really be a con. This game is very well designed. If i had to pick something, some enemies were kinda annoying to deal with.\n\nAnd finally to address some complaints that I've seen, and my perspective.\nCombat is bad: It's a bit limited, but It's functional. It's roughest in the early game, but even then the short range and stamina didn't feel BAD. It's not like i kept accidentally running into enemies because the range is short, when you get hit you get knocked back, but especially if you learn to ukemi it's barely a loss of time. Juggling is very rare, and that usually happens when you let yourself get surrounded.\n\nEnemies are tanky: I don't particularly understand this one. So long as you don't completely ignore weapon upgrades, i never felt there was a point where there was any enemy that took too many hits. Except maybe boars in the overworld encounters. They kinda take too many hits for being as slippery as they are, but they're also completely and easily avoidable. It's not like other ones where after a point all early enemies die from one hit, but I really wouldn't regard it as bad.\n\nMovement is clunky: I didn't get this, sprinting and rolling takes a little bit of a learning curve, but soon enough it's easy. It's no La-Mulana or early castlevania level of jumping. There were only a few points where I felt it was a bit too hard to get the precision I needed with the movement options. otherwise I was able to be as precise as needed to properly platform as needed.\n\nGrind: I only grinded at one point. There's only really one point of the game that gates continuing the main story behind money. I grinded a bit to get more money, and then never after that. I just collected, sold, and explored.\n\nNo Map: I didn't find it an issue as explained above.\n\nThough a bit of disclaimer: Like I said, I've played a ton of metroidvanias, from the clunkiest to the smoothest, so in some of these my perspective may greatly differ from the other player's experience.

It then redesigned itself into a beautiful game with double the content and released on SWITCH. With the Steam release, it has taken all those years of developement and made a truly delightful experience that everyone can enjoy.\u2029I am 16hrs into the game, considering that the story is 25hrs long and a completionist playthrough is upwards of 50+, I've still got a bit of a journey to go.\u2029\u2029[/b]\n\nYou will find yourself recognising many adventure tropes. A young hero set out into the open world, on a journey that has consequences on worldly events. It all started when a starship came and rudely abducted all the adults, and so recruiting the help of others, you plan to get them back.\u2028\nThe stakes are still relatively small for me, but I am sure to learn the \u201cfate of the world\u201d stakes any moment now... If only I took a break from exploring and collecting moonstones. Unfortunately, I get distracted way too easy by new landscapes and recurring characters like The Travelling Melodies.\n\nIt is a vast world with lots to explore, in true Metroidvania fashion. Any that adore the genre will find a happy home here. Even within the first hour, I spotted cracked rocks and corridors hidden in darkness. I smirked, \u201cYes, I will be returning to learn your secrets\u201d.\n\n\u2029\u2029When you\u2019re not exploring for secrets and lore, you will be fighting for your life in the challenging but rewarding combat. Button mashing the attack button will get you nowhere, you will need to study your enemies patterns and fight smart. Yet another excellent reason to love this game.\u2029\u2029\n\nThere are; underground bandits who live with armadillo-like sand monsters, huge towns filled with beautiful windmills, hi-tech laboratories with robots and secret underground ruins of a lost city reminiscent of our modern day. With so much to discover and humorous dialogue with characters you meet, you won't get bored. Each new location looked different from the last, with great effort in adding narrative details to show off different cultures and lands. The music assisted in the atmosphere at every opportunity, boasting an album of 60 gorgeous tracks.\n\n[b]Within the small amount of time I have played, I have seen and done so much.

It beautifully (and I do mean that quite literally) ties together classic platformer mechanics with a tight control scheme, and many, many well thought out puzzles that are just the right level of difficulty, and keep you thinking throughout the whole game. Something rare in most any game these days.\n\nI've seen some other reviews complain about how big hits send you flying, but that's actually a part of player skill, and it is explained multiple times by NPCs that you can negate this by hitting the dash button just as you are landing, and though the timing for this does need to fairly precise, the game does explain how to safely practice this skill until you've mastered it.\n\nDid I mention the controls are tight? I'll be honest, slight gripe, everything is a little too tight. I don't really mean the controls, but the battles. Aside from most of the Legend of Zelda 2 style overworld battles, They're built like puzzles, which is great, I love the approach from a design standpoint, but once you figure out the puzzle, it's nice to have a little wiggle room for user error, which there is not much of for many of it's fights and challenges, especially along the main story line. They're tough, and while it's possible to beat all of them without taking any damage, some of them feel like a small Touhou fight. Even early on, the game doesn't hold your hand. That said, the puzzle mechanics to the fights don't get Rabi-Ribi levels of complex, and even when you do get hit, the fights are still rather doable, so long as you've figured out the patterns for the fight, and haven't completely refused to explore a little.\n\nThe game plays a lot like an RPG, and I was actually a bit surprised, given the overall style, to find that there is no leveling system, and you don't really need the Rin (this game's currency) you're awarded for fighting all that much either, so aside from the occasional need for item drops, the game actually encourages you to avoid fighting when possible, and it's here that this little gem shines. I thought I was being clever avoiding fights here and there, but it quickly became apparent that the levels are carefully designed and very well tested, actively rewarding you for what would have in any other game been seen as clever, out of the box thinking, both with the more obvious faster or better way around an obstacle or group of enemies, and collectibles often directly used for character upgrades. It's no ordinary metroidvania, and I love that it actively rewards you for gaming it.\n\nDespite knowing that the difficulty the challenges in this game presents may seem daunting to some players, this is easily one of the best releases since Hollow Knight.

However, finding good ones doesn\u2019t require the player to go out of their way.

There are also optional songs and optional battle techniques to improve combat prowess even more\n\n Because of this, the main focus of the game is on exploration.  Looking around for collectibles and solving puzzles is almost required to move on past the increasingly difficult combat challenges. Thankfully, it doesn't feel like a chore. Every treasure chest is cleverly placed, and each upgrade makes you feel increasingly powerful.

This is my game of the year all things considered, but I can acknowledge that there are some issues that people will have with the game if you didn't grow up in that SNES era.\n\nExamples include - no map system outside of the world map, \"awkward\" combat that takes getting used to, and the sprint-jump system. The combat and sprint system can be mitigated by experimenting with how it works and playing around it once you figure it out instead of trying to fight it. I personally didn't have a problem with no map, but I do wish they'd add one in an update as it would be a fantastic accessibility feature to help others.\n\nI've outlined some tips farther down below to help you get around some of these issues!\n\nI think the game's art direction, world building, general platforming, and music make this game a masterpiece for me. Every area has it's own music and distinct style which both fit together incredibly well. Some of my favorite tracks are \"Boss Battle\" \"The White Towers\", and \"Merry Fellowship\".\n\n\nA few tips that I thought I'd share based on what people really dislike about the game based off other comments.\n\n~Exploration~\n- The game is focused on exploration and adventure over all other aspects! If you don't like to talk to NPCs or go off the normal path, the game probably isn't for you.\n- The game has a ton of secret areas which are referenced by NPCs. You can miss ~50% of combat tools [spoiler] and these are not just health or stamina upgrades! Many are the best weapons/skills you can get in the game! [/spoiler] if you ignore NPCs hints or don't go looking for secret platforming areas.\n- Enemies and combat stats seem to be heavily weighted towards getting ~25-50% of the hidden items in the world when you can. The early game is a little difficult, but if you explore and get 50-75% of items, it quickly becomes quite easy.\n\n~Combat~\n- 99% of enemies do not have contact damage. Your short range isn't as detrimental as you might think because you can get right on top of enemies and not take damage.\n- Most enemies attack in front of them. If you're right on top of them, it's easy to jump behind them when their attack indicator shows to dodge the attack. Running backwards will likely get you hit, and the first few enemies (mainly frogs) are designed to teach you this mechanic.\n- Like early 2d platformer games, there is animation cancelling when your jump attack reaches the ground. Try to implement hop attacks often! They do ~1.5x normal hit damage. Early game, a short-hop jump attack > either power attack or normal attack does a lot of burst damage with little stamina consumption. \n- If you really do not like the stamina mechanic, there is an option to turn it off in the settings. With jump attacks or charging, it is easy to play around it, but some people still might not like it.\n\n~Sprinting/Stamina~\n- You can perfectly control yourself in the air after jumping when NOT sprinting.\n- Sprint jumps take you a fixed distance and should be reserved for combat ONLY. Maybe 1 or 2 jumps in the game require sprint. Otherwise it is just a massive lack of control and you'll be much better off doing a walking jump.\n- Walking jumps are great for repositioning, dodging attacks, or doing general platforming.\n-  Sprint jumps are a \"get outta dodge\" panic button in combat. Maybe you need to get away from an enemy quickly or get behind them. \n- In towns/general stretches of land, sprint > immediate jump > sprint immediately after landing > repeat is a fantastic way to preserve stamina compared to sprinting everywhere. You should be able to get the groove of this very quickly.\n- Spamming normal attack in combat does good damage, but will run you out of stamina quickly. Implement the jump attack animation cancel into your fights!\n\nHonestly this is one of the best games I've played and it was hard seeing the lower rating on steam due to people not experimenting with some of these mechanics and giving up early.

This isn't actually a statement of judgement or quality, just a mislabeling of the tag system. It is more similar to Zelda 2 than anything else. \n\nWith that out of the way, this game is just a huge bummer. It's got an amazing look, a fun story, and interesting exploration but none of that can make up for the combat being absolutely terrible. The sluggish movement and extremely short melee range makes engaging with enemies extremely challenging but not in a good way, in a way that makes it feel unfair and unpleasant to deal with. Later on ranged options become available but they aren't much better, with aiming at any distance being hard to judge and also planting the character in place unable to move while doing so, making the always very fast enemies even more likely to hit her and sending her ping-ponging across the ground into multiple unavoidable followup hits.\n\nThere are accessibility options available but none of them actually do anything to address the key problems with the game. Yes it will make it easier if food can be eaten while in the menu, if multiple attacks in a row don't decrease in damage, if normal attacks don't consume stamina. But they won't slow the enemies down, they won't make the character actions more responsive, they won't decrease the amount of damage the player takes, it won't stop the player from getting trapped into animations, or make them able to turn in midair. Not that turning in midair would help, since the current air melee attack is shorter range and slower to trigger than the ground one.\n\nEven playing with all of the options on the combat was an unenjoyable slog, and while most enemies can be walked past or avoided there are still mandatory boss encounters that will require the player to engage with it.

Looks are very charming, it offers some freedom and exploration (although the clunky controls will make you dislike combat and precise platforming) and is overall decent. \nThe grind however is, as far as I'm concerned, ruining a lot.

So, what's your poison of choice:\n\n- Music?\nThis game will have you lost in a pure symphonic euphoria the moment the main menu lands. After playing, I happened across the fact that the OST will go on sale eventually. In my heart, I've pre-ordered the soundtrack, and when it goes on sale, I'll own it for real. It's good.\n\n- Combat?\nAfter speaking to literally everyone in town, I went outside. Enemies appear on the over-world and roam about; some will even chase you across the map, so be careful out there! I spent about 5 or so minutes whapping boars with a bat while dodging their attempts to steamroll me or Goomba stomp me. I died in spectacular fashion.\n\nI had this experience so you wouldn't have to. You're welcome.\n\nKeep in mind, I'm playing on the highest difficulty, so your experiences may vary. During the course of that trying battle, I learned alot about how combat will work. First off, you have stamina. Your stamina drains when sprinting and attacking (extra stamina is consumed if you jump after sprinting); each successive attack after the first deals decreasing damage until, ultimately, you can't attack at all. You can also charge your attack to deal massive damage; it's pretty quick but will necessitate well-timed use because getting hit interrupts it. Also, fck bees.\n\n- Exploration?\nDunno, man. I only got an hour in. However, the over-world map already has several visible locations and my wanderlust was kicking in pretty fiercely. Oh, how I long to end up in-over-my-head in a place I don't belong...\n\n- Art design?\nOh, come on. The trailer showcases everything you need to know on that end.\n\n- Not in Early Access?\nOh, baby. This is, most assuredly, the full package.\n\n\nAll in all, (for me, at least) this one's a keeper.

[b]10 out of 10 worth my time and money[/b].\n\n[h1][TL;DR][/h1]\nFrom world-building with the gorgeous pixel arts, soundtracks and clever NPC dialogues, to the exploration-focused gameplay that involves constantly finding well-hidden collectibles and solving unique puzzles, [i]Phoenotopia[/i] gives me the adventure I have always wanted from video games. It is definitely my personal favourite of all time.\n\n[h1][Pros and Cons][/h1]\nPros:\n+ 30+ hours of enjoyment, 50+ for full completion\n+ Distinct- and beautiful-looking areas/[url=https://sillythewilly.bandcamp.com/album/phoenotopia-awakening-original-game-soundtrack]soundtracks[/url]\n+ Hundreds of Zelda-fashion collectibles (equipment, techniques, heart pieces, chests, etc.)\n+ Nimble main character and tight controls\n+ Variety of combat options\n+ Cleverly written dialogues (from comedic to deep and emotional, good stuff)\n+ Great attention to details in world-building\n\nCons:\n- Not enough maze-like areas/dungeons\n- Game can get too easy if you are an avid explorer\n- You can only hug Lisa once\n- You cannot throw more money at Quells\n\n\n[h1][Full Review][/h1]\nThis final section is where I elaborate on the [Pros and Cons] listed above. I also talked about [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenotopia/comments/l1be7b/my_pretty_long_essay_about_why_i_love_phoenotopia/]why I [i]love[/i] this game so much[/url] on reddit, so give it a read if you're interested!\n\n(I will simply refer [i]Phoenotopia: Awakening[/i] as PHOA from this point forth)\n\n\n[b]Game Length[/b]\n\nAn average game of this genre can usually keep you entertained for 10 hours, and 15 ~ 20 if you are a completionist. The original [i]Phoenotopia[/i] (a free Web Browser game) is already this long, and PHOA is at least twice as substantial. I am pretty confident that PHOA is unrivalled in terms of quantity alone, but what about its quality?\n\n\n[b]Different Aesthetics[/b]\n\nThe sheer variety is the strength of PHOA, and it is the main reason why exploration feels much rewarding here. In terms of aesthetics for example, all the areas have their color themes picked from all across the color wheel (see for yourself in the 2017 [url=https://phoenotopia.tumblr.com/post/162734499718/progress-update-zz]Dev Blog[/url]). It's hard to imagine how many colors they managed to fit in one game. Coupled that with the many fittingly amazing soundtracks? [i]Chef's kiss[/i]\n\n\n[b]Numerous Collectibles[/b]\n\nHaving a big emphasis on exploration, PHOA has hundreds of collectibles scattered around the world as well. This game reminds me a lot of ALBW where I can find treasure chests and Heart Piece power-ups around every nook and cranny, and here you even have 100+ Moonstones to trade for tool upgrades, just like the Maiamai! Despite their differences in terms of genre, I am definitely getting a similar sense of wonder from both adventures!\n\n\n[b]Movement and Control[/b]\n\nBesides the unlockable [spoiler]Teleporters[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Trams[/spoiler], most of the time you will be traveling on foot, and I really like the movement system in this game. This may sound childish, but it feels surprisingly fun and free to run around towns and areas, to the point where we even have mini-games dedicated to that (called \"Free Running Challenges\"). It gets even more satisfying when you discover the few hidden movement tricks that let you almost run indefinitely, making normal running like its own obstacle course!\n\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\n\nThe game has its challenging moments, but you'll probably have no trouble if you are patient enough. The essence of combat boils down to \"how you approach the enemies\", which is quite different to the reflex-tests that most other side-scrolling platformers offer. For example, if you are surrounded by a group of wild boars, you probably want to lure and focus on eliminating them one by one, as opposed to rushing in with your baseball bat.\n\nIt's also worth noting that enemies have no active hitbox unless they are attacking. So if you don't like close combat or throwing projectiles, you can literally run past pretty much all foes. Anyway, the game rarely forces you to use any specific weapon, and each weapon choice is good for certain situations (excluding the [strike]joke[/strike] ultimate weapon of course).\n\n\n[b]NPC Interaction[/b]\n\nReading in this game is some of the most fun I've had. From the tutorial NPC that yeets you onto a bench to \"teach\" a technique, to the lore NPC that tells you about how the restaurant had to change its name after man-bear-wrestling became illegal for safety reasons, the writing in this game is simply full of life. Sure, some people may get overwhelmed, but it's not like you [i]have[/i] to read most of them to progress or anything, so I'll take this gladly!\n\nOh, and there are of course many Side Quests here. When it comes to quest rewards, you don't just get shiny new items, but also some of the best dialogues in the game too. While the bandit quest line might be fan-favourite to many, mine is the backstory of a nameless sentient robot (it kinda resonates with my mild depression, don't tell anyone). Needlessly to say, the game has a [i]really[/i] diverse cast of characters.\n\n\n[b]Attention to Details[/b]\n\nIn addition to the assets and the writing, the designs are also pretty well thought-out. Treasures are in the form of antiques because you are exploring a ruin,  keys are one-time-use because it's a gemstone to be inserted, Prickle Fruit takes longer to cook because it's hairy and can be burnt easily like IRL, et cetera. All these small details may go unnoticed by many, but I argue that they do add up to help immensely in keeping this an immersive experience.\n\n\n[b]Nitpicking (on level designs)[/b]\n\nThis game is [i]brimming[/i] with puzzles and riddles, and most of them are standalone with clues either next to them or right outside the room. There are many [i]many[/i] clever ones that I like, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't mind seeing a few complicated Divine-Beast-like dungeons too.\n\n\n[b]Nitpicking (on combat balance)[/b]\n\nThis is another part that \"bad reviews\" confuse me - The game is not really hard or unfair. Obviously, the more you explore, the more collectibles you find. Some come in forms of money (used for buying certain tools and inventory expansion), some come in forms of Heart Rubies/Energy Gems that raise your HP/stamina cap. If anything, you are near unstoppable when you can [spoiler]create explosion from thin air or regenerate health automatically[/spoiler]. The reward for exploration [i]may[/i] have empowered players too much near end-game.\n\n\n[b]Not even Nitpicking[/b]\n\nThe animation when Gail hugs Lisa is so cute, and you only get to see it once per playthrough? [b]Blasphemy![/b]\n\nAlso, trust me when I say the most frequently asked questions from Discord are \"Is any DLC planned?\" and \"When is the sequel coming out?\". Guess it's safe to say that most of us are excited to see what's coming next from the team!\n\n\n[h1]I really really like the game.[/h1]\n^ This ^\nSo please consider buying it to support the dev!", "timestamp_created": 1611434584, "timestamp_updated": 1611435708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686196386814117432", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85215292": {"recommendationid": "85215292", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979910600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1612285946}, "language": "english", "review": "wow what an absolute delight", "timestamp_created": 1611421701, "timestamp_updated": 1611421701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461309522390365601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85195960": {"recommendationid": "85195960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049559479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1611923303}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1611398381, "timestamp_updated": 1611398381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461309522390365601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85194900": {"recommendationid": "85194900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972382561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1611395518}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like the style and the music of this game, but some of the controls really really bother me.

I consider it a great extension of the OG flash game's - featuring softer lighting and brighter colours, it really has this \"soft and cozy\" feel to it. It's fun to see how prettier everything got - from locations, now having certainly more details to themselves, both lore-wise and aesthetic-wise, through NPCs who got a major overhaul, where even ones with two lines have more \"visual personality\" and UIs, ending on the grand non-pixel images like the start menu background or the first cutscene.\n\nHearing many of the old tracks mixed with the new ones was fun too! The way they expand on visuals' climate really cements a location's feel. (As you can see, I don't know how to discuss music)\n\nThe plot is engaging, and formerly sort of dull personalities of the flash were changed and built upon, too! Lore can be digested both via dialogue and via environment - my favourite piece was an ancient building in south-east of Atai, it had such an interesting puzzle not because of its \"puzzle\" elements (though I liked them too, even if I kept failing) - it was just jam-packed with history despite only using maybe 30 words overall.\n\nPuzzles can be hard at times, though. That needs to be said. Lots of them require quite specific, fast movement. Even though most of them aren't required, I believe that it may be helpful for people. I don't believe it's a bad thing! It can just get a bit frustrating, at times.\n\nI know that a lot of people said it, but while I adore the effort, the locations are. HUGE. It's very easy to get lost in your average city, and the amount of NPCs can be a bit overwhelming. And I say it as a person who loves talking to them for lore. After some time I just stop caring, unfortunately. And I can't shake off the feeling that I'm missing out on something important...\n\nThe combat is usually enjoyable. The beginning of Doki Forest feels quite hard at the beginning, even now when I'd estimate I'm 33% through the game with decent gear for this level, but it gets better after that. I mean, I am playing with all the Accessibility Options on, because I'm not very experienced in that sort of stuff, so I don't really know what the game is like without them, haha. I struggled with one boss after that, but that's more because I didn't have a lot of food on myself, so it's more my fault anyway.\n\nOverall, the game is very pleasant to play, even if it can be overwhelming at times.

A masterwork RPG. Worth full price.\n\nPhoenotopia is big on exploration, lore, characters, puzzles and secrets, with simple yet engaging combat system. The world and its puzzles & secrets are laid out expertly. Its lore and visuals are consistent. The music is great. Everything is just perfect.\n\nThere is no quest menu. You must engage with the world and remember people, names, places and events to progress in the main story, and even more so for secret unlocks. As a vague example, you'd have to talk to a lot of people around town, who will give you nuggets of information that give you the general state of things. Guided by your own curiosity, you will use this information to find secrets and solve puzzles as you inch toward your goal, which often conveniently ties into the main story.\n\nCombat is simple, but has depth due to the way you interact with enemies. Projectiles can be destroyed by hitting them. Enemies are not immune to environmental hazards. Enemies will perform certain actions, not at random, but depending on how healthy it is, what you are currently dong or where you currently are. Enemies aren't just damage soaks. They flinch and have knockback. Your attacks have weight. The gameplay begs you to outsmart the opponent. Enemies don't just touch you to damage you, they all have attacks that you can see and dodge. It just works.\n\nThe economy in this game is expertly crafted as well. They have a food and cooking system, that is actually VITAL. Inventory space is short, so you have to decide what you hold, use and discard. Eating is nuanced in an interesting way. Heavier foods heal for a lot, but take literal mid-combat seconds to consume, leaving you open while you try to heal. However, liquid foods, which are rarer to come by or harder to craft, can be consumed quickly, so they are better for combat, for example. Money is similar: it is scarce, making spending money a decision to weigh carefully. Do you want extra inventory slots or do you want that new weapon? Do I really want to spend money on this shady NPC who 'claims' to have useful information? You have to actually think about these situations! In most games, the economy is so bloated that you can throw money where-ever and it wouldn't even matter.\n\nThis game challenging and makes you think.\n\nAll that being said, difficulty may be a concern. If you're not one to pay attention or maybe you just forgot some key information, the lack of a quest menu may become a nuisance. Without the right leads in mind, you can easily get stuck, not knowing what to do, where to go, or how to progress, if you don't pay attention. Also, some combat scenarios can be very challenging. Keep in mind that there are a variety of perks you can enable to make the gameplay more accessible at any time. Settings, such as getting invicibility frames and having more stamina (you need stamina to attack or use abilities). \n\n---\nOverall, I love this game. Definitely my favorite RPG to date. I've been a fan of the game since it was a Flash game on Armor Games. Since Flash died, this remaster is such a welcomed release. If you've played that version, note that this game is that, but with more features and new or reworked content, on top of the graphics update.\n\nAlso, its not a \"metroidvania\". Maybe in a very loose term... but do note It takes way more from Zelda than it does from Metroid or Castlevania.

I only logged a couple minutes just so I could make this review as soon as possible. I love this game so much, I played the original when it first released many years ago, it was one of my favourite games, and it still is to this day. Ever since I found about Awakening, I had been anxiously awaiting its arrival until it released on Switch a while ago now, I picked it up day one on release. This game holds so much nostalgia to me, and the soundtrack is incredible (both the original and Awakening), as soon as I played Awakening for the first time, it was like I was a little kid again. Aside from the fact that I personally like it, the reason I recommend this game is because not only does it appeal to those who like metroidvanias (which were my favourite growing up, and are still among my favourite game genres), but it also appeals to those who love an incredible story driven game with REALLY well thought out and beautifully crafted puzzle systems, that make it feel less of a puzzle and more of a true metroidvania, integrated perfectly, and it also appeals to those who love games like Zelda II, since there are lots of aspects taken from that game. The original was beautiful, and still is, but this remake is beyond any expectations I could have had for how amazing it could have been. This game, is one of my favourites, ever, do not overlook this game. Even if you're not into metroidvanias, I believe you will still love this game, because it's something that many different types of people can love. I've had an interaction with the developer himself a few years back, and not only are they a very, very talented individual, they're a very kindhearted, warm and welcoming person, who you will be supporting if you get this game.

It's hard to get across just how much content there is to find in this game, and almost all of it is unique and fun to solve.

It's not flashy when it comes to the trailer, it's art style is good but not eye appealing, and its first impression of gameplay doesn't seem to pop compared to other games. But I'm here to say that would be a mistake. Phenotopia Awakening is a game that understands how to assemble a series of mechanics together to make an alternative yet fantastic experience that will reward players who adapt to the game's mechanics. The dash having a real momentum really ups the challenge of both platforming and combat, and sub-weapons actually have strengths/weaknesses to make them actually sub-weapons (and not abusable). Combat can be tricky if you try to fight recklessly, and the game rewards you using your mind rather then your reflexes in many cases, which is really nice to see. Combine that with a great variety of different puzzles and combat scenarios, and you have a game that you can bite into.\n\nThe story does well in highlighting the world and not making it all about the protagonist, but actually feeling like she's a part of a huge adventure that happens in conjuction with other's stories. Granted, you may get bogged down in some of the text (there's a lot of talking here), and if you're someone who needs action every couple of minutes to feed your adrenaline addiction, this is not the game for you. It's a game where you will have to explore, find a side story, maybe do some grinding to get some money and food, and then figure out exactly where to go next. When the world opens up, man does it open up, to the point where it can really feel a little bit overpowering. With that said, it's a game that you can easily get lost in, wondering where the time went.\n\nGive it a try, and you'll find a game that you'll want to see where it ends up taking you. \n\n[b]Gameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/n9H18rAmHa0 [/b] \n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Strong alternative gameplay that relies on smart mechanic design in order to provide a challenge, rather then focusing on reflexes/reaction.\n[*] Puzzle/Level Design is some of the best in the genre, having a variety but also actually making you think alternatively about your tool set.\n[*] The best word to describe the game: clever. \n[*] Difficulty is challenging without being unfair. \n[*] Controls are purposeful in the right ways: forcing you to adjust to them without having variance.\n[*] Lot of content here, chunky game that doesn't have a lot of bad meat on its bones (no real filler).\n[*] Side-stories and missions are a blast and can lead to some hilarious/cute moments.\n[*] Game uses it's presentation well to set up good moments and sound design complements the game rather nicely. \n[*] Feels like an adventure: a lot of games miss this lately and it helps that the game's events all feel of the same world and down to earth.\n[*] Wonderful music that does well to setting the mood. \n[*] Good selection of accessibility options to help players without feeling like handing them the farm.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A lot to take in and you constantly end up getting lost. A game that at times I really feel like I needed a screen dedicated to quests/side missions/map.\n[*] It does take some time to get adjusted to the different gameplay style at play here, and if you're stubborn, you're not going to have a good time.\n[*] Every now and again you're going to need to grind for food/resources and at times it can get a little annoying. \n[*] Would like to see steam cloud saves implemented in the future.\n\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
