Unfortunately you can't change the shape of the logo but you can change what's on there. There's a build phase after you've finished making the uniforms, school name, motto and choosing the principal. The build phase is where you can start building your school including the facilities you'll have there along with researching different topics to become the best. Researching is basically upgrading. You can unlock better teachers, Eco -friendly options with electricity and water, able to unlock more land, maxing out your schools student population to 700, workers work faster, more furniture, walls, floors, plants, fences and gates. The zoning feature is great because you can stop students from interacting with teachers and workers in certain places while the feature also tells you the basic criteria to build the room you want to build. Goons will try and ruin your school, you can easily remove them by completing the detention rooms research. Students are quite unique compared to the staff, they confess their love to other students, they can rebel, they all have different traits, they follow the schedule you make for them alongside having the capability to become ill. The rebelling is that they try skip school, smoke in the bathroom, bully students or are just rude. You can choose what to do as punishments for each type of rebellion. (The only way they are caught is by having monitors at your school.) Overall, you get a great looping experience, every 9 days a new year starts, you compete rival schools while getting ranked for the effort your students put in during their exams. The only downsides to this game is lack of events, school trips, workers bugging out and not doing a single task for either a full hour or whole day, ( I usually just re-spawn the workers.), lack of land to own, too long of days (even on full speed, maybe add another fast forward button?), I also dislike how you can't just view all the students from a certain year. This is because I want to favourite all of my Seniors before they leave so that they feel appreciated and motivated to do more work. Another issue is that the school pet becomes basically useless by the mid to end-game the pets objective becomes obsolete as you have more facilitates to boost your students happiness rates. My final issue with this game is how you can't \"start\" a game unless you use the normal mode instead of the sandbox that gives you unlimited money but I solved this issue by using a mod.

If managed well, you can have the entire skill tree researched in just a couple of school years. \n\nI really hope the population (student) cap is lifted in future updates, because that is the main drawback in sandbox mode. Some other suggestions would be school wide emergencies that need real management (lock-downs, fires, pandemics, etc.), a Delinquency bar on student info panels (I haven't seen one yet, but let me know if iv'e just missed it), and perhaps a DLC of boarding school/military school with additional management functionality.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed the time put into this game.

"language": "english", "review": "It was fun for awhile; took me maybe 12 hours to burn through the content at a leisurely pace. After that its just repetition and leaving the game running for achievements if that is your thing. \n\nPros\n-The graphics and soundtrack are pleasant enough.\n- The concept of a prison architect style game set in a school is interesting.\n- The performance was OK although my prison was quite small and it was still dropping in to the 30s on occasion so I worry about how well it scales.\n\nCons\n- The game feels a little shallow. For example most buildings don't really offer any function or introduce any new mechanics or game-play elements. Maybe they provide some under the hood stat boosts but really other than ticking off grants the building of facilities does not feel very rewarding. \n- There is a system for routing staff members such as setting an explicit path for a Janitor. Unfortunately its cumbersome and actually counter-productive. For example If you have a Janitor on a specific route then they will ignore dirty areas in other parts of the school. Removing the route allows them to be more dynamic and cover more ground.\n- Workers occasionally stopped performing tasks for me. I think its maybe if you queue up to many jobs it creates confusion or maybe even kicks out some earlier jobs. This game appears to implement a stack (last in first out) system as opposed to the more traditional queue (first in first out) system. I had to cancel the work and apply it again or sometimes putting additional work tasks in the same general area would be enough.\n- The UI is clunky and gets in the way. A lot of the screens were not very intuitive in my opinion and the menus are always taking up a chunk of the screen.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where the games goes now since its been acquired by paradox. Will it be the usual story with 50 DLC's (and no season pass) or will the base game get any love as well since its crying out for more content. As it stands now I think it does just enough to get the thumbs up but probably wait for a big sale.", "timestamp_created": 1670260863, "timestamp_updated": 1670260863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

I am quite proud of myself on this one, as I was wise enough to pick this game up for pennies when it was still on early access. Now that it's worth $20 it is definitely worth the asking price for any fan of the simulation genre, and you should get it now before Paradox turns it into something even better.\n\nThis game was a natural buy for Paradox. Although Paradox takes a lot of flack for their DLC scheme, I am a long-time Paradox fan and will throw down the gauntlet to defend their honor if you say there is a better publisher out there. Paradox is very community-centered, offering modding compatibility before it was cool and keeping a keen ear toward fan feedback. Though fans bellyache about their DLC, I have yet to see another company manage to do DLC better, and Paradox would not be able to offer the amazing support they do to their games without the occasional boosts they get from DLC. As a big fan of Cities: Skylines and Prison Architect (as well as their grand strats), Paradox DLC is basically always worth the asking price and it rarely feels as though they're hiding behind a paywall that should've been included in the base game (here's to you, EA.) \n\nNow that Paradox has picked up Academia: School Simulator, we can expect them to do the same thing they did when they picked up Prison Architect. I had the luck of picking up Academia for pennies when it was in alpha, at a time when it was barely functional. It has come a long way now, as a full-fledged school simulator which has always been a blatant copy of Prison Architect -- and a good copy, no less. Adding its own spin to Prison Architect's successful gameplay structure and turning into an education sim, Academia is already an engrossing success. Now just wait until Paradox gets done with it.\n\nThe first thing Paradox did when they acquired Prison Architect was implement many massive free updates. Academia has many small issues that still need to be ironed out, and I expect they'll all be fixed within a few months of the acquisition. We're likely to see free objects, free gameplay additions, bugfixes, scenarios, and more. At its current level, Academia is still a little rough around the edges, though I'm at six hours and counting and I'm still having fun. With the love and experience (and also money) the Paradox team will be able to put into it, I have no doubt that Academia's base game will be massively improved over the next several months and they will do it completely for free.\n\nThen, they'll start adding DLC. This game is ripe for an expansion from grade/primary school into university, and I have no doubt that a university expansion will be among the plans Paradox will lay. The fact that they own Prison Architect will make the addition of dormitories and more complicated schedules easy. A specialized school DLC will also likely happen, adding reform schools and military schools, perhaps even juvenile detention centers... the potential for this game is vast. I have absolutely no doubt Paradox will make this something special.\n\nIf you're a fan of the sim genre, you should absolutely pick up this game, even at its $20 price point. It's worth $20 in its current state, but it's also a great investment for the future -- after all, Prison Architect retails for $30.", "timestamp_created": 1648690996, "timestamp_updated": 1648691076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633403778076171875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113095831": {"recommendationid": "113095831", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014363558", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1649000357}, "language": "english", "review": "who would've known building the very thing i hate, be giving much entertainment", "timestamp_created": 1648690278, "timestamp_updated": 1648690278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113051540": {"recommendationid": "113051540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289031622", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1648672055}, "language": "english", "review": "It's An Amazing Game For People Looking To Play A Different Version Of Prison Architect.\nHonestly My Opinion 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1648611026, "timestamp_updated": 1648611026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543679177761077881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113021465": {"recommendationid": "113021465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854417269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4187, "last_played": 1661815028}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah I guess, I mean like if you like prison architect, then maybe...

Although I've only played Academia: School Simulator on Easy mode so far (ie all the options cash, truancy etc. set generously) it's a much more chilled out experience. No constant struggle with contraband and bloody riots thankfully! Although even on easy budget I failed my first school by not building the classrooms needed to open within the initial budget.\n\nFrom there though it's not a hard trial and error to get the student's needs satisfied and work toward getting them their best possible grades! The year ticks over quickly and more students (and therefore income) want in your school, soon snowballing to where you can afford to get more ambitious with your setup! Add 'grants' to that and you can get into that position even quicker!\n\nYou are dealing with 4 years of students each with names and some variety in appearance, as well as likely having 6 faculty teachers in year 1 also each with names and individual stats. Even the Janitors and Cooks have names! All these make it an addictive pleasure to watch the school schedule tick over in the place you've built, check how the students are doing in their subjects down to individuals if you want, building and tweaking as creatively as you like.\n\nI personally have 3 schools running rather than grinding one into excess and boredom, which is made moe enticing by having 10 uniforms to choose from which can help you feel reason to create a different environment.

If you haven\u2019t played Prison Architect, you should check it out first since this game is a lesser version of it. Game is fun while learning (there aren\u2019t any help for you to learn) but pretty boring after a while. Most of its difficulty comes from low money income and you just have to wait for money while playing. There are some annoying bugs like students dropping school while you have their needs and bus services don\u2019t work but it doesn\u2019t affect the game that much, I guess.

I get a nice warm fuzzy feeling when troubled students get the counseling they need and get into top tier colleges. There is a small bittersweet feeling you get when see these students grow up in your school, have to leave for better things.\n\nOf course, it feels a bit shallow. I achieved the ideal school in less than 24 hours of gameplay, which I suppose isn't the only goal in the game, but that's what mine was, and I feel that was good enough. I think what would push the game over the top would be the addition of more social aspects being implemented. Bullies/crushes are awesome, and these interactions make you root for good outcomes (doesn't always happen of course), but the drama is somewhat interesting. However, there isn't much of it. I wish there were cliques, fads, and trends to contend with. Perhaps, students will resolve to establish territories in non-essential classrooms/area where outsiders are snubbed or bullied. Perhaps, if they walk the walk or talk the talk, they can join the clique. I don't think it has to be only traditional, \"Goth, jock, geek\" archetypes, but perhaps students who don't fit into these groups create subcultures based on musical/game interest?\n\nI don't know. This is a review, not a suggestion board.\nRyan Sumo, I don't know if you're done with this game, but I loved it, and hope there is more. If not, I think that's cool too.\nThanks.", "timestamp_created": 1633574361, "timestamp_updated": 1648186720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Other elements like teacher training, student activities, and our randomized events system are things that PA does not have. PA also does not have, AFAIK, people that fall in love and break up with each other.\n\nIf you didn't like the game its your right to leave a bad review.

I've experienced only one bug which was quickly targeted and zapped by the developers in a hotfix. \n\nMy only complaint is that towards the end of the game, it gets kinda stale. You've done most of the grants and most of the check marks to get to the end and aside from three events in the activity hall and random events, there isn't much to focus on except the every day, which can get dull over time. \n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 Excellent, can't get much better\n[b]\u2611 Good, smooth and polished[/b]\n\u2610 Decent, little to no bugs\n\u2610 Poor, some issues\n\u2610 Unplayable, bug riddled\n\n---{Soundtrack}---\n\u2610 Made a custom playlist including soundtrack\n\u2610 Still jamming\n\u2610 It's okay\n[b]\u2611 Turned it off after a while[/b]\n\u2610 Lasted 30 seconds before muting\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Smooth Brain\n[b]\u2611 Easy to learn with depth[/b]\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Play Time Potential}---\n\u2610 Short (1 hour or less)\n\u2610 Average (1-8)\n\u2610 Long (8-12)\n\u2610 Marathon (12-24)\n[b]\u2611 Addicted (24+)[/b]\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n[b]\u2611 Worth the price[/b]\n\u2610 Buy on sale\n\u2610 Not recommended", "timestamp_created": 1619030804, "timestamp_updated": 1619036892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598784208297729492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90650875": {"recommendationid": "90650875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401518069", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2140, "last_played": 1635034036}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game!", "timestamp_created": 1618956410, "timestamp_updated": 1618956410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90596217": {"recommendationid": "90596217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283934171", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1879, "last_played": 1618735447}, "language": "english", "review": "lots of fun, great game to relax and unwind playing", "timestamp_created": 1618865275, "timestamp_updated": 1618865275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90556533": {"recommendationid": "90556533", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059960722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 714, "last_played": 1655001254}, "language": "english", "review": "e", "timestamp_created": 1618801550, "timestamp_updated": 1618801550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90520088": {"recommendationid": "90520088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235296816", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2703, "last_played": 1618749462}, "language": "english", "review": "Game Rating: 8/10\n\nThis game is much better than Prison Architect and I gonna buy their new game (Ruinarch) to support this developer\nThis game worth it full price\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nUpdate 22.03.25:\n-paradox interactive\n\nBefore this date, it was a good game...", "timestamp_created": 1618749141, "timestamp_updated": 1648279861, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90445991": {"recommendationid": "90445991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134085919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3872, "last_played": 1699252900}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addicting.

So many things are lifted directly from PA such as staffing (build office zones, hire staffers like lawyers that occupy them one to an office after you research them), research and grants, zones, building methodology (little worker guys hover around Delivery zones then go do it) that it's all jarring in the end. Unfortunately it's all done with an inferior UI that feels like it belongs more in an alpha than a finished product. It lacks polish and detail and seems to achieve the bare minimum while making it hard to see important facts like how your teachers are assigned, or alert you to problems like subjects with no teachers covering them.\n\nWhat the game really seems to suffer from though is a shallow gameplay loop. You have a build phase at the start of the year and then you kick off the year and then...there's just not a lot to do. Your kids go to class, your janitors clean, your monitors grab the ones smoking in the bathroom, and short of doing some tweaks to logistics there's not a lot of conflict going on here for you to diagnose. Prison Architect solved this by challenging you with things like contraband, intra-prisoner rivalries, riots, and other events, but Academia feels like the team never quite hit on a solid answer to what should keep the player occupied. Some of it feels like roadblocks they threw up to slow down your kids' improvements just to keep you plugging away - for example, a Track improves your kids' P.E. class...but only for Freshmen.\n\nI do feel like the underlying idea here is great.

Yet it takes a whole IRL hour most of the time to finish a year on the fastest setting?? Thats ridiculous.

There are definitely things that feel like the game is missing, like the ability to move items instead of selling and re-placing.

Academia itself is a great concept for a less-gritty Prison Architect where you run, build, and manage a school.  You have to deal with staff, grades, problem-students, budgets, schedules, the list goes on...\n\nUnfortunately, the game comes across as trying to be a mile-wide but only an inch-deep.  There's lots of basic things missing from the game you would expect to be commonplace, like relocating objects.  There's also a it-just-gets-the-job-done UI which -- at times -- has little to no data for you to work off of.  For instance, when planning meals for your cafeteria(s), there is zero feedback given to the player of if you are making enough food, have enough serving lines, cooks, food stocks, or etc.  You just have to spam-place objects down until you stop having students drop-out or complain about being hungry for lack of any analytical data to go off of. \n\nThe research tree can be fun to unlock more stuff for your school, but the first \"school year\" can be very hard; requiring you to only build the bare-minimum room sizes and objects or risk running out of money to continue. While this is just a preference thing and you can change your starting funds on a new game, it makes each play-though feel remarkably identical.\n\nThere are game over scenarios here -- if you have over 50% of your students either being delinquent or sick, you get shut down.  This isn't that big of a deal, except for the random events that happen throughout your gameplay.  You can ignore these events and lose reputation instead, but doing so is a rough shot-in-the-foot to any progress.  The events aren't always that bad and sure you could save-scum to get around them, but in my last two play attempts in 1.0, I got an earthquake event that required me to either lose $8,000 in-game which I didn't have at the time, or have something like 40+ objects break and over half the student body instantly get injured.  This results in a game over at the end of the day because there's no way you can get your students back healthy before the end of the day without an infirmary level nursing station, which you won't have or afford in the first day(s) of your school. \n\nSo, the TLDR here:\n\nGame at the surface is fun if you can get past a basic UI, lack of a few come-to-expect gameplay functions for this genre of game, sometimes punishing random events, and the need to watch the game in fast-forward to get more money to really do anything.  The game is fun, so if you can grab it on sale I would say it's worth getting, but it still needs some more additions before I would personally say it's ready for a full-release and the full-price; especially when you can get games like Prison Architect frequently on sale at this price or less which currently has a more fleshed out and (dare I say) \"finished\" feel. \n\nI have nothing but respect for this dev who has always been willing to communicate, and I hope the game keeps getting worked on into the future, because if some glaring missing functions and data-reporting was there which isn't, it would be worth $25-30 easy because the concept is fun.

I've played prison architect before so getting used to the game wasn't that difficult and I did expect something similar - less prison-y perhaps. In short, it's a nice cute game to play.

Ultimately, that is what my review boils down to. After 2 or 3 years you find yourself just waiting for time to pass. I would say around 1/3 of the time I've played has been spent on waiting for the academic year to end so I can actually do something. The scenarios make this game for me but they are also too easy and can be completed quickly. There is very little management needed and it just becomes a game of \"lets make a pretty school\". That being said, school design is certainly a strength of this game.\n\nEven with the custom difficulties there aren't enough delinquents or sick students for it to pose a challenge. All the hardest difficulty settings do is determine how long you'll be sat waiting with nothing to do because you have no money, and won't be getting any money until you can attract enough students. The only challenge to it is how tediously slow time passes when you have nothing to do in-game.\n\nGoing forward, for me to recommend the game, I want to see significantly harder scenarios or things like custom scenarios/enrolment settings where we can choose the % of delinquents/sick students we want per year for example. Disasters (e.g. fires, earthquakes, epidemics) would also be a nice addition to increase difficulty and, combined with custom settings, we could set the frequency/severity and/or a grace period if we wanted to so we can get our school up and running first; this would add more gameplay to long term saves when things get boring. Adding staff age/retirement would mean we have to really consider who to hire, whether they're worth the money, and when we'll need to hire new staff to replace them once they leave. Student satisfaction/needs could include career pathways e.g. a student wants to be a scientist but you have no science lab so that lowers their satisfaction. There's a lot they could add but, if nothing else, the time needs to pass faster.\n\nAgain, it is in no way a BAD game, it just needs more to it and I'm hopeful that they'll continue updating it.", "timestamp_created": 1602626071, "timestamp_updated": 1602626071, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592911779880523682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77349998": {"recommendationid": "77349998", "author": {"steamid": "76561199051329128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 941, "last_played": 1654317303}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1602351195, "timestamp_updated": 1602351195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488069385290145874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77343060": {"recommendationid": "77343060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198954566013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2632, "last_played": 1627574901}, "language": "english", "review": "epic", "timestamp_created": 1602343053, "timestamp_updated": 1602343053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488069385290145874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77317741": {"recommendationid": "77317741", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029484660", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1684810974}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me gusta XDDD\n", "timestamp_created": 1602302788, "timestamp_updated": 1602302788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77261490": {"recommendationid": "77261490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448527198", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1616455285}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is pretty fun and the devs are constantly making improvements.

I've found it quite fun and put in many hours but I do agree there is quite a bit lacking in the game. There's also a lot of infuriating game mechanics that almost ruin the game for me and are making it hard to want to continue playing the game in its current state. \n\nStarting off with the positives. I like the customisation you get for your school and how you can decorate. It is very similar to Prison Architect as mentioned. The game has run very well for me and the graphics are cute. \n\nNow on to the negatives. Oh boy. \nSometimes I feel like I'm playing School Janitor Simulator instead as the hygiene mechanic in the game is beyond broken. This is my biggest grief with the game. Dirt gets everywhere even when I set the level to 'Tidy' and your janitors have a hard time keeping up with the amount of dirt being produced. The students then complain the school is too filthy and drop out which lowers your income. You hire more janitors which also lowers your income but the school is still too filthy. This creates an endless loop of students dropping and you losing more and more money. This makes playing scenarios immensely frustrating because it makes it way more difficult than it needs to be and you're way too likely to fail due to just not having enough funds and not being able to bring it back. Unpaved dirt also tanking your overall cleanliness school is really stupid also. It's...the ground...why are we counting the grass and ground as dirty?! The janitors also act poorly in their AI. They clump together on the routes instead of spreading out and with janitor priority they ALL go instead of just the ones without a route as stated in the tooltip. Basically, you end up researching Janitor Priority as fast as possible then spending all your time telling the Janitors where to clean. Not what I signed up for.\n\nNext is the grading system. Not sure if it's just buggy but I definitely find it ridiculous. With level 1 teachers, even if at the end of the school year your students grade levels are all in the green they will still overwhelmingly fail. It forces you to get level 2 teachers which tank your income fast. Heck, even with level 2 teachers you still get a weirdly high number of students who fail. But if you don't get a good grade you don't get enough students interested so you don't get much tuition money. This again starts a nose dive to failure. It's not that I don't want a challenge, it's that it's too difficult to come back from having a drop like that and it just ends up in failing or starting the save over. The other hand is that it gets way too easy. \n\nNext the random events are a nuisance and don't have much variety. It's pretty much 'spend money you don't have or 90% chance to lose stuff'. Pay $3000 for only 10 prestige? No way. I find myself just skipping them and taking the -5 prestige penalty instead because it's simply not worth it. You may get the good event where you can just get some money ($1000) or prestige (100) but I don't get those much. They're also very repetitive. \n\nThen you realise that there isn't really all that much to the game. You really don't need to build more than just basic classrooms if you don't want to unless you want the grant money or the scenario tells you to. You get better teachers, build the school bigger and that's it. The various sporting rooms are per class group which I don't think should be a thing (why only seniors for basketball or only juniors for swimming?). The game is in early access and I do think it has a good amount of beautification options right now so I'm not bothered on getting more for now but there does need to be a lot more gameplay elements to it. How about the option to put on our own events? Plan the graduation ceremony? (As of right now students just disappear in to the cosmos when they graduate). More random events that do something other than spending money to still lose some staff or students. What if the school inspector was more than just a random event pop up? Plenty of ideas.\n\nOverall, my conclusion is they have a good beginning here and I have enjoyed the time I have played but I would recommend anyone who is looking to purchase to wait until they put more into this game and fix the glaring issues because you'll get bored very quickly. I'm mainly treating this game as an idle game at this point.

Seems to be very poorly balanced in the beginning, or something, I really don't know...\nI enrolled 40 students at the beginning of my first year, and I had less then 20 by day 9. The students kept dropping out because it was \"too boring\", but I had a common room, and I couldn't do anything because I was in negative cash flow for 90% of my play time. I don't know if it's a balance issue or a bug with the latest update, but my god was it annoying. I tried multiple tries to research other things first etc, but the students kept leaving and you slowly lose more and more money, until I couldn't do anything anymore. By day 9 my teachers were costing more than my students were able to pay me for tuition. Grants helped temporarily, but I could never get back into positive cash flow. Refunded for now, maybe I will check on the game in a few months or so.\n\nEdit 5/5/2020\nI purchased the game again, its quarantine time, what else can I do?

I've played two schools in 3 hours, in both I was able to research the full student portion of the research tree and built everything, and discover it made little impact - I keep losing students because my school is \"boring\". \n\nThe rest of the research tree and mechanics are largely about scaling up the logistics to support a larger school. But that seems to be it. This lacks all the subtly and challenge of the the other games. Theme Hospital for example had scenarios and scaled up the challenge over the course of the game. This is just everything on a plate and you realise it's not much of a meal. From what I can tell not much has changed over a few years in early access.\n\nI contrast this with Another Brick in the Mall which has constantly upgraded the mechanics and game play until it reached 1.0.

manegment game, my only complaint is a BIG complaint. very often, i feel the need to go AFK and they r trying to make it more fun than a AFK game so came eventful days, (and where u hav to click a goon to have ur moniters arrest him) but unfortunitley it made it worse, and rather than go AFK, i dont want to be bored staring at the screen waiting for something intresting to happen but i need 2 play or i could let a goon wander in my school, and bad things will happen (which is why they added a research where moniters automaticly take down goons but comes later in game) and if i miss a event by accident, i lose prestige which prohibits me going afk, so i thought i'd watch a student but that got bored QUICKLY bec its the same routine, go to class, pee and/or poop, go to class, eat, go to common room, go to class, go home. one way to stop this is adding a 20x speed so u can skip through the day if needed and the game should go back to 1 speed if a goon has been spotted or there is a event or other such thing have happened. i would love to see this happen, otherwise i would 100% recomend this game and remember to check updates after eventful days to see if they have implemnted my ideas. if ur the creators reading this, PLZ include my name, not my steam name, plz say im Ptr2680 plz. wow i made this years ago and no one noticed 0_0", "timestamp_created": 1584847144,

For a few days I was pretty much addicted to it. There was a lot to amuse me; the initial chaos of having to scrape the school together with little time and stuff going wrong, the achievement of getting that under control enough to start focusing on my long-term plan for what I wanted the school to look like, the thrill of transforming the landscape bit by bit to fit that long-term plan, and the unfettered joy of watching the school function like a perfectly made swiss watch once my plan was implemented.\n\nI would highly recommend this game. \n\nThat said, however, I would NOT recommend this game at its full list price of $20, because after that addiction period I was essentially done. There's little to no replay value, and there's not a lot of variation in the directions that one can take with their school. There's a LOT of potential if the devs opened it up with a much better modding system and allowed us to tinker with the many many MANY feature implementation requests that exist on the community page, but they pretty much seem to have moved on to their next game and left this largely by the wayside.\n\nMy advice to you is to put this game on your wishlist and nab it immediately when it's on a 50% or greater sale. \n", "timestamp_created": 1581201928, "timestamp_updated": 1581201928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743201732635498047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1581251499, "developer_response": "Hi, thanks for the positive review despite your reservations about our working on the game!

I had some money to spare and I grabbed it. I think both prices are decent considering it is a simulator game with pixel graphics ( which are both completely fine but ultimately are easier to make than full 3D games etc. ) That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of time I've spent playing this game and not getting bored. I've sunk about 12 hours over the past 3 days (I forgot to shut my PC off at night with the game on increasing the hours it says I've played. I think if you have some extra money lying around or it goes on sale its a worth while buy.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nThe game itself is fun and addicting. The principle task as per most simulation/management games is taking whatever the simulator is (school, prison etc) and growing and upgrading attempting to reach max efficiency and productivity. In this case, you're the principle of a school and you're tasked with growing and expanding the school. This is done through building, researching upgrades, hiring teachers, completing grants and so on. In doing so you will be rewarded with cash rewards and a reputation system called \"Prestige\". Your schools prestige determines how it will be ranked among 999 other schools, higher the prestige- better the rank. At the end of the school year which takes place over 9 days, your schools rank will be determined for that year along with your exam results and cash rewards. The goal is to reach rank one while continuously growing and expanding and dealing with the issues that come along with that. I think this is a great simulator game and has a steady base to grow from with continued updates. \n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n- Easy to sink many hours into\n- I've only personally crashed once in my 12 hours of play as a result of placing a racing track (not sure why lol)\n- Not over-complex, the game adds new features gradually allowing you to fully understand the previous before moving onto the next\n- UI is simple and easy to look at and understand\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n- Slow paced, the 9-day school year is may seem short but each day feels very long even at 3x speed which isn't that fast. \n- Due to the long days, money is difficult to come by. Most revenue comes from day to day tuition fees which alone are very underwhelming. \n- There's a lack of content. This is less of an issue as the developer seems to be updating it with new stuff but it's in need of some new core systems to add to the game as it can become very stale. Both the grant system and researching upgrades can be completed fairly quickly which feels like a dead end as the only other goal you have is becoming number 1.\n- The 'Sell to the Grid\" perk is busted. On my main campaign save file, 1/8 of my map is wind turbines essentially giving me infinite money allowing me to bypass any financial difficulty. It takes away from being a school simulator and turns into a power plant simulator.\n\nHow to abuse \"Sell to the Grid' [ I AM SAYING IT SO IT CAN BE FIXED, DOING THIS WILL RUIN THE GAME ]\n[spoiler] After researching up to the \"Sell to the Grid\" perk, every morning when you receive the schools daily income, spend most of it on wind turbines. I prefer to section them off to the side so it does not interfere with building. Each wind turbine gives you $500 to daily revenue. So each day you buy a few which allow you to buy more the next day, so on and so forth. This makes your revenue double every couple of days. I have about 700 turbines giving me 350k a day. [/spoiler]\n\n-At the beginning of each day, a sum of money is taken from your account to pay for expenses? (It's not specified) The amount needed per day is no where to be found meaning if you don't have a large sum of money left over at the end of day, the school may close down due to lack of funds. You can reload the save as the game auto-saves every morning and you'll have zero dollars in your funds and the day will go on as normal.\n\n-The kids are never happy. Each kid has needs: access to food, bathrooms, rest (places to sit), fun (recreational rooms) and safety. No matter how many toilets you install in the school or how big the cafeteria is, there will always be complaints about having to use the bushes as bathrooms or there not being enough food. Out of spite I have placed 500 toilets in my main save with only 450 students and yet still some students have the nerve to use the bush. Janitors seem to be very slow or do not do their job at all. With only 450 kids I have 108 janitors but the school is apparently \"filthy\" to the students. This though was referenced in the discussion post on future plans for the game. \n\nTLDR: The game is really fun but needs some fixing and improvements\n7/10 (in its current state)", "timestamp_created": 1577751638, "timestamp_updated": 1577751664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60860840": {"recommendationid": "60860840", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967383595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1577746099}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Prison Architect, but a school.\n\nIf that interests you then enjoy, otherwise it's a bit underwhelming.

To me, the game lacks anything that would be \"fun\" or could make some real thinking.  There are no sports in this school game, no football team, which is pretty much the backbone of high schools today.  There are no competitions of any sorts, no chess team, no glee club, no debate team, no track team, nothing.  You just have students that come, teachers that teach, and then random stuff might happen, like a student leaves because he can\u2019t find a toilet or there isn\u2019t enough food.  Teachers don\u2019t get better or worse, your schools don\u2019t compete at all.  After you have your school running, there really isn\u2019t anything to do.  There isn\u2019t even a graduation in the game, no ceremony, just at the end of the year, you get a grade card, you can see how each student did, and that\u2019s it.

Academia: School Simulator gets you in at the conception phase as you lead your institution from establishing its name and emblem to achieving Ivy League greatness. Every step along the way involves you and the decisions that you make including not only the construction and design of its structures but also in who is employed there and the environment and overall routine of those who populate your center of learning.\n\n[b] The Founding Of Your Very Own School [/b]\nWhen you first start your game you are brought to the school customization screen. Here you decide on your school\u2019s name, motto, emblem, and student uniform as well as the difficulty settings for your game. There are a number of options to mess around with to your liking and you are certainly not lacking in freedom of choice, though I would have liked even more options; the addition of teacher uniforms and biomes, for example, could do wonders for further differentiating one school from the next. However, even in its current state, the customization on this screen is more advanced and in-depth than one might assume and it was an enjoyable and intuitive experience that created a first impression that made me quite optimistic about the game that I was about to buckle down and play for several hours.\n\n[b] The Ribbon Cutting Ceremony [/b]\nNo, you\u2019re not actually getting a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Once your school is founded you will find yourself looking at a large, empty plot of land graced only with a road and a significant number of trees and bushes. This is where you will spend the vast majority of the game, the exception only being at the end of each year with a brief summary of your institution\u2019s performance. Your first step will be the construction of a principal\u2019s office and starting with this the keys to the castle are in your hands and within moments, you\u2019ll be introduced to three of the most integral aspects of Academia: School Simulator: grants, admissions, and staffing.\n\nGrants are tasks that you can complete for additional funding that payout both in advance and upon completion. This type of funding is very important to the future success of your school and the tasks may include anything from hiring a few janitors and placing a few trash cans to researching and constructing a library.\n\nAdmissions are key to the success of your institution as they are the primary source of your income. Each year, including the first, you are informed of the number of students that have applied to attend your school and you may choose to accept as many of them as you have the capacity for. Every student comes with an upfront tuition cost that is immediately added to your treasury upon the start of the school year as well as having the effect of increasing the subsidy that you receive daily as long as they continue to remain in attendance.\n\nYour staff is just as important as your student body as your school will simply not function without them. Most of the staff in the game are generic currently, for example, one cook is exactly the same as the next cook regarding their wages and efficiency although they may have varying names and appearances. Your teachers are the one exception to this rule and they are a major one; every teacher has a set of six skills, one for each subject that is taught at your school, and this determined how capable they are of ensuring that your students achieve the highest grades that they can. The better your students perform, the more your school is rewarded, the more its prestige grows, and the larger the number of candidates who seek to join your ranks the following year will grow. Teachers are separated into three categories as well: Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s, and Doctorate degrees that offer significantly different levels of efficiency in their teaching as you might imagine.\n\n[b] But How Are The Graphics? [/b]\nThe graphics and audio are not by any means going to push any system to its limits unless you are breaking out your Commodore 64 for the experience. I enjoy the simple art style and it never caused me to feel as if my immersion had been broken, as a matter of fact, the simplicity played in its favor by always keeping me on track and avoiding any distractions that came up. The music and sound effects were above average as well and worked well for the game, there weren\u2019t many but they set the mood as calm and relaxed, similar to something that you might hear in a game like Stardew Valley. In short, both the graphics and the audio work well for the game but they most likely won\u2019t be blowing anyone\u2019s mind.\n\n[b] What Is Solid? [/b]\nI played through nearly all of the content in this game twice on the default settings before writing this review and there are a number of features that are enjoyable. The first time, I made a \u2018classic\u2019 school that was a single building and designed to be a standard prep school and chose to use the British school uniforms (Gianni Bato Prep); the second time, I decided to make a military academy campus that was split into several buildings and the students were required to wear military dress (Marshmallow Military Academy). I was happy to see that both were efficient and that neither seemed to be a worse option than the other. I also enjoyed the variety of room types that you can unlock for your school, everything ranging from libraries to AV rooms to a variety of sports-focused rooms and so on; I never felt that my options were limited in this regard. The reports that are available to you were some of the most streamlined and efficient ones that I have seen in a game of this type, I always knew exactly what needed to be improved to keep my students fulfilled and out of trouble.\n\nDuring the time that I played I encountered only one real issue with the game and it was one that was text-based. One of the grants on the list had a requirement that was not accurate for the technology required to unlock the building that was the only other requirement to receive the completion funds. I notified the developers via Steam and received a response within only a few hours of sending it that included a genuine \u2018thank you\u2019 and it added another layer of optimism for me that this game is destined to be great in the future.\n\n[b] What Can Be Improved? [/b]\nAs contradictory as it sounds after reading my earlier praise, I believe that additional rooms would certainly add to the longevity of the game. Although my first school took several hours to get to the point of unlocking all of the content for building, on my second run I had it all constructed on my campus within an hour and a half.\n\nI would also suggest additional challenges that arise during the course of your institution\u2019s career. My first year with Gianni Bato Prep was fairly challenging but by the time the windfall of funds from admissions arrived at the beginning of the second year, I never had any financial difficulty again. I still very much enjoyed the casual nature of building and managing a growing school but there was nothing left that offered a challenge. My experience with Marshmallow Military Academy was simply casual from start to finish after having learned the nature of the game previously.\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\nMy overall recommendation on this game currently is to pick it up if you\u2019re a fan of management and construction games like Prison Architect, these games are very similar in their feel even if their themes are quite different. The game that is currently available to be played is certainly playable, I didn\u2019t feel that I was grinding through the hours to experience enough to write this review, I genuinely enjoyed every second in the game. It could certainly use more content, though, and within less than a dozen hours, I had experienced nearly everything that the game had to offer.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1568688576, "timestamp_updated": 1568688649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59834057092666626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55055048": {"recommendationid": "55055048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388785594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 33433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5215, "last_played": 1639563120}, "language": "english", "review": "i would recommend academia school simulator in the beta form but i do want to see a few things added before the game completely launches\n\n1. personalized schedule\n\n2.more floors\n\n3. options of starting in an elementary, middle, and high school,", "timestamp_created": 1568154661, "timestamp_updated": 1568154661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540159404277801514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55046493": {"recommendationid": "55046493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184453051", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 390, "last_played": 1651575958}, "language": "english", "review": "Iv played this game for 6 hours, thought i could get into it but just cant, its not the same as playing prison architect.\nCan I still Get a refund??", "timestamp_created": 1568113404, "timestamp_updated": 1568113404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417246162891387939", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55021642": {"recommendationid": "55021642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796648610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1639426618}, "language": "english", "review": "its a fun game for like a hour then it gets really boring", "timestamp_created": 1567960774, "timestamp_updated": 1567960774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491661310195922852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54988868": {"recommendationid": "54988868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065639723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1567806895}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed the game.

Depending on your budget, that amount of fun may justify the price all by itself. The game is very similar to prison architect, but because it is still in development it is without the wealth of features that those games have.\n\nPros:\n\n- The game looks well polished, with intuitive interfaces, good graphics (for the genre of management game it is) and nice ambient sounds + music.\n\n-The gameplay is just as fun as Prison Architect and the game sets you progression goals to keep you engaged.\n\n-There is a nice element of world-building as you seek to outperform other schools, but this is more of a side feature than a fully fleshed out concept.\n\n-You can enjoy this game casually or invest a lot of time into routing your employees and making your school incredibly efficient.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game is missing some key features that will make your experience more frustrating and uninteractive. The major issue is that you cannot route or assign your cooks, and given that you will most likely build multiple cafeterias for your staff and students, your cooks will try to evenly distribute regardless of the size of each cafeteria, leaving you either understaffed or forced to employ a surplus of cooks in order to make sure food gets made for your students.\n\n-Late game scaling will scare off casual players, because as you expand into your map you will begin to require great degrees of area micromanagement. Your students get 1 hour lunch breaks to eat and relax, but if you don't place recreational facilities and cafeterias at multiple locations, they very often can't make it to one of these rooms in time. Some might say that this isn't an issue, but rather a feature of the genre, but it often means that you will spend a large portion of the beginning of the game mapping out the structure of your whole school many years in advance, preventing you from actually jumping in and just playing the game.\n\nIn summary, a good game, worth investing in, but you will probably get bored of it after a while until new features are implemented and game fixes are made. Given the fact that this game is moddable and still in early development, it's safe to say that these things will eventually be fixed and/or improved. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1567182200, "timestamp_updated": 1567182200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580146908760070801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54873145": {"recommendationid": "54873145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191121459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1586542231}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great and fun game!

I had so much fun with hunting down the achievements. It has a lot of grindy one and after a while that was boring, but I still enjoy this game so much.  Before you start a game you have the option to choose how your students behave, are they angels or devils, or maybe something in between. Are they tidy, or messy, stuff like that. This will help you with hunting down specific achievements. You choose also which outfit they will wear, and on the steam workshop there are a lot more options, even harry potter uniforms! \n\nAfter you choose all the basic stuff and gave your school a name and slogan you'll start your new school with a big piece of land on which you'll start building your school. Once you have built the basics you can accept students and start the school year. During the school year, you can keep on building, but you can't accept new students during the school year, only at the start of a new one.  This game has a lot of different kind of rooms you can resource and add to your school. The game will give you \"to-do quests\" which help you get through the game easily. \n\nAs stated above this game has achievements that are grindy, very very grindy. You can save at any moment during the game and you can reload a save file while keeping the stats you already had. This will make some achievements so much easier.  Like the achievements for students with bad behavior. There are \"quests\" that will give you 10 student of each of the 3 bad behavior types.

After the original review (from 5 hours of play) I am now at 20 hours. I have got to say that the game has drastically improved and I would recommend anyone who played the game in the past to give it another go. It is in immediately fun game (I played on Hard) as the mix of challenge and objectives are great. I found myself having to start 3 separate schools in-order for me to get to (effectively) the end of the game where I had completed most grants and my cash-flow was positive. The game has become FUN to an extent which is great! \n\nMy only few problems (And I know it is an Early Access, these are mainly Ideas) is that some feature do not seem to work properly. The food situation is very difficult to handle and hard to manage. Some UI feature to work out production vs demand would be great (Similar to the prison architect style). I also don't understand why the Bus would be used, you are charged money and seemingly get nothing in return. If there is a reason for this a better explanation would be needed (IMO).\n\nIn conclusion the game has vastly improved and I would now recommend it to someone who likes games such as Prison Architect and Rimworld.\n\n\nOrigional Review\n\nI bought this game almost from launch and even though many things have changed, I still just don't find it fun to play. Unlike Prison Architect in which I have played for hundreds of hours, this game has nothing that brings me back to it, or even makes me want to play it. It seems to just involve grinding and even though i have had multiple playthroughs throughout development I always end up forcing myself to play it.

It's challenging to call it a good game, but it certainly isn't a bad one. I originally purchased this game after seeing it on youtube and being interesting in a school sandbox game, in which I could do a variety of things from build the best school, to making a living hellscape. Academia: School Simulator, did not meet those expectations.\n\nStory\nI don't truly demand story in every game I play, but I feel like this could use a little... anything? I dunno even just a: Gramps left me his inheritance and I was told to spend it on his dying wish: building a school. Whatever, moving on.\n0.0/2.0\n\nGameplay\nI can't really bang to much on the game, other than being repetitive. There are plenty of somewhat interesting options, like research pathways, school blueprints, and transfer students. Solid gameplay with reasonable controls and strategy. Acceptable.\n1.3/2.0\n\nArt\nGraphics\nGraphics are good. Original enough character design and good looking sprites. Most objects are solids colors, but have enough detail to make it feel realistic. Not a masterpiece, but pleasant to look at.\nSound\nMusic was not memorable, but I remember it was there. There were probably sound effects too. That I don't remember say a lot about how good the sound was. Mediocre.\n1.2/2.0\n\nEnjoyment\nAlright, here's where I have an issue:\nInitially, the game is fun enough to try to build the greatest school and become the top school in the world. After taking a few in-game years to build your school, you just need to slowly accommodate more students and get better teachers to climb the ranks. Now sit and wait while the game slowly runs through a dozen or so years to become the top school. While it doesn't really stay interesting the whole time, the concept seems fine enough, yes? Here's where it gets ya: there really is no replay value. Sure, you can build a new school, in a different orientation, but it you want to make progress you have to use all the same rooms and fit all the same parameters. It's like if every time you have a sandwich, you have the choice the assemble it a different way, but you only have 4 different ingredients: ham, cheese, mustard, and bread. There are only so many ways to put it together, and even when it's a different order of ingredients it still tastes the same. Very much like this game. Another thing I wanted to do with the game was experiment with my limits (e.g. taking away food, locking students in, etc.). Very much to my dissapointment, in game students whose need aren't met just up and leave and don't come back. How fun. Locking students in means that only half will appear the next day and the rest will reappear outside the building. And finally, probably just a problem on my end, trying to make class sizes huge. Adding hundreds of desks to a single classroom. Doesn't work. Crashed my game. More than once. Honestly all in all unhappy with this game's failure to have replay value. I tend to spend my money on games I know I will seriously enjoy, games I know I will come back to and play again. I was expecting that with this game. Did not deliver.\n0.3/2.0\n\nBonus points\n+0.3 Wide selection of random selected names and character designs.\n+0.2 Relatively accurate depiction or school management\nYup. this sure is an okay game.\n0.5/2.0\n\nConclusion\nI understand this game is still not complete, so some of the issues that I had may still be fixed. They may have been fixed before I even post this. Regardless, I can't recommend this game right now unless that person is really into.. school management.\nFinal score:\n3.3/10.0", "timestamp_created": 1565145754, "timestamp_updated": 1565145754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661549627780914307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1565231754, "developer_response": "Hi!

I've been kept busy for the last week trying to make the perfect school, and this is actually challenging enough that I haven't done it yet.

I estimate that while this is in early access, this will keep the average person busy for 10-20 hours, many more once the devs add what they are planning to. The management part isn't perfect by far, but it allows for some pretty heavy micromanaging. The main issues I have with this game is that it seems impossible to feed all your kids, and that I have to hire way too many janitors to make my school clean. Currently working with about a 300 student school and I have close to 30 janitors. However, this may just be me not being efficient enough with the routing mechanic?

It is similar, in a way, to Prison Architect (both in look and design) but the whole point in it is to build a excelling school, teach students so well that they have impeccable grades and ensure that students aren't all going outside to defecate in bushes because you forgot to build a toilet ... oops.\nI thoroughly enjoy the game and would recommend it to anyone who likes management sims. It is filled with little touches which add more flair to the game. This includes things like the students giving love letters to each other or students thinking about cheeseburgers rather than focusing on what the teacher is telling them. \n\nIf I was to give one criticism it would be that once I have researched everything on the game, and have completed all of the quests, I don't have much left to do. When playing most management sims usually they don't come to an end, or usually it is very difficult to reach the end. For example in Cities Skylines you almost never reach an end and almost constantly have something to do after weeks of gameplay. I know I can continue to expand and improve the school, and earn more money, but this seems tedious and less of a challenge once everything else is complete. It might be worth adding more quests and more things to research as this will keep the game interesting for a longer period of time.\n\nOverall though I really enjoy the game and have been loving the improvements and content updates that the devs have been adding to it.\n\n\n\n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1562801438, "timestamp_updated": 1562801438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548455238342285156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53981034": {"recommendationid": "53981034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014085497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1562648222}, "language": "english", "review": "I have high hopes for this game, but at the minute there just isn't enough there to hold my interest.

No matter what you build cafeteria wise, they will always complain about a lack of food and some will even drop out because of it. I posted about the issue on the steam forums and the developer said they are working on it, so that's encouraging but it is quite frustrating at the moment\n\n--Students/staff don't have much personality.

My favourite mechanic is the energy selling, I just thought it was so unique compared to anything else I had seen. -Some of the new starter settings I thought gave the game especially sandbox mode more customisation(the flag customisation is a nice touch). \n-1 thing I noticed whilst hiring teachers was the \"mellow,\" \"strict,\" \"boring,\" etc, modifiers, this is great, again something that gives the game a personal touch as anyone who goes to school knows which teachers they like and dislike and it's something so minor that you wouldn't even except but greatly improves the game. This also means that you can't just hire the teacher with the best qualifications, love it. \n-After checking the reaserch tree and finding the lawyer option to fire employees instantly, which is sort of funny, not really bad nor good but if it will extend the longevity of the game that is nice as that is one of the issues I had with PA as well, even if it's not the most useful the in the world if it's more things to add to your school it will help keep engagement as I always find selling my prison in PA is just not that satisfying after you've worked so hard to get to that point and it's like what now(ignore mods for my sanity plz). \n-Actually as for research, it's all an improvement, I would like to see the school programs expanded upon though as I find that is an interesting aspect of the game which could be nice to expand(referring to the recycling program) a final comment on it though, I'm mostly indifferent to the expand school population though there should be an option when the game is loaded in sandbox mode to set max population(within reason and if there is a reason why they can't do this then it's fine just a suggestion anyways) to allow for just messing around with the game or really big schools.\n\nOverall my previous rating I would say was more like a 3/10\nI would now put this at a 7/10.\nThis game still has steps to take before reaching the level of prison architect but I can confidently say that it's on it's path there.\nProps to the dev team for improving this game and once again my apologies for my earlier review.", "timestamp_created": 1559686140, "timestamp_updated": 1611886077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51049489": {"recommendationid": "51049489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403807754", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1620973386}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]An engrossing (if currently limited) school builder in the style of Prison Architect [/h1]\n\nI love management games, so Academia really hit the spot! I've played Prison Architect, and it's cool to see how Academia managed to adapt those same mechanics for building a school.\n\nThe core mechanic is essentially constructing the different parts of a school, but you have to manage your students' needs, such as food or toilets. If you can't provide enough toilets, watch as your students end up peeing in the bushes, or even worse, leave your school altogether! Say goodbye to that tuition money.\n\nOne of the trickier things at the moment is definitely balancing money. The game's a little tougher from Prison Architect in the sense that you only get students at the beginning of the school year, instead of a new influx of people on the next day. And the little things that I need to keep [strike]precious tuition money[/strike] students from leaving slowly add up, and it's been a fun and careful balancing act managing all the costs. [i]Especially[/i] the toilets.\n\nAfter playing 12 hours in, though, I'm definitely seeing the limits in the game. There aren't a lot of things to aim for anymore, besides getting #1 on the rankings or rebuilding the school all over, which I don't really have any incentive to do.\n\nAll in all, though, what they do have is great. It's fun to figure out in the first few hours, and here's hoping for more late-game developments. \n\nHere are some things I'd love to see:\n\n- I know I have a rival, but why do I need to care about the rival? Why should I care about hitting the #1 rank? Would be cool to have some backstory or reasoning for the rival, just to make me work harder. Bonus would be if I could even check out my rival school, to really see what I'm up against. \n\n- I had the idea of building separate junior high and senior high buildings, until I realized that I have no idea if my faculty are going to be a mess going from one faculty room to the other. So, would be great if I could assign my faculty to specific faculty rooms once I build more of them.\n\n- Clubs would be nice? Or random student-led initiatives. Having just graduated from college, I distinctly remember that a lot of things were driven by students instead of the admin, and it would make sense in the game for the students to have some more agency in shaping their school.   \n\n- My 7 year-old cousin would like to request a school bus.

There's something in particular about the animation style and the structure that suggests they drew a lot of inspiration from Prison Architect here. And, for those of you who aren't familiar with PA, well that commonality in design approach might as well be a written guarantee you're in for a good time here. There's hardly a better influence for the sort of simulator game Academia aims to be, and it's clear they paid attention to the lessons laid out before them by prior works in forging their own take on the genre.   \n\nA lot of the design elements it took PA years in early access to sort out--like zoning and pathfinding for staff--Academia included right out the gate in the early access period. Now it's moving along its own journey of discovery towards their ultimate game vision.  Some of the more technical aspects you would find in PA and other sims aren't implemented here though. However, I'm not sure if those mechanics are \"not yet added\" or if it\u2019s an intentional design choice in omitting things like electrical wiring and water pipes from the gameplay. Personally, I'm happy enough with it being omitted to focus on the core student experience since that level of micro-installation was always more a burden to me. Plus, there\u2019s not really much strategy to be found in pipe placement here unless Little Timmy is going to be burrowing his way-out Shawshank style.... though if they do go the utility route, that\u2019s something I'd definitely love to see, hah.  \n\n\nI\u2019ve also attached a video here covering the gradual end of my first play attempt, in which I go from a reasonable tight-position to totally F'd by the end. What's great is that despite failure, it's not s something found frustrating. Going into that final death-kneel I already knew what I screwed up earlier, and thus could actually learn from my mistakes for next time.  For games like simulators where it takes a long while to really get into those juicy parts that learning experience is especially a boon since you can otherwise burn out easily trying to jump into the next game without really knowing what to change for better results.  Something wonderful atop of all that, even when I hit that failure point, I kept playing anyway since it was actually really fun trying to dig my way out of that hole by gutting staff and carefully selected grant money goals. If even I collapsed in it. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkTBrniBLD4\n\nThere's a whole lot I know to do going in to another gameplay, but it\u2019s safe to say my main fuck up was\u2026. Just not paying attention with a clicking selection like a major dumbass. I ended up hiring like 5 janitors in a row, that cost me thousands for upfront pay even while fired directly after, so I totally gimped myself early on.  The second part that killed me---and something that I'm not quite so sure as sure was my part---was that I was still being charged daily payments for a teacher I already fired on top of the cost of their cheaper replacement, so instead of being the cold-hearted move that saved my ass, it just buried me further with no way of getting out of that hole. I actually plan to hit the devs up about that though part since I'm thinking that was a bug  The latter part of my video ends up being pretty shitty since I was waiting out the clock thinking that at the end of the day their salary would stop being paid,  and then the next day before realizing it wasn't happening and I cost myself an extra $400 a day plus the 4g upfront for that new teacher instead of saving $500 by ditching a teacher costing me $900 daily. \n\nOh!  And the bonus modes! I know this is MAJORLY important to select portions of the audience for these games who don't care about challenge, and just want to build their perfect vision. Yes, there absolutely is a free-range mode that just lets you do as you please. And if that weren't enough, there's already workshop support for mods to bend the game over backwards along with the usual texture replacement files and personal details at your leisure.  For those of you who do want general pressure curve but perhaps a lighter one, the starting map generation also gives the usual options for wiggle room with regard to base income and other settings too. \n\n\n [URL= https://store.steampowered.com/app/672630/Academia__School_Simulator/?curator_clanid=32660416?] \nCheck Academia : School Simulator  on Steam now!\n[/URL]\n\nIf you want more recommendations for weird and wonderful games then stop by our Steam curation group sometime, and follow WWGW: \n [URL= https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32660416-Weird-Wonderful-Game-Watch/] Weird Wonderful Game Watch [/URL]", "timestamp_created": 1557758355, "timestamp_updated": 1557758814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697680056095123291", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50588310": {"recommendationid": "50588310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160960904", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6466, "last_played": 1615087560}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't been able to put this game down since I downloaded it!

So I was pretty excited about this game.\n\nI'm giving it a hesitant thumbs up on the premise that it will deliver on its promises as it progresses through EA.  It's very bare bones at the moment but I'm hopeful that it will live up to its potential as its exactly the kind of game that I would love if it were much, much bigger.\n\nAs a teacher, I do have some feedback on the academic side of things for the developers:\n\n-  Unique teacher profiles are great but perhaps star ratings should be given per experience rather than degree level.  Great teachers don't need a PhD, especially not for PE!  Also, why are they maxed out on only one subject area?  Some teachers are very well-rounded and schools often use them as substitutes for other subjects, or they compete with each other to teach in or lead different departments.  There are loads of interesting dynamics to explore here to add a different dimension to the game.\n\n-  Can't the school and students have some choice over what subjects they provide/study?  More player-control over the schedule would be great.\n\n-  Ugh, those chairs with attached tables.  I have never seen those in a real school, just old photos of instutionalised pupils with dead eyes from the horrors of rote learning and the cane.  And what's with the 19th century green chalkboards?  Can we have some modern day school furniture please?  I am unable to design a school that I would ever want to work in.  Aren't we living in the times of project-based learning and blended education?  Let's get some round movable furniture with wifi connectivity, gadgets for team tasks and graphics of students giving digital presentations.\n\n-  Could we have a choice of principle at the start which will affect gameplay, like the storyteller in RimWorld or the prison manager in PA?  Also more variety of conditions at start up and some scenario options to improve replayability and offer increasing difficulty.\n\n- At present I can't see how to keep my school progressing up the school rankings, but I am guessing this is because prestige and quality standards are still in development?  I have designed a clean, safe, profitable school with small class sizes quite easily but my ranking is still between 400-500.  I can't see what's going on here and the reports aren't particularly helpful or informative.\n\n-  On this note, there should be bi-annual school inspections which threaten the school's access to grants or even threaten them with closure but offer higher prestige and affect how easily the school attracts new students.\n\n- Getting new students is as easy as ordering them from a transfer button for next day delivery like some kind of child-trafficking branch of Amazon.  Instead parents should visit on open days at the beginning of the year (after build phase) and decide whether or not to enroll their child.  This would force you to manage your budget much better or accept less desirable students to be transferred if you get desperate.\n\n-  As your prestige improves, the type of student you attract should better, but pressure to keep parents and inspectors happy should increase.\n\n\nOverall, great start but you're still a way off your final draft.  C-\n\nEDIT:  Since I wrote this review the developers have made some huge improvements.  I'm upping my grade to a B+.

I would argue for a C+ over a C minus, but of course I would do that! To reply to some of your thoughts.\n\nMore player-control over the schedule :\n\nTo be honest this is probably not going happen any time soon. The reason being that the more control the player has over the schedule, the more havoc it will wreak on the AI. We'll continue to try to think of ways that the player can tweak the schedule, but I'm afraid for now this current setup will stay for a while.\n\nWill more subjects become available with more individualised classrooms:\n\nThis is part of the plan, yes.\n\nscience/art lessons actually in the lab/art room :\n\nThis should have started happening with the latest update.\n\nUgh, those chairs with attached tables. I have never seen those in a real school, just old photos of instutionalised pupils with dead eyes from the horrors of rote learning and the cane. And what's with the 19th century green chalkboards:\n\nHaha! I think our experience with school was a little different! I still remember those chalkboards in high school, and in the Philippines at least those seats are pretty standard. We opted for a more 90s style setup/decor because that's what we're more familiar with. I don't know that we'd be changing the facilities, something we're exploring is the ability to upgrade objects in the future.\n\n\nCould we have a choice of principle at the start which will affect gameplay, like the storyteller in RimWorld or the prison manager in PA? Also more variety of conditions at start up and some scenario options to improve replayability and offer increasing difficulty:\n\nYes this will definitely happen. We'll be adding some more difficulty settings to the custom school screen hopefully in the next update (no promises, fingers crossed, etc. etc.). A choice of principal will added in the more distant future.\n\nAt present I can't see how to keep my school progressing up the school rankings:\n\nThis could be a matter of game balancing. We'll definitely be discussing this.\n\nschool inspections:\n\nDefinitely in the works. We're just figuring out the best way to integrate this into the game properly.\n\nAs your prestige improves, the type of student you attract should better, but pressure to keep parents and inspectors happy should increase:\n\nThis is one of our major mechanics that we hope we can add by the end of the year or early next year.\n\nUnique teacher profiles:\n\nWe made the choice to use the degrees as an abstracted way of showing ranking, fully realizing that this isn't true to to life. I suppose we could have gone with a star rating, but as it is it's too deeply integrated into the game now for us to easily switch. We definitely want more variation within teachers, and once again that's something we're planning for in the future.\n\nThanks again for the great feedback, we hope you can give us another grade at the end of the year!"}, "44691640": {"recommendationid": "44691640", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993262426", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1536717614}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has potential, but like others have said it plays like a builder just like Prison Architect.

I think this shows great potential and I really enjoyed experimenting with what's there so far. While it's relatively easy to complete everything the game has to offer at the moment, it's still worth playing around with. I have a few suggestions for the developers of things that might be neat to add in the future. I'm not certain what it is they're working on and what they see for the full release of the game, but these could be things to explore:\n\n- clubs\n- social cliques (goths, jocks, nerds, thespians, etc)\n- school competitions, assemblies, plays, etc ... even just an auditorium\n- weather and/or seasons\n- different classrooms for special area subjects such as P.E., art, and music\n- other classes, like woodshop, home ec, computers, chorus, etc\n- a wider selection of floors and decor\n- customization for furniture (color, material, etc)\n- some system for comfort - kind of like in The Sims where you need a certain amount of decor and windows. While the options for decor and windows are there in-game, it doesn't seem like a necessity aside from getting a small grant and some prestige\n- a campaign mode would be really cool - you're given a school that has some sort of problem either with truancy or academics or something and you need to solve it\n- more athletic options - swimming pool, wrestling room, weight room, track, basketball court, soccer field, football field, etc\n- staff and faculty seem really go-with-the-flow ... what if there were internal conflicts or someone suddenly decides to quit? Or maybe staff or faculty demands better working conditions or smaller class sizes or they'll go on strike or quit?\n- if your school starts becoming rowdy, it might be interesting to have students form gangs that you need to deal with\n- branching off rowdier schools, vandalism is something else to explore\n- enacting certain school codes, like dress codes, or even just situations like running in the hall, no smoking, food fights might be hilarious and fun to break up, students fighting in general, students arriving to school late\n- I would absolutely love to play the game as a primary school, too ... I teach kindergarten and I wish there was a simulator that went K-3 or even 3-6.

Nothing is ready. Oh my god. \n- I get new workers. Two of them just to try. They build  a wall, go to vending machine and nom on a chair. I guess kids will sit on a grass. \n- The wooden wall cost 0$. That would actually be great but it doesnt matter because my workers are not that interested anyway. \n- Aha, and i worked on school logo to make it look like Hogwards.

However, I personally do not find that it has enough personality to give it a thumbs up at this time.  Most of the points I raised below still stands though with some improvements on teacher hiring, student behaviors (including added speech bubbles), and prestige effect for admission.  It's definitely sad to me that I can build a school that is much more profitable as a utilities company selling water, electricity, and trash due to absolutely no true alternative revenue streams (or even a way to even tweak my tuition) that in any way relates to academia.  As I said before, I truly like the concept but it has a ways to go before I can recommend it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Review\n\nI have been waiting for a school simulator for a while.  After playing for a few hours, I can honestly say that this game (in the early access stage) isn't it.  I truly wish that there is a button for \"Wait\" instead of just Yes/No.  Alas, I digress.  I\u2019ll update the review once they\u2019ve had more time to release more content.\nFirst, I must point out that, as far as early access games go, this one has a lot of potential, and is more polished than most at this stage. It isn't loaded with high end graphics, so not much can go wrong there.  It also has games like Prison Architect and Rimworld that came before to set the standards for what we would expect in a management game of this style.  I will also say, with full disclaimer, that I have played both of those titles thoroughly and enjoy them massively, but it just doesn't quite scratch the itch of a non-murderous-prisoners/aliens/slaves/nomads/pirates/you-name-it simulation.  I was looking forward to some frivolous high-school drama, and an easy-going simulation to pleasantly pass an hour or two where I can build my nice academic empire, and maybe pull a senior prank or two.  It isn't quite there yet.\nWhat it does have going for it:\n1. Standard learning curve\n2. Customization of school seal and motto\n3. School-themed\n4. A really responsive dev team\n\nWhat it lacks:\n1. There is an awesome feature where you can tweak your class schedule, but only by moving a recess and a lunch slot.  You are forced to have 6 class periods, 1-hour recess, and 1-hour lunch.  Also, the schedule is locked for each grade year (e.g.  if you want to set the lunch break to 12, you must do it for ALL seniors, instead of for specific class).  The classes are also set: no electives.  Or rather, students do electives during their recess periods, which involves library, art, computer lab, or just hanging out.  \n2. The game-play is structured more like an elementary school than a high school, where teachers come to you, not the other way around.  What this translate to, then, is you have one classroom for each grade year, then you just have 6 teachers go around to teach those 6 classes.  There is no penalty to the class sizes, BUT, there is a penalty to the number of teachers.\n3. Teachers... You can hire teachers by their education level.  Bachelor's level teachers are dumb as a brick, and PhD teachers are brilliant.  PhD teachers cost a fortune to maintain but are highly efficient.  Now, I am not a teacher, but I can tell you that this is already flawed.  There were college courses that I took in my younger years that I wished were taught by some of my high school teachers who had bachelor's degrees.  This is not a college simulator, having only PhD teachers be the only worthwhile option just doesn't make any sense (can someone point out why you would ever keep non-PhD teachers in this game?).  \n4. Lack of class variety.  Since the teachers come to the student, not the other way around, all classes are plain.  It discourages you from spending the time to design a nice science lab.  Gym? No gym.  Just another boring classroom with a P.E. teacher at the chalkboard.  Really?  I\u2019m sorry theater fan, I\u2019m not even going to mention you.\n5. Money?  Income is solely through subsidies.  This doesn\u2019t make sense to me.  Schools don\u2019t pay vendors to bring in vending machines; vendors pay schools to bring them in.  I\u2019m also pretty sure I had to pay for school lunches (Yes, I understand there are subsidies for low income households, allowances for unpaid lunch accounts, etc.), but this game, no charging lunch.  Instead, you must hire cooks and pay for the ingredients to feed your entire student body AND staff.  Really?\n6. Transfer students.  You adjust a little slider, and you get the specified number of students (in the specified grade level) in a day or two.  This is just plain lazy, in my opinion, especially when the game already tracks prestige.\n7. All those <sarcasm>great</sarcasm> school events that anyone might remember from their childhood?  Non-existent.  No science fairs with the volcanoes.  No awkward proms/formals.  No random school pride days and pep rallies.  Graduation?  No such thing.  Field trips? Forget it!  What do you have? Exam day, that happens overnight after Day 9 each year.  At least there is still that planned varsity sports thing we can look forward to?\n\nHere are some things I think are missing:\n1. Private vs Public school mechanics.  \n\u2022\tIn the public-school scenario, you get a yearly budget to educate an X number of student.  The budget may increase/decrease each year by scripted external events (e.g. city provided XYZ company with massive subsidy caused school budget shortfall), but the number of student just keeps growing.\n\u2022\tIn the Private school scenario, students pay tuition.  You get student based on your prestige.  Good teacher-student ratio adds prestige.  State of the art facility adds prestige.   High matriculation and college enrollment adds prestige.  More prestige = more student and ability to charge higher tuition.  Lower prestige = less tuition (if you want anyone to come to your school).  \n2. True economy.\n\u2022\tAdd bistro area, in addition to plain cafeterias with outside vendors\n\u2022\tAdd student jobs, especially since some vocational program paid students (e.g. the cooking class pays the student servers for the student run dining option, the school bank pays their workers, the auto-shop pays their students for side jobs, etc)\n\u2022\tAdd ability to earn side revenue from food/events/ticket sales that can then be used to reinvest in bigger and better facility, events, vendors, food options, etc\n3. Student housing for boarding school/hybrid.  There is so much possibilities down this venue, I\u2019m not even going to list.\n4. As previously mentioned, add some of the school events that are prime-drama producer.  Make it an event, add some modifiers to those boring students like science fair winner, varsity cheer leader, class president, D&D club, etc.  Make me care about those little figures running about.  I\u2019d like to see a graduation ceremony where a little kid that frequented the principal office Freshman year gets recognized as most improved. \n5. What about drama?  There are the bullies, the truants, and the rowdy.  But, I don\u2019t see food fights, or students being chased outside the school, or kids running around the hallway screaming.

There is no camparison between schools except for an abstract ranking at the end of each semester.

No personality or individuality of students, no clear driver, no challenge. The classes go through 4 years and all that happens is you get a cumulative score for each 'class' at the end of 12 identical days, play wise, and  then each year every class moves up one grade level. Just another indication each class is being hard-coded with hive-logic, since they don't have divergent goals. It would be cool if there were tons of activities and classes and each student could pick a class based on his or her own schedule, get a bf or gf, be part of a clique, and so on. Basically, there aren't a variety of things to do a student picks one of many.

Your workers are a little dim so really you can only build one thing at a time which makes for a fun challenge. However there are features of the game that I feel should and could add challenge and complexity that just don\u2019t at the moment. \n\nFor example, getting a positive cashflow is really just a matter of making as large a classroom as possible and fitting as many chairs in it as you can. Whilst there is a student hunger, bladder and motivational score it\u2019s not really clear what drives these or more importantly how they effect the amount of money you have/ ability to build the next thing. For example , I made the worlds best cafeteria, easily accessible etc but a bunch of the students were still starving and yet I still had plenty of money and students were still coming to school. Without any effect of poor health etc you just don\u2019t really care and 50% of what should be the games core mechanic becomes obsolete.\n\nIt takes about 4-5 hours to complete all of the objectives the game offers and there\u2019s no real incentive to do it outside sandbox mode. Once you achieve all the objectives the fun kind of runs out the gate.\n\nOutside the objectives to build new things there are no objectives that actually involve you managing anything efficiently (like student health etc) and there are no missions or campaign mode like \u2018fix this broken school\u2019. I feel like the game has a great centre to it but there a bunch of tools that are really cool but are never utilized.\n\nI know this review sounded mostly negative but there is still a solid 7-8 hours of fun to be had so I would still recommend it.

You start from the ground up, selecting grants with certain qualifications to earn money for the building of classrooms and other school-oriented buildings, hiring staff, placing furniture, and selecting decorations. One could chose to spend all of their grant money making a beautiful school that parents dream of sending their kids to, or a player could spend as little as possible cramming tons of desk into tiny classrooms with the intent of hoarding money. \n\nI am fond of the progression of the grants; done in order these teach you the fundamentals of the game without feeling like a lengthy tutorial. Once completed, though, the only goal of the game seems to be to grow the school\u2019s population bigger and bigger, making it easy for interest in the game to fade. Being in Early Access, though, I have high hopes that the amount to do in the game will grow, so this is hardly a fault. \n\nMoney is certainly a challenge, but once you find the happy place of keeping your finances in the green, things get quite a bit easier. It is possible for the game to shut down your school if you run out of money, but starting up the most recent load seems to trick the game into allowing you to continue making the threat much lower.\n\nThis game also isn\u2019t buggy at all for me, a huge plus for a game that is in Early Access as I am someone who has learned to expect some level of technical difficulty playing a game that is not fully released yet.\n\nOverall, though there is not too much to really do in this game, I see a lot of potential here. It would be worth playing if you generally like these planning and management sims.

You honestly can do a lot like playing in a sandbox...I mean it is a sandbox.\n\nHowever, I would love the game even more if there was story. It gets extremely boring after completing 2 years in the  game. There isn't much you could do too. There is also too many kids. People bunch up so much it's really messy. There also should be more problems in the future like suicide or a mental classroom for those mentally disabled.\n\nBut other than that, great game. Really reccomend it for those who play prison architect. Hope this improves the game in the future!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521185769, "timestamp_updated": 1521185769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40814332": {"recommendationid": "40814332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348941309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1629508036}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this game has a lot of potential and at the risk of repeating what other says, here's what I think it should include:\n-a gym for P.E.

But hey, that's why it's Alpha so it can be updated! Anyway, here's what I think can be added or improved:\n\n-More Grants. I know this is obviously on the way, but more Grants will keep players interested.\n-More rooms. More traditional and elective courses, like: Foreign Language Classroom, Graphic Design Classroom, Business Classroom, etc., a Gymnasium, Band Room, Shop Room, Drama Room, Art Room, etc. Any elective that schools have this game has the potential to include. Obviously there are ones that would be utlized more, like the Gym, but others could have only a few students. I don't feel the need to micromanage these subsections although I do believe they provide an excellent factor for admission of students. With a better sportsball team, maybe admission rises. You can include different staff in order to make this negative or positive. ie, a better teacher/coach means more sportsball players, therefore more students in admisison and tuition.\n-have the ability to change tuition to reflect school status\n-charge for lunches\n-admit a larger population of students to include those with low income. This could be added as a difficulty setting so that funds are harder to come by and disperse. This could go along with charging for lunch; for those with financial diffculties you may need to cover their lunch expense\n-Maybe instead of totally firing a teacher we have the abiltiy to dock their pay for low performance or, on the flip side, send them to training to improve their education. This of course would cost but would improve the students learning environment.\n-Have a test day right in the middle. Even with transferees, 16 days is a long time to go with no additional students. With a test right in the middle and a fresh set of students thereafter. (of course not too many, but 5 to 10 would do wonders)\n-Wider array of teachers. I don't mean for standard classrooms, but for elective courses.\n-the school could have clubs! with clubs comes happier students, more students in admisison, or smarter students. Clubs could be something like almost every school has: Yearbook, School Newspaper, Foreign Lanugage Club, etc.\n\nThe possibilites are endless.

Right now, as you'd expect from an early access game, Academia is very bare bones. It has the absolute basics of the gameplay one might expect from a school-sim, and not much else besides.\n\nFeatures are very sparse, gameplay is honestly rather same-y and tedious, and there's as much variation as a straight line. This makes for rather boring gameplay, and really it's not worth playing past the first school year. The graphics are simplistic and clean, the soundtrack is a little unforgettable, and the interface can be a little obtuse. Ambient sound effects, such as students chattering, construction work, or clatter in the school kitchens, are nearly nonexistant save for the school bell. Furthermore, there are indeed a number of bugs, mostly graphical glitches so far.\n\nSo why am I recommending this? Simply put, what IS there seems promising, and there's room to expand. As we're in such an early stage, one would expect the game to be fairly basic until new features are added in. And it seems as though Squeaky Wheel does indeed intend to add more, if hints on the interface are to be believed.

It is just a pity it is still in its early stages, so we all have to wait until its full release. It has a lot of pontential. What we have so far is the core of the game done well indeed - no game killing bugs, great arts and it runs smoothly. In fact, if there are any bugs, at the end of the game's day, the system restarts and all the apparent bugs go away as the next school day begins. \n For gamers like me who love and play management games, the challenges so far are not hard at all. Starting with plenty of money, I never go below 70% of my funds ever. Perhaps, harder levels should be added for those who prefer dealing with difficult financial troubles (think about less startup money and a huge bank loan at hefty interest rates). Government funds for a private school such as this should also not come easy. \nThe infinite budget sandbox mode should not be in the main menu at all, but within a submenu, preferably saying - \"n00bs sandbox\" or something akin to DOOM easiest mode.\nAs far as buiding a school goes, in terms of doing whatever you want, I think a classroom should not necessarily have 10 student's tables, but none at all. Kids should just sit on the floors, why not? I like the fact, classrooms can be outdoors, so sitting on the grass and no 10 tables required should be the way to go.\nLooking forward to:\n- vertical buildings;\n- school activities;\n- music classrooms, gyms, pool (outdoors type as well),\n- natural elements (raining, snowing, scorcihng sun - all able to be turned on and off by the players)\n- annoying parents telling the principal what to do\n- unruly staff (they all work so perfectly, humm, like machines - wages setting)\n- teacher's age (teachers working year after year can become later vice-principals....in your second branch somewhere else) Yes we should own more than one school and having someone realiable working there.\n- kids' love for the school - they can go away if they feel the school is not their second home\n- gardens and trees in need of tending (hiring gardeners)\n- choosing or not school uniforms\n- adding CCTV cameras in each room\n- middle and primary school and kindergarten (college and university)\n- lots of drama (drugs, romance, pregnancy, illnesses, death, parent's death)\n-  after-school programs\n- night-time classes for adults (like cooking, sewing, foreign language, mechanic classes)\n- Vending machines generating income to the school\n- Car or Bus Drop-Off zones \n- character traits and vices for students (Like genius or great leadership/ lazy and depressed)\n- time outs; suspension, after-class detention \n- students making their own friends, rather than just going to school and learning\n- (school shooting is not cool and totally passable - we want to have fun after all thinking about managing a school not having to deal with this craziness).", "timestamp_created": 1518131304, "timestamp_updated": 1518132510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39937940": {"recommendationid": "39937940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077866652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1568150266}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]I overall like the concept of the game, and I'll probably keep playing it for a while.\nMechanics are good, and its easy to understand if you mess around with it for a bit.

But in short words, I would recommend it.[/b]\n\n\nSome reccomendations/ideas I have for the developers:\n\n-More things for the students to do while in recess, or any other free time. When I played, the kids would just stand around, read a book or fill up the computers while waiting for the next period, and I would like for them to have something else to do. (chess table, play with each other, have a swing, etc.)\n\n-Reactions/emotions with eachother, like love, anger, happiness while they are close to eachother; also it would be nice to see a personality trait for each kid to make them all different from eachother, some would be shy, goofball, perfectionist, etc..\n\n-Customize the staff and students uniform. That would be a neat thing to do.\n\n-Things to do, to make more money for the school. I would like to be able to do some events that would help me get more money to expand, etc. I want to feel more useful and productive while waiting for the things to be built or while I wait for the time to pass by to have the students graduate..\n\nI hope my ideas arent to crazy or time consuming, but also, that you take them in consideration.

Two, in my first school I built, I was having kids breaking into staff only places, and can't get out because they are blocked by staff doors. Three, my first school also is at and F passing rate, it has all top notch teachers, and its clean, but the kids still aren't learning. Four, a in school suspension room would be nice. Five, we should be able to have the option to turn on a thing that makes some kids wanna skip classes, or even escape the school. Six, fires, tornados, earthquakes, and drills for all of those would be hard to implement into the game, but it would be a very nice feature to have.

I've put a lot of hours into similar games like Prison Architect, and I got this because I wanted to build something new. \n\nFirst off, the graphics and UI are OK. They could be better, but they work. The music is repetitive and frankly I could do without it. There are a few bugs, like when installing a window the workmen climb through the new opening to leave instead of using the door like a normal person. The other one I've seen is where the workmen lay a floor different than what you ordered.\n\nI'd like to know where the developers went to school, because it resembles no high school I've ever been to:\n1. Students should arrive and depart mostly by school bus or car.\n2. In real high school there is no recess. The commons area is usually the same as the cafeteria. Instead, there are clubs, usually before or after school. This could be made to really affect the student's behavioral and academic experience.\n3. Several rooms appropriate to a high school are missing: 1) gymnasium, 2)wood shop, 3) metal shop, 4) drafting, 5) cooking, 6) sewing, 7) science lab, 8) stage or auditorium, 9) msuic, band, or choir. Basically, half the school is still missing.\n4. I've yet to see students change classes for different periods, nor have I seen lockers or the need for them. \n5. Even though it's your school you can't schedule classes or change the bell schedule. As the principal, you should have the option to get overly creative with the bell schedule. Schedule different lunches to optimize cafeteria space, schedule study periods, allow more or less time to pass from class to class, etc.\n6. While not a hard and fast rule, typically I see the principal handling the teachers and budget, while there is a vice principal who usually takes care of discipline problems. When I was in high school the vice primcipal was the man we feared.\n7. Almost every school I've ever seen has a detention room. Students should have a deterrent from being rowdy, and ideally, they should have a reward for achievement (dances, field trips, play days, pizza party, awards ceremony, anything)\n8. The school's crest and motto should mean something. For example, some things about the school could be easier or more challenging depending on which four symbols are in your crest. Like the basketball could give a bonus to athletics and P.E., while the atom could boost science education.\n\nThis game more closely resembles an elementary school. Add a playground for recess and change from \"freshman, sophomore, junior, senior\" to \"first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade\" and you've pretty much got it. Somebody should make that mod already.\n\nSo, to the developers: I realize your programmers, but have some kids and go to a school and see what's really in there, then make the game.\n\nI don't think I'll return it because I think it has potential and I'm hoping it will improve greatly, but I would recommend waiting to buy it until it's at a further stage of development. It's definately no Prison Architect, at least not yet. As it is, it's probably worth about half the price it's offered at.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515892083, "timestamp_updated": 1515892083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571428537368774414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39311520": {"recommendationid": "39311520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294306982", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1649125186}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it!

I just noticed that the game devs actually read these so I was wondering to make some tips what I think the game needs to level up.\n\nOverall, if you like building games, this is for you.\n\nAfter 2,5 hours of purely sandboxing I got these thoughts:\n- The options menu doesn't show the quick-buttons for example for rotating objects, nor let's you change them. ( I just figured everything out by just pushing everything ) So maybe adding a changing option helps the ones that doesn't like playing hide and seek.\n- Some of the builders prioritize the objects, even there would be walls, floor or doors still in development, getting themselves trapped. Maybe you could change them to at least go by walls -> doors -> floor -> objects? Or maybe put two kinds of builders?\n- The system that you have to make a trash can, hit demolish and wait for it to get demolished is way too slow. It would be nicer if you could just throw it to time and space, so if you'd like to build something immediately you don't have to wait someone to get it away first. Or maybe something else? It just feels a bit dumb, even I kind of recognize what you have tried to do here.\n- I would like to have a feature that the school atmosphere could be raised with plants, posters, swings etc. and maybe bullying, unclean places and such could decrease it or sth. The fact was that I wanted some plants but there was none, please let me have plants!\n- It feels kind of stupid that the builders don't have anything in their space. Why not add those containers where they could sleep and rest during the day?\n- I would also appreciate to get info of how many food boxes you need per human and how many food grannies to make them a meal. I had a lot of food not in my freezers but everyone still get their food and no one complained?\n- The transfer student system is a bit unclear - do I have to make them space to the classes or is there going abroad as many students of mine?\n- Maybe in somewhere in the future we could get more floors to the schools?\n\nSorry about a longish post, I really like this game and I'm looking forward to see where it goes!", "timestamp_created": 1515771988, "timestamp_updated": 1515772128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537506401538848877", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39276818": {"recommendationid": "39276818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405340585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1604338732}, "language": "english", "review": "my game keeps crashing i cant even play it says the game crashed and try's to load but does nothing for hours would recommed but not for a bad running laptop. :( :(", "timestamp_created": 1515749951, "timestamp_updated": 1515749951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486041754484176636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515759374, "developer_response": "Hi, we're sorry that the game crashes but thanks for the good recommendation.

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wording [/h1]\n\nAcademia: School Simulator is a game developed and published by Squeaky Wheel Studio Inc.\n\nI have been patiently waiting for a game where you can run your own school, after playing School Tycoon to death back in the day, sadly that game is no longer available to play both physically and digitally, so I had to patiently wait for another studio to come up with a school simulator where you can be the head of a school and run the school of your dreams\n\nSo, is Academia: School Simulator worth it? Well...\n\nCurrently, with this review being written whilst it's in early access, it is definitely an odd one. I recommend this game to support it within it's current state, but honestly... it's just not worth playing, not yet anyway...\n\nThe foundation of a school simulator and that of a fun game really is there, as are most of the basic rooms and functionalities, but it's also about as early access as you can get...\n\nYou set up a school, simple. Build classrooms, bathrooms, a cafeteria, a faculty, an office, home room and that's basically it... so long as your students are healthy and happy, they go from year to year with a minimum of fuss. Sure, there are a few strange bugs and the AI gets a bit annoying in certain parts, but it's never really enough to get in your way or is game breaking\n\nThere's no fights, although there is bullying, but at the time this review was written, it's incredibly basic. There's no drama with students, no dropouts, no sport functions or buildings, no prestige, no head-start, no parents, no politics, no cheating, no strikes, and everything else you would normally see in a school. Honestly, play it for roughly two or three hours max and you've seen everything the game has to offer\n\nIt's incredibly bare bones but there is a lot of potential here, and I want to see this become as good as Prison Architect and I want this to be the next School Tycoon game, but as it is right now, think twice before purchasing it. If you want to support the developers, pay the full price but if you want to actually play it and have fun and explore what the game wants to offer to you, then wait for it either to add a few more updates first or when it completely leaves early access\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1513977972, "timestamp_updated": 1513977972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417723804712295532", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38535733": {"recommendationid": "38535733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198222961864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 8350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 215, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1700600134}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like prison architect then definitly get this game. its still very early access and needs work on balance and game play; however i bought the game on release and it is continously updated with hefty changes =] im so so looking forward to where this game goes.

What we have to keep in mind is that it is still a very early access game.\n\nThe building aspect is very similar to that of Prison Architect, which I am a HUGE fan of, so if you have played that game or something similar to it then you know the controls already but there are a few differences which seem to be the same as SimAirport. \nThere are not a lot of choices when it comes to wall and floor colours e.g. I really hate that there is only one type of wood and carpet flooring so I hope we get more colours to really make each room stand out. \n  \nPlaying is simple, maybe too simple at the moment as there really is no challenge or \"End Goal\". Your students and teachers go about their school day, learning, teaching, eating and leaving...thats it. It would be nice in future updates if we can create our own schedules for each year group and see different types of students like bullies, geeks, jocks, cheerleaders ect. to make the game a little more lively maybe even problems like a fire broke out in the kitchen or frogs ecsaped from the labs (if we ever get rooms like that).\n\nThere is so much that can be added to this game like...buying more land to expand on, doing PE instead of being stuck in the class room, making our own scheduels , clubs, school trips. I will leave my list there as there are many many things I would love to see added in future updates.\n\nDoes the price reflect the game? No. I think the \u00a314.99 I paid for this game is too much for the little amount of gameplay I get. So my advice to others is that it might be an idea to wait for it to be on sale or more things have been added. If it was lower say...\u00a38.99 - \u00a310.00 then it would be about right for what you get ingame.\nIt would be nice to see the Developers push to get more updates out in a month or have one BIG update at the end of the month like some games I have played, unless it is a bad bug or crashes which they update as soon as they have fixes. \n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes mostly but a little no. Yes because I can see some really great protential in this game and as long as you understand that this is a very early access game and are happy with basic objects, game play and are also happy to wait for updates then go for it! No mainly because of the price, for me it is just a little to much for the little you get if it was lower then it would be yes all the way.\n\nOverall score...6/10", "timestamp_created": 1509738298, "timestamp_updated": 1509738298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548431217670440674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36244904": {"recommendationid": "36244904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056083730", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1597678972}, "language": "english", "review": "I've got to give it to the dev: they've been active and have put a lot of work into improving this game over the last year.

Sure there's a few strange bugs and the AI gets questionable, but it's never really enough to get in your way.\n\nThere's no fights, no drama, no dropouts, no sports, no prestige, no head-start, no parents, no politics, no cheating, no strikes, etc. etc. etc.  Play it for 2 hours and you've seen everything.\n\nSo why the thumbs up?

I've pretty much done all I could in this game as of now (wishing there was more to do, but it's still in Early Access so I understand). I'm very, very excited and have high hopes for the new updates. :)\n\nSome ideas and features I'd like to suggest: \n- School events, fun and moral boosting scenarios/cutscenes after achieving certain goals (i.e: book fairs, dances, etc)\n- A variety of clubs that could boost students' stats (i.e: art, music, chess, journalism, etc)\n- More objects that are decorative but also useful (i.e: vending machines, phones, posters, wall fire extinguisher, newspaper dispensers, fences, etc)\n- More types of faculty & their respective offices (i.e: the principal, counselors, librarian, security, maintenance etc) \n- A gym for P.E (swimming pools would be amazing tbh)\n- Different food qualities (i.e: ability to train cooks)\n- More zones (i.e: detention room, theatre room, reception, school newspaper, science lab, student council, etc)\n- Different personalities for students that causes them to behave in a certain way (i.e: Delinquent, Teacher's Pet, Dreamer // vandalizing, sleeping in class, gossiping, picking up trash, joining student council)\n- Adding the four seasons (i.e: Summer: student's complaining about heat (install AC/fans), Fall: leaves turn orange, decorations like pumpkins are added, Winter: snow, students building snowmans, Spring: allergy season)   \n- Player's ability to catch rule violators (i.e: using their phones during class) by clicking on them and having an option to send them to detention, and boosting some sort of school rating haha) \n- More freedom of choosing whether certain zones could be indoors or outdoors\n- Co-op?! That would seriously be so fun.\n\nWould like to see fixed/changed:\n- Ability to put trees on grass\n- Option to edit the placement of an object (i.e: rotating it, changing the color, placing it somewhere else)\n- Ahead-of-time warning before going bankrupt :(\n- Ability to take multiple grants at once \n\nLots of people have probably already suggested these, but I really hope that we'll get to see some of these implemented in futures updates. Also the gameplay was simple enough for me to play without needing a tutorial (so I thought it was kind of ridiculous that people refunded the game the moment they realized there wasn't a tutorial). @Developers, thanks so much for all the work that's going into the making of this game!!

Since a lot of people have mentioned Prison Architect, I will agree it has a very similar vibe but is very, very simplified even from fairly early stages of Prison Architect's Alpha phases.  I don't think the game is so complex that a tutorial is in any way neccessary right now.  If you're familiar with other sim games, you'll figure out how to get started and going fairly easy, and like Prison Architect Alpha it has a to-do list as the basis of some guidance.  The only thing that was less than intuitive with the GUI was how to set boys and girls bathrooms.  If you go to edit zone for the most part the only option is to remove the zone rather than actually make any changes to it, but it also gives you the option to change the bathroom gender and grade level for classes.  Other than that, the game is pretty simple and intuitive for those familiar with the genre.\n\nThat said, I'm only recommending it if you're interested in supporting the developers.  If you're hoping for a game as enjoyable as mid to late stages of Prison Architect alpha testing, you're going to want to wait a while.  Currently, there is absolutely no problems to manage in the game.  You start with ample funds to have students in small class sizes with the best teachers no problems.  There is no conflict that arises aside from frequently sick students due to a dirty school, but I'm not 100% sure why that's happening aside from my janitors being slackers, and there are no consequences for it.\n\nLong term, things that would likely improve the game are adding objectives/failure clauses such as ways to measure the student body as a whole's learning (though that might be a result of trauma from the American Education system, aha), more effort in attracting parents to transfer students to your school through meeting academic or musical/athletic goals with your students such as competitions you send specific students to and making more money possible only after reaching certain objectives.  The introduction of delinquents is a start on making the game more whole, but there's a long way to go to add depth.\n\nAlso, A+ for using the Prison Architect artist.

I absolutely love this game! If it keeps going well, this will be one of my top favorite of all time games. I subscribed to the subreddit, email, twitter and the youtube channel so I don\u2019t miss a single thing. If you liked or loved Prison Architect, you will feel the same way or stronger about Academia. It takes on a very similar gameplay and artwork to that game. I messaged the Dev on Twitter and sure enough, the artist from PA is on this game and he is working in a small group to make Academia. This is his own project and he is passionate about it. I expect great things from this game and I bought 2 copies right when I could on launch day. \nSummary so far:\n\tYou start out with a blank slate in an open canvas as you prepare to make your school. You have 3 zones already that you can of course change. You have deliveries, garbage, and an area for your workers. At this point, there are no scenarios or tutorials implemented yet but that should change over time. To get a sort of tutorial now, you can just take on a grant, finish the grant, then move to the next. In this way, you will get the idea and progress. I haven\u2019t played until end game or anything yet but I can see how it will progress based on what I\u2019ve done so far. The gameplay is similar enough to PA to know what to do intuitively but it is a different game still. You can hire at this point: janitors; teachers; workers; cooks and nurses. This game is based on a high school so there is freshman through senior classroom zones to make. There is even the ability to have a bathroom for men or women. This game looks, feels, and sounds great. It\u2019s a very positive experience so far. I would definitely recommend this game to add to your collection. \n\nPros:\n\u2022\tGreat art\n\u2022\tGreat music\n\u2022\tGreat UI experience\n\u2022\tIntuitive menus for building and management tasks\n\u2022\tSandbox mode for just playing around or experimenting\n\u2022\tGreat communication with players and perspective players\n\u2022\tA team that can be trusted in early access to deliver and not abandon the project\n\u2022\tTasks don\u2019t take too long to get done by workers\n\u2022\tBeing able to vote on the next game project for the devs\n\nCons:\n\u2022\tSome editing tasks can be tedious such as having to bulldoze grass if you lay down grass and want to change it to something else like concrete tiles\n\u2022\tNot enough tile and wall pieces yet\n\u2022\tLack of campaign so far\n\u2022\tLack of proper tutorial so far\n\u2022\tSlow loading to start the game\n\nVerdict:\n     I won\u2019t give a game that released practically a second ago a numerical value or something of the like. I can say that the issues with the game so far will most likely be fixed over time. I don\u2019t see my cons as permanent problems. I simply added them because they are there. If I were to recommend the game or not, I would always recommend it. This is a great start to what will become a great game. I say go for it! \n\nStill not sure:\n\tI can blame you if you don\u2019t know if you should get it or not. I recommend checking out the dev logs and gameplay videos on Youtube. I would also check out the site. That should help you decide for sure. Some games in early access are simply not worth getting yet until they fix and add more content. I think this is one game worth getting and enjoying the journey over time. \n", "timestamp_created": 1505011583, "timestamp_updated": 1505011583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58323967456817627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34846002": {"recommendationid": "34846002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286378840", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1557176316}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1504988691, "timestamp_updated": 1504988691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466926097869873047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34845423": {"recommendationid": "34845423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188244618", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 981, "last_played": 1689018219}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST EARLY ACCESS GAMES I HAVE PLAYED.

Students simply go home (not even using a school bus)\n- Very limited amount of zone types and things to do\n- In current state, absolutely not worth the pice.\n- Can't rename students/teachers or staff.\n- Can't buy land to make an even bigger school\n- Everything can be built in 5-10 minutes, leaving you with nothing to look forward to.\n- High graphical settings can bug out your game, huge amount of memory also used\n- No missions/challenges or anything really to make it more interesting\n- No tutorial, you are thrown in and you have to figure it out all by yourself\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI will update this when updates come to add new zones/items etc ofcourse.\nIf you want to support the devs, and believe they won't abandon this project, then I'd say buy it.\nIf you want a prison architect game that is about schools, do not buy this yet.\nIs it right now worth 16 euros?
