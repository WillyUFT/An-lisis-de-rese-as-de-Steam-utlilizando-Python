The new graphics are gorgeous, but the developers retrained the original level and character design for the most part. The music is solid, and the voice work is excellent and even features some VAs from the original games. If you don't like the new music, there is an option to use the older music (a nice bonus for us older fans).\n\nNew players will have fun with this title too. The gameplay is pretty simplistic - kill enemies, find gems/eggs/dragons, fight a boss occasionally. But the level design is quite intelligent even though the levels are now over 20 years old, and the characters are fun. There's a lot of replayability if you're the type to go for 100% completion, but you'll get hours of playtime even if you're just playing through the game in a hurry (remember, this is actually three full-length games). The controls are straightforward and intuitive, but I wouldn't try to play with a keyboard and mouse. Overall there's not a lot of depth, but if you're looking for a game you can pick up and play for 10 minutes or two hours this is a good choice.\n\nI'm currently playing on the Steam Deck and this is a great travel title. I'm a bit surprised at the near 40GB size of the game, but that and some small stutters on the loading screens are my only complaints (I'm running the game from an SD card, so you'll probably get better performance if you run the game from the Deck's internal drive). Actual gameplay is buttery smooth on the Deck, and the battery draw is average (much less than something like Baldur's Gate 3, but more than something like Hollow Knight. The game also plays very nicely on my older gaming laptop, I get 60fps @ 1080p consistently. As this is a fast-paced game, consistent framerates are important - I haven't seen any dips below 60fps except on loading screens.\n\nOverall I recommend this for new and old gamers alike. Super elite pro gamers might not find it challenging enough but for the rest of us it's a great way to kill an afternoon.

The additional physics cause Spyro to drift in air and water, making precision movements and collecting underwater gems etc more difficult than it should be. \n\n2. Incremental Super Charge. This was a mechanic present in the original Spyro 1 when using a Super Charge ramp. Spyro would gain more and more speed the longer he supercharged down an incline. This feature was added, unnecessarily to both Spyro 2 and 3 speedway levels. This coupled with the aforementioned flight drift, considerably changes how you must approach these levels, which were faithfully recreated and not designed around having these additional physics. In Spyro 2 and 3 Supercharge should not be an incrementing variable but a constant. This isn't even an issue of having to create extra code, as the code for Supercharge with a constant speed is already in the game, as can be seen when using the Supercharge \"Gate\" power ups in Spyro 2. \n\n3. The most egregious change made to the games, affects every main level in all 3 games. \nSparx the Dragonfly will not collect gems if Spyro is not touching the ground. This forces the player to back track and do several passes through areas to collect gems that in the original would be collected on the initial pass.

The small amount of unique additional content is also pretty cool. I enjoy looking at this game, and listening to the soundtrack.\n\nNegatives:\nI'm not a big fan of the controls, which is the primary reason why I don't recommend this game. A mixture of janky camera work (even more so than the originals), motion blur (which at least can be switched off), and Spyro feeling more like a cat than a dragon, leads to an underwhelming and sometimes nauseating experience. I can only stomach (literally) playing this game for about an hour at most at a time, as my stomach churns from the sudden rotations and zooming of the camera. I only get this kind of motion sickness when I feel out of control of something (e.g. the back-seat of a car). I don't experience this kind of feeling with original trilogy, so it is definitely worth having someone with motion sickness playtest future titles (if any get made). The only other gripe I had was also control-related, and that's the vehicles, especially the skateboard. As this is a platformer, the controls can make or break this game, and sadly, even though I intend to gradually finish the game (when my stomach allows it), I will probably never play this game again after that. \n\nI hope they take what they did well from this game, and fix the controls if there ever is a future title, as it is a real shame that I have to mark a game with a lot of love in it as a thumbs-down. Of course if you don't get any kind of motion-sickness, it could still be worth a play for you. \n\nEdit: after finishing 100% of all three game, I can say that Spyro 3 is a broken mess in many areas, especially the skateboarding and massive frame drops I was experiencing at random times that made the game unplayable without rebooting, or switching around graphics settings every 10-20 minutes. This was enough of a blowout that I've lowered by original score of 4/10 to 3/10. Just play the originals at this point.\n\nRating: 3/10 (really below average)\nAny%: ~7 hours (across the trilogy)\n100%: ~20-30 hours (30 for me as I can't stomach moving too quickly)\nValue: ~$20 seems like a fair price for someone who doesn't have the problems that I have, but with the frame drops and nausea, just play the originals.", "timestamp_created": 1699165443, "timestamp_updated": 1700709319, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149545631": {"recommendationid": "149545631", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113014129", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1699135686}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1699135719, "timestamp_updated": 1699135719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149530657": {"recommendationid": "149530657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286867960", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1699119723}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen jueguito.

original game or have seen the game's movie/cutseens or have played this on ps4/ps5 then theirs no worries.\n\n********* For all three games *********\n*Music\nGreat & dynamic for standing still, running, & moving in every level & hub world & is just a banger of a soundtrack.\n\n*Gameplay & Controls\nsmooth & responsive with the camera control being added it helps a lot in areas & makes things easier then it was in the original game, if you press the (L3) then sparks will point to the closest gem helping you collect & find things alot faster & safer, due to the remaster side of the game & better camera the mini games are alot easier to handle, playing this game on controller is not only easier but helps in some areas & mini games it's ok on keyboard but if you have an Xbox or PlayStation controller use it as it feel way better, there are times were some AI are smarter or dumber then their original PS1 counterparts witch either makes it easier or a small challenge.\n\n*Graphics\nVery nice & beautiful even on low settings, the game looks & feels amazing even on the lowest graphical settings witch is nice to have for highend & lowend computers, its stunning on highest but dose not lose much on lowest settings.\n\n********* Spyro the Dragon (Game 1) *********\n*Story\nnothing was change from its original plot more was added making it more realistic & better moments & animations.\n\n*Original vs Reignited\nIn the Original game the dragons were bare bones & just a few different dragons models with color swaps & sometimes reused the same voices and for the most part said \"thank you for releasing me\" was about 95% of what dragons said, in the Reignited the dragons all have different body types & shapes more detailed colors & different outfits & animations as well as the whole \"thank you for releasing me\" is now 5% of what dragons say while 95% of them say something not said before, only other change is in gnasy cove the enemies held guns & fired bullets in the original while in Reignited they have goo/slime guns and shoot blobs at you witch i don't really care about.\n\n*Bosses, Enemies, & Difficulty\nNot much can be said about this, the bosses & enemies as well as the games difficulty is pretty much very easy unless your very new to games or platforms, the bosses do seem to have a little more delay/slowed attack speed & a little bigger hitboxs then the original game had witch is not a bad thing its very hard to die in this game unless your really bad at judging the distance of your flame attack & charge speed just remember \"big guys flame, small guys ram, big metal guys push off cliff\"\n\n*Achievement's, Challenges & Playtime\nThe challenges and achievements are pretty easy to get you will get most of them just by playing you will get like 75+% of them if your getting 100% in each level, the total playtime it takes to complete all Challenges & Achievement's and 120% the first game it will take you about 6~7 hours or more if your bad so its not hard to do.\n\n**Bugs & Issues\nThere was a issue/bug in the level \"Ice Cavern\" that one of the enemies did not drop a gem but it was fixed by me just jumping into the void to lose a life and respawn at the last checkpoint to respawn the enemy witch only wasted about 20 seconds so no big deal, and the other issue/bug is on the level \"Alpine Ridge\" there is this gate that an enemy lowers and raises but if you have your fps at 60 or unlimited the enemy will bug out and keep the gate raised thus making you unable to finish or play the rest of the level as its within the first 2-3 mins of entering the level to fix this you have to lower the fps in options to 30fps witch will fix the issue and after you kill the enemy the gate will be permanent be lowered so you can go back to 60+fps annoying for a first time but not unplayable.\n\n*Score for Gane 1\n10/10 its under 24 hours of playtime and very easy and everything iv said with the only issues/bugs being easy fixes that only waste maybe 20-40 seconds overall.\n\n********* Spyro: Ripto's Rage (Game 2) *********\n*Story\nnothing was removed its pretty much the same as the original just with new/better and more expressive animations and moments. \n\n*Original vs Reignited\nnothing other then visuals and designs & the trolley witch is better in reignited then it was in the original theirs no longer \"trouble with the trolley eh?\" unless your bad at playing the game, the last change was \"funny bones\" dance in the original, he did the moon walk shuffle and disco dance while in the reignited he flosses and disco dance,\n\n*Bosses, Enemies, & Difficulty\nHitboxs are a little bigger then they were in the original, alot of minigames are fixed or just better due to the camera making it easier, the boss \"Crush\" has became dumber witch i dont mind, however the boss \"Gulp\" has gotten smarter and has faster attack speed/animations then the original did and has ALOT better aim so he will give you issues, and the boss \"Ripto\" is the same for his 1st and 3rd stages but his 2nd stage is harder then the original one.\n\n*Achievement's, Challenges & Playtime\nMuch like game 1, they are pretty easy to get you will get most of them just by playing you will get like 75+% of them if your getting 100% in each level. as for the playtime its about 8~9 hours of playtime unless your bad at the game.\n\n**Bugs & Issues\nthere was not any bugs or issues to note other then Gulps AI being alot more aggressive then the original to the point i think its a coding bug.\n\n*Score for Gane 2\n10/10 its under 24 hours of playtime and very easy and everything iv said with little to no issues/bugs\n\n********* Spyro year of the dragon (Game 3) *********\n*Story\nThe story is the exact same just with better and more expressive animations and moments\n\n*Original vs Reignited\nnothing other then visuals and designs \n\n*Bosses, Enemies, & Difficulty\nHitboxs are a little bigger then they were in the original, alot of minigames are fixed or just better due to the camera making it easier, nothing much with the difficulty is different other then the skateboard and race levels are easier and better.\n\n*Achievement's, Challenges & Playtime\nMuch like game 1, they are pretty easy to get you will get most of them just by playing you will get like 75+% of them if your getting 100% in each level. as for the playtime its about 10~11 hours of playtime unless your bad at the game.\n\n**Bugs & Issues\nThe only bug/issue was in \"sheila's alp\" one of the enemy's just A-Posed as it was on the edge of a cliff and had no falling animation so it was just A-posing as it was \"falling\" but again they dont have a falling animation so it just A-Posed witch was more of a funny issue/bug\n\n*Score for Gane 3\n10/10 its under 24 hours of playtime and very easy and everything iv said with no real issues/bugs\n\n********* ISSUE/BUG with the game itself *********\nCurrently there is a bug/issue that if you have SteamVR installed on your PC the game WILL open SteamVR for what ever reason & if you dont close SteamVR fast enough it will close the game if you exit SteamVR unless you close it before the game finishes loading this is an issue as of October 2023, if you dont have SteamVR then it wont do anything.\n\n********* OVERALL *********\nevery game is very easy with little to no bugs/issues as well as keeping it the same as the original & it improves it & being so short with getting everything done in this game as a whole is 20-30 hours of total playtime it might be 30-40 hours or more if your bad at the game or new to games but overall its with paying but if your really good or what ever you can get it full price or 50%+ off",

While I don't think I enjoyed the game as much as they did, I still had a fun time playing through it, and I think it's a good game if you're looking for an easy, relaxing collectathon.\n\nThe first game in the trilogy is definitely the weakest. The game looks great and controls well for the most part (aside from the camera being awful sometimes, which turned out to be a common theme for the entire series), but most of the game is very easy and simple and the story was pretty simplistic as well. I also encountered a few unfortunate bugs, including one where the Alpine Ridge level became impossible to complete unless the framerate was lowered, as well as some physics bugs where I randomly lost speed or got stuck inside things.\n\nThe second game improved on the first quite a bit. The story is more complex and interesting than the story from the first game, and the cutscenes before entering each area were also pretty neat. It also added a bunch of neat new abilities and a variety of extra challenges to complete, which were pretty fun as well. I also appreciated the ability to point to treasure that was missed on each level, that you didn't have to collect something from every enemy in every level, the more interesting and challenging boss fights, and the cool and useful reward for fully completing the game. There were still a few bugs though, such as gems suddenly becoming impossible to collect, enemies getting stuck inside terrain, or challenge progress tracking incorrectly.\n\nThe third game made a number of changes from the second game much like the second game did, but I didn't personally like all these changes as much. The story is still good, but I didn't love it quite as much as the second game. The world design was definitely better with bigger and more interesting worlds, and I loved that each level had it's own set of different creatures, although I missed the starting/ending cutscenes for each level that the second game had. I enjoyed the music in this game the most out of the three, but I also found this game to have the most tedious and frustrating challenges in the series. This game also added some other characters that you get to play as briefly, but most of the time I just felt like they were more clunky and they mostly just made me miss playing as Spyro. This game was also by far the buggiest of the three. An NPC getting stuck on one level forced me to restart it multiple times, and I encountered numerous other issues such as getting stuck in terrain constantly, certain basic abilities suddenly failing to work (like jumping or gliding), and Spark sometimes pointing in a random direction when searching for remaining treasure.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] Although I found the games to be pretty easy and a bit buggy at times, and I didn't enjoy every challenge the game threw at me, the games have fantastic visuals, great music, good stories (in the second and third game at least), and are fairly fun overall.

No hay mucha historia mas alla de \"este es el malo: a por \u00e9l\" y por algun motivo da igual el enemigo, que 4 ascuas de Spyro lo mandan con San Pedro.\nLos controles son bastante simples, aunque algo dif\u00edciles de dominar. Lo \u00fanico negativo del primer juego (es posible que lo vea en los dem\u00e1s juegos) es que los niveles de vuelo tienen los controles invetidos y no se pueden modificar (y yo lo siento pero los controles invertidos son un asco)\n\nEl segundo juego se me ha hecho incluso mas corto que el primero (de hecho creo que hay menos niveles o eso me ha parecido). Innova pero no mucho. Mete un par de habilidades nuevas, y de paso las gemas sirven para algo (el capitalismo se invent\u00f3 en Spyro 2 xd). Por otro lado, es un poco menos arcade. Ahora hay mas di\u00e1logos, m\u00e1s personajes (unos cuantos furros) y los mundos tienen sus \"mini historias\" y en vez de \"dragones\" como coleccionable ahora hay orbes que se consiguen generalmente con misiones secundarias. Parte mala, que por meter las nuevas habilidades, te medio obliga a hacer backtracking en algun momento si quieres completar todos los niveles (aunque realmente a partir del segundo mundo ya puedes hacer casi todo bien). Las secundarias en parte alargan los niveles al contrario que los dragones que solo era acercarte y ya.\n\nEl tercer juego probablemente queda como el mejor de los 3 solo por el hecho de incluir m\u00e1s personajes jugable aparte de Spyro (lo cual es un soplo de aire fresco para el gameplay que lleva siendo el mismo durante 2 juegos). Comparado con el 2, hay algo mas de narrativa (aunque se han quitado las cinem\u00e1ticas que habia al inicio y final de cada nivel del 2).\n\nJuntando los 3 juegos, solo he encontrado un bug en el 3 donde un veh\u00edculo no se mueve por encima de los 60 fps. El ricach\u00f3n (el oso con mon\u00f3culo) es f\u00e1cilmente el mejor personaje del juego. En plan, es un asqueroso pero hace gracia y acabas teniendole cari\u00f1o (claro que si no vais completando los niveles a full entiendo que cuando le veais os va a dejar en la bancarrota, a mi siempre me sobraban las gemas a raudales)\n\nComentario general, es un buen pack  a un buen precio. No son juegos demasiado complicados (comparados por ejemplo con Crash xd) pero a\u00fan as\u00ed son divertidos de jugar y de completar.

The games, on their own, were very enjoyable even though they slightly differed from one another. +1 perfect games!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[u][b]Detailed Version[/b][/u]\nThis was my second playthrough of the trilogy and I remembered close to nothing about the game. I believe that allowed me to have an even better time. Now, I'll go through the individual games and give my two cents.\n\n[i][u]Spyro the Dragon[/u][/i]\nA way to get additional lives... After you defeated an enemy and collected their gem, anytime you defeated that enemy afterwards, they'd drop an orb (or soul). Once you collected 20, you'd get an additional life. It kinda gave you a reason to go to already completed levels, which was nice! One thing I didn't notice until revisiting the game was the lack of the hover ability while gliding. It threw me off before I realized it was simply missing.\n\n[i][u]Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage![/u][/i]\nThen there was the introduction of various learnable abilities. They added some not so very needed, but very much welcome variation to the mechanics, which I loved. What I didn't love was how you learned said abilities... I was never sure if I had to venture back or if it was learned somewhere down the line. I wish it were more clear where, or when, you'd learn such abilities.\n\n[i][u]Spyro: Year of the Dragon[/u][/i]\nWe could play as other characters! This was really fun since it was kind of like playing a whole other game for a bit. The only one that was a bit irritating for me was Sparx. Not actually playing as Sparx, but how to unlock Sparx's worlds. I, for the life of me, could not figure out how to get Zoe to unlock the worlds. I ended up Googling it and finding out I had to beat the homeworld's boss, which sounds so backwards to me...\n\u00a0\nThroughout the trilogy, my ongoing gripes were with the camera movement (especially underwater), the lack of world tracking unless you've traveled to said world, and no further use of the rescued dragons once rescued. I won't fault such an old title for all that and it didn't affect my enjoyment very much, if at all.\n\n[i][u]Please thumbs up.

Este juego es un cl\u00e1sico de la infancia de muchos ni\u00f1os de los 90. Un trilog\u00eda de plataformas en un mismo juego lista para jugarse. La realidad es que es una excelente idea. Los gr\u00e1ficos son preciosos, se mejora el dise\u00f1o de los personajes y la m\u00fasica ic\u00f3nica est\u00e1 ah\u00ed. Tambi\u00e9n sus controles no han sido tocados como tal... y quiz\u00e1 ese es un peque\u00f1o problema. Hay un ligero cambio de din\u00e1micas en Spyro 2 que continua en Spyro 3, y al ser un remake uno podr\u00eda esperar que el primer juego tendr\u00eda estas mejoras, pero no es el caso. No habl\u00f3 de la mejora de trepar paredes, nadar ni el salto con cabezazo, estoy hablando de una peque\u00f1a mejora el momento de planear. Y su ausencia puede volverse un dolor de cabeza en algunas ocasiones para quien est\u00e9 juego los tres juegos al mismo tiempo.\n\nAunque bueno, este no es el punto por el cual el juego tiene el pulgar abajo. Sino algo frecuente es la bajada de frames que se llega a dar en varios niveles, en especial de Spyro 3, al mismo tiempo que hab\u00eda pantallas de carga muy duraderas que pod\u00edan prolongarse hasta los 5 minutos, cosa que tambi\u00e9n se repet\u00eda cuando un aliado nos daba instrucciones. Esto hac\u00eda que varios niveles se generara una terrible sensaci\u00f3n de mareo tras un par de minutos, as\u00ed como frustraci\u00f3n por perder una vida y esperar a que volviera a cargar el nivel.\n\nTodos estas circunstancias hac\u00edan que jugar este juego se volviera cansado en algunas ocasiones.\n\nRepito, esto es muy probable que se deba a los problemas de mi propia PC, algo que tendr\u00eda que revisar por mi propia cuenta.\n\nA pesar de esto, la trilog\u00eda de Spyro es un juego bastante bueno y divertido, que, s\u00ed bien jugar los tres de forma continua nos demuestra los repetitiva que lleg\u00f3 a ser la trilog\u00eda original, no pierde su encanta y carisma.

It\u2019s sucked, as expected\u2026 but at least my time off work has allowed me to finally dive into this collection. And honestly, laying in my bed with my Steam Deck, and constantly being hit with the feeling of \u201coh my god, I actually remember [i]every[/i] detail of this level\u201d helped to make fighting this junk off again just a little easier.\n\nIt really was a treat to re-experience all the same solid action-platforming, fun characters, and the regular stream of goofy mini games of the originals - just with a new coat of paint, some honestly gorgeous cutscenes, and a load of entertaining new voice performances. Cloud saves, multiple save slots for the entire collection, and a [b]much[/b] expanded options suite are also present; and help to make these games not feel [i]completely[/i] ancient.\n\nIf anyone cares to know whether I think there\u2019s any negatives? Well\u2026 Year of the Dragon is still kinda mid, like it\u2019s always been. Ripto\u2019s Rage somehow whips just as hard as it did on day one, though. Also, all of Unreal\u2019s 4\u2019s classic issues are present - weird issues with shader compilation, occasional stuttering, and annoying cutscene audio delay and crackling are all here. Other than that, though - I think this is a damn fine package. Ran quite smoothly on my Steam Deck, with minimal tweaking - so I have to imagine that most any mid-range rig built between ~2017 and now should have virtually no issues with it.\n\nWith all that in mind, I honestly can\u2019t recommend this collection enough - and even though they definitely took some liberties in their reimagining of the trilogy, I still appreciate it for having it\u2019s own cohesive style. Major props to Nicholas Kole\u2019s work, for just being unbelievably gorgeous to look at. Seriously - if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re gonna want to get [i]every[/i] skill point, just to admire his efforts a little more before you move on to something else.\n\nAs a final note - congrats to all the developers for the game having recently crossed its much-deserved ten million sales milestone!

Nothing that Toys for Bob was in charge of could have been done much better. The game looks great and sounds better than ever, but each level is still instantly recognizable even 20 years later.\n\nI only have one real complaint, and it's that tying game physics to frame rate is simply unacceptable in the 21st century. Especially when the game is literally impossible to complete on a higher than 30 framerate. Yes, it's only one level where it's a real issue, and you only have to lock the frame rate for 10 seconds or so, but that should have never passed quality inspection. Not for a major release with a big money publisher behind it. Doubly not when higher frame rates are an option offered in the in-game menus.\n\nThe loading times are also weirdly long for a relatively simple game.

However, the Reignited Trilogy is a great way to play the first three games.  Each game is relatively similar to each other with some giving Spyro more movesets to explore.  Each game (if you are not going to 100% them,) is about 4 to 5 hours each.  A fun trilogy but there are some problems with the PC port.  First, it keeps opening Steam VR every time I boot the game.  Second, if you have the frame rate over 120, Spyro will slide nonchalantly across the ground.  Third, cut scenes are compressed FMV and do not look good. also the audio is not synced when they play.   I have experienced crashes and the game minimizing itself for no reason, just know that this PC port is not the worst I have seen but it is not the best.  I recommend you pick this game up if you want to get into Spyro or grew up with the games, just be aware there are some quirks in this port. \n", "timestamp_created": 1694586311, "timestamp_updated": 1694588406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146197972": {"recommendationid": "146197972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362596301", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4895, "last_played": 1694573250}, "language": "english", "review": "Spyro.

The remastered version of original spyro trilogy.  I will start off with spyro 1. First spyro game in this game you have to rescue dragons collect gems to adavnce to other worlds also on some levels you going to need to catch thieves and rescue dragons eggs.  My opinion of this game is positive altough there are going to be some tough levels like tree tops the trickiest one. I give first spyro evaluation of 10 of out of 10. Next is Spyro 2 Ripto's rage, this game became even better in this game you  have to collect gems and orbs, also this game now has quest system where you have to help certain inhabitants of the world to get orbs neccessary for the quest. In my opinion this game is an improwement over first spyro, and i give an evalutation of 10 out of 10. Finally Spyro 3  year of a dragon. Now this game is a complete improwement of both first games, in this game you have to once again collect dragon eggs and this time there will be more than little number in the first spyro also you collect gems as well, and another improwement is that you get to play as other characters as some missions requires different characters to obtain gems/eggs. In my honest opinion this game is an absolute blast altough i didn't like the bonus level race in this game it was frustrating to get that first place, but after hard work i did it and now I\"am writing a review about this game. My evalutation of this game will be 9 out of 10. Final evalutation is 9.6. I highly recommend this game to everyone who played spyro on ps1 or are new to this game, and i will tell you this is not a game just for kids, because kids nowadays woudn't even bother to play this game let alone try to figure out where the remaining missing gems are.

You get a chance to roast them later (literally). There's more! Horny pixies locked in cages. Trolls flash green butt cracks and slap them cheeks. Pervy draenei flirt with innocent dragon... the list goes on!\n\n[b]Wholesome Trilogy[/b]\nThere's three games, where the next one gets better and more complex.\n1st adventure: simply run, jump, glide, collect gems, hit enemies... drown and fall to death (jump controls response suck!) in between and repeat so 30+ times.\n\n2nd crusade: all of the above, plus you can swim now! It's like playing GTA SA after VC: \"whoa, I CAN swim!\". A lot of quests are water based, so embrace your aqua nature.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3021948635\nSequel feels larger, yet repetitive due to its secondary objectives which are made of compulsory backtracking: new abilities are locked, yet NPCs ask for gathering animals, chests, accessing areas which are out of reach for now. \nMoreover: we have mini games too! Riding carts, flying through various rings, playing hockey, pursuing hopping thieves and many others.\n\n3rd quest: all of the above AND you get to play as new animals: Penguin, Kangaroo, Yeti & Monkey. Each has unique powers and either helps during boss episodes. Heavy accent is made on skating, you better train the dragon doing flips and spins.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nSpyro Trilogy is casual, colourful & cute. And simply super!

Overall I'm fairly happy with the entire experience as I love platformers and the fantasy theme is a lot of fun. All characters, enemies, and levels have unique assets which shows a lot of time was put into the artistic design. The games do have a weird physics tied to frame rate issue, most likely an unfortunate symptom of the port. The game must remain at about 30 frames or platforms, walls and a couple boss fights do not work at all. Its weird but 30 frames is plenty to enjoy the game so I'd advise to switch it as soon as you start playing to avoid frustration. The trilogy as a whole is a mixed bag gameplay wise so I'm going to go through them one at a time. I did make an effort to make myself at least familiar with key parts of the original set of games to make a solid opinion.\n\nSpyro the Dragon with all the achievements as well as getting 120% took me about 8 hours. I personally loved this one, the amount of care that was put into this one was great. All the levels are standard, there aren't any crazy platforming tricks you have to pull off that aren't the standard jumping or gliding making everything as smooth as possible. One thing in this game that I can't believe they took the time to do is with the elder dragons which all have completely different designs as in the original they were all the same shape with varied colors only. It definitely reads as the first game in the series as it is a little more simple than the other two in the set but that isn't a bad thing as sometimes bare bones is better than overly complicated mechanics. A complaint which is obviously just attempting to keep consistent with the original is the boss fights in this. They are simple platforming challenge, chase, catch up and hitting them. The last boss is the same way which is sort of disappointing but this is my only complaint. Other than that great title in the series and a great starting point.\n\nSpyro: Ripto's Rage took me about 15 hours to 100% and get all but one achievement. I really liked this one too and found playing it to be relaxing and pretty standard as it was with the first. I never had to do any heavy back tracking and was impressed with the increase in content but not in an overwhelming or unwelcome way. Ripto is a better villain than Gnorc not from a design stand point but that he seems more relevant and he has more of a presence in the story at least it felt like it. I wish the collectible in the game was more interesting but that is minimal. Every level had a start and ending cut scene which was kind of cute. The boss fights in this one are a very welcome change from the first and play like standard boss fights rather than the platforming ones. They are adorable and the final fight against Ripto is also pretty neato. Like the first a lot of care was put into this one and I was really happy the entire time I played it.\n\nSpyro: Year of the Dragon is where I started to have a few issues. It took me about 15 hours to 117% finish the game and get most but not all the achievements. I really wanted to just finish this one after awhile because this ended up being my least favorite of the three games. My god, did I want to just quit at some point and I did not want to finish this one but I pushed through to complete and 117% this one. First off the Spyro sections are standard, levels once again have unique assets and enemies. These sections were totally on par with how the first two games were and I was very happy with them. I personally think the Rhynocs are weird and look silly and dumb, that's minimal. The villain is also just not great, I think she is just... Bleh. I was so mad at this game at some point that I took a very long break from it and forgot why I stopped, got on and immediately remembered the amount of aggravating stuff race back. Spyro sections were completely fine where it adds in the other characters who you can also play as is where I started losing it. It was fine when Spyro was using vehicles or otherwise but the other characters, please just no. I've looked at videos of this in the original version of this game as well and it was somehow worse at least gameplay wise. Sections with Sheila were fine, Sgt. Byrd was just boring as you became very overpowered in my opinion, Bentley is just a no, absolutely not, and Agent 9's levels were so all over the place and out of place I was just not interested or wanting to do them. There are also some levels with Hunter and they were also annoying but minimal compared to Bentley's. Some positives for this one are the boss fights at least end of area boss fights are very cool, some of the individual level boss fights are frustrating. Also, I get it was the 90's but skateboard sections, no. These bugged out for me on half the occasions I had to do them especially in the last section of the game I won because I fell through the map after a failed trick and it sent me ahead of the other racers and I won. This game also had me getting soft locked causing me to have to jump of the edges of the maps for a respawn to fix the puzzles. This happened a number of times so many that it was one of the things that originally made me take a break from the game. In the end it wasn't a terrible game, frustrating for me yes. Sometimes adding too much fluff to a game is too much especially if the fluff isn't executed in a productive way that still makes the game feel like its predecessors. \n\nOverall I was fairly happy with the entire collection aside from about a quarter of the third installment. I'm not sure if this was because a second studio was brought in to help with the third game or not, I'm unsure. The first and second games were a treat for me and so I'm sure that anyone with nostalgia towards the titles will love them. The third game has a sort of rushed feel at least to me but overall wasn't the worst, it is just the sections where I'm forced to play other characters that I didn't enjoy. Having other gameplay elements isn't an issue but the way these are done is just not up to a standard that makes them fun or enjoyable to me. The entire graphic overall with all three titles is amazing and the glow up from its PS1 era originals is outstanding. It was well worth my time and I played for quite awhile making nights after work enjoyable and relaxed. Its a great deal especially if it were to go on sale so I'd say pick it up at least for the first two installments and if you want to have a time go enjoy the third as well. The first two get an 8.5/ 10 for me because dragons are awesome and the third a 6.5/ 10 because no one likes Bentley's Boxing, just no.", "timestamp_created": 1691970298, "timestamp_updated": 1691970298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652887344360351563", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144013327": {"recommendationid": "144013327", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971201629", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1687, "last_played": 1693432303}, "language": "english", "review": "The original Spyro trilogy was a fun laid back good time back in the day.

Full disclosure: I was a Nintendo kid.  We had a GameCube, and my brother and I had our own DSes.  The only Spyro game I played when I was younger was A Hero's Tale, and I only remember the box art.  Throughout my early emulation kick, however, I was intrigued by the original Spyro trilogy.  I never made it very far in them though.  Playing through this game was the first time I had completed any of the original 3 games in this franchise.\n\nSpyro 1 is a solid time.  It's fairly light on the plot side of things, but it makes up for it by being incredibly fun and having some iconic locations (for better and for worse).  This is the one I tend to go back to for some brain-off platforming, and with only a few exceptions, most levels won't be much of a challenge once you master the controls.  This remake also adds the Sparx radar function from later games to help hunt down some of the trickier gems.\n\nSpyro 2 wound up being my favorite out of the collection, despite introducing Hunter into the series.  2 is a consistent ride.  Even the stuff I'm not the biggest fan of (something something trolley problem) is still fun in it's own way.  The music is great, the hub worlds are nice to explore, and I like the non-linear progression.  I might even develop a speedrun category for this one (Low% NG+).  This one is great!\n\nYear of the Dragon was a step up in some ways, and a step down in others.  Expanding on the non-linearity of the last game is nice, and I like that the Speedways have more going on than in 2, but there were some ...decisions made that I disagree with.  I'm referring to the skateboard/hoverboard, those levels sucked.  The other playable characters brought some diversity into the gameplay without shoe-horning Spyro into more limited movesets temporarily.  Unlike the other 2 games in this pack, I haven't gone back to this one since getting 117%\n\nThe PC porting job is good for the most part.  I played with a DualShock 4 for the authentic experience.  I did run into some known issues trying to run the game at 60 FPS.  Due to a bug, some things like the staircase in the wizard level and the last jump in Tree Tops are impossible to clear at 60 or higher, so you have to go into the settings and set it to 30 FPS.  I wound up doing that in other parts of the game as well, so if you're wanting a solid 60 FPS experience, you won't find it here.\n\nThis game is good.", "timestamp_created": 1691784361, "timestamp_updated": 1691784361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585798859596252441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143923099": {"recommendationid": "143923099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361880465", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1692974245}, "language": "english", "review": "Skylander is on of my favorite Videogame Franchises of all time and despite Spyro being always a Skylander in my heart, I cannot ignore the quality of this game.

Several times I hit spots where my fps just plummeted to around 2-3fps and lagging the entire game including the menu. Resaving the graphic settings would fix this.\n\nSometimes Spyro will just start sliding on the ground while standing still. Seems to be a somewhat common issue where setting a max fps limit (60) fixes this. Personally I had some serious problems in the dark passage level in the dreamweavers world where Spyro would just get stuck on random spots on the floor while walking. Jumping would fix this, but it would sometimes start doing it again right after. Lastly I had a few times where the game didnt seem like it registered I jumped so Spyro would just fall to his death. Ultimately setting the max fps limit seemed to fix most of my issues.\n\nCouple minor things that aren't really issues, but are annoying enough. Flight controls(inverted) can't be changed for flight zones and the credits for the first game are about 20 min long with no way to skip or go to the menu. At no time do i ever want to watch 20 min worth of that crap. Leave it to the movie theatres where it belongs...\n\nOne last note is the steam deck verified process could be improved and made much more clear. From my experience the game itself was unstable at various times mostly in the dreamweavers and magic crafters worlds. Having to set an fps cap midway through a game kind of goes against the verified requirement of being playable with the default settings. Imo they should be doing is reevaluating games every few months to make sure newer updates or proton versions don't break anything to retain that verified status. Seems like once they set it as verified they almost never lower the status even if it technically shouldn't qualify for verified anymore. Thankfully this game only needed some minor change to be playable, but other games might be far worse.

I have this release on the Nintendo Switch and I had no problems whatsoever with it but I got it for PC because I figured it would be the better experience compared to the Switch's hardware. Boy was that a mistake.\n\nI only played Spyro 1 but right out of the gate Spyro would not move when I pushed the thumbstick. He would animate as if he were walking, but he would not actually move anywhere. I would have to jump to get him unstuck from this state. It happened randomly throughout the entire playthrough and didn't seem specific to any level or world. Sometimes after walking and stopping Spyro would slowly slide on his own. If he slid off an edge he would fall and probably die, and I lost a few lives this way. Spyro also walks diagonally sometimes, for lack of a better way of describing it. He'll be facing one way but pull to the side as he walks and it makes navigating narrow bridges and platforms extremely hard. I also noticed a bug with the Supercharge ramps where sometimes Spyro will enter the Supercharge state but not have the speed that goes with it making certain levels like Tree Tops not possible to complete as long as this bug was in effect.\n\nAlso on top of that this game has at least one bugged achievement, Rocketeer in Spyro 1. I did exactly what the achievement said to do and it simply didn't unlock. There are only two points in the entire game where you can attempt this and one of them is at the very end after 100%'ing the game. I'm not planning on attempting it again. Not worth it.\n\nApparently a lot of these bugs can be fixed by setting the in-game FPS settings to 30 but I did not try this. I had already completed the majority of the game before I found this out. I shouldn't have to lower the FPS and like I said I was playing this on PC for the better experience compared to the Switch. There's no way the playtesters didn't notice the litany of glitches plaguing this game. They just simply didn't care. This is published by Activision after all so it's not like quality is their MO.

Just go in to the menu and hit the 30fps limit for that one bit, and you're fine. I had no other issues playing this at a smooth 60fps for the entire trilogy.\n\nThese games do rather take on a childish feel in a lot of ways, the story of all three feels that way and mostly in the second game. I struggled a little bit with that as an adult, but hey if you can indulge in it then it's just fine.\n\nThe gameplay is where it's all at though. These are comprehensive collectathons with plenty of character to them. Whether it's dragons, eggs, keys, gems or orbs that you're searching for, everything feels exact and tailored to keep the gameplay pace well-tuned and quick. You're never too far away from the next thing to pick up, or little area to explore, or minor puzzle to solve.\nThere's not a lot of truly taxing or difficult stuff in any of the games, but the few examples of that are rather big. The dragon boss in Spyro 3, the jumping puzzle in Spyro 1's Tree Tops level and the various Hunter side-objectives in 2 & 3 being the main ones.\nBut pretty much all of this stuff is optional, so if you just want a laid-back approach to collecting a load of stuff, exploring all the worlds and flaming and charging all the baddies, you can absolutely have that and it's a lot of fun all-round.\n\nThe basic controls are smooth and responsive, while the camera is a bit slow to turn, there's a quick center-behind button as well. Running, charging, jumping, flaming and gliding all work great though and it does feel just right to do all these things.\n\nThe music and overall atmosphere are well defined in each world. Characters are generally funny and nicely animated, with attention to detail when expected. You can burn bits of the environment.\n\nThere's not a massive amount of things to say really, when the main appeal of these sorts of games is just HOW the controls feel - and it's just done very smoothly and nicely in the Reignited Trilogy. So if you want an experience that will last for somewhere near to 20 hours, that feels pretty good for the whole time, you can't go wrong with this pick.\n\nFurther thoughts, gameplay and a more in-depth review on my channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag_-sQaDjV8", "timestamp_created": 1690381602, "timestamp_updated": 1690381602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6789436936378479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142825280": {"recommendationid": "142825280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198434882873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1690880598}, "language": "english", "review": "Childhood memories like Sonic", "timestamp_created": 1690367198, "timestamp_updated": 1690367198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142813262": {"recommendationid": "142813262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098455928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2465, "last_played": 1690345767}, "language": "english", "review": "Great remake of a great trilogy.

Secondly, the game progression is well done; each game that you play, you get new mechanics that are not that repetitive while still maintaining the original essence. Thirdly, there were unique enemies and bosses that made the game even more challenging, despite the platform scenarios.\n[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]\nOn the negative side, the main flaw was that the boss fights were very clunky because Spyro's movement was somewhat awful most of the time. Besides that, the game does not work properly at high FPS, bringing some non-completable levels until you lower the FPS limit to 30 or 50.\n[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]\nIn short, it's a remaked trilogy that brings great level design, an awesome soundtrack, and challenging platform scenarios, but sadly functions badly sometimes at high FPS with awful gameplay at bosses.

I obviously recommend this game.\n\nIf my profile didn't make it abundantly clear, this is one of my all-time favorite childhood series. I was never really that into Crash Bandicoot. Linear gameplay is fine, but not for me with platforming, since it takes all of the fun away from exploration and puts it more into challenging you with carefully timed jumps in limited spaces.\n\nSpyro's not like that, it's much more relaxed. There are some challenges, to be sure, especially with the mini-games in Spyro 2 and Spyro 3, but technically you don't have to 100% (or 117% or whatever) the games just to beat them, you'll just miss out on the bonus levels in 1 and 3 or the permanent superflame powerup in 2. Even then there's some wiggle room, since you can still access the bonus areas in 2 and 3 without getting everything.\n\nAnyway, the Reignited Trilogy being a total from-the-ground-up remake of the original trilogy of Spyro games, it works very hard to create a faithful experience... in terms of gameplay. There are actually a lot of aesthetic choices I wasn't too pleased about in the days counting up to the release of the games, and unfortunately Spyro 3 might be a little [i] too [i/] faithful to the original because Activision was directly responsible for it being rushed AGAIN, causing issues with the whole Reignited Trilogy that, while mostly fixed, will probably mar this otherwise shining example of how a remake should be done.\n\nFor long-time fans, look past the changes and appreciate it for what it is: a recreation of a childhood classic. Even full-price at $40 it's a steal.\n\nFor new fans: you would be stupid to miss out on this if you like collectathon mascot platformers. Spyro's the best and you won't get a word in on me about that edgewise.\n\nOh and hey, play with mods once you've beaten the game. Model swap Spyro out for Cinder if you want, it's your game to play how you like... and while it's certainly buggy to play as Sgt. Byrd in Artisans or Bentley in Glimmer, as the levels weren't designed with them in mind and sometimes their attacks can't even hurt enemies, it's still a heck of a lot of fun.

Successfully maintaining the essence of the original titles while revamping them for a modern audience, the trilogy deserves a commendable score of 8.8 out of 10.\n\nThe Reignited Trilogy is a heartwarming trip down memory lane, maintaining the sense of whimsy, adventure, and humor that defined the originals. The captivating tales of a young dragon on heroic quests hold up remarkably well, thanks to the timeless charm of the characters and the engaging nature of the stories.\n\nThe original controls and gameplay mechanics have been faithfully reproduced, ensuring that each glide, flame, and charge feels just as satisfying as in the original games. The inclusion of quality-of-life improvements, like the option to use an analogue stick to control Spyro, demonstrates the developers' dedication to balancing nostalgic gameplay with modern conveniences.\n\nVisually, the Reignited Trilogy is a delight. The graphical overhaul breathes new life into the Spyro universe, with richly detailed environments, impressive lighting effects, and meticulously designed characters that stay true to their original designs while being distinctly modern. The developers have gone the extra mile to ensure that each world is unique and immersive, offering a vibrant and colorful playground for players to explore.\n\nIn terms of audio, the remastered soundtrack by Stewart Copeland, the original composer, is a highlight. The catchy, atmospheric tunes, coupled with improved sound effects and voice acting, elevate the overall experience significantly.\n\nOne of the Trilogy's most impressive aspects is the sheer amount of content on offer. With three full games, over 100 levels, and myriad collectibles, the Trilogy provides excellent value for money. Whether you're battling bosses, rescuing fellow dragons, or participating in challenging mini-games, there's plenty to keep you engaged for hours on end.\n\nHowever, the Trilogy is not without its minor faults. Some players might find certain aspects of the games, such as the flight controls and camera movement, a bit clunky, even with the updates. Additionally, a few of the more dated game design elements, like the lack of a map in the first game, might be off-putting to players used to more contemporary conveniences.\n\nIn conclusion, the Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a fantastic homage to a beloved classic that stands as an example of how to do remasters right. With its nostalgic charm, appealing visuals, engaging gameplay, and substantial content, the Trilogy is not just for fans of the original games, but also for newcomers looking for a fun and accessible platformer. Despite its minor shortcomings, it serves as a vibrant and rewarding journey that any player can enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1690015754, "timestamp_updated": 1690015754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142570678": {"recommendationid": "142570678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047903117", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1581662191}, "language": "english", "review": "Game breaks when playing above 30 fps.", "timestamp_created": 1690012671, "timestamp_updated": 1690012671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468085110187530518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142551913": {"recommendationid": "142551913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119238888", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189, "playtime_at_review": 1544, "last_played": 1700435630}, "language": "english", "review": "chill platformer", "timestamp_created": 1689980048, "timestamp_updated": 1689980048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142544111": {"recommendationid": "142544111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042145273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2607, "last_played": 1690055989}, "language": "english", "review": "Tons and tons of bugs.

Seriously, what is going on with the framerates in the PC port. I was not getting dips this bad on PS4 and I've never seen a game where the framerate is worse capped than it is uncapped. That and the fact that I had to go into the startup commands and make sure it was going to the right screen AND that it wasn't turning on my VR headset (even though it's not VR compatible) was very annoying. \n\nAll of that being said however, these games kick ass!

The first game still has some tricky parts to it like I remembered. For those who haven't played Spyro, you explore different worlds as a little dragon, collecting gems and whatever else the plot wants you to get (free frozen dragons, collect orbs, free baby dragons from eggs). You can glide around (and fly in flying levels), use a flame or charge attack. It has mostly simple gameplay yet later games introduce more abilities and 'mini-games', puzzles, or challenges in the levels. Irreverent humor throughout yet compared to most modern games perhaps, the plot and characters are NOT complex at all and have not much more deeper meaning than \"collect and rescue.\" Reignited looks so beautiful from the level backgrounds to everything else. I LOVE the redesign of the dragons in Spryo 1 -- they are so creative! There are a few redesigns in game 3 I've seen which are... a little creepy... trying to stay too close to the original with the pixel black eyes. Overall it's a solid game; lots of fun. It's nice I got this on sale so 3 games for $9.99 ain't bad at all!", "timestamp_created": 1689170196, "timestamp_updated": 1689170196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141889829": {"recommendationid": "141889829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384619386", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2894, "last_played": 1689150468}, "language": "spanish", "review": "elora x spyro no me discutan", "timestamp_created": 1689149412, "timestamp_updated": 1689149412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141876615": {"recommendationid": "141876615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079571310", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1689624202}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Top 5 Remakes de la historia del videojogo", "timestamp_created": 1689129816, "timestamp_updated": 1689129816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141859348": {"recommendationid": "141859348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267650178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1689196203}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple nostalgic fun, old school kinda wonky camera.", "timestamp_created": 1689108618, "timestamp_updated": 1689108618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141842919": {"recommendationid": "141842919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041323652", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2009, "last_played": 1688782895}, "language": "english", "review": "Tis great game, Play it!", "timestamp_created": 1689092643, "timestamp_updated": 1689092643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141827676": {"recommendationid": "141827676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989777945", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 246, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1700728492}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the original trilogy growing up, and these are literally perfect remakes of those games.

The controls....\nThey're simply anti fun lol\nI still don't get why you can't just jump + glide from a running charge, yet you need to stop running (the game has barely any momentum physics btw) to jump and glide, it's so counter-intuitive for me.\nRegardless of that, it wasn't my main issue, as I managed to get all achievs and maximum % on the 3 games, but man, in the third game when the skate minigame is introduced, everything bad about the controls become worse. Spyro somehow loses all sense of direction after tricks randomly, even when you perfectly spin/flip for the right amount of time by holding/releasing Triangle/Y. It makes every skate minigame a chore when you have to race the CPU that clearly doesn't have the same issues.\nMight be an engine issue but the physics are just bad.

The menu selection and guidebook make it incredibly easy to switch between games at will, although I did notice longer than expected loading screens at times. \n\nThe gameplay is pretty much exactly what you would expect from Spyro. It\u2019s simplistic platforming revolved around collecting and exploring the levels, as well as minigames with the later series entries. The biggest issue was both the camera and movement, which often felt less sharp than in the original games. This was most notable during underwater and flight levels. There were times I would have to switch from my controller to a mouse and keyboard in order to have Spyro turn sharp enough to make specific turns. I also encountered small bugs that were not detrimental and easily fixable by resetting the level, but did come as a hindrance at times, such as whirlwinds not allowing me to glide or being stuck in specific mobs. \n\n9 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1688845395, "timestamp_updated": 1688845679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

Reignited for the modern age! This trilogy brings back our purple hero Spyro and his buddy Sparx from the iconic classic Playstation games Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage and Spyro: Year of the Dragon. The perfect collection for any fan of the game, even if just for nostalgia's sake, this will take you back in time to when you were playing these games in the late 90's and 00's. Everything is perfect about this, from the graphics to the music, which you can make the choice between the reignited game music or the classic. Animations and character designs are beautiful, as is every world you step, or rather, glide into. Full of colour and wonder.\n\nBeing a long-time fan of Spyro since he came flying into our lives in 1998 and kindling an ember in our hearts, I've fully completed this on Playstation 4 already after having got it on release. I couldn't say no to re-buying the trilogy again on Steam, because not only am I a sucker for everything that this game is, but I love that you can collect the items in the points shop, as well as show off your achievements here (I mean sure, you get achievements on Playstation too, but I value them more on Steam.). You can also mod the game, which I haven't done yet, but will soon, just to play around with what creators have made, but the game really is perfect even without that. It works naturally with a Playstation Dualshock 4, so you don't have to mess around in Steam settings to get it to show Playstation icons instead of XBOX or PC. \n\nI bought this in the trio collection along with Crash N.Sane Trilogy and Crash 4: It's About Time, but at the sale price of \u00a38.74 (compared to \u00a334.99) you are crazy to not buy this. You'll have hours of fun, whether you've played Spyro before or not. Fantastic games, fantastic music, fantastic characters and worlds. It's just all amazing.

find missing gems. ~\n\nYes I recommend it as a whole, even after my upcoming rant. But this is gonna be long because I need catharsis after Spyro 3.\n\nI only owned Spyro 1 as a kid so the other two games were fairly new to me on Reignited Trilogy.\n\nI liked the redesign for the most part (yet the originals will always have their own charm).\nThe camera controls were just awful though. Active mode, passive mode - both were bad, in my opinion. You have to manually control it just to see where you're going sometimes. \n\nNow onto the individual games:\nSpyro 1 was as lovely as ever. Fun collectathon game.\n\nSpyro 2 was great, too. Minigames are introduced so there are more things to do in each level, but it's nothing too troublesome.\nEXCEPT for Gulp. Eff you, Gulp.\n\nNow I need to vent about Spyro 3. I was not prepared for the frustration that game caused me.\n\n100% gem collection was painful in certain levels. More than a few times I was missing the final gems and they were in hidden places or I had just not scoured every single piece of ground. Icy Peak and Spooky Swamp were the worst for that. It was only after a while that I saw on Reddit that you can click the left stick and Sparx points to where the missing gems are. If it wasn't for that, I would have wasted even more time in later levels. (It also says it on the controls menu, so silly me for not realising!)\n\nHad I played Spyro 3 before, this might not have been an issue. What is unavoidable, though, is the design of some of the minigames. They are just [i]unfair[/i].\n\nThe fire dragons in Fireworks Factory, holy hell, WHO thought of that? It takes forever to kill them [i]and[/i] they can regain health. What a slog.\n\nThe whack-a-mole game with Bentley....... The amount of times I swore at that blasted game. The timer starts before you can even move yourself down the stairs (with the speed of a turtle) and because of the camera you can't even see where you are supposed to hit. And the DAMN GNOMES RUNNING IN YOUR WAY LIKE HEADLESS CHICKENS. WHY ARE YOU HERE?!\n\nThen, the skateboarding. Once you get used to the mechanics it's not so bad but then they introduced skateboarding races in Lost Fleet and, bloody hell, it's time to get angry at skateboarding again. It's so easy to crash when you are trying to do flips; sometimes Spyro will just fly off course into the celestial sphere; and the turbo meter randomly decides when to fill - sometimes giving you zero boost. It's just so inconsistent in every aspect.\n\nIt's worth watching some videos on the skateboarding, because that helped me get the Lost Fleet skill point.\n\nApparently those three games mentioned above are harder in the remake compared to the original. I fully believe it.\nThey were the main culprits, but in general a lot of the side character missions/extra tasks were not really as fun as the previous two games. They felt slow.\n\nI just wanted Spyro 3 to be [i]over[/i], a feeling which I was not expecting. I never had that frustration with Spyro 2, and certainly not with Spyro 1.

I have a personal connection to the franchise, as I played the original version of Spyro when it was released, despite its pixelated and less visually appealing graphics. However, even back then, I fell in love with the game and its charming protagonist.\n\nThere's something about Spyro that captivates me, although I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it's the sense of adventure and exploration that comes with guiding the lovable purple dragon through beautifully designed worlds. Maybe it's the satisfying feeling of collecting gems, rescuing other dragons, and thwarting the plans of the mischievous villains. Whatever the reason, Spyro has always held a special place in my heart.\n\nFor those who haven't experienced the original Spyro games, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. One of the fantastic aspects of this package is that you get not one, but three incredible games in a single purchase. The trilogy includes Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!, and Spyro: Year of the Dragon, each offering its own unique set of challenges, characters, and environments.\n\nThe developers behind the Reignited Trilogy, Toys for Bob, have done a remarkable job in revitalizing the franchise. The updated graphics are absolutely stunning, breathing new life into the vibrant and colorful worlds of Spyro. The attention to detail is evident in every aspect, from the lush landscapes to the character animations. It truly feels like stepping into a magical realm.\n\nNot only do you get to relive the nostalgia of the original Spyro games with enhanced visuals, but the Reignited Trilogy also includes quality-of-life improvements and modernized controls. These enhancements make the gameplay smoother and more enjoyable, ensuring that both newcomers and longtime fans can appreciate the trilogy to the fullest.\n\nWhether you're a fan of the original games or someone looking to embark on a fantastic adventure, Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a worthwhile purchase. With its charming protagonist, engaging gameplay, and the value of three games in one, it offers hours of delightful entertainment.

overtly biased and blinded by pure nostalgia. Not a day goes by where I can see this game and not immediately think of being a little kid and sitting on the floor next to my brother in awe as he played and then waiting on him to come visit so I could show him that I learned how to do the cool flips on the skateboard to catch the little guys on balloons. At the time I absolutely despised the sounds of the egg thieves and hearing them in the original trailer literally brought me to tears.\n\nThis remake absolutely blew my expectations out of the water. I may not have a decent amount of playtime into the Steam version but I finished the PS4 edition (PS1 nostalgia so it was the obvious choice to play on originally) not long after launch and grabbed this one on sale just to replay it on PC and it is still just as flawless as the PS4 version. The remastered music is wonderful, the option to toggle it makes it perfect. The remade bosses and important dragons all having their own distinct characteristics.  I literally cannot state just how impressed I was (and still am) with this remake. There was so much love and care put into bringing our little purple dragon back into the modern day.\n\nEvery time I replay these 3 games even in their remastered form I get immediately thrown right back into my childhood and that is such a wonderful thing. I do not think any other remake to this point or in the near future will ever come close to the sheer perfection of this one. \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1686635343, "timestamp_updated": 1686635343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139979797": {"recommendationid": "139979797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136953739", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1686711844}, "language": "english", "review": "purple dragon,", "timestamp_created": 1686632174, "timestamp_updated": 1686632174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139977191": {"recommendationid": "139977191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070515710", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1699884751}, "language": "english", "review": "I never played the original on PS1, but it was fun to experience the game in this remastered collection.

If your fps is very high, such as 144 fps, certain physics are affected, such as your max jump height.

I have never played these games before, so the Reignited Trilogy was my first time experiencing these games. I enjoyed playing through all three games, though I did not like the third game as much as the first two. The only major complaint I have about the Trilogy is that having a high fps can affect certain physics. For example, there is one area in Spyro the Dragon where if your fps is too high, you won\u2019t be able to make a jump since your max jump height is affected by the high fps. I had to cap my fps to 30 in order to get past this area. Thankfully, there were only a handful of times where I had to do this.\n\nOverall, if you are into platformers and have never played the original Spyro trilogy, I recommend taking a look at this game, especially if it\u2019s on sale. If you have played the original Spyro Trilogy, it may still be worth taking a look at this game.", "timestamp_created": 1685923959, "timestamp_updated": 1685923959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629160761833190918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139567067": {"recommendationid": "139567067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170666111", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1693765513}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es literalmente mi infancia.", "timestamp_created": 1685922853, "timestamp_updated": 1685922853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139560085": {"recommendationid": "139560085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354542240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2189, "last_played": 1685905502}, "language": "english", "review": "Toys for bob actually nailed it", "timestamp_created": 1685911378, "timestamp_updated": 1685911378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139557628": {"recommendationid": "139557628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004129500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 4067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4054, "last_played": 1689122048}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a great quality remaster.

E.G instead of having gems up the middle of some steps you have to jump up, they are on opposing sides so you need to jump left, right, left, right. Another example are the random mini games that ask you to do the same thing 5 times for the sake of it. Really, the same thing 5 times in a row?\n\nThe mechanics in game 2 and 3 also feel terrible. Swimming is clunky as hell and the mechanic to run, jump, glide, then flap at the last second just adds to the horrible feeling of tedium. Run, jump, glide is plenty of things to control to get a perfect jump adding the flap on top of that doesn't feel rewarding. \n\nEach point is minor, but add it all up and it just feels terrible to play games 2 and 3. \n\nThe graphics do look nice and overall the port is good although there are some minor bugs.

It's a lot harder to perform a hover on flat ground now, often when I press triangle it just seems to abort my glide.\n- The skateboard controls a little differently; it seems much easier to accidentally end up facing backwards after performing a trick, and colliding with walls during a race is much less forgiving.\n- Resetting after a death is a little slow - it shows a transition screen every time instead of just a dip-to-black.\n- I find Spyro's new texture a little too vibrant / over-saturated. He used to be more of a medium purple (#9370DB) but now he is VERY purple (#800080).\n- Many challenges have been made easier (e.g. through auto-aim), while other parts have been made MUCH harder (e.g. fighting Gulp).

La quinta generaci\u00f3n de consolas es un buen ejemplo de ello, \u00e9poca donde naci\u00f3 el carism\u00e1tico drag\u00f3n p\u00farpura de nombre Spyro bajo el ala de Insomniac Games. Si bien la saga pas\u00f3 por varias manos tras la trilog\u00eda original y no tuvo una evoluci\u00f3n clara ni tampoco buena con entregas m\u00e1s mediocres que la inteligencia de un gnorc, los chicos de Toys for Bob fueron los encargados de traer de regreso las aventuras del intr\u00e9pido dragoncito en toda su gloria.\n\nA grandes rasgos, este remake es un calco pr\u00e1cticamente intacto de los juegos de PlayStation con variantes muy puntuales. Visualmente es m\u00e1s bello que nunca, haciendo gala de unos efectos preciosos tipo cell shading donde no s\u00f3lo Spyro se ve bastante bien dise\u00f1ado y fiel a sus entregas originales; todos los personajes cuentan con un nivel de animaciones, detalles en sus redise\u00f1os y expresividad sublimes haci\u00e9ndolos m\u00e1s adorables que nunca. El mismo patr\u00f3n se repite con los niveles, todos cuidados al mil\u00edmetro en t\u00e9rminos de tama\u00f1o, elementos que conforman el escenario y enemigos, siendo bastante reminiscentes a la trilog\u00eda original. El mimo y cari\u00f1o puesto incluso en los apartados m\u00e1s decorativos, como que cada nivel cuenta con un fondo exclusivo en la pantalla de carga, los m\u00faltiples efectos que dan vida a los escenarios, o la galer\u00eda que muestra el arte conceptual de la trilog\u00eda hacen del juego una experiencia muy agradable. La gran fidelidad de la que goza el t\u00edtulo, similar a la que tiene Spyro con el peque\u00f1o Sparx, podr\u00eda ser, no obstante, un arma de doble filo ya que Reignited Trilogy es una gran recreaci\u00f3n de las aventuras de los noventas sin sorpresa alguna para los veteranos, haciendo de los tres juegos una revisita muy deleitosa aunque con muy poca novedad.\n\nAl tratarse de una trilog\u00eda compacta, en t\u00e9rminos de jugabilidad es, a grandes rasgos, la misma a lo largo de los tres juegos lo cual sacrifica un poco la sensaci\u00f3n de evoluci\u00f3n que hizo Insomniac con sus obras, puesto que dispondremos desde el comienzo todo el set de movimiento b\u00e1sicos de Spyro desde el primero hasta el tercero. No obstante, el t\u00edtulo goza del esp\u00edritu de los juegos de anta\u00f1o donde la diversi\u00f3n prioriza por encima de todo lo dem\u00e1s, de modo que aunque a la larga puede hacerse un tanto repetitiva la din\u00e1mica jugable, en el fondo es una aventura extremadamente entretenida de jugar tanto por su sencillez y objetivos mayormente claros como por la implementaci\u00f3n, cada vez mayor, de minijuegos y tareas nuevas conforme se avanza de modo que el juego resulte siempre entretenido.\n\nNo obstante, no existe tal cosa como una obra perfecta. Reignited Trilogy padece de cierta inestabilidad en su tasa de fotogramas que se hace muy notorio durante las pantallas de carga, aunque por suerte nunca durante el gameplay. As\u00ed pues, la c\u00e1mara en determinados enfrentamientos contra jefes sigue un patr\u00f3n que puede chocar con la jugabilidad haciendo un poco dif\u00edcil manejar a Spyro a pesar de las configuraciones en el men\u00fa. La banda sonora presenta elementos interesantes como un dinamismo en su uso dependiendo de las acciones del protagonista, adem\u00e1s de contar con una regrabaci\u00f3n orquestal de las composiciones la cual cumple a nivel musical en comparaci\u00f3n con las versiones MIDI de PS1, aunque careciendo de la misma fuerza, energ\u00eda y vigor que \u00e9stas gozaban. No obstante, este apartado puede ser modificado en cualquier momento a gusto del jugador, a\u00f1adiendo opciones muy c\u00f3modas como la selecci\u00f3n inmediata de niveles que aceleran el proceso de ir de una zona ya visitada a otra.\n\nEn definitiva, Spyro Reignited Trilogy es una verdadera carta de amor al pasado, una recreaci\u00f3n de la trilog\u00eda de Insomniac cuidada con fervor y ah\u00ednco, y toda una oda a las aventuras cl\u00e1sicas de la quinta generaci\u00f3n.

It directly involves the dragon world, the dialogues with the adult dragons add to its lore, the level design is simple but good and collecting dragon eggs is fun. There are some issues with the camera sometimes breaking.\n\nThe second game strips away all of that. It takes place outside the dragon world, you don't even collect dragons anymore (if I remember correctly), the level design is usually fine but starts really suffering from weird collisions and boss fights that straight up break when your framerate is too high (!!!). And with \"high\" I mean more than 30 FPS.\n\nSpyro 3 goes more into the direction of Spyro 1 again, but the levels feel simpler and the gameplay issues become more apparent. The controls also completely bug out in some minigames such as the skateboarding. The unlockable characters add some gameplay variety but are underused and the ending of the game, including the final boss and related cutscenes, just feel absolutely lazy. Apparently it was outsourced to a different company and butchered more than the prequels.\n\nWhile I was trying to reach an unreachable platform in Spyro 3, I finally figured out that you jump higher when capping the framerate to 30 FPS. Other people report doors in the game not opening when the framerate is too high, or Spyro just constantly sliding on the ground. All those issues have been known for years and got never addressed by Toys for Bob (was there even a single patch for this game?), but some NPCs do the floss dance from Fortnite, so that's something, right? The same devs developed Crash 4 - figures.\n\nEmulate the PS1 games or something if you're not too lazy. But only 60% of players actually made it through the first world of Spyro 1, so I guess you'll likely enjoy the remake too without ever reaching the broken parts. I'll give it a thumb up anyway because it worked for the most part and it was good enough for me to play until 100% completion (or 120%/100%/117% if you're a Spyro nerd), but maybe for the first time I'm not tempted to collect the remaining achievements in a game I completed.", "timestamp_created": 1684451113, "timestamp_updated": 1684498861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690925776958465576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138514607": {"recommendationid": "138514607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196160921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 2969, "last_played": 1700174915}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I was happily surprised to see these games were not nostalgia bait and quite fun.\n\n[list]\n[*]The art team nailed their work, the locations are nicely designed and varied through the games. \n[*]The platforming feels nice and fluid. Some rounded edges on platforms can turn near-miss landings into a slide into the abyss but it's a rare issue.\n[*]The combat is simplistic in a good way; this game is a platformer first and foremost so the combat is simple and easy to learn.\n[*]Saving dragons in the first two games is fun since each dragon has a unique design and voice lines, which is sadly lost in the third game, saving eggs with repeating animations and no voice acting.\n[*]The side characters are hit-or-miss, but the unique levels given to each of them in the third game adds a nice bit of variety to the levels\n[*]The bosses were a bit of a letdown, even the final bosses, but ultimately they're a footnote.\n[/list]\n\nThe only thing these games lack is a difficulty curve near the end, but they don't necessarily need one either. The games are a fun & easy glide most of the way through.\n\nUltimately these games were quite fun to 100%. it's rare for gems to be so out of the way that they're hard to find on your second run through a level, although some of them are easy to miss.

[b]Hit registration is WAY OFF[/b]\n\n'Speedway Minigame' - Flying through circles won't register at times....triggering a restart.\n\n'Speedway Minigame' - Sometimes burning objects won't register the object being burnt, Triggering a restart.\n*Sometimes I restart a time trial over 10 times because the speedway Minigame doesn't burn my targets.\n\n'Spyro 3' - Hitting literally anything with Yeti in Spyro 3 at times wont register.\n\n*I'll mention that Spyros flame is super inconsistent, some say it's a shorter flame compared to Original. It either hits or misses especially\nin the times you need it to hit.\n\n'Flame ability' - Both the Fire Flames and Fire Bolts are super inconsistent, Sometimes they hit, sometimes not.\n- With flame bolts they are best used with the 'Aim' function as Spyro has inconsistencies hitting with no 'Aim' function\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. [b]Controls[/b]\n\n'Movement controls' -  are inverted for Minigames AND CANNOT BE CHANGED [b](For the invert fix check the guide section for the workaround, Thanks spyro community)[/b]\n\nTO ADD TO THE CONTROLS - There is no Sensitivity for Game pads. Only Mouse and Keyboard. :/// Yes you can do this externally but really...\n\n'Another One DJ KHAL' - .Okay so Spyro purposely ADDS mouse acceleration to certain parts of Spyro, like Agent 9s minigames \nwhere percision is needed\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. [b]JANK[/b]\n\n'Racing in a Car/Skateboard' - Sometimes when you land hard on the ground, you'll lose all momentum or Spyro will act like you were in the middle of a 'skateboard trick' and the board will break.(even if you weren't in a skateboard trick it will break) (and yes even if your board is perfectly straight and looks like it's not on a angle it will still break)\n\n'Sliding' - Sliding physics are heavy, trying to turn corners...forget about it your going off the damn slide. Look up 'Spyro Slide Haunted Tomb' REMASTERED not original and you will see.(please look this up, it's actual silly)\n\n'Responsiveness' - At times you could lightly tap the sprint button, and spyro will go so far as to jump off the map, but when you need to dodge an enemy bullet Spyro moves like a slug...very inconsistent.\n\n'Softlock' - Yeah...another skill issue, if you miss a gem and need to go back to a world to get it...and it's locked in a room that needs a mission to open...you need to do that ENTIRE mission again. Not a crazy softlock. (Your going to repeat missions more than you think)\n\n'Jumping' - Sometimes it takes RNG and no actual skill, you just miss. It's super crazy like intended jumps just fail.\n\n'Keys Combined' - Certain keys can't over ride, If you want to glide but have your fingers on the 'sprint button' your glide wont over ride as priority. Many games have this fixed except Spyro.\n\n'Spyro 2' - The 'Train Minigame' is one of the MOST BROKEN THINGS IVE SEEN IN A GAME. \n- Sometimes the buttons won't turn the cart\n- Sometimes if you fail the cart miussion you'll respawn to re do the mission and you'll spawn far above the cart almost off the screen\n- When you jump over other objects expect to just die for no reason\n- Shooting on a cart is horrible I don't know why this is a thing, it misses, there is no consistency (it's bad)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI updated the Review, It's easier to read and better layout.

Retro meets modern, loads of fun, very visually appealing, with easy to use controls for a computer. Also comes with the abilty to remap keys if you like, and the play with a controller. \n\nThe story line is interesting, yet brief enough to allow gameplay to dominate. Much of the game is easy enough nearly anyone can manage it, but if you are a completionist, there are several places for an extreme challenge, while also not completely getting in the way of the main game. Highly recommended!\n\nThere are a few not so great things to mention. Final boss fights are all very tough, as there are no checkpoints, great flight skills are needed in second game in order to get skills point for art gallery, and there are multiple inconsequential bugs in the third. None of these things stop normal gameplay, but can be very frustrating, if inexperienced or going for full game completion. There are also some minor issue with Steam achievements not always registering. I personally have 3 final goals, fully completed, that will not register. Again, not interfering with gameplay, just annoying. The camera while charging, or supercharging is wildly difficult to keep track of, making complex jumps over a void life-draining, though most of that is not necessary to complete the game.

I don't know if this works for the other two games, but they're also not Year of the Dragon where all the levels have 1 to 3 side quest portals with their own pile of gems!\n\nLook I'm going to be honest with you: I bought this mostly for Spyro 1 and Ripto's Rage. I never really liked Year of the Dragon and the only way I 100% it as a kid was with help from my cousins. But with Reignited I decided to try and get all the achievements and do everything myself! And I did! And let me tell you Year of the Dragon is still my least favorite of the series. God I never want to 117% that thing again.\n\nBut I also think Year of the Dragon probably got the least amount of love out of the trilogy? Like I can't really say much about the minigames seeing as to how I needed help with the difficulty scaling with the original. Everything in Reignited's Year of the Dragon is on Normal Difficulty and a lot of the minigames and bosses have been tweaked, so it was all pretty easy for me to do this time. Except Bentley's boxing minigame because it didn't tell me I had a THIRD punch option.\n\nBut Year of the Dragon was so buggy! They all shared some technical bugs, but it just felt like everywhere I went I was seeing issue after issue! Sudden camera jump here, Spyro getting stuck in a corner there, Fairy trying to ask me about my camera for the 30th time just because I walked past her, enemies getting charged back suddenly zooming in close to the camera to do their death animations, Spyro not being able to charge through certain types of Enemies/Fodder animals because they were in their death animations (ok to be fair I also saw this a few times when doing the Flagkeeper Achievement in Scorch for Ripto's Rage), and oh my God the SKATEBOARDING. If you hit the edge or corner or something, you're either stuck or the game thinks you've hit a half-pipe and throws you up to let you do a few spins, but then you always end up breaking your board no matter how good you position your board afterwards and God help you if you're in the middle of a race or trying for the course record!\n\nLike sure, some of those issues exist for the other games (not the NPCs or Skateboarding stuff) but they're way more tolerable. And even with the issues with Year of the Dragon, all the games are well remade: everything is placed almost exactly where they were supposed to be, they gave all the original dragons unique designs and animations (the baby dragons are... kinda like the original ones I guess?), certain characters like Moneybags will have different animation loops depending on what text they're currently saying, and Spyro has new designs for things like Superflame and Invincibility! Heck they even adjusted that annoying ledge to no longer be the hardest part of the Metalhead boss fight!

Simple designed, very easy to 100% and only a little bit annoying in term of controls for both movement and gliding.\nInverted controls while flying are vomit inducing tho.\n\nAnother annoying thing is lack of invincibility frames on getting hit.\nSparx (aka health bar) being yellow? Get hit 3 times in 2 second - YOU DIED!\n\nNot much to add here. Well, beside boss fights being super lame. Like all of them. \nNot a single good one.Just average.\nFinal boss was super dull too.\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\n\nSpyro 2: Ripto's Rage have way better level design, 3 amazing boss fights and way more stuff to do buuuuuut it does have a bit more annoying things about it.\n\nSwimming is really bad with camera hugging your dragon butt way too much,\nSpyro still turns like a 50 ton truck, \nflying levels with inverted controls are still top tier garbage but at least now they are way easier to finish\nand chase sequences are even more annoying because way more of them now require you to jump, fly and swim around more often when comparing to first game.\n\nCase in point: you cannot do flame or fly while holding run button so that means you need to STOP or MOVE SLOWLY for like 0.5 to 1 second to do a glide, precise platforming or flame while dude is still running away from you at mach speed. \n\nSo you need to find that one sweet moment when dude is doing a jump or something and you have like 2 frames chance to flame him there.\n\nIf that is not a definition of \"tedious game design\" then I don't know what it is.\n\nOn top of that low FOV combined with awful camera spectacularly fails to track Spyro on left or right turns whilre running and swimming, especially near walls.\n\nApparently this is not the case with original PS1 versions of Spyro 2 and 3 camera is way more smooth and he doesn't turn like a truck while running anymore so developers of Reignited Trilogy kinda f*cked up here.\n\nOh yeah there also \"speedway Hunter challenges\" and those are just super lame.\nYou just fallow Hunter flying thru rings or something for like 2+ minutes and you win by being second place. But one tiny mistake and you do all over again.\nSlooooowly. Booooring. Zeroooooo challenge.\n\nAnd yet still better than flying around with time limit or chasing a thief.\n\nI did enjoyed 100% each one of those games tho.\nKinda shame that rewards for doing that are really lame like not even a funny special ending or something but MAN the difficulty spike in Spyro 2 is extremely harsh and noticeable.\n\nPeople say that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is hard to 100%? \nI easy 100% those games with a blindfold and broken arm because how smooth controls are and how those games lack any sort of annoying level design.\n \nDifficulty curve in Crash games was as smooth and straight forward as it can get. \nNo difficulty spikes of any\nFirst levels are easy, last levels are harder. Makes sense right?\nHeck, even swimming and running feels good in those games.\n\nBut when Spyro does all that? \nIf its not banging a head into a wall, its gonna be another \"ups, you run out of your super stricted time limit - now do WHOLE section or level all over again\"\n\nLike 95% of the game and most of levels are baby diaper easy mode difficulty\nYou will finish those in minutes\n\nCollecting all gems? Not a big deal because you have a flying dragonfly that points those. \n\nCool feature for this genre even tho once in while the game gives a middle finger and points out a gem that to get you have to hit a special wall first on the other side of the wall \n(I am looking at you Autumn Plains) or some other stupid thing. \nWhat is this illusionary wall Dark Souls crap? At least some NPC or loading screen could give you a hint for this but nope\n\nAnd then there is that one challenge per few levels that was clearly not tested correctly or flying section that feels like it was designed by aliens from planet Idiotism because it takes WAY too much time mixed with trial and error to finish it\nGeez, thanks game designers for doing that in this baby game that is 97% way too easy and 3% stupid hard\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\n\nSpyro: Year of the Dragon its easy best of all 3. \nWhen Spyro 2 gave us few new moves, Spyro 3 gave us basically the same game plus different playable characters, minigames and vehicles such as boat, UFO, submarine and skateboard\n\nDevelopers instead of adding to mechanics or new moves for Spyro, decided that sequel should  have gimmicks. A LOT of gimmicks\n\nCharacters are fine, mostly.....\nNot exactly. There is 4 of them and each one of them feels super underwhelming\nSheila is a platformer type but she is annoyingly slow and jumping removes any sort of fun momentum you could build up.\n\nSgt. Byrd can fly but his homing missles are dull to use because your lack of control over them\n\nBentley is way to simply and sluggish to be fun to play. On top of that he have spin/reflect move that was used only ONCE in his tutorial level and then never again. Lame!\n\nAgent 9 have a gun so its all about shooting stuff. At least he feels fine but also way too simple to be engaging for longer than 3 minutes. Sometimes he is first person shooter, sometimes third person shooter, sometimes rail shooter. All of those feels meh because you just shoot same single enemy type\n\nSparx is probably the most fun out of new characters to play as because he plays like bullet hell games\n\nVehicles tho......ew.  They are ALL clunky, stiff and doesn't feel fun to use. Especially skateboard and UFO\n\nThere also minor improvements such as no more dumb talismans and cannons rotate way faster and shooting straight forward and not on arc so thats good - no more \"spam until you hit something\", just aim and hit it\n\nNo more annoying cutscenes before and after the level and now in game story is way more enjoyable. \n\nFlying sections are way easier and chasing thieves is still super not fun\n\nFighting Twin Dragons was infuriating and hints for some eggs are way too cryptic\n\nThe game boasts 20000 gems to collect instead of 10000 like in Spyro 1 as \"more content\" but its stupid and foolish because you don't have more to collect in a fun way\n\nThe number just got bigger and that's it \nYou way more often pick up \"5\", \"10\" and \"25\" to justify that levels now have 500 or 600 max gems to collect instead 300 or 400\nAh, PS1 era of gaming sure was weird and full of terrible/bullcrap marketing slogans\n\nI like new villain but Ripto was still way more fun to watch in cutscenes and as much as I found Elora from Spyro 2 cute, let's face it - Bianca is the only true waifu material here\n \nOh, right - about boss fights\nFirst boss was very fun, second and third boss was garbage and boring tier and way too easy to beat and yet somehow BOTH of Sorceress fights are even worse!\n\nNo extra phases, vehicle focused and victory feelt like to a wet fart in a middle of swamp lake\n \nWhen Ripto was super fun to fight, Sorceress gets two different garbage fights setting a new low for this franchise\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\nGame about flying dragon and yet flying is the worst part of those games and weird thing is that if you use mouse while flying it works perfectly fine\n\nAs if up is up, down is down and its smooth and all. And you can invert it if you want in settings \n(yeah, if you are a masochistic psychopath that is).\nSo basically the best way to play this whole game is with a controller and use mouse for all flying sections\n\nAlso set framerate to 30 because all 3 games have goofy issues like jumping not high enough, certain challenges being way harder and more annoying to do (especially with time limit) or Spyro sliding on normal floor like it was ice\n\nAll that is because of framerate being above 30\nI did learn about that far too late. It would save me a lot of trouble with this trilogy\n\nShame because the game plays really well and smooth in 60 FPS\nOr you can play in 60 FPS until you find some particular odd moment or challenge that requires precision, speed or time limit and then switch for a moment to 30 FPS", "timestamp_created": 1682802392, "timestamp_updated": 1699715762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

Nothing major has been altered or changed as far as I can tell, and so they seemed to have stayed nearly entirely true to the original. However, there are some minor alterations and, in particular, hiccups that are noticeably different from the original Spyro games. \n\nSpyro controls a bit less optimally than in the classic PS1 games. That is to say that it often feels like the camera is competing with you for control over Spyro, often causing you to miss a ledge you're gliding to, jump in the wrong direction entirely when attempting a glide, or miss a charge attack when you are trying to kill one or more enemies, resulting in you getting hit. This may not actually be a problem for anyone with no prior experience of Spyro. It may just be user error lol. \n\nOne more bug I noticed, and this is only relevant for completionists, is that there are times when Sparx will absolutely not pick up a gem no matter how close you get to it, thus resulting in the occasional \"missing gem\" hunt. However, this issue is remedied by the ability to have Sparx point to any missing gems within a level. \n\n*Update* \nI ran into another bug during the Gulp encounter in Spyro 2 where the dinosaurs that drop items to attack Gulp with stopped carrying any items altogether, thus I had to exit the level and come back. \n\nLastly, there were moments where the enemies really seemed to be struggling to move properly, thus rendering them mostly inert (in particular, the cannon shooters in Peace Keepers). On that same note, the egg thieves were made way easier to catch, often allowing you to torch them immediately upon reaching them. I hardly had to chase any of them. \n\nAll in all, these remakes really capture and reignite the charm of the original series of games on the PS1.

Along the way, he must traverse multiple realms, defeat various foes, and collect gems and dragon eggs to restore peace to the Dragon Kingdom.\n\nReplaying Spyro The Dragon is a joy, and it is evident that the game has aged gracefully. The controls remain responsive and intuitive, making it easy to guide Spyro through his adventure. The gameplay is simple yet engaging, with a mix of platforming, exploration, and combat that will keep you entertained for hours on end.\n\nOne of the highlights of revisiting Spyro The Dragon is the opportunity to rediscover the creative and diverse level design. Each realm is packed with unique challenges and hidden secrets, which, when combined with the vibrant colors and delightful soundtrack, make for an unforgettable gaming experience.\n\nOf course, the nostalgic factor plays a significant role in the enjoyment of this title. For many of us who grew up with the original PlayStation, Spyro The Dragon was our introduction to the world of 3D platformers. As such, the game represents a simpler time in gaming, before online multiplayer, microtransactions, and endless sequels took center stage.\n\nIn conclusion, Spyro The Dragon remains a remarkable gaming experience that has stood the test of time. Whether it's your first time exploring the Dragon Kingdom or you're revisiting it for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, Spyro offers a delightful, captivating, and enchanting journey that is sure to leave a lasting impression.

It's probably my all time favorite game. \n\nI REALLY love that they remade these. The remastered graphics are gorgeous, but if you're coming straight from the original PS1 to this, it will be jarring. I actually embarrassed myself in front of my boyfriend and his brother my first run through: I was so used to how forgiving the polygons of the PS1 were for just constant charging everywhere, I ran into almost everything in this one. I also liked that they really characterized each dragon and individualized them more. \n\nThere is an option to have the original game's soundtracks playing instead of the new music: Needless to say, I don't even know what the remastered music sounds like because the OG music is amazing. \n\nBesides all that, the storylines are the same, the maps are identical, as is all the placements of chests and gems. My only real gripe: In the PS1 version, if you couldn't find that ONE red gem you needed to complete a level, you could just stand still and wait for the sparkle to show you wherever it was in the distance. I don't believe that little exploit is in these ones.

There might be weird phrasing since it was not originally meant to be a Steam review tied to the game's page.\n\nBesides the OG Skylanders and playing 10 minutes of a random Spyro game on a PS2 in PLACE as a kid after school then getting bored, this is my first time experiencing Spyro!\n\nThis trilogy is absolutely amazing! It is a must play that everyone should get to experience. 3 really good games (2 which are amazing) that are an absolute joy to play. About 30 hours of content all together (my fully completed save says 25 hours and Steam says 40 hours). Must buy!\n\nI 120% (fully completed) the game as well as platinum-ing the achievements for it and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience! The game is NOT hard at all, with me casually 100%ing each level as I went, just making sure I got everything before I moved to the next area. But I think that is what made it so fun; for a game to be a super chill collectathon that doesn't have you searching every pixel for hours so you can find one chest behind a wall. The game was also pretty short. I beat the game in less than 7 hours. The art is amazing, Spyro feels great to control (though I would switch the flame and charge buttons if I could), the music is fun, the characters are great and make you chuckle, and the story is kiddy so very easy to sit back and just have a good time with.\n\nIf you are looking for challenge in a 3D platformer/collectathon, this is not it. But if you want a fun, chill experience to kick back with, this game will be the PERFECT tool to scratch that itch with!\n\nI cannot wait to jump back into the Reignited Trilogy so I can play the other 2 games, and if they capture the same whimsical, fun, chill feeling that the first game created, I will have so much fun with them as well :D\n\nEdit:\nJust finished Spyro: Ripto's Rage! This is the second game in the Reignited Trilogy.\n\nI 100% (fully completed) the game as well as platinum-ing the achievements for it and really liked the game! Spyro 2 does some things better than Spyro 1 and some things worse than it. To me, the things it did worse are bigger cons than the pros you got from the things it did better. Still a good game that is immensely fun to play and something I think everyone should get to play someday! Just not as good as Spyro 1. Spyro 2 is less flowy and focuses more on challenges and characters. You are stopped multiple times throughout every level to talk to someone to either help them, for them to give you something, or for some other reason. While I do think the challenges are fun and a good mixup from the general gameplay loop, the greatness of Spyro is getting to run around as that little purple dragon, so any time that you cannot do that is time wasted in the game. I should add that this game is a hair longer than the first. While I beat Spyro 1 in a little under 7 hours, I beat Spyro 2 in a little under 8 hours. Both are still shorter than an average AAA game, but I think it is interesting to see the little change in playtime.\n\nSpyro 2 has real boss fights! Since there is a more understandable and concrete story in Spyro 2 ((this is not a spoiler) Ripto has screwed everything up so you have to help the people of every world you visit), there are enemies which you definitely want to fight/kill, and to see that those enemies have actual fights around them and not just fall over like a cardboard cutout in the wind, it is very nice. Now, I am not necessarily a boss fight lover in a game like this. I kinda liked that Spyro 1's boss fights were just excuses to put another level in the game. But for the person who is looking for this sort of experience, you can find it in Spyro 2.\n\nSpyro 2 also is more difficult than everything being breeze through easy. I would not say that Spyro 2 is hard at all, but it is no longer (what some may call (not me)) brain numbingly easy. The puzzles of Spyro 2 are definitely more fun, engaging, and complicated, which is a very nice addition to the games as a whole. One thing I did not like about Spyro 2's added difficulty is how they tinkered with the gem placement in the levels. I think Spyro 1 had the perfect feeling of no gem being super annoying to find so you wanted to find all before you ended a level. In Spyro 2, though this happened fairly rarely, there were times that I needed to use Sparx to guide me to the missing gems and they were hidden in frankly stupid spots and unfun to search every crack of the level to find.\n\nOverall, Spyro 2 is a very good game that everyone should play; it adds somewhat real story elements to an otherwise story-less game and offers more reason/incentive to keep progressing, but messes with the gameplay loop and screws up the flow of the game so that it is no longer as perfectly tuned as Spyro 1 (Spyro 2 still has an impeccably made gameplay loop, but its flaws are apparent when held up to its older brother).\n\nI am super excited to get into the last game of the trilogy when I can. The visuals of both of the games I have played so far have been stunning and if the third game keeps up with the first 2 in gameplay, then I am in for another treat!\n\nEdit 2: Just finished Spyro: Year of the Dragon (Game 3)! This was the final game in the Spyro Reignited Trilogy (2018).\n\nI absolutely loved this game! I 117% it in less than 10 hours! What Spyro 2 lost in trying to make every level have some sort of story (and thereby giving unnecessary and annoying cutscenes), Spyro 3 trimmed down on. What Spyro 2 lost in trying to make every level have a weird gimic that didn't work much of the time, Spyro 3 fixed by keeping the absolutely amazing gameplay loop and only adding gimics around the edges of the levels. Spyro 3 was a great game that is a must play if you enjoyed Spyro 1.\n\nWhile I still prefer Spyro 1's way of putting the barest of reasons in the player's head so they can go about playing the elite level design and gameplay, Spyro 3 did put a story in the game that has more to care about.\n\nThe collectibles in Spyro 3 are back to greatness! Spyro 1 felt amazing with everything you collected. Spyro 2 made the main collectible (besides gems) these weird special gems which did not feel nearly as nice to collect as other items. Spyro 3 made dragon eggs the main collectible (besides gems), which felt great because it made you feel like you were saving the dragon species by beating the game. Also, Spyro 2 had this horrible idea of taking gems out of enemies when you kill them, so you never had any incentive to kill enemies besides when they put an arbitrary lock on the next area until you kill enough things. Spyro 3 brought back gems when you kill enemies (gems feel awesome to get) so you really wanted to defeat everything in a stage and collect those juicy gems!\n\nI must admit, the skateboard levels were not my cup of tea. It was annoying to first learn the controls, and when I did become somewhat comfortable, there was a lot of poor collision and registering of tricks. The gimic characters were fun in my opinion and they did not overstay their welcome. They were not more fun than controlling Spyro, and I think the devs knew that, so they gave you one full level with them, then 2-4 sublevels to let you experience them but not make the game about them.\n\nI thoroughly loved Spyro 3 and had a great time with it! I hope all who like 3D platformers/collectathons get to experience this \"gem\" of a game!", "timestamp_created": 1680654677, "timestamp_updated": 1681626005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505617976188659668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136116322": {"recommendationid": "136116322", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989072254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2608, "last_played": 1680652274}, "language": "english", "review": "This collection takes me back to good 'ol playstation 1.

I've been really enjoying playing through all three games as I only remembered the original from my childhood. Its a great relaxing mix of platformer and exploration. I love the fact that you can do the level in any order you decide and that the hub worlds are levels in and of themselves. \n\nThat said, its worth noting that the first game in the trilogy is by far the strongest. The second game is still good but there is a noticeable shift in tone and its clear the creators were trying to figure out what to do to define Spyro as a franchise. Its still fun and a good game but it also has quite a few minigames with completely different tones. That said, its got the same relaxed and fun feel to it. Though, having to pay to unlock skills like being able to climb a latter is frustrating when the skills are needed in levels long before you unlock them! I'm not a huge fan of being forced to do a level multiple times because I didn't have the skill unlocked the first time. It does however add more skills to the game which really opens up what Spyro can do. \n\nThe third game, Year of the Dragon, is a mess. Moneybags is back and once again forcing you to pay to be able to continue the level/free a character. I like finding all the gems in a level so its never been an issue of having enough but its still frustrating. More importantly, this third entry doesn't know what it wants to be. You have to free other characters - and then you play as them. That would be fine but they all have different skills/abilities and there are a five of them:  Kangaroo, Monkey, Yeti, Dragonfly and Penguin! I just want to play as Spyro! Add in the fact that they have mini levels inside levels that force you to use these characters and some are very very different turning game play into a side scrawler or first person shooter and its just a weird tone shift. There is also the fact that the mini games have made a return and suddenly you're playing a skateboarding game all about tricks/skills and racing. That said, you can focus on the main game and the plot is fun. The third game feels easier than the first two, especially in terms of bosses.\n\nThe levels all shows completion percentage and you can teleport yourself into any level you've been in before to go back and try to 100% it. All three games have a special area or level you can access only if you 100% the game so if you're a completionist it will reward you for it.

Perhaps other people may disagree with me on this, but it just doesn't feel snappy enough for me to enjoy playing. \n\nI hate to say this, but this might be the worst remaster I've ever played. But despite all of the negatives, overall I'd say this an ok game. Not great, not terrible (as I've seen worse), just ok. So I don't regret playing this, I just wish it was polished up a little more.\n\nEdit: After a little more time with this, I have to say that the controls ended up being worse than I thought.

Not only was Spyro my childhood, as for many other players, but it was also always a very well-constructed game.  I would say it if a good fit for all ages, parents and children alike. The gameplay is relaxing, sometimes a little challenging, the worlds are vast and full of secrets, and the whole atmosphere is amazing. This pack includes a remaster of 3 different games, so there are dozens of hours of content even without replaying any level in any of the games. The semi-open world was ahead of its time and still keeps up to this day. You can choose which world/level you want to go to (with small limitations like areas accessible only after completing certain objectives), so the order in which you play them is largely up to you.\n\nI could give a different opinion on each of the games, but they would all be praising the games, both the originals and the remakes, for doing such a good job. Needless to say, stepping into those worlds again after about 20 years gave me a memorgasmic feeling, and that is the only way I can describe it. Everything felt the same and yet so new. It made me feel old, but in a good, melancholic way, seeing the game grow up along with us like this puts things in a new perspective. I relive my childhood through this game, as well as make new memories with it now.\n\nI never thought a game could impress me so much. I never thought I'd be able to feel Spyro again, almost through the eyes of a child like I used to, and yet I did. Although the originals didn't have flashy features and amazing graphics, back then I think we all saw those games like the remakes are now, it's incredible what imagination can do.

The game includes remastered versions of the first three Spyro games, complete with updated graphics, improved controls, and all of the charm and humor that made the original games so great.\n\nThe graphics in Spyro Reignited Trilogy are simply stunning. Every level is packed with detail and color, and the updated character designs and animations make Spyro and his friends look better than ever. The game also includes some fantastic new features, such as the ability to play as Spyro's friends in certain levels, which adds even more variety to the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay in Spyro Reignited Trilogy is just as fun and engaging as it was in the original games. The controls have been updated to feel more responsive and fluid, and the game includes a number of quality of life improvements that make it easier and more enjoyable to play. The game strikes a great balance between challenging and accessible, making it perfect for both new players and fans of the original games.\n\nThe only real downside to Spyro Reignited Trilogy is that it doesn't include any new content beyond the original three games. While the updated graphics and gameplay are certainly worth revisiting these classic games for, there isn't much here for players who have already played the originals to completion.\n\nOverall, Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a fantastic remaster of a classic game series. It's perfect for fans of the original games, as well as anyone who loves platformers and wants to experience some classic gaming goodness.

If Steam had at third option in the middle probably would the one I would choose for this.\n\n Spyro 1 is the real treasure is and with better visuals and camera control it\u00b4s more comfortable to play now than ever. 2 and 3 I feel they went overboard with mini-games and locked areas, a collectathon is fine, but a collectathon+metrovenian can become frustrating, particularly when axis-Y controllers can\u00b4t be changed for the controler. In general the game\u00b4s option do seem to have come directly from the late 90s, way to little options. The camera controls in all games are an improvement (except in some areas with fixxed cameras where it\u00b4s wonky at best), but other than that and visual stuff, most of the game it\u00b4s just the same, no particular extras. Some mini games in 2 and 3 have become easier, and others harder, but overall tons are very annoying. \n\nOverall it\u00b4s a good game, mostly because the old ones where good, not as good as some other platformers and with some misguided ideas, but still solid and pretty nostalgic.

Gnasty Gnorc (the G's are NOT silent*) is upset because the news downplayed how cool he is and now he's on a rampage. Gameplay & mechanically, I'd call this game pretty average by today's standards.\nYou've got some very tight platforming, two different attacks (charge & flame breath), a variety of 29 unique levels, and a -lot- of things to collect -- Gems, dragons, & eggs all scattered throughout the world.\n\nThe levels?? They're fantastic. They all have their own personality & varying complexities. Some of them make you think (*cough* Tree Tops), others make you race, and some you just want to explore. \n\nCompleting the game is quite simple and doesn't require too much involvement, however, the real fun is in getting 100% completion for that fun final stage. \n\nBy today's standards, there are some faults -- The boss fights aren't very unique or interesting & there isn't too much variety in the gameplay loop, but it's still a fantastic time.\n\n*The G's are actually silent\n\n----\n\nThen you've got Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage. The developers looked at Spyro 1 and thought \"What can we do to make this better?\" \n\nThe boss fights are better, the levels are better, they added more variety and engagement to the gameplay loop, they added little 'missions' & fun challenges within the stages to complete. \n\nThey've added swimming & climbing, and timed flights. They've added new attacks, and abilities, and so many new collectibles. They've also added some friends (like a cheetah!) and one particularly greedy NPC to spend your gems on. \n\nEverything about this game feels polished & praise-worthy. Above average by today's standards.\n\n---\n\nThen we've got Spyro: Year of the Dragon... This is where the devs go wild.\n\nThey all gather in a musty old board room around a big wooden table and someone says \"Spyro 2 was too good... How can we possibly make it any better?!\"\n\nAnd a year later... They do it... They actually make the game better...\n\n\"How?\" you ask....\n\nTHEY GIVE THE CHEETAH A SKATEBOARD.

The Spyro trilogy was the first set of games I played as a 6 year old in roughly 2003, and at that time we didn't have a 128kb memory card for my PS1, so every time I'd shut off my console I'd have to start from square one again. \n\nI like to think that if 6 year old me knew that 19 years later, I had gone back and completed the Spyro trilogy in it's full as a 25 year old adult, he'd be pretty dang stoked. Especially knowing that after all these years I've finally gotten my well deserved, and long awaited revenge on Mr. Moneybags.\n\nReplaying these games gave me an incomparable and indescribable flood of nostalgia that was definitely complimented by the modern graphics of the remastered version. The graphics made the game feel inviting and not so outdated, they were improved and different, but definitely not unrecognizable. There's also an 'enhanced' soundtrack, which was close enough to the original that I still remembered the sounds and notes from most of them which was a real treat.\n\nIf there was one thing I wish the game featured, it would be the option to toggle the graphics from the old models and newer ones. There were many points where I wish I could've been interacting with the old models of Hunter and Elora specifically, mostly during the skateboarding events, because those are what I was looking forward to and what stuck with me the most from when I was a kiddo.\n\nThank you for this lovely revival of one of my favorite childhood games. <3\n\nPlease bring back Ape Escape ;)", "timestamp_created": 1676531600, "timestamp_updated": 1676609515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132947132": {"recommendationid": "132947132", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970476244", "num_games_owned": 1054, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1677629182}, "language": "english", "review": "Remember games from the before time?

I can still play Banjo Kazooie today and feel challenged by it since you have to use your brain to get past obstacles a lot. In this game you never have to use your brain, you just have to scan the level for some obscure ledge you can jump on to access the secret areas. That's not fun, hidden object games are NOT fun, and all of the skill is just making these annoying glides that require insane precision to pull off. Except since the gliding is not nuanced in any way, a lot of it just comes down to luck if the game wants to register that you did in fact glide at the height of your jump. I can make long glides the second time if I mess up on the first try, but it's not like I did anything different. And that's the game's only real challenge is dealing with the floaty horrible controls or playing some mini-games which, lets be real with ourselves here, suck balls.

I loved 3D platformers when I was a kid, but sadly I never got to play the original Spyro games back in the day. Fortunately, thanks to this remaster I've been able to see what I missed out on. The devs have done a tremendous job of remastering the originals. The visuals are stunning, the gameplay is smooth, and the characters are all charming and eccentric.\n\nThe Reignited trilogy is also a very family-friendly set of games, ideal for kids or older players alike; there's something for everyone. In terms of gameplay, it's very much what you'd expect a 3D platformer to be - and truth be told, the style of gameplay is quite consistent across all three of the remastered titles, so it can get a bit repetitive after a while. But the games do try to throw in different mechanics from time to time, just to vary things up a little - such as levels where you switch to different characters with slightly different mechanics, or pilot vehicles such as boats, submarines, hovercraft, skateboards, and more.\n\nAltogether, it's a recommendation from me!", "timestamp_created": 1675434981, "timestamp_updated": 1675434981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51530611515045166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132118521": {"recommendationid": "132118521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962654403", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1651, "last_played": 1688567969}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it!\n100% nostalgic!", "timestamp_created": 1675423674, "timestamp_updated": 1675423674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132102240": {"recommendationid": "132102240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282955791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 991, "last_played": 1675431418}, "language": "english", "review": "i really like spyro it's my childhood but this remake is garbage the amount of glitches is unbelievable and the sucks controls and camera it's simply bad but i liked the game since i like spyro", "timestamp_created": 1675395966, "timestamp_updated": 1675395966, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479108631610870361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132065307": {"recommendationid": "132065307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116206018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1699747838}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1675348065, "timestamp_updated": 1675348065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132011403": {"recommendationid": "132011403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120261140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1700574374}, "language": "spanish", "review": "manteca\n", "timestamp_created": 1675269238, "timestamp_updated": 1675269238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131973017": {"recommendationid": "131973017", "author": {"steamid": "76561199139511027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 777, "last_played": 1678915467}, "language": "spanish", "review": "bastante divertido para rememorar viejos tiempos", "timestamp_created": 1675211871, "timestamp_updated": 1675211871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131962146": {"recommendationid": "131962146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362077807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1697132920}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok...I grew up with the Original Spyro Games and I did love them.

Mi recomendaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda no tocar los controles, aprende a jugar con los que trae el juego de base y no los cambies, yo cambi\u00e9 dos teclas y ya fue suficiente para tener alg\u00fan problema. Durante el Spyro 1 y el 2 todo fue bien, pero en el 3 hay unos niveles de Skate con turbo y el turbo no funcionaba pese a estar vinculado a una tecla que fuera de ese nivel si funcionaba, la \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n que encontr\u00e9 fue darle a restablecer los controles por defecto, hacer el nivel y al salir volver a ponerlos a mi gusto. \n\n2\u00ba La gran mayor\u00eda de los jefes son una chorrada, pero si te gusta hacer logros como a m\u00ed posiblemente pases un mal trago en el Spyro 2. Parece ser que a los Boses les han tocado la punter\u00eda y la inteligencia de los proyectiles ''guiados'' y algunos logros piden que completes el boss sin recibir da\u00f1o as\u00ed que sin hacer spoilers os recomiendo no daros de cabezazos y simplemente completar el juego, ya que en todos los Spyros puedes rehacer los combates y niveles y en concreto en el Spyro 2 completar el juego os dar\u00e1 una gran ayuda para este tipo de logros.\n\n3\u00ba Los Fp's. Es posible que en algunos niveles ve\u00e1is bugs o un comportamiento err\u00e1tico en alg\u00fan enemigo o mec\u00e1nica del juego, os recomiendo que si por ejemplo, un enemigo no hace X cosa y no pod\u00e9is continuar el nivel o hay un salto que est\u00e1is 100% seguros que se hace de una manera y a\u00fan haci\u00e9ndolo perfecto no lleg\u00e1is por muy poco, posiblemente la soluci\u00f3n la encontrar\u00e9is bajando los Fp's a 30. Lamentablemente este juego es un port de consolas a PC y por ello el juego est\u00e1 programado para funcionar a 30 fp's y al ponerlo a m\u00e1s pues es posible que el juego se rompa por alg\u00fan lado. A m\u00ed solo me ha pasado 2 veces en los tres juegos pero es posible que existan mas fallos que se solucionen de esta manera. \n\nPor todo lo dem\u00e1s, esta recomendaci\u00f3n la escribo despu\u00e9s de haberme sacado todos los logros tanto del propio juego como los de Steam as\u00ed que puedo decir con conocimiento de causa que me ha gustado esta resurrecci\u00f3n de una parte de mi infancia, dir\u00eda que es un 98% o 99% id\u00e9ntico al original lo cual me parece perfecto personalmente. \n\nEspero que lo disfruteis!", "timestamp_created": 1674654289, "timestamp_updated": 1674654366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597315430641174316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131502899": {"recommendationid": "131502899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059422262", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1674845618}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic stroll down memory lane, but with beautiful graphics.

FoV is locked and is way too low by default for a widescreen computer monitor. There are many bugs at high frame rates (above 50) that can make the game unplayable. In my case, setting the game to unlimited in the menu and adding an FPS limit of 120 on the Nvidia control panel seemed to fix the sliding and the softlock on Alpine Ridge, but results may vary. It's also failing to keep my cursor in my main monitor, forcing me to disable my second monitor if I want to play. The mismatch between vertical and horizontal mouse sensitivity when looking around can only be fixed through config files, but doing so merely shifts the problem to flying and swimming controls instead.\n\nAnother weird thing to note is that the game asks for a firewall exception which it doesn't need and causes a Steam process to access your microphone whenever it's running. There's a problem with loading times in the first game too, making them much slower than they need to be.\n\nYou can find some fixes and workarounds on PCGaminiki, but you shouldn't need to do all this shit just to play a game properly.

Rarity is pregnant with septuplets, and she\u2019s showing off her ten-month-pregnant body for Spike, who is the father. Spike is looking on with great interest, leaning back and leisurely jerking off while he enjoys the show. Before he can cum, Rarity climbs down and mounts him cowgirl, letting him orgasm inside her. Spike has a ridged dick with a tapered point, along with a thick, bulbous knot at the end. Rarity is modeling a navy and violet dress with a silver hem.\n\npart:2Rarity is pregnant again, this time with twelve foals. The compatibility and fertility of dragons and ponies is no longer in question, and the effects of which have been having an interesting effect on Rarity\u2019s body. Dragon magic has started to intermingle with her own, bonding her to Spike and allowing him to be of equal size to mate with him no matter how big he grows. Which is good, because Spike has started growing more and more as days past, the power of the Elements starting to affect him as well. Now with both of them growing larger by the day with no sign of stopping, they have one last romp on their old bed before they both outgrow it.\n\npart 3:A few years have passed. Rarity and Spike have continued to grow bigger and stronger, continuing to have more children as the Elements of Harmony infuse them with divine power. Here, Rarity is once more ten months pregnant with more foals than ever, but even as a giant in a state of advanced hyper pregnancy, she still like to go hunting for gems. Spike still helps with her gem hunting endeavors, mostly to make sure she\u2019s safe, but also as a bonding activity.\n \nHowever, being alone in such a beautiful and nostalgic place often leads to them feeling frisky\u2026 although considering their sex drives these days, they\u2019re pretty much always frisky.\n\npart 4:Here, Rarity is implementing a new form of magic allowing her to be impregnated while already pregnant. In moments, her packed-full womb will be swelling even bigger with freshly-conceived lives; all rapidly gestating to catch up with their \u2018older\u2019 siblings. Spike\u2019s orgasms are copious, but she won\u2019t be wasting a drop of his thick, virile seed\u2013it\u2019s all going inside for maximum results.\n\nSpike, who\u2019d intended to watch the process, can hardly contain himself. He can sense the spell working, and is now about two seconds from plunging back inside Rarity and knocking her up even more. His massive nuts are filled to the brim and aching, his dick is harder than ever, and he fully intends to knot her and pump her full; first doubling the baby count then quadrupling  then octupling \n\npart 5: Spike and Rarity, now ascended into gods of lust and sex and fuck 24/7 no breaks ever they don't want/need to take breaks so they just fucking and Spike keeps making  Rarity pregnant again again and again \nand they are now up to 10 to the power 10 to the power 10 to the power 10 to the power 10 to the power 56 babies but they want more and can have have more and now will surpass infinity \n\nElongated Spike starts fucking Rarity for all she is worth, ramming into her fast and furious until he finally bursts in her snatch with a belch, grunting and groaning. Rarity then starts fucking Spike for all she is worth until she eventually fucks Spike into eternal orgasmic bliss. Their bodies are a constant friction, like magnets that are pulled and stretched over a universal band, wrapped around each other, pulling them closer and closer, until finally they are fucking each other so hard that they are a fusion of both of their bodies.\n\nThe couple is joined together as one, each orgasm and impregnation coming together and creating a god in the form of lust and desire for each other. It will be a God-like fuck, fueled by the power of desire, sex, sex, fucking, and their godhood. The resulting deity will be more god than man, divine in all ways, full of infinite love and infinite lust for the ones who gave him power, which they didn\u2019t know but it doesn\u2019t matter. This new couple can have infinite fucking and fucking, and it will make them even stronger than they were before.\n\nThe offspring of such a god-like pair is known as an inter-imaging, being produced by god-like creatures who intermingle their godhood with human beings. In other words, the offspring of Spike and Rarity\u2019s inter-imaging will be intermingled with the spawn of Spike and Rarity.

It pains me to say it, but maybe get this on another platform if you don't mind the 30 FPS cap. Toys for Bob (or, most likely, Activision) did not and will not bother to fix what is most likely easy bug fixes tied to framerate and that's a shame. \n\nAs for the games, I think they're fine. The only nostalgia I have for these games is maybe the Second game (I vaguely remember the hockey game) and the opening area of the first game since it was a demo in Crash Warped. So really, these are relatively fresh on my gaming palette, and after it's all said and done, these games are a test of patience to complete. \n\nAs collectathons, each game has their own unique frustration: The first game has horrible gliding controls that make you commit or die; the second game has some real D-tier levels and trash boss fights; and the third game makes completion spotty with locked characters and a lazy distribution of gems. \n\nI ended up completing Spyro 1 and 2 relatively easily, but once I got to the third game the seams were beginning to break and by the fourth hub world I was ready to be done. I didn't hate this experience--and in fact, booting it up is a joy and the games look and sound wonderful, Toys for Bob is a great developer--but between the myriad of negative points and the poor, permanently buggy PC port that it is, I cannot recommend it unless you're hankering for nostalgia or just really don't care about the issues and can play around them.\n\nTL;DR - Spyro the Dragon: 7/10; Ripto's Rage: 7.5/10; Year of the Dragon: 6/10.

Things like Dragon Counter, guidebook, talismans ,fonts, and icons are polished to the point of being soulless. A similar comparison would be the visual change from Borderlands 2 to 3 where all the menus became more \"techy\" and thus losing the charm of the cartoony health bars.

when I was a kid until the Skylanders games I have played pretty much every title to come out.\n\nThere has been ups and downs with Spyro as a whole but when the reignited trilogy came out I was super happy to see Spyro return, upon completing the games and doing this review I am 100% happy with the results, I can't wait for a new Spyro title!\n\n---------------------------------\n           GAME REVIEW\n---------------------------------\n\n10/10 for graphics, the style works super well with Spyro and I have the official art of Spyro book which I have read through a few times and I enjoyed every part of it. \n\n9/10 engine, the game runs really well on my main pc rig but the steam deck doesn't like it as much, I understand that it is not as powerful but the engine has been notorious for having *some* performance issues, though overall it works really well\n\n10/10 gameplay remastered, this game is EXACTLY like how the original games ran and played, included many many quality of life additions such as the map and keeping consistent in abilities, adding on I like the skills, as I like to push my skills further.\n\nThere however was a few bugs I found, an example is clipping and

It's not even fair to compare it to Crash 1 in the same sense of \"oh it's more simple\". It's actually the simplicity that works really well here, unlike with Crash 1 where the levels are dumb too. Anyway, the remaster does a fantastic job remaking the old dragons and giving them actual character rather than \"recolor 15\" of the old days.\n\nSpyro 2 - Hot take, it's worse than 1! But not a bad one. It's not a \"step up\" in the same way Crash 2 is at all. It's more like a step up in an experimental way. When Spyro became a bit more complex. Certainly not bad, but has a lot more things holding it back than 1.\n\nSpyro 3 - Pretty solid overall. This is where the experimentation in 2 goes to find a proper game. Improved controls for new characters are also a plus in this remaster. In my opinion anyway. Very good and my second favorite of the three.\n\nAll three are very worth the playthrough or five. Despite the music being so-so. It's fitting for the stages, but it's not really as memorable as Crash. But the rest makes up for it I'd say.

This is one of the few games I could play again and again and not get tired of it. \n\nNot sure if its with age or perhaps with it being \"Reignited\" the controls are much smoother throughout the game compared to the original games. I will remark that parts of the game (looking at you Agent 9 in Dino Mines) are still just as challenging as the were in the original.\n\nI love how they revamped all of the graphics throughout the games, however, I did notice in the Haunted Tombs that the Egyptian headpieces looked to be meshed from the previous gen game instead of being updated.\n\nOverall, an amazing game, great for introducing children into the world of gaming.

This remaster does a great job in making that vision shine through, even if the original developers are not on board.\n\nThe graphics and music are top notch, bringing the original art style in a modern fashion that isn't too overboard but not too bland either. It's what the developers would have loved to do back on the PS1. I will say the voices are a mixed bag, as in some cases, they do just fine. I was expecting Tom Kenny to come back, as he did most of the trilogy and his voice was easy to modernize rather than Spyro 1's voice actor, a style that would have seemed out of place for this remaster. Some of the other voices are odd, such as some of the characters in the first level of Spyro 3. They just... don't seem right. A minor nitpick, but it doesn't affect the game overall.\n\nAs for the game itself, the level design and gameplay mechanics hold up very well. If you've played the originals, you'll have no problem knowing where every gem or egg is at. However, there are more glitches in this version than the originals. You really start to see the glitches when you get to the third game, as the mini-games such as the skateboarding races are a toss-up on whether you'll fail or not.\n\nOverall, while this does have some flaws, it's a great way to introduce a new player to the Spyro series, even if the quality of the games dipped from Year of the Dragon.\n\nHere's to hoping Activision will greenlight another sequel like they did with Crash 4.", "timestamp_created": 1670704242, "timestamp_updated": 1670810392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128267024": {"recommendationid": "128267024", "author": {"steamid": "76561199226850688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2635, "last_played": 1694926118}, "language": "english", "review": "Played these as a kid and loved them, reignited was a work of love.

Doors simply will not open unless you cap it to 30. If you set your framerate cap to 144, you will slide around and you cant actually reach the max jump height, making some parts impossible. Capping to 120 fps fixes the sliding. \nThe game also crashes frequently for some people, which I did not have thankfully. The game also has no true fullscreen, so when you rescue a dragon or any dialogue is on screen, your mouse will end up on your other monitor and  you might not be able to move because you clicked for fire breath, but in actuality you clicked your other monitor because the game doesnt have exclusive fullscreen. \nOf course, none of these bugs have been fixed and there hasnt been a single patch since this came out in 2019, because money is more important than a polished product, since toys for bob released this game and then activision forced them to work on call of duty, a VERY hard to make and highly complex game.

Every detail is a joy to see, the visuals are a testament to what can be done when people who truly love and care about a storied franchise are allowed to demonstrate their creativity and dedication to preserving the passion and spirit of the originals. The sound design, musical score and voice acting is all top notch and a faithful remastering of the original sound, music and dialog. The controls are just about perfect given the team at Toys for Bob had to work with control schemes two decades old and yet still work and work well. Only on occassion such as being underwater does the camera give me any issues. But even that one somewhat glaring problem does little to detract from the overall experience of an otherwise near flawless reimagining of one of the most beloved franchise trilogies of all time. This is Spyro done right and most important of all, this is Insomniac Studios being paid proper tribute in spite of the fact their studio name isn't featured. Toys for Bob are the kind of people that I can trust to handle remakes of these and other classic games of yore.\n\nThank you Toys for Bob.

It has its fair share of faults, but is still full of charm and fun to play. Achievements Level: Easy.\n\nI played the original Spyro as a kid, so going back into this game and 100%ing it was a bit of a no-brainer for me. I think for the price it is it's absolutely worth getting, especially on sale. However, that doesn't mean it's not without its fair share of issues.\n\nThe game is plagued with lots of problems revolving around poor optimization for PCs. Higher framerates can hurt the gameplay or straight up softlock you from beating certain bosses. Cutscenes are choppy at times and the collision for ledges and enemies are pretty awkward. Spyro 3 has a skateboard race section and it's awful I hate it. Certain quality of life mechanics are added/taken away from game to game (Gem colors change between 1 and 2, 2 has a theater for rewatching cutscenes that isn't present for 1 or 3, 2's levels reset after leaving whereas 3s doesnt, etc), which is very odd to me given how much of the rest of it had been standardized. A lot of 3s side characters are very sluggish to control, especially on a controller.\n\nAs for the good, these games are absolutely gorgeous and full of life. Characters (especially in the first game) are very well animated and most of the humor is still great even if it's pretty childish. The gameplay for Spyro himself is very solid and thrives in its simplicity.\n\nSpyro 1 is short and sweet, I think it's still the best game in the package for me. It just has some great and memorable worlds, areas, and characters. Story is simple (which is the standard for all three games honestly) and the boss fights are laughably easy. Lots of secrets and challenges to find that the sequels just don't do as well imo. \n\nSpyro 2 has some pretty memorable hub worlds and levels, but replaying them can be a pain since they reset once you leave. The story is the most expansive in this trilogy, lots of cute cutscenes for each individual area and new characters with a lot more relevancy/presence than 3s. The boss fights, power ups, and 100% reward are very well done, easily the best of the trilogy. \n\nSpyro 3 was my least favorite, it was fun to play for the most part but largely forgettable. The new playable characters feel really bad to play with the exception of Spark and Agent 9 (on mouse and keyboard, at least), and they don't really serve a purpose to the game at large other than some diversity in gameplay. Each level loops around in some fashion, making it very easy to revisit each one and find missing special stages, gems, or eggs. Boss fights feel awkward and boring. The 100% reward is both very satisfying and very underwhelming, especially in comparison to 2s.\n\nAs for achievements, the game is very easy to 100%. Skill Point challenges don't have any related achievements, and neither does 100%ing Spyro 3 for some odd reason. Most achievements can be earned playing organically, with some special challenges like burning specific objects in certain levels.

I'm told that some of the control schemes (namely, the skateboarding stuff in \"Spyro: Year of the Dragon\") have gotten significantly worse than in the original games, but on the other hand, I've also heard that a couple of the bosses are waaaaaaaaaaay less difficult than their original, infamously OP versions, so it's a bit of a mixed bag. \n\nThey've replaced the primitive 3D graphics of the PlayStation 1 with unexpectedly beautiful graphics rendered in Unreal 4, which feels kinda like overkill, but undeniably makes the game absolutely gorgeous. \n\nThe stories may be shallow, especially \"Spyro the Dragon\", but the characters themselves are deeply endearing, and I loved taking part in their adventures. \n\nI won't lie, there are some VERY frustrating bits in this game, especially if you get bitten by the Completionist Bug like I did (I would certainly call 337% \"complete\" anyway), but patience, determination, and a little bit of luck and stubbornness will see you through. \n\nAll in all, this is a lovely update to some widely-beloved classics, and I'm tickled pink that I finally got to experience these games I missed in my childhood. If you like platformers, especially oldschool collect-a-thons with lots of minigames, I absolutely recommend the Spyro Reignited Trilogy... and hope that Toys for Bob cooks up some new Spyro content soon! :-)", "timestamp_created": 1665542432, "timestamp_updated": 1665542432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488165676593780518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123705387": {"recommendationid": "123705387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037589857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 5627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1669388117}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1665539859, "timestamp_updated": 1665539859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123704039": {"recommendationid": "123704039", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012096156", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1650311188}, "language": "english", "review": "woah that's that one guy from the Skylanders game", "timestamp_created": 1665537042, "timestamp_updated": 1665537042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123686466": {"recommendationid": "123686466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989256991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2879, "last_played": 1667942725}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing goty all years", "timestamp_created": 1665504710, "timestamp_updated": 1665504710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123660042": {"recommendationid": "123660042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097955653", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2254, "last_played": 1689562017}, "language": "english", "review": "complete this trilogy once a year started from PS1 > Ps2 > Switch > PC know this game so well could complete it blinfolded. nostalgia at its finest", "timestamp_created": 1665447772, "timestamp_updated": 1665447772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513743937015533447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123654719": {"recommendationid": "123654719", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186423299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1697498238}, "language": "english", "review": "YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE", "timestamp_created": 1665437087, "timestamp_updated": 1665437087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123635472": {"recommendationid": "123635472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392336921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1669590041}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the BEST remasters I have ever seen.

Spyro the Dragon is a game about freeing the Dragon Kingdom from the evil forces. The content is split between standard levels - where the objective is to collect all the gems (by defeating enemies, exploring and solving puzzles), free the imprisoned dragons and catch the thieves that have stolen the dragon eggs; flight levels - where the level is played as a free-flight dragon and the goal is to complete the 4 objectives as fast as possible; and boss levels - where you fight the boss in an arena. The later games also add mini-games on top of this, as well as other characters.\n\nThe PC port is a little rough around the edges, particularly if you play it on a controller. Steam fortunately has good controller remapping support, allowing you to for example increase the joystick sensitivity, which is not possible in game.\n\nThere is also something to be said about the remaster losing some of the charm the original had. I agree this is the case, but given the difficulty of playing the original games in a HD format I would say it is worth the trade off.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game(s).

Despite that, these were an incredibly fun experience, and while some facets of their design have grown over the years as game development has progressed, this return to form was incredibly touching even to someone who hadn't had the nostalgia. A gold standard in remastering, from the absolutely incredible art direction to the wonderful sound design. While the controls will take a bit to get used to, to those who are more used to more modern games, they come very naturally, very quickly.\n\nA few bugs here in the PC port, including a couple visual hiccups in animation (Spyro floating outside a balloon, mouth movements sometimes not playing) to ice-level-like physics everywhere when FPS is set at 144 or unlimited (Setting to 120 or lower fixed this for me without sacrificing much). Nothing gamebreaking, so far as I came across, though, so really only minor complaints. Weirdest bug or oversight is that the game will try to also launch SteamVR -- simply right-click your game, go to Properties, and in the launch options, enter \"-nohmd\" without quotations to fix this!\n\nLoved my time here.

To those who played them in the past, you'll find such love here that you shouldn't pass it up, and the huge leap in visual fidelity is worth your return to the dragon worlds. To those who also have kids now, this trilogy will absolutely delight them, too. I'm left desperately wishing for more.

Unfortunately, I think that comes at the cost of some inherit clunkiness that keeps this collection from being a must-play platformer. Although the level designs are gorgeous and have fun layouts to explore, they seem to call for a level of precision that your character doesn't posses. \n\nSpyro has a painfully wide turning radius that leads to constantly missing enemies during charges and falling off platforms when you simply meant to turn around. Exacerbating these sluggish controls are a jumps and glides that have incredibly tight tolerances. Whether I was going to make it to the next platform by a few centimetres or headbutt the side of it always felt like a guessing game. If Spyro was a more responsive character, I would chalk it up to \"git gud\", but when he has all the agility of a semi-truck, it's hard not to feel frustrated. \n\nAside from beautiful character and level design, there's just not much going on in Spyro Reignited. The story is threadbare, and combat boils down to headbutt/firebreath before the enemy can trade hits with you. That means the platforming has to carry a lot of weight here, and I simply don't think the controls are up to the task.

It really reignited my memories of playing Spyro on my PS1 a while ago. The games are the same, except that the sound effects and soundtrack are improved and the graphics are brand new.

It's evident that they dedicated a lot of time to create their concepts and sometimes the dragon just say \"thank you\" and fly away. But talking more about the games: the 1st one is nice and the dragons are cool; the 2nd one, I think is the best, because there are some new game mechanics, the storyline is more cohesive, the main antagonist has a lot of personality and I like the level designs and soundtrack on this one better; the 3rd is my least favorite because the story on this one is too childish to my taste, with a lot of irony and some romantic interest among characters, and there are new playable characters that don't do much and are not nearly charismatic as Spyro is. In general, the three games are not hard for curious completionists, and, once again, the second one is my favorite under this aspect because it is better designed and more challenging.

The thickness comes the excess amount of fat that the dragon\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t expel normally by other means. So, it\u2019s fattier. Any culinary chef will tell you that \u201cfat carries the flavour.\u201d When they say this, they mean things like oil, butter, and animal fat. Fattier cuts of meat are usually more flavourful than lean cuts.\nThis applies to dragon semen. Human semen tastes like sea water that is slightly expired, whereas dragon semen tastes like a whole buffet that could force Michelin to re-establish their star rating system.\nIt\u2019s like an orgasm for your taste buds.\nImagine 69\u2019ing your dragon boyfriend, and a few seconds after you finish, so does he. This heavenly, thick, delicious syrup fills your mouth, and you instantly orgasm throughout your entire body. You\u2019re immediately horny again. Thankfully, dragons don\u2019t really have a refractory period, so he\u2019s ready for round two. Then three. Before you know it, you\u2019ve both came a few gallons in total (mostly his work), and it\u2019s a full thirty hours since you stared. You\u2019re not even hungry or thirsty, because his semen has enough nutrients to keep you well fed and fully nourished.\nScientifically, since it\u2019s warmer, it should be thinner than human semen because viscosity decreases with temperature. (Try this out with olive oil in a pan! Heat it up, and it will spread out by itself) However, the presence of the extra fat in the semen keeps it nice and thick.\nIt\u2019s extremely satisfying to play with. It\u2019s like that corn-starch and water experiment you did in 4th grade. It\u2019s somewhat like melted caramel. Furthermore, it coheres to itself well. If you stick a finger in a puddle of dragon semen and drag it from the centre to away from the corner, you can observe a large amount sticking to your finger.\nThe chemical composition of dragon semen not only serves as an aphrodisiac, but it also heightens the sensitivity of C-tactile neurons, or CT nerves. CT nerves serve to give pleasure to a human when they are gently stroked. These neurons fire slowly than others, but dragon semen acts like a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the chemical reactions that take place when these neurons fire. A catalyst speeds up the reaction of a chemical reaction.\nSo after a dragon covers your entire GI tract with a single sploog, he\u2019ll slow down, slowly thrusting his penis back and forth inside you. This is extremely pleasurable. His semen will heighten the sensation of his penis in you, or at least your pleasure from doing so. It feels bigger, longer, and warmer.\nBack to the taste.\nThe taste depends on the dragon\u2019s diet. The smaller, sleeker dragons of the North Forest like to eat fruit. So, their semen is naturally sweeter than you would expect. It tastes like mango covered in salted caramel.\nIf it\u2019s an ice dragon, the semen tends to be much more flavourful because they like to eat seals. However, since it\u2019s you know... an ice dragon, the semen is very cold, almost growing a few frozen semen crystals if you leave it in the snow for too long. There is a solution, though. You can just microwave a large mug and drink it later. Or, you can intentionally leave the semen in the snow, let it half-freeze, and enjoy a chewy treat! It\u2019s like taffy!\nTheoretically, a human can fully survive on a diet of just dragon semen, supplied from just one dragon.\nDragons can produce about three gallons of semen in a single day. It really depends mostly on their size.\nIn a single sploog, they can produce about four to eight cups of the stuff. Dragon ejaculations tend to last between fifteen to twenty seconds, coming out in bursts and spurts that get slightly weaker each time. If a dragon\u2019s semen in your ass, you will certainly feel this effect. It\u2019s like getting a massage internally, again, only 300 times better.", "timestamp_created": 1662466664, "timestamp_updated": 1663432260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121806624": {"recommendationid": "121806624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152576155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2377, "last_played": 1668739075}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, I think I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a lighthearted plaformer.

I already completed the Reignited Trilogy on the Switch a couple years ago but decided to double-dip during the $14 sale going on until September 5th 2022, so who could pass up that deal? Plus, I've always wanting to own the Spyro Reignited Trilogy on my PC.\n\nSpyro 1 is the first and has those examples of \"Early Installment Weirdness\" since Spyro can't hover, the Hub worlds are lethal, the bosses are HARDLY considered bosses. If I can explain it clear, the \"bosses\" in Spyro 1 more resemble bigger stage enemies. Nothing about them feel like bosses...the music doesn't change, there's no pre-cutscene, there's no HP meter, they're more stage obstacles that need to be defeated especially \"Blowhard\" since you flame him throughout the stage rather than a one-on-one battle. Toasty's design is amazing though, really love the Reignited Trilogy's redesign on him. One stage that stands out is Dark Hollow. I loved it in the original game, BUT I love it even more in this remake since they added it to become a library. This game can take 5-6 hours to finish. If you're a marathon player, maybe even faster.\n\nSpyro 2: Ripto's Rage is the best game in my opinion out of the trilogy. It took aspects of the first game and improved upon them: giving Spyro a hover, new flight and breath abilities, swimming, headbashing, stage NPC's. The bosses are great too and all three of them are established from the very beginning as Crush, Gulp and Ripto, unlike the last game's main threat being Gnasty Gnorc and his nobody henchmen. There are stages you have to come back to when you've learned new abilities, but it evens out in a way where it is not that much of a hassle.\n\nThen last we have Spyro 3: Year of the Dragon, which people often view as the BEST game of the original trilogy. I disagree. Spyro 2 had that perfect balance of fleshing out the world and abilities of Spyro, but Spyro 3 adds too much. New characters, new gameplay styles such as skateboarding, boxing, tanks, PLENTY of backtracking... You can't complete each hub world and its stages in order. You have to go to the next hub world, finish the new chararacter's stage, go back and get all the side egg quests that were locked behind the new character wall and if you get too ahead, you can't do any of Hunter's missions until you defeat Scorch. Sparx is also added as a playable character and has the same issue of a new gameplay style and only being able to enter his stages if you defeated a boss or gotten enough eggs. Speedway stages also add races. It's like a step forward and a step back with the new characters and poorly developed bosses...which although actual bosses, seem to have Spyro 1 issues lacking identities since we get a small cutscene of Bianca or the Sorceror turning foot pawns or butterfly fodder as the bosses, unlike Crush and Gulp who were Ripto's minions from the beginning. What's even more insulting is Spyro doesn't even get a cutscene with the final boss, the Sorceror when the Reignited Trilogy could've fixed that and given one with her which the original game lacked. \n\nAnyways, I completed Spyro 3 on the Switch and as of this writing, am only 84% finished. Overall, Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a great experience and is a classic collect-a-thon.

At face value, Spyro is a repetitive collectathon. You go through every level collecting things. When you haven't collected enough, you have to backtrack and collect more. Levels are very small and enemies tend to fall into the category of \"use the first attack\" or \"use the second attack\" with variety in the form of \"wait until some character animation is over then attack\". \nThe controls and camera make running awkward and platforming clunky. Jumping puzzles are the worst.

trilog\u00eda me parece sencillamente magn\u00edfica, no voy a decir que no me la pille por nostalgia de jugar al 1 y a ver si por fin me lo terminaba, y no solo lo hice si no que lo exprim\u00ed al m\u00e1ximo y despu\u00e9s de eso fueron el 2 y el 3.\nSon juegos de plataformas 3D muy divertidos, con movimientos b\u00e1sicos pero que casan perfecto con el plataformeo. Jug\u00e1blemente son, por lo que he o\u00eddo, id\u00e9nticos a los originales salvo porque ahora podemos usar joystick para movernos y para la c\u00e1mara, cosa que no ten\u00edan los primeros mandos de PS1; yo puedo confirmar que por lo menos el primer juego es id\u00e9ntico a nivel jugable y ha envejecido muy bien.\nEl 1 me pareci\u00f3 el mejor, quiz\u00e1 sea por nostalgia pero me parece que es el que m\u00e1s personalidad tiene. Respecto al 2 y 3 evidentemente se centraron m\u00e1s en historia y NPC's cosa que no me parece mal pero que en ciertos momentos me parece que no pega con lo visto en el primer juego.\nVisualmente es precioso y han hecho un lavado de cara estupendo tanto a escenarios como a personajes.\n\nAhora voy con lo malo:\nLos tiempos de carga entre mundos son un poco largos (sobre todo en el 1) pero nada insoportable, nada comparado con lo que voy a decir a continuaci\u00f3n al menos...\nPara mi el peor ha sido el 3, y no porque sea un mal juego si no porque no pod\u00eda evitar tener la sensaci\u00f3n constante de que la hitbox no estaba tan bien pulida como en los otros dos, lo cual me extra\u00f1a much\u00edsimo porque a nivel t\u00e9cnico es a efectos pr\u00e1cticos el mismo juego dividido en 3 partes. Pero lo dicho, llamaradas que seg\u00fan el primer y segundo juego deber\u00edan dar pero no llegaban por poco en el tercero y tambi\u00e9n pasar por el borde del aro correspondiente en las pruebas de vuelo y que a veces cuente y a veces no, como digo, solo en el tercero. \nY bueno, lo peor para mi sin duda son los minijuegos de monopat\u00edn del tercer juego, quiz\u00e1 sea solo cosa m\u00eda pero os juro que no se a quien le pareci\u00f3 una buena idea poner a un dragoncito haciendo skate. En estos minijuegos es donde he notado m\u00e1s las hitbox rarunas y ademas para los aterrizajes te pide ser super preciso. Si no vas a conseguir todos los coleccionables pues te dar\u00e1 m\u00e1s igual, pero si quieres conseguirlo todo en el juego pues esto puede ser un autentico dolor de cabeza, por lo menos para mi lo fue.\n\nRespecto a bugs la verdad es que son casi inexistentes y digo casi porque hay uno que te vas a encontrar creo que obligatoriamente: En el primer juego, en el mundo ''Cresta Alpina'' llegar\u00e1 un momento en que no podr\u00e1s seguir el camino si juegas a 60 FPS, la soluci\u00f3n es bajarlo a 30, cosa que puedes hacer en cualquier momento. No es un gran dolor de cabeza sabiendo la soluci\u00f3n pero me parece feo que no lo arreglen.\n\nDicho todo esto, salvando las extra\u00f1as hitbox del 3 y los minijuegos de skate del mismo y ese \u00fanico bug importante estos juegos me parecen extremadamente disfrutables tanto si quieres rejugar los cl\u00e1sicos como si los quieres jugar por primera vez.", "timestamp_created": 1661813811, "timestamp_updated": 1662302945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121445179": {"recommendationid": "121445179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038313314", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "playtime_at_review": 750, "last_played": 1700410815}, "language": "english", "review": "Coming up to a 100% playthrough of the first game at 12 hours of gameplay, im at 85% currently. \nI have not played the other 2 games in the trilogy yet.\n\nThis was one of the very first games i ever played as a child so i am going to be biased.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW:\nFor a quick answer, this game is amazing and whether or not you have played this in the past, its a great game to pick up if you enjoy cartoony platformers.\n\nEverything in this game feels nostalgic to the original with the biggest changes to the game being, graphics, controls, and the art style of the dragons. Graphics are amazing, no high end system required. The controls feel completely different to the original ( Although you can choose the classic controls in the settings ). While the new control scheme feels so much better, it makes the gliding, parkour and enemies a TON easier to get around which might make the game too easy for some. There are still very tough levels with either controls though. The new dragons art style are overall great with some being a bit weird but there are SO many to find that it doesn't even concern you eventually. I havn't had encountered a single bug and i have explored every nook and cranny of world 1 - 5 on spyro 1.\n\nThis game is making me also want to buy the remastered Crash Bandicoot.

I knew it was meant for children, but many such games also appeal to adults. Spyro is not one of those.\n\nI imagine some people still love the simple gameplay. Some love the nostalgia. Some will enjoy this game with their children. I am none of the above. If you expect this game to be like Crash Bandicoot you will be disappointed.\n\nThat said, the game is beautiful, and ran smoothly on my rig (Ryzen 3100, 16GB RAM, RX 580 4GB). That is why I cannot give this remake a thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1661704276, "timestamp_updated": 1661704276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522481083869934082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121378107": {"recommendationid": "121378107", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228904087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1669384611}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un viaje al pasado :-)", "timestamp_created": 1661701958, "timestamp_updated": 1661701958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121377448": {"recommendationid": "121377448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239528838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1661954564}, "language": "english", "review": "I love these games, I already owned all 3 on the ps2, so when I saw them here I had to have them for my computer.
