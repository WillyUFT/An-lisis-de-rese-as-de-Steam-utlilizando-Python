It has a perfect combination of storytelling and character attachment, something so simple yet so complex, has been executed with no error - something you don't see much is games today. i have purchased every DLC possible and have replayed them too, which shows my adoration for this game. I can't go a day without it joining my daily thoughts and i often end up zoning out and pondering about the story line for sometimes hours at a time. I have this game as a favourite on steam for quite some time now, and have been questioned many times by friends.  This used to bother me, until i began thinking about those fuzzy felines and everything is okay once again. At this point, I feel as if the game matters more than my current friend group, and soon my family. I have cancelled many meetings and events with friends and family just so i can play this game and its DLC once more, and I have no regrets. I can not wrap my head around the fact that i used to think this game was repulsive, and a crime against humanity. However, after trying it as a \"joke\", i feel compelled to express my love toward it with absolute gratitude. One day, I hope to pass on and join my new feline family, wherever that may be. \n\nI also love the massive gay threesome that goes on, pretty hot. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1668378402, "timestamp_updated": 1668378402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125235168": {"recommendationid": "125235168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971697509", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 790, "last_played": 1668990089}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Yo Mr White!

[/h1]\nAlright, I'm not into novel games, but I've just sunk 10 hours into it non-stop. The story is an absolute treat that shocked me, intrigued me, gave me goose bumps, and pulled my heart strings more than once. It's in a league of its own. Please do not compare it to furry anime series out there, because you'll just end up thinking about [spoiler]Beastars[/spoiler], and we do not talk about [spoiler]Beastars[/spoiler]. Ever. Instead, i'd invite you to think back to wholesome furry comics of 2010s (Furpilled, Circles, Sequential Art, Better days, etc.). Different genre, same warm and fuzzy feeling of getting attached to your favorite characters. \n\nFolklore-wise, the game reminded me of the attempt Trese made to popularise Philipino folklore, but Nekojishi arguably did a way better job with Taiwanese myths and legends than that 'Edgefest' Netflix rolled out. \nThe plot is anime-worthy and, if serialized, would do wonders to the industry full of the same formulaic titles that don't know where to stop with OP characters, power inflation, primitive romance lines, and drawn-out emotional arcs. \n\nBut hey you're not here for an art critic's rant so go get yourself a furry husbando (or three!) already.  \n\n11/10 wholesome furry boyfriends. Cannot recommend it more. \n\nP.S. special thanks to James Somerton for mentioning Nekojishi in his video on Gay Representation in Video games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQNKEkrPEfI", "timestamp_created": 1659214127, "timestamp_updated": 1659214158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119744021": {"recommendationid": "119744021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237224334", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1631296390}, "language": "english", "review": "kawaii desu neeee ~ >w< furry kun so cute !!!", "timestamp_created": 1659160941, "timestamp_updated": 1659160941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119268974": {"recommendationid": "119268974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960786498", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1511686253}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not gay but this is pretty hot", "timestamp_created": 1658507863, "timestamp_updated": 1658507863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118995772": {"recommendationid": "118995772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198423008854", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1667798161}, "language": "english", "review": "games too good at making me cry", "timestamp_created": 1658124532, "timestamp_updated": 1667105714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118842722": {"recommendationid": "118842722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997816621", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 846, "last_played": 1685683812}, "language": "english", "review": "This game man...

I really fell in love with Likulau though. He is hot af, but I'm really a big fan of his growth at the end of the good endings he's a part of. Leopard cat also had some good growth at the end of the perfect ending, but he's otherwise kinda annoying in my eyes. And last but not least, Guardian Tiger, he really does all the work at holding the story together and is the MC's guide through it all. He's the only one of the three that takes the MC's wants into account, and is always his stout advocate.\n\nAll in all, this story was as educational as it was entertaining. I'm not one to make any extra effort to get achievements for any game, but this is one of the few games where it's actually kind of fun to try to get them all. Granted, I don't have many at all (because I'm really bad at getting achievements lol), but I had fun getting the ones that I do have :) \n\nI recommend this game strongly for anyone who likes/loves furries, and anyone who likes a fairly decent story line and world lore.", "timestamp_created": 1653916430, "timestamp_updated": 1653916430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568106293678283691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115880105": {"recommendationid": "115880105", "author": {"steamid": "76561199187945685", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1053, "last_played": 1652720975}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this visual novel so much that I cant stop thinking about it.

At initial glance I thought this visual novel would be fairly boring which is what stopped me from playing after getting 50 minutes into the story.  Giving this story another chance, however, I found out that this visual novel is more about living life instead of going on some journey selected by the user.  In a way, this visual novel is still a journey, but the journey is more about the sudden change in life the main character, Liao, goes through when he encounters three big cat spirits.\n\n[b]Art:[/b]  The art is absolutely wonderful!  A small issue of mine is how most of the animation is used with the same poses of the cat spirits a majority of the time.  They do make it more worth it with all the shots seen throughout the story and thrown into the gallery as you progress but it would've been nice to see some more poses instead of the ones mainly used with small changes like having the eyes close.\n\n[b]Music:[/b]  The music is also very good!  It's nothing extremely noteworthy but it's still of high quality.  None of the music in each of the scenes feel out of place and that greatly helps bring across the mood of the story as it progresses.\n\n[b]Story (SPOILERS AHEAD):[/b]  The story itself is fantastic!  While I'm not all that big on the slice of life genre I like how this story utilizes it.  All the characters have their own quirks which makes them all very memorable through each scene you play through.  There's a fair amount of good and bad endings that are nice.  I do find the whole [spoiler]doing romantic stuff to be able to possess your body stuff[/spoiler] to be odd, though I'm a bit used to it being here.  I, however, have a bit of an issue when it comes to the true ending of this game.  This ending, while it has the most positives, feels slightly bittersweet to me.  In this ending, [spoiler]Leopard Cat reveals that he has wanted to eat your soul the entire time you've been with him, simply because he thinks it will be delicious.  Liao, possessed by Guardian Tiger, is romantic to Leopard Cat as a means to stop him.  This action gives Leopard Cat more power as to become a better spirit.[/spoiler]  This ending bothers me since this character is definitely my favorite of the three, and the fact that [spoiler]his eyes aren't opened without being put in a romantic place[/spoiler] kinda bothers me.  Maybe I'll get more used to it over time or my feelings will change as I play through the epilogue DLC but I'd rather this ending be adjusted completely rather than having it be left as is.  Regardless, I still think this whole story works great within the slice of life genre.\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]  While I'm not huge on the true ending, I overall find this to be a well-crafted visual novel.  There are some other things I didn't point out like how there are several spelling and grammar errors throughout, but that's only because of how it was initially in a different language and I've seen this happen plenty of times to not mind.", "timestamp_created": 1628079300, "timestamp_updated": 1628097167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559961318969726563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96790275": {"recommendationid": "96790275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011581307", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1627892782}, "language": "english", "review": "So, first off: I'm a little older than the average Steam player, or VN consumer, so I was a little...  ...doubtful as to whether I'd like this or no.

I do wish that there was more full body sprites instead of the same few being flipped around for almost the entire game, but we do get cute reaction headshots next to their dialogue. \n\nHowever, while Nekojishi is light on content, that does not mean it's a relaxing cuddly affair. After the first in game week, this game gets heart wrenching and really makes that choice of who to go with way more complicated than expected. Every character is decently well written, with good comedic timing and well placed foreshadowing, and the immature sexual humour in the first half really undermines how emotionally fraught this game can be. \n\nI would recommend this game to people who like furry art and who want a VN with an intriguing plot, rather than an Otome that mostly focuses on racking up love points and earning kawaii girl pictures.", "timestamp_created": 1614930183, "timestamp_updated": 1663029032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87701269": {"recommendationid": "87701269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347876347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1680872001}, "language": "english", "review": "Very uwu", "timestamp_created": 1614649253, "timestamp_updated": 1614649253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87658654": {"recommendationid": "87658654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344788137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 627, "last_played": 1614684677}, "language": "english", "review": "likulau cry i cry\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1614591300, "timestamp_updated": 1614591300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87305054": {"recommendationid": "87305054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264339423", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1595731652}, "language": "english", "review": "*SCREAMS IN FURRY* yeah that just explains everything about this game. it's just an okay game i really wasn't a fan tbh. to me personally it felt a bit slow and harder to get through because i started to get bored. i am a huge fan of VN but this didn't hit it.

The characters are very detailed and cute, even though I'm not a furry or gay, I still loved the artstyle of this game. (If you're wondering, I like Shu Chi Senpai most lol) It adds a more casual feel when playing the game.\n\nSecondly, the interface and animations. It is well programmed and the buttons do what they are supposed to do, the little animations and sound effects that made the characters move when they are expressing emotion was spot on, adding to the cuteness of the game. It also helped the characters express their emotions better, even if they are just still images on the screen.\n\nThirdly, the story line. It is very well written, every ending brings an lasting impression. The way the story leads up to the ending is mostly very upbeat and entertaining and it really allowed the players to learn more about each character in the story, watching them grow and develope their own stories. I found in the process in playing this game, the life of the player character is actually quite normal (Well if you ignore that he has the power to see Guardian Cats, gods and spirits) He has his own university life, does whatever a normal person does. The way this normal life leads to the endings is very thrilling.\n\nNow, there are the endings themselves, I did not expect this game to give me such a lasting emotional impression. Every different ending of the story gave me a new insight and feel for the characters. What I didn't expect most is that the overwhelming amount of guilt and somberness the game has managed to express, now I know there are happy endings to the story, but some choices made were devastating for some of the characters in the game, especially to Lilaku and Shu Chi Senpai. The game makes you feel the guilt no matter what, not just when you make the choice, but at the endings as well. Now that's good writing!\n\n[b]Now, for the cons:[/b]\n\nI don't think I have much to say here, the game was very well made. From the graphics to the story, amazing. However, If I were to critisise one point of this game, I think the process of getting the different endings are too complicated, there are a lot of choices. You wouldn't know what choice you made wrong until it is too late. But that's just my opinion.\n\nHope you found my review helpful, leave a comment or a like :) It'll be much appreciated.\n", "timestamp_created": 1613106880, "timestamp_updated": 1613113729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63263702392578125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86277156": {"recommendationid": "86277156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161979152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1056, "last_played": 1612893446}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

game.

I was correct, many parts made me cry, some made me laugh, and almost all of them made me go \"I'm done, I give up!!!\" (in a good way)\n\nThe DLC could use some NSFW because as I was going through the online search of this game many say that there are NSFW CG's and sadly it's not on steam though I would like it to be on steam if possible. Many would love to have a NSFW DLC on steam and trust me on this one it would be super popular.\n\nThe VC DLC was a nice touch to add in and I love it but the sync on the audio to dialogue ratio could be a bit better for English but but it's okay since it was made in Mandarin first and not English so they get a small pass for that one. (Because I already know Mandarin and was too lazy to read it in Traditional)\n\nThe summer time expansion pack was really cute. it took a second for me to realise where the pack was and where it would be but it was I think a very cute, funny and tear jerking moment. I suggest [spoilers] To read up until the end of the convention on the expansion pack because after that on the choice you made during the convention doesn't affect the ending.

Nekojishi is a game makes you think a lot, forcing the player to re-evaluate their decisions through meaningful consequences. Selfless options can come to a loss in this game, as is true to real life. This game, in part, helped me be more outgoing in real life, showing me that you don't have to please everyone, and that the best way to have a positive impact on a lot of people's lives is to get out there and be yourself. While \"being yourself\" is a common clich\u00e9, this game subtly carries that message in a deep and personal way. \n\nIf you are looking for a quick and simple game with a shallow story, you'll be forced to look further. Nekojishi's emotionally complex and varied endings provide a deep connection to the world and story, displaying depth and character comparable to some of the greatest pieces of literature ever written. The first time I did a full playthrough of this game, the ending I was left with was heart-wrenchingly sad. It, along with a few other things, served as the catalyst for an emotional and philosophical following few nights, and I believe I came out a better man from it. This game has a few tragic endings, along with some more cheery ones to balance it, but all of them are beautifully constructed to leave lasting memories.\n\nThis game is so much more than some trashy furry yaoi game. It is accurate to real life in character, despite the mythical parts, and will bring out emotions you might not have ever experienced otherwise. \n\n10/10.

That was intense, heh. \n\nAt this point I did my first playthrough and I have to say, even though Furry is not exactly a fetish of mine - but still appealing, I fell in love with this virtual novel as soon as I saw the intro cinematic before the main menu even popped up.\n\nFirst I have to say that the english translation, as far as I can compare it to other VN's that originate from the east (And the fact that I'm no native english speaker as well, since I'm from Germany), is superb with only a hand full of errors that were barely noticeable. The characters are very adorable and likeable, even though a certain character obviously (and seemingly) having a crush on you right off the bat is a red flag for me, if you catch my drift. \n\nYou're being put into an impossible situation and I for myself constantly wondered how to go about it. The story is well written and the glossary is very helpful as well, teaching me some foreign culture I never even thought about. I've read many novels of not so professional writers (Chapters App), so I've experienced some pretty stereotypical formats. Just saying this because I'm not reading paperback - writers can't and shouldn't be compared in general. What I want to say is, that for me the plot was very refreshing and interesting and I only stopped because I had to pee or eat (And even then I've still kept reading while eating, heh.).\n\nFor something free of charge, this has been definitely worth my time and I'm going to explore the other routes as well. However, while I like to focus on the good things, I must say that even though it kept me going for like 4-5 hours for one playthrough on average speed, it's pretty short.\n\nLet me rephrase; I want more. I feel like the story has a lot of potential if being worked on and I understand that it's not as easy to create a visual novel. I'd try it myself, but I'm not good at programming, scripting or whatever needs to be done and I'm no visual artist either. I hope in the future there will be more of it, or more stuff like this. \n\nAnother thing that irked me a little was that I didn't get to know the side characters better and that there was really only one real crisis I had to go through, even if the situation in itself is a crisis.\n\nIn conclusion all I can say that this is a wonderful peace, furry or not. Very adorable, lightheaded and enjoyable. Please consider giving it a shot, you can't go wrong with this one.\n\n#TeamLeopard", "timestamp_created": 1600921264, "timestamp_updated": 1600921765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

procrastinating and help them out with something. On the surface level, it's a furry dating simulator, but beneath that layer is a clear celebration of Taiwanese culture, both Indigenous Austronesian and Han Chinese.\n\nThe story is interesting, well written for the most part, very comedic, and it touches on some themes and topics not often discussed in most other media. Visuals are pretty good, a lot of the background locations are actual places around Taiwan (you could use this game as a travel guide). Character designs are amazing, very appealing if you happen to be a gay furry, but also very relevant to what the characters represent. Sound design is okay, main theme is catchy, other songs in the game are also pretty good, but there's also a bunch of generic sounding VN music. Gameplay, well, it's a Visual Novel.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that any ending other than the perfect one is unsatisfying, and with a DLC and upcoming sequel, it makes you wonder why the other endings were included in the first place. If Nekojishi was a linear story or if it had handled branching paths in a better way, then it probably would have been perfect. Regardless, I still heavily recommend the game; It's cute, fun, you can learn a bit about other cultures, and it's free.\n\nAlso Likulau is best boy.", "timestamp_created": 1595837977, "timestamp_updated": 1595837977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756034672260284424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73320345": {"recommendationid": "73320345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218484611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1597023212}, "language": "english", "review": "great game. you date tony the tiger!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1595783609, "timestamp_updated": 1595783609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73286726": {"recommendationid": "73286726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075176475", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1676, "last_played": 1621027981}, "language": "english", "review": "I am simply in love with this game and the tiger...It made me cry, it made me smile and most importantly it made me care, especially for the tiger but for the other guys too, especially after multiple playthroughs.

It begins to fall apart when the tiger gets angry and Liao just accepts it. It begins to fall apart when you try to go on a date and a car hits you. It begins to fall apart when Shu Chi directly asks you a question that you have an answer to and it just... doesn't give you the options.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that this game has a penchant for contrived conflict that gets legitimately frustrating after a while. Some of the endings seem to be terrible just for the sake of being terrible, like \"hey you wanted to go on a DATE? in a BIG GAY GAME? fuck YOU!\" It gets old very, very quickly when the main character behaves almost exactly the way I wouldn't for the purpose of advancing the story. In fact, if you look at the list of possible endings, it goes something like \"bad bad good very sad sad sad good tragic tragic perfect,\" which is just plain not fun in my opinion. \n\nI wrote notes as I was playing through this, and one of the things I wrote is \"game will you get it through your thick skull that i want to see liao and shu chi have a happy and fulfilling life together.\" Other lines include \"i really don't like this false dilemma; it's not a dilemma if i've decided already,\" and \"this game has some real terrible endings; i've had two of them so far and neither was even remotely satisfying for any of the three characters.\"\n\nIf you want a sort of similar game that actually gets to the romance instead of dangling it in your face like a bunch of carrots (and then crashing a car into you), try Tennis Ace. It's just one guy making this story for three years, and even though it's incomplete, it's actually amazing, story-wise. It uses the visual novel format to its fullest extent and tells three compelling, not to mention lengthy, stories that don't end with a cheap tug at the heartstrings.

In a severe turn of events, however, this turned out to be one of the best stories I've ever had the pleasure of playing through. I've laughed as much as I have teared up playing this game, and connected with the characters more then I ever thought I could. Nekojishi is a tragic story as much as it is a fun one.This was supposed to be a joke game for me, but ended up being a game I'll recommend with full serious intent. If you're not going to read the rest of this review, let me say: Don't let the whole \"gay furry\" thing drive you away, this game much more then that.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nNekojishi, follows the story of Liao, a college student who just wants to make it through his ordinary life. This all changes when his third eye is opened and he can now see spirits and gods. With his third eye opened, Liao is dragged into a position where he must decide the future of three beast men.\nThis game starts off light hearted, but gets deep and serious fast. Your choices visually affect all the characters, and some choice can be the difference between life and death. The choices you'll need to make will feel hard, and most choices involve trading off something or come with consequences.\nThis game has a very deep narrative involving Taiwanese folklore. To help you with fully understanding everything Taiwanese, the game actually has a pretty in depth Glossary.

I've learned a lot from this game, and have actually been inspired to learn Chinese after playing.\n\n[h1]Characters/The Whole \"Same-sex romance\" Thing[/h1]\nSo here's a pretty nice starter. I walked into this game still pretty confident I was straight. I still enjoyed this game even though I walked in having no interest in same-sex romances. However, this game did spark a pretty big interest in such. This being the first same-sex romance game I've played, I don't think I've ever actually looked into whether I'm actually straight or not. Oh well, guess I'm Bisexual now or something. Thanks Likulau for making me gay or something like that. Anyways, back to a more serious tone...\nThe characters are VERY easy to connect to. Each have distinct personalities and ways of doing things. Getting connected to a character only to end up hurting them with a choice you needed to make is the hardest part of the game, but sometimes it needs to be done. These characters will be remembered for years to come.\nAlso, did I mention Likulau is the best kitty? Oh uhhhh...ahem, right, I'm still not done with this review.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe art in this game is amazing, and beat out a fair amount of even the paid visual novels out there. Everything is so detailed, the sprites even adjust to the lighting as you travel! There are a good deal of CGs in the game, and all look fantastic.\nThe UI looks fine, and is non-invasive.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe game has a pretty good sound track. Quite a few of the songs are variants of the game's main theme, but still all sound heavily unique. The songs don't burn out after countless hours of hearing them, which is great!\n\n[h1]Issues[/h1]\nThis game isn't perfect, but it's MOSTLY perfect. I had a hard time finding things to write here, but some issues include...\n-There are some spelling errors and typos in the english version. Given they are few and far in between, it's still worth mentioning.\n-DLC issues when playing in English, specifically the voice over. The game will read a few text boxes ahead at times, and moving on to the next text box before the voice over is done will result in silence until you catch up to the voice over.\n\nIn the end, I'd say just give the game a shot, regardless of your sexuality or interest in beast men/furries. If the three kitties don't hook you on the game, the powerful story and Taiwanese lore will.  Also, a tip on the DLC, the \"Sunny Day\" extra pack adds CGs to the main story as well, so I'd recommend getting it before you're finished with the main story.", "timestamp_created": 1582355729, "timestamp_updated": 1582355729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73167884349822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63899088": {"recommendationid": "63899088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073971489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1605803552}, "language": "english", "review": "its quite gay!\n", "timestamp_created": 1582325513, "timestamp_updated": 1582348327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509584963321685791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63660753": {"recommendationid": "63660753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085898827", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1671300267}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has pulled at my heart-strings and its really well-done <3.

I like visual novels and this was free and had some gorgeous looking art, so I was down to give it a try even though it clearly is meant to appeal to furries. I have seen plenty of furry stuff in my time, being a denizen of the internet, so it didn't feel weird to me and I could just think of them as magical spirits, like the game implies. If you're someone who also isn't a furry but likes visual novels, I would suggest giving this a try anyway, unless you're uninterested in reading a story about a boy who is sexually attracted to cat spirits, which, I can't really blame you. From here on I'm going to continue on about why I like this story.\n\nAs a story, I found this fascinating. Not only does it explore a culture I knew next to nothing about (I have learned a lot!), but as I said before the artist involved does better art than some on the $60 visual novels I see out there. There is a lot of content, it's not a short little thing, and while it does spend time doing cutesy anime tropes like hot springs and uwu I like them but I shouldn't, the core of the story is actually a very difficult decision the main character has to make about his life. At the start it is played up for laughs a bit, but as time goes on, each spirit becomes more desperate for the protagonist's help. Each one NEEDS the protagonist for one reason or another, and the writing exploring this is very grounded and serious. I found myself truly struggling with what i would do. Each one is trying their hardest and saying no to any of them is devastating (I don't want to spoil the specifics of their situations, learning the depth of their problems is part of the joy of reading). \n\nThere are plenty of dating sims games I've played that have been air-headed fan service with characters whose existence serves no purpose other than to fantasize having them as your waifu. I expected this to be the same but was instead drawn into the writing completely. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of fan service. This may be a hard game to play if you have no attraction to men. Still, even that aspect is analyzed by the story. The protagonist is even chastized for objectifying them at one point, instead of focusing on his decision! The fact that they are spirits is also interestingly explored by myth and writing as well. I really do love what they do with the world building they establish.\n\nI'm starting to ramble, but I hope my review gets someone who might ot have tried to to give it a chance. It is well put together and written with weight and history.

I'd say it's good enough that it doesn't hurt to play. If you're a furry, gay or any demographic in which this type of game would appeal, I'd say you'd like it fine. If you're like me and just like animals in a mainstream way, you'll find some flaws. Quite plainly, it's a game meant to appeal to furries mainly and has a bit too much of anime romance cliches for my likely. Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it to some extent. \n\nThe biggest issue is that it seems very difficult to get different endings. I've tried to play this game multiple times on speed just to see what endings I could get. Getting with Tiger is the easiest, but otherwise I always ended up with no one or dying. Even when I supported one of the other characters 100% I didn't end up getting with them. If Tiger is not your favorite out of the cats, it's likely you'll get a somewhat disappointing ending your first time and if you weren't totally invested in the first place, it'll be doubly disappointing. \n\nThe pacing is very slow and there are only about 8-12 choices in a 5ish hour game.

Nekojishi just so happens to satisfy these attributes, especially for its visuals.  For a small Developer team, Team Nekojishi did a stunning job at the graphics and effects, and that is already seen with the Opening. Each and every character has details that match the etiquette of the culture that this story takes place in (Taiwan), and I\u2019m a huge fan of oriental themes and environments. There\u2019s a Gallery in the Menu options, too, which captures the most stunning pictures from the stories that you unlocked. It\u2019s a must-see when you attained all the endings!   \n\nThe story was nothing special, but was easy to understand/follow. You play as a character named Liao, who goes through the everyday life and struggles as a college student - with the addition of having 3 Guardian Tiger companions by his side. Here is where you choose who you can interact and eventually be with in the end (or even none), amidst the drama and decisions we make. I found Leopard Senpai\u2019s endings to be the most melancholic and character progressive, but to each their own. Other players would argue differently for who they like.  [spoiler]I love Guardian Tiger.[/spoiler]  \n\nMusic and audio were also decent and soothing. They had all the ingredients to any typical VN, where they merge with the environment, or special sounds being triggered based on your decisions in-game. The Opening song also was nice, albeit not too memorable.   \n\n A Limited edition pack also exists \u2026 which, I won\u2019t be downloading. It\u2019s limited for a reason, after all! Overall, Nekojishi was a blast.

I've paid for things that weren't nearly as good. \n\nThere are some grammar mistakes and a few typos, and if I had to give a major criticism to the story it's that it starts really slow. Painfully slow. Even fastforwarding through the beginning section takes a good while on replays; so make sure you create a save at that first choice to save on time. But after you're over the intro, where Liao is pretty repetitive, it really starts to hit it's stride. \n\nThere's a lot of really interesting things to the plot that I didn't really expect from the game. I really like the perfect ending, I feel it's a good balance of all the things the game wants to do and it accomplishes it pretty well. There's quite a few bitter sweet endings, and the bad endings are impactful in a good way. Nothing is too far out there that it's rough to sit through, or that ruins the whole game or characters on subsequent playthroughs. Even though it could have easily gone that way (as some other VN have done for me).\n\nThe Limited Edition patch is great, though I did actually find the Standard version of the perfect ending to be better in terms of plot. I'm not sure why they cut some of the parts out for the LE (explicit) version. I feel like some of the heartfelt dialog could've been adapted to the LE version just fine.\n\nGreat art, the music never got on my nerves, the zooms and movements of certain characters conveyed humor and drama really well given how limited the format can be. \n\nI do kind of wish there was a bit more side content though. Akin to Coming Out on Top having side dates, if Liao could've had a dream about Ragoo for example... or other side characters.

First thing I saw was the beautiful anime-like intro with beautiful voice singing the theme song and I already knew I'd love this game. Both the visuals and story of this masterpiece are simply amazing, and even though the furry concept of the characters might not be appealing to some audience, the story will surely keep them playing. All the folklore references are a big plus, because you both learn about the culture, and experience it yourself by going through all the dialogues with well-written characters. Game has multiple endings, and despise the fact that I haven't gotten them all, those I got really played on my emotions, and I believe other ones will too. Sadly, there is no perfect game. The biggest flaws of this one I've noticed so far, are bugged achievements, mismatched character icons with dialogues and the voice-acting in the DLC, which most of times lacks emotions and completely doesn't match the characters.

I admire it, and I think it's brave. I understand why the creator would want it to exist on a number of levels.\n\nI mean, yes, it's a heartwarming story that draws on cultural values, beliefs, and tenets so that's obvious, but more than that it's a thing of comfort for anyone who feels outside of the norm. As an actually autistic (diagnosed) person who has bodily dysphoria issues thanks to abuse (too many welts and dents to count), who enjoys escaping into stories of non-humans as a coping mechanism when things get too hard? Stuff like Nekojishi actually helps me. I know that's not something that many neurotypicals will be able to understand, but that's really how I feel.\n\nIf I had the guts, I'd love to do something like this but about my own culture. I'd love to tell a tale about the Wolves of Ossory (werewolves) and the Dreigiau (dragon spirits, upon which Western dragons were loosely based, though these ones aren't evil or greedy).\n\nI've been thinking about how I'd review this for a while because despite obviously being a gay doujin visual novel, it's... wholesome, it's got great characters, and it has a surprising amount of depth. I really enjoyed this. And on the darker days when I'm reading about stuff like the Judge Rotenberg Centre and forced autism \"cures\" which are effectively just torture, I'll turn to something comforting like Nekojishi to escape it all.\n\nI like fictional creatures, they can be whatever I want them to be and they're generally better than real people are, even at their worst moments. Even at their worst, there's a kindness to them that I find all too rare. Perhaps that's just something that I'm projecting, but it's something I could only project onto non-human characters as I've experienced so much abuse at the hands of neurotypicals.\n\nI liked this story, I liked how all issues are overcome with such kindness in the true ending. I appreciate that you shared this with all of us without asking for anything in return. I have since bought the DLC, the soundtrack, and some merch as I wanted to show my support but I really do appreciate the sentiment of offering it for free.\n\nThis is a really vulnerable position so I'm going to disable comments on this review because people can be bloody mean-spirited, but I just wanted to thank you for this and say how much I've enjoyed it and why.\n\nI may eventually regret posting this but there you go.", "timestamp_created": 1555162156, "timestamp_updated": 1555162156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855939149856567383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50088816": {"recommendationid": "50088816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083288121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1513927804}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a lil gay", "timestamp_created": 1555051181, "timestamp_updated": 1555051181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50061775": {"recommendationid": "50061775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205360992", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 940, "last_played": 1615572008}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved it so i decided to try translating it <3", "timestamp_created": 1554899278, "timestamp_updated": 1554899278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50055249": {"recommendationid": "50055249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055662844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1541722674}, "language": "english", "review": "All of the love interests are jerks.

The first day I saw this, I honestly thought it was gonna be low quality in many of it's features. But I honestly couldn't have been further from the truth. Nekojishi is a wonderful game that had my attention to the end. I mean just seeing how many hours I put into this game should make things clear of my appreciation for it. The story and plot don't come off as a dating sim, at least most of the time. It instead reads like a fantasy novel, which is my favorite kind of stories. In complete honesty, I cried at the first ending I made it to. It's so heartfelt and attaches you to each character like they really are developed from a real person. \n    The soundtrack helps with that emotional feel, making sure to let the mood of the setting become unmistakable and quite the tearjerker on many parts. The artwork and expressions were very well done, and the DLC did a wonderful job adding more to the art. The DLC (A Sunny Day) epilogue itself was just as nice as the main story despite it being much shorter. \n\n    Now despite all these wonderful pros, there were a couple flaws to the game in my opinion. The first one would have to be the language translation. I don't know how well it was in Chinese and the other languages, because unfortunately I don't know that many languages. But as for the English version, it's got many spelling errors, punctuation problems, and other grammar issues. It sometimes killed the mood for me, not to say it was entirely bad because it made me laugh a few times. I also noticed that the form of English that was translated was for UK. I laughed real hard at the times the characters used the words \"bloody\" (as in bloody hell), \"metro\" (for subway/train station), among a few other words. That's not necessarily a bad thing either, because it's not like there's anything wrong with UK English vs US, just wanted to point that part out. However, the grammar is a problem and probably should have been checked over when originally written. \n      Another problem was the steam achievements. I completely understand why they were all secret. It's a story rich game, it would be a lot less fun if you already knew how to get the achievements because it would just spoil a ton of the story. But my real issue is the actual achievements themselves. A good majority of them are near impossible to find because the likelihood you'd just stumble across a certain pattern of choices that would lead you to the achievement. And because the achievements are hidden, there would be no way to even guess how to get them. I played over 50 hours to get all the endings and artwork without using a guide. And once I saw what the other achievements were, it kinda made me feel a bit bad having to try getting them. Like having one character not have any affection for you, or having a brutal death. It's just better not to have those kind of achievements at all. Though the rest of them were pretty good.\nThis last complaint isn't much of a problem. It's about the audience. Not many people would probably wanna play as a homosexual boy with other male characters. \n**SPOILER ALERT** \nThe fact that the characters didn't have a fixed gender and only looked as the human viewer percieved, it seemed weird to me that there wasn't an option to have the characters female.\n**END OF SPOILER** \nI mean I understand why there wouldn't be an option to make the characters female, but I just thought I'd mention it, cause I thought it would be interesting and give a bigger audience. But as I said, it's not much of a problem, just a sort of side thought.\n\nThe other extra content was alright. The Nekojishi Voice, where they had voice actors for each of the character besides the one you viewed the story as. It wasn't bad, and I don't know how well the acting was because it wasn't in my language. But personally as an American, I'd was better without the Voice. I instead read it on my own and even voiced over as the characters myself, along with a few friends. We had much more fun doing that, but I still thought the actual voice actors did a fair job. I didn't buy the soundtrack, but I sometimes get tempted to because the music was so great for me. One of my friends have it and he loves listening to it all the time.\n\nOverall, I personally believe this game was amazing. It had a wonderful story, great soundtrack, lively characters, and the game is FREE. Like even if you're skeptical, you're not going to be wasting a single cent. There's nothing stopping you from getting it even if you're poor as heck. The main game is free, which makes it totally okay for the DLC stuff to cost money. Nekojishi has been one of my favorite story rich games and I one day plan on playing it again.", "timestamp_created": 1551562124, "timestamp_updated": 1551562124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49321029": {"recommendationid": "49321029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198430889640", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1561411509}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly i picked it up when i was searching for new games to play and saw that\ni was supposed to play it as a joke but now i fear that i'm a gay furry since i already clocked 5.5 hours in this", "timestamp_created": 1551553397, "timestamp_updated": 1551553397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49289995": {"recommendationid": "49289995", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995235026", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1551865959}, "language": "english", "review": "Buff cats that R ttly DTF. \n\nN1 China.", "timestamp_created": 1551419344, "timestamp_updated": 1551419344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49263592": {"recommendationid": "49263592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256944441", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1606029371}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Would become gay from hot cat gods again", "timestamp_created": 1551279052, "timestamp_updated": 1551279079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49196174": {"recommendationid": "49196174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000068857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1550954586}, "language": "english", "review": "why does my family guardian violate my butt is this even proper etiquette? did mushu do the same thing to mulan???", "timestamp_created": 1550954814, "timestamp_updated": 1550954814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535994768142700195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49182354": {"recommendationid": "49182354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118912984", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1550917805}, "language": "english", "review": "Gay", "timestamp_created": 1550917819, "timestamp_updated": 1550917819, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.234884262084960938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49063943": {"recommendationid": "49063943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027618583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 894, "last_played": 1604002988}, "language": "english", "review": "Yup, still good.

You know what I mean. Pick a guy and forget about the other ones, for the rest of the story. Fortunatly I was wrong and to avoid spoilers, I wont go into deatils here.\n\nThe characters are well writen, everyone has clear motives and acts on them. There is no cringy out of character dialouges, which is a big plus. The main character was a bit annoying sometimes, but since it is his character and he somehow needed to be like this for the story to progress this way, I m fine with it. The cats are all adorable in their own way and they all have an equal part in the story.\n\nMy main criticism is, that I would love to have more influence over the story with more then mostly two options to choose from (like in coming out on top)\n\nI also bought the DLC, which for itself didnt bring up very much new content, but since the main game is for free, I gladly payed for it.\n\nIn addition, since this is one of the few games, where we have a decent representation of gay men, if you are gay and want to have more games like these, but you are not into furries (as I would have said for myself, before I played this game), just give it a try and if you enjoy it, support the developers by buying the DLC.

I downloaded this because the art seemed fantastic and the plot was something I hadn't really heard before. \nI'm so sorry but even if this were a book the only reasonable thing to do with it is to use it as tinder.\nAt least it was free. I acknowledge that even if I personally did not like this game, it still must've taken a heap of time and work to do, and I respect that - I respect every single game maker and artist, whether it's music or drawing or cooking. This was just... A dish I did not like in a restaurant I should've known not to enter.\nIf you still wanna read my rant of \"criticism\":\nThe game itself was a disappointment. It shouldn't be called a game because there is nothing to play. There's no interaction whatsoever. You just click until your hand dislocates from the shoulder, and read until your eyes bleed. Also, who wrote this? A 13-year old girl probably, and I know that's a harsh thing to say, but I wrote stuff like this when I was 13. The flavor of it is just naive and worn out. It's new and fresh only to someone who themselves is new and fresh to anything like this. There is nothing original to the whole package, except for the art. The characters are carbon copies of everything that's a standard mold in anime, manga, manwha and the like.  Spoiler alert: there's a hunky kind manly dude, an athletic, quiet, mystic foreigner, and a talkative, optimistical, clinky uke type with a leaner body. All the 3 basic flavors of asian comic culture, no side dishes, no gimmicks, just... Nothing new under the sun. The main character is an annoying little brat who seems to go \"ahh~~ I shouldn't~~ but I kind of will~~ But I should'n~~\" \"kyaa you scared me~~\" \"you can't just-- !!! but I will do nothing about it if you do--!!!\" about just ANYTHING. Everything is a surprise to him and everything seems like the biggest decicion and... There's just not an ounce of originality to this.\nWasted my time, but good luck to anyone who loves stories like this, with characters like this.

Starting from a really nice intro, awesome music theme and on a really good drawings ending. I came here looking for a visual novel after trying out \"The Poisonous Fountain\" (Which I recommend as well) and I immediately got a mouthdrop. \nThe game has everything you could expect from a visual novel and much more. The characters are colourful, vibrant and differ from each other like fire and ice. And yet each of them is lovable and care about the main character in their own ways. I almost got into tears a few times when I had to say \"goodbye\" to some of them. There are a few unexpected plot twists really well woven into the main plot that cause emotions from happiness and serenity to anger and hate. And speaking of emotions, since the game is available on Steam, it focuses on romantic relationships, feelings and the way of expressing them rather than sexual content. The most lewd moments in the story include bathing together and french kissing so morality defenders should be satisfied. Out of journalistic duty I need to mention that there is a patch in the net that enriches the version with bed scenes, but you need to be adult (and gay or at least like such stuff since all avalable characters to interact with are furry males) to run it. \n\nPros:\n- grat story\n- wonderful music\n- unexpected twists\n- really good art / graphics\n- a glossary explaining some of south-asian culture and beliefs in an interesting and educatiing way\n\nCons:\n- some endings are really difficult to find\n- no female characters ( not visible at least, may be a problem to some but not me heh, he)\n\nGive it a try. Even if you're not into M/M relationships you will still find interesting and rewarding content. You may even learn something about relationships and how to deal with them. And if you really can't stand seeing two males in a romance, please take your cold, dead heart elsewhere as quoiting the character in another game \"you are a sad person and I have no desire to talk to you any longer\".\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1542394327, "timestamp_updated": 1542394327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

I was scrolling through Twitter when I saw someone talking about it. I watched what I believe to be one of the first trailers and got pretty excited because, well, let's be honest: it's already hard to find furry visual novels, let alone ones that are targeted to the male gay audience. Unfortunately, I was very busy with work, so I couldn't play it as soon as I wanted to. \n\nFast forward to today, with much more free time in my hands, I decide to give Nekojishi a try, since I postponed it for so long. I downloaded it from the official web site and got instantly hooked. I could not stop playing it! The opening, the way the characters are presented, their interactions, their dynamic together, the soundtrack, the CGs, the funny moments... just... wow. \n\nOne day later, I bought everything that's available on Steam. If you can afford to, I highly recommend buying at least the Chinese voice pack, as it greatly enhances the experience. Even though I don't speak Chinese, I believe the voice actors did a really good job in portraying the characters emotions. By the time the story got to its climax, I could feel like I was there with the characters. I wanted to hug them and tell them that everything was going to be okay. I won't spoil anything, but if you have a fragile heart like me, be prepared for a lot of twists. After finishing my first playthrough and getting one of Likulau's endings, I was devasted for the rest of day, not by the ending per se, as it was quite happy, but by all the events that led to it. It was surely a rollar coaster of emotions. \ud83d\ude29\n\nTo sum up, this game got a special place in my heart. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story. I wanted to thank the dev team for the amazing work, so I've decided to leave a review. Thank you very much! I'll definitely continue to support you guys in the future. \ud83d\ude0a", "timestamp_created": 1540528277, "timestamp_updated": 1540528277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Unlike me, I was playing this game with friends who weren't so fond of furries, and they kind of ruined my interest in the game. We were browsing through games and I saw this, all I could think in my head was: \"A FURRY DATING SIM????? GET THIS RIGHT NOW\", and so I got it, because why not.\nI feel like I just couldn't enjoy this game as much as I would of liked to because of the 'furries', or the tigers, leopards, etc, as they are stated in the game. Being called senpai and calling others senpai was kind of just awkward, and to me this game seemed a bit too pushed to seem like a normal dating sim. The game didn't even seem realistic in itself in the first place anyway. Literally the first option you have in the game is which of the three mains do you want to sleep with; like seriously, come on...\nI can't really decide whether to recommend it or not, but, all I can say is that the game was pretty boring to play.

The characters had excellent designs and although their personalities weren't entirely unique, the plots in which they followed become heaily intertwined.  \nOverall, I'd give this game an 8.5/10 for a visual novel.

But the game is so much more than that; it's got heart, with a story that's certainly going to make you feel for its characters regardless of the path you choose. The soundtrack also helps; man, I love the music in this visual novel.\n\nI will say that the romance aspect of the story isn't quite what I thought it would be. The game's got its cute moments, but the majority of it revolves around the lore of the game. However, I'd argue that the emphasis on folklore has an impact on the relationships you form with each of the love interests.\n\nThe plot is rather complicated, so I recommand familiarising yourself with the terminology you encounter on your journey. The game has a handy Glossary menu so you can refer to it whenver you need to refresh yourself on anything. I think the game's most enjoyable if you're expecting a good story to be told. There's a lot to wrap your head around (especially if, like me, you're walking into it having no knowledge of the folklore) but it makes for a better experience.\n\nSo all in all, I'd definitely recommend this.

This game has none of that. Does it have cute moments? Sure. Are the character designs nice? Yes. Was there actual knowledgable information in the game? Yes, but this game sucked the will to live right out of me and I didn't have the motivation to read the folklore sprinkled into the game.

And you can already see, I highly recommend it - even if you're not really into homosexual or furry content I'd recommend you give it a try. \nThe storyline has got some peaks you will always encounter in the same order but everything in between is up to your decisionmaking. Your choices matter - \"well, of course my choices matter, it's a Visual Novel\" you could say and I'd partly agree with you there BUT! - in this case I was kinda caught off-guard through my many playthroughs how impactful every single decision can be. Everytime you get to decide wether the protagonist does something it directly influences not even the way you get to the end of the story but even the end itself. Therefore you should try to play the story at least two to three times and every time, just take what you've learned about the protagonist and try to apply this in your next playthrough and you'll ultimately might end up in an end to the story that is not only quite longer than your average playthrough but also reveales a lot about the important characters, their motives, backgrounds and even feelings.\n\nThere are always moments in the story that give you somethign to think about, let you question not only the story or the fictional world you're playing through but also - like every good book or film should - makes you think about yourself. At least it did to me. If you immerse yourself in the Story you'll be able to question yourself and your decisions and this often left me in a brief state of - the fuck did just happen? - sometimes funny, sometimes awkward and sometimes even really depressing.\n\nAs I don't want to write a whole book about this game I think I'll just mention two other very neat features this game offers you: \n[olist]\n[*]The game comes with a very emotional and beatiful composed soundtrack and even an Opening song + video! How awesome is that? :D\n[*]This game uses a lot of words, names, places etc. that are just kept in the original language and provides a glossary that unlocks the entries describing the names, places, gods etc. as you progress through the game. But the thin that makes this actually awesome enough to mention it here is that, after I did some research and asked around at the university most of it is actually taken from the Taiwanese culture and mythology without changing much. Even basic principles are described one way or another without much missing or wrong information and that's actually a nice way to learn something you probably didn't know before.\n[/olist]\n\nOkay... so I guess everything else I could say at this point would take to much direct reference to the story and the characters which is the reason I'll just stop here and let you experience this game for your own. \nHere are just some good-to-know facts to help you get a short overview\n[list]\n[*]The game is a Visual Novel, containing not only a bunch of character sprites to show the speaking characters expressions while they are talking but also a lot of well sketched background images showing an approprite scenery to what's happening in your textbar most of the time.\n[*]It also contains some animated scenes and lots of impactful sound effects, helping you to immerse yourself.\n[*]Most of the characters are illustrated with even different types of clothing and expressions sometimes and characters present in a scene will be shown as long as they are there ( at least most of the time - I think I remember one scene where you're actually talking to someone but just got the background image but I couldn't recall where )\n[*]you can play with your controller - I thought this might be worth mentioning as I found playing visual novels with my controler while making yourself comfortable and get something nice to drink (no really, remember to drink enough while playing video games or reading books!!) very nice.\n\nAs a sidenote I'd like to mention that there is in fact a NSFW version for this game but I highly, HIGHLY recommend to play the standart(Steam) version of Nekojishi - I've made my walkthroughs in both versions and the latter gave so much more depth to the characters and their feelings. It could be considered an option to play through both but.. imo it's not worth it - except your out for the yiff, then, well, go ahead [spoiler] but please don't be too disappointed if the NSFW content is just not that satisfying because of story reasons^^[/spoiler]\n\nNow I hope you will have as much fun with Nekojishi as I had, because I definetly enjoyed this game. \nThanks for taking your time reading this and have a nice day :)", "timestamp_created": 1530538317, "timestamp_updated": 1530538368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607367992401123047", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43194296": {"recommendationid": "43194296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105819938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 2187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2187, "last_played": 1538831479}, "language": "english", "review": "truly the best game ever made", "timestamp_created": 1530383281, "timestamp_updated": 1696685309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.218181803822517395", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43183366": {"recommendationid": "43183366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839504523", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1529046343}, "language": "english", "review": "Before you start this game, make sure you have tissues nearby.

Tiger's story from the get go is he wants you to go back home to your family with him because low key he wants to show you why he is your Daddy~ now \n\nNext up is Clouded Leopard! I would love to say a few jokes about this guy but damn did this game beat me to the punch because after his first few lines you realize something is off and then it dawns on you that this guy is a retared. he doesn't understand anything, he talks really primitive, acts like a fly walking into a light, and is the most OVER POWERD PERSON IN THE ROOM, also he reads porny manga \"im more serprized the guy can even read\"\nLeopard is the reason you can now see gods and spirits why did he do that welp his get go story is his village is in danger and he needs you to be his Oracle so he can tell his people whats up thru you.\n\nLast is Leopard Cat aka Senpai! you maybe wondering why does this nerd get to be called Senpai well unlike the other two Leopard Cat is just like you and by that I mean this guy has a real body he has possessed your real senpai in hopes of pleasing you to help him with his story. Senpai Cat is this games Cuttie Pie~ character so he is really nice, people around him think he's hot and wanna date him, he is always trying to date you, he uses Uber, hes never cold, likes hats and loves to shop. \nSenpai Cat's get go story is that he is a Guardian Tiger from a failing timple he wants you to return with him to his timple so you can help him restore it as its new priest so its god doesn't fade away and Senpai Cat doesn't return to being a yaoguai\n\nIn Conclusion this game is great its writing is fun to read and the pacing doesn't feel slow. \u5bb6\u6709\u5927\u8c93 Nekojishi has a grand total of 12 endings and trust me if you play it once you are gonna wanna play it again for a better ending because Nekojishi likes its sad and dark endings \"like a normal anime!\" \nIf you dont like the ending you got but you dont wanna reread stuff you've already read the game has your back by giving you a butten that will blast you thru the game but will stop when it comes to something you haven't seen before making getting the other endings way more enjoyable to get.\n\u5bb6\u6709\u5927\u8c93 Nekojishi is a book and not originally written in English so for English readers you may find a out of place word once or twice in a chapter but nothing that will make reading the story difficult. \n\u5bb6\u6709\u5927\u8c93 Nekojishi is a really well made game compared to others like it \"especially furry based\" and its completely free other then the \"sunny day\" dlc and I feel that makes it one of the best Visual novel games on steam especially if you are a furry because this is a decent story first and FA bait second \n\nMy finale score for \u5bb6\u6709\u5927\u8c93 Nekojishi is 7/10 its a gay love story for furrys not everyone is gonna enjoy it but OOOH baby that kick ass opening anyone can jam out to.", "timestamp_created": 1528514782, "timestamp_updated": 1542906189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506578981876373291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42587458": {"recommendationid": "42587458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048148054", "num_games_owned": 1279, "num_reviews": 145, "playtime_forever": 25304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21978, "last_played": 1578100695}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Nekojishi[/b] is a gay visual novel which caught my attention pretty quick.\n\nThis and Coming Out On Top are the best visual novels in the area of LGBT that have ever been made imo and they both deserve more honor and fame.\nNekojishi includes a huge amount of emotions, alot of love you give the characters, alot of 'Nawww'-moments, just alot of everything.\nI love this game so much, I idled about 380 hours in it and actually planned on buying a body pillow from Likulau cuz husbando (<3), sadly they need about 2 months to bring them back on stock, so that's kind of sad.\n\nI just recommend you playing it if you like VN's and don't mind LGBT-stuff.

Also there are a few pieces of information that have yet to be concluded, does that mean there will be a continuation? I've played through the DLC, and yet, there are so many questions that still have yet to be answered. Regardless, this game is one of my favorite Dating Sims so far.

Tiene ha diferencia de muchos otros juegos de smuladores de citas logros o otras cosas y no te centra en un solo personaje si no que  todos importan y se tiene que tomar en cuenta tambien ya que es muy importante y a diferncia de la version para adultos este si tiene logros y hace que tenga que podamos rejugarlo muchisimas mas veces ya que los logros no son faciles despues de todos algunos de verdad son dificiles y que se tiene que mirar una guia a fuerzas pero eso no le quita cosas buenas al juego si no todo lo contrario a mi me encanta ese tipo de cosas y los perosnajes de este juego sin duda alguna para mi lo mejor que tienetodos tan carismatico, amables contigo, graciosos, recordables, para mi son perfectos cada uno con una motivacion y personalidades totalmente diferente pero los tres con un mismo destino y es conseguir la confianza y cari\u00f1o de nuestro protagonista haciendo escenas que son simplemente inolvidables, si juegas al juego te aseguro que no te arrepentiras claro si te gustan todo este tipo de cosas como los furries el ser gay o los gatitos :3 pero si no te gustan los felinos con este juego los terminaras amando y de forma literalmente.\nCosas buenas:\nMuy buen visual, muy tierno pero a la vez muy sexy\nBuen soundtrack\nExcelentisimos personajes muy carismaticos cada uno de ellos(mi favorito es Likulau <3)\nPara mi una buena historia\nLas escenas donde solo son imagenes tambien son muy bonitas\nLos personajes secundarios al igual carismatico y utiles\nFinales muy bonitos o tristes (si es verdad que algunos son parecidos, pero siempre cambia al de todas formas)\nCosas malas:\nLo menos me gusto y si lo hubieran hecho de otra manera le hubieran sacado mucho mas poencial al juego es que nustras decisiones cuentan mucho pero al mismo tiempo no cuentan demasiado :/, quiero decir nustras decisiones no puede cambiar los eventos oligatorios donde ocurre algo importante como por ejemplo:(SPOILERS)Una de las partes finales del juego donde nos ataca Likulau y nos salva Lin hu, no la podemos evitar de ninguna forma que importa que tengamos el 100% de amistad o felicidad con Likulau el siempre nos atacara, podrian haber hecho que dependiendo de nuestra felicidad con Likulau se arrepintiese de atacarnos y que al final no nos atacara pero solo es un ejemplo. Otro ejemplo es en las aguas termales donde esa secuencia no se puede evitar de ninguna forma y si pero ya que juegas al juego un par de veces esa parte por lo menos yo me la salto por que no conseguimos ni informacion de los personajes, ni historia , ni nada, solo una bonita imagen de los gatitos en las aguas termales, aqui pudieron haber hecho algo como decidir con  quien nos queriamos ba\u00f1ar... 7u7 o que dependiera de algo mas como felicidad o algun evento anterior, tambien que el la parte donde ven que van a comer elegir a quien a compa\u00f1ar para mirar la comida, etc.\nEn fin, mis casi 46 horas jugadas a este juego y las que se vienen por que para mi este ya esta en mi lista de juegos favoritos y en un puesto muy elevado Nekojishi SI lo recomiendo si eres un amante de la ternura, de los furries y eres gay por que si lo eres disfrutaras este juego sin medida alguna.

Words can't describe how goddamn good this has been made done. I got the good ending (and all endings) to leopard cat, and my godddddd. The final ending was a pain in the a** but you know what, I was able to look it up on youtube, THANK GOD for them. I can't thank this game enough. I seriously love this game, and might have plans to buy something off of this in the future. I literally been looking for the last ending to leopards route, and I finally found it. I was so amazed at how much work was done. I seriously, love this game. I in fact will be doing a review on it for a video. I heard there was a uncensored version, but when I'm a little older, I might play it. But for now, this game has me ALWAYS on edge, craving for more. It gives me ideas for my stories, yet it fills me with sadness for some of the endings. I love the artwork. I dearly love it. I think this game might be one of my favorite steam games. It's not my first favorite but it's my second favorite game, and probably will always be. I also had a friend play this game with me at my house 3 months ago I believe, and we both had such a good time while I voice acted the characters reading the dialogue for him. He said he wanted to take the leopard route and I asked him why, he says something about him being cheeky. But I think it was because of he knew there was going to be a bad ending but he knew he could change. I clearly do not regret my friends decision, and understood why he chose him. I would reccommend this game to anyone at the age of 14 or 16. Sure it does have some language, but the dialogue.... I'm only into games that have a storyline. But this... THIS GAME HAS MANY DIFFERENT PATHS!!! I'm both amazed. I'm also currently in the furry community. But for those who haven't tried this out, NEED TO. YES the endings are a pain to get, but trust me you'll definetly won't regret them. The endings are sooo good in my opinion. I hope to see more games like this from the creator.

Most visual novels these days have to be funny and have no emotion in them, but this game really makes it's characters loveable and their emotions can grow to point where it's impossible to choose who you want to go for. And with multiple endings, the player can go for each god, or kitten (I'm not a kitten!). The overall story arch devolps into one that I will cherish forever. Not to spoil anything, but most of the endings made me tear up a little (and I never do...) My only negative comment, is some of the english translation. It's not bad, it just took me out of the emotion for a second. For example, the word class transfered over to phone, which had me confused for a second, but never really took me out of the game.

MC is more likeable. i hated him.\n\ncharacters. gaurdian tiger was the best thing about this game for me. thats not saying much.. the others are pretty below average.\n\nstory. BORING AS HELL. no, hell is more interesting. at least its PHYSICAL pain. no, the story of this game was so boring that i only got three hours into the game before i droped it. NOTHING HAPPENED IN THOSE THREE HOURS. nothing dating sim like either! its just going out doing regular human stuff except with furries. you think that'd be interesting? you'd think that'd at least advance your relationships? NOPE. what youre eventually supposed to do from what i can tell is be a priest or oracle for one of the three cat bois. none of those options are good, and even Liao knows it. \n\nthe art. the art is fine. nothing wrong with how they drew the characters. BUT THIS GAME IS SUPER LAZY WHEN IT COMES TO EXPRESSING. ok. take doki doki for example. the characters all had different sprites to portray different emotions. and they were animated in a way that simulated action, even if it was minimal. this game? LOL WHAT EVEN IS A SPRITE XDDDDDDD. each character ONLY HAS ONE SPRITE, THEY ONLY BLINK, SOMETIMES. there IS a little face thing at the bottom left corner of the screen, but take this scene for example. GT and CL are mad at each other, so their sprites slowly but jerkingly move towards each other. this wouldf be fine if they didnt have such passive expressions! it really breaks the emersion when you have to look at the little cirlce at the bottom of the screen to see how theyre feeling. \n\nanother thing about the art. you spend so much time in one area, literal hours in a boring colorless apartment, talking to 3 cats that dont move EVER. they just blandly smile at you. jeez, the set up of the game is terrible. Not to mention there are no human sprites, even when youre talking to humans. wtf nekojishi.\n\nthe furry pandering is..... could it be high and low at the same time? Liao is always talking about how much he looooves them kitties but at the same time nothing really brings you closer to them, or at least nothing interesting. like at all. senpai does seem to wanna get the D but thats him, y'know? hes just annoying.\n\nso thats my review. in conclusion, this game is boring, lazy, and over all just not worth it, even if its free. dont get this game unless you want to sit through three hours of nothing just to see a furry's bare ass. which you can already see on the steam page, so dont waste your time. thanks for reading my review, i hope it was helpful.", "timestamp_created": 1526683768, "timestamp_updated": 1526683768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469370424747467041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42094313": {"recommendationid": "42094313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817827973", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1527381172}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

In any case, I would definitely recommend to anyone.\n\nEDIT: Yes, it may be gay, and some people may not like it, but it is so much more than sexuality, or even the actual basis behind what the narrator (Liao) does [i]sexually[/i] throughout the story. The story itself is written wel, and has a lot of content in it that pushes you to think twice about your choices. Furthermore, he best component for this game/visual novel is the amount of saves it has, so that you can save on decisions and navigate through different paths easier. Yes, I know many other visual novels have a save system likes this, but there are also [i]many[/i] who don't. All in all, I still stand behind my recommendation to anyone, especially those who love fantasy/folklore/mythology, or just a good story in general.\n\nP.S.

Just as a fair warning this review may or may not contain spoilers, but I will do my best to make sure I do not to let any of the MAJOR plot points slip out, so if you want to avoid any possible spoilers steer clear. Without further ado let's get down to it.\n\n[h1]Plot Summary[/h1]\nThe main plot of Nekojishi is somewhat linear and straight forward for the most part. You play and take the role of Liao; a young homosexual male college student ([spoiler]and furry[/spoiler]) who suddenly awakens to his hidden ability to see and communicate with spirits. However, these are not your typical spirits as they appear in the form of anthropomorphic animals. Now this game is obviously catered to a certain demographic and audience. If you're a furry and/or homosexual you're more than likely going to have a wet dream, if not then just take it for what it is with a grain of salt. But I digress. Along the line Liao is asked unfavorable requests from three feline spirits; his Guardian Tiger, Clouded Leopard, and Leopard Cat. [spoiler]These requests all require that Liao give up his college life and dreams, and become a Jitong/Oracle/Priest for one of the three cats[/spoiler]. As a result you are tasked with trying to find a way to appease these three feline spirits while trying to maintain your college life.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs usual with most Visual Novels there isn't a whole lot of gameplay to be had. For the most part it's the stereotypical pick choice A, B, or C and then something happens. From there the game goes on long bits of dialogue before you get to the next choice option to make, and by long dialogue I mean a reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally long . However; not all of the dialogue in the game is bland as it offers interesting flavor text as well as adding more to the personality and likability of the characters. In addition some choices do lead to a few good laughs here and there.\nAs is tradition with Visual Novels this game has various different endings pertaining to the three characters; Guardian Tiger, Clouded Leopard, and Leopard Cat. In total there are about 12 endings (some of which are almost similar). However, unlike most visual novels it is not as straightforward as you may think to get some of the endings ([spoiler]the True Ending being one of them, and most difficult to get to without a guide[/spoiler]). Most of the endings require that you make very specific choices at certain points during the story, as well as how well you treat each of the three cats individually or all together. All in all if you\u2019re going to jump into this thinking you can just romance one of the cats; sad to say, but you won\u2019t be able to get the full experience the developers want you to have. Now I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t romance just one of the cats, but rather there is a specific route the developers want you to take to get the full enjoyment of Nekojishi.\n\n[h1]Art and Music[/h1]\nThe visual aspect of Nekojishi is very appealing, it has a nice art style that is fluent and doesn't really stray far from its capabilities. However, the sprite work is somewhat lacking in regards to what most other visual novels are capable of. For the most part you will only see the same character sprites throughout the story with very little differences, save for a few facial expressions here and there. In order to compensate for this the character sprites move around the screen a few times to give a general idea of how the characters are interacting and behaving, be it with another character, their environment, or with what they are doing. In addition the bubble icon next to the dialogue window depicts facial expressions of the character talking which gives a better idea of how they are feeling.\nSprite work aside the CG\u2019s are easily the most impressionable thing out of Nekojishi, the style is very distinct, impactful, and is very eye catching. However that being said the unique distinction between the sprite work and the CG\u2019s does make a bit of a disconnect between the two. Because the artwork between the Sprites and the CG\u2019s are different by miles sometimes it makes the player wonder if they are even still playing the same game. But nevertheless both styles still keep true to the original design of the characters.\nAs for the music if was fairly nice. It didn't stray too far from the general feel of the Visual Novel and it did a nice job on delivering the mood of what was currently happening.\n\n[h1]The DLC/Epilogue[/h1]\nIn regards to the DLC epilogue, it was a little nice addition to the game. It gave a bit more content to the main story and was nice to see the characters develop even more. However, I was on the fence about the DLC  being a 1-2 hour long scenario (depending how long you take to read) that only has one choice option. The choice option really doesn't change much of what happens in the epilogue, but it does give more flavor text if you so choose to see them both before continuing on (but really you should be choosing them both anyway). The additional CGs that was included in the DLC was also a welcomed addition to the main story. It also gave much needed attention to the love scenes in the Public/Steam version of the game. However I really don\u2019t think the Epilogue DLC is worth the money by itself. So I went ahead and got the Bundle DLC that came with the Chinese Voice Acting and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. If you want to see the Epilogue and while getting your money's worth I highly recommend getting the Bundle pack. Sure it takes away from the charm of how the game originally started, but the voice acting does give a bit more depth to the characters in a way.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAll in all Nekojishi is a nice Visual Novel for what it is. It's a nice story with likable characters that all have their own strengths and faults, which also makes them likable to a certain degree. The supporting cast also adds more flavor when they are introduced over time and make the experience even more enjoyable. However, Nekojishi is still somewhat plagued with a few little grammatical errors here and there, but I was still able to enjoy it. Even the developers are doing their best to fix these errors which shows how much they care about their work. If you\u2019re a grammar nazi then you probably won\u2019t like this game; but like I said, take everything with a grain of salt. In regards to the Limited Version of the game, unless you are really thirsty for smut I highly recommend playing the Steam version over the Limited Version. The love scenes in the Steam version are more impactful in the feels department over the Limited version of Nekojishi. Overall a good story with lovable characters. I am looking forward to the continued development of Nekojishi as a whole.", "timestamp_created": 1524892266, "timestamp_updated": 1524972437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41720961": {"recommendationid": "41720961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021918837", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1595061917}, "language": "english", "review": "Before I start actually talking about this game, let me just point out that I have a major bias for furries. Although, if you don't like furries you probably aren't interested in this game.\n\nSo I haven't gotten through the whole game yet, but let me walk you through the general plot real quick. You play as a taiwanese college student named Tian Liao Lin. One day, you start seeing these three cat man. There's your guardian tiger, a clouded leapord, and a leapord cat. Now these people are gods and you're a jishi, which is like a religious spirit medium thing. Now, you have your own plans for life. You want to become a professional dancer, but each of these three cats want you to use your spirit medium powers to dedicate your life to their temple. So they basically become your friends while you decide which one to go with.\n\nNow, this game has three branches, one for each cat, each with multiple endings. I only went down the leopard-cat's branch (because oh my god is he adorable and like just my type) so I can't talk about the other branches.\n\nBut oh my god is it incredible. Beneath the cover of a furry dating sim, there's an amazing story and a ton of super interesting lore based around chinese and taiwanese culture. The ending I got was incredible with many different twists and stuff. It was a wild ride the whole way through.\n\nNow, I will point out that this is the SFW version, and there is a more explicit version with cat-men sex in it that you can find at the nekojishi website. In this version, all the sex scenes are just replaced with kissing, but it doesn't detract from the story at all. \n\nTL;DR: If you like cat-men, I cannot reccomend this enough. If you don't like cat-men, it's a very interesting view into taiwanese culture and still worth a read.

I found myself genuinely enjoying it. It's true that the game is somewhat text-heavy. As a slow reader it took me an *hour* to reach the first decision the game gives you. But the later decisions were more frequent (I think ^^).\n\nThe translation is overall good. Not perfect and there are some mistakes, but that's nothing I can't forgive in a free game. The art style is nice and the way they move around made me laugh more than once.\nThe story however and the background info the game gives you, that's where Nekojishi really shines. I learned so much about Taiwan folklore, hot springs or - surprisingly enough - even the struggles of unknown artists.\nThe 3 feline characters fighting over who of them will win the main protagonist have very distinct personalities. There's a silent one, a cheerful and a third with a fatherly side on him (\"dress well, it's cold today\"). They are interesting enough in their own way.\n\nAnother suprise was the playtime. I expected it to be much shorter. I've *paid* for digital novels/dating sims in the past that weren't even half as long as this one. The slow pace emphasizes the fact that relationships (and many other things) take time, effort and work to grow. Granted, for some people it may be a bit too slow paced.\n\nBut the content is always there. New things happen, new characters and locations appear.

I played the Limited Edition outside of Steam. I recently purchased it on Steam to play the DLC.\n\nYou'll notice I don't write many reviews. That's because I only write them when a game leaves a heavy impact on me. And this game has done just that. I have never played either a dating sim or a visual novel, so I don't have a whole lot to compare this to, honestly. All the same, I loved this game. Truth be told, I was lukewarm on it at first. Played for an hour or two, then put it away for months. I came back to it and go a little further and--what's this? Suddenly it's dragging me in, making me all emotional. Not something I was expecting. This game tugged at my heartstrings, each ending heartwarming, heartbreaking, or, sometimes, both.\n\nGayness aside, I actually enjoyed building relationships with the cats more than any lewd stuff. Seeing how simple decisions could drastically change the story or any of the cats behavior toward \"you,\" or Liao, whichever way you prefer to look at it. After I played as far as a couple endings, I couldn't stop. I had to see them all, so I just kept playing.\n\nIronically, I finished the final, true ending the day the DLC comes out. Just when I was desperate for more. Hooray!\n\nOnly cons I can see are: 1: English can be just a little off at times. Nothing significant--a duplicate word here, a typo there. A few things could be worded a little better. But really, it's a translation, and it's done quite well compared to most. I found it to be more than satisfactory.\n\n2: Too short. I understand the base game is free, but had I known how much I would love it, I gladly would've paid money for a longer story.

It's just that I was spenting a longer story than it was.\nThe only developed character is Senpai, he is more complex and the story practically focus a little more about him than the rest of the characters. Likulao is a good character too, I'm not gonna lie, but in the true route you won't have very chances to know more about him and I think that's kind contradictory when in the DLC looks like Liao knows everything that happen with him.\nI started loving Tiger Guardian when Nekojishi was a demo, but when I could know him I couldn't stand him! He's contradictory in everything he says, at the end of the story you can't understand him at all. \n\nThe story could have been better if it'd be longer, everything would have much sense and there's a lot of empty spaces even with the DLC.\n\nSomething else that I want to say, and this is about the DLC. Even so I like the game because the theme about taiwanse spirits is interesting and the Steam version is a lot better than the limited one, because the +18 are really excesed.\nBut this is a free game and a furry visual novel, there is a lot of furry visual novel that when they want to add something or fix something they just updated the game, for example Major/Minor. But putting a paid DLC so insignificance and without not so much meaning about the principal story is the worst. The only thing new about the DLC is the new outfits and the last part of the DLC for the story, is the only thing salvable. I just see this DLC an intent to make the story longer but without suceed. Even with this DLC you can get in the game new CGs but what the hell? For something like CGs they could just updated the game and done, there was NO necessary to spent money for something like that. They don't even need to put something like that when they gain money with the Nekojishi merchandise from their website.\n\nThat DLC is just a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend spent your money for that, you can live without that and you won't lose too much about the story. It's just an ambicious way to get more money about a furry game that got famous, that's all. It's not important at all. Don't make the same mistake as I.\n\nWith this I'm saying I don't hate the game, I like it.

BUT AT LEAST try.\n\nAlright, on to the review.\nSo I review with 5 subjects, Gameplay, Story, Art (Music and Graphics), Enjoyment and Innovation/Bonus. Let\u2019s start with game play.\n\nGameplay\nThis game... lacks in player control. I sometimes feel I go for long times without making a decision for the story and it gets boring. I can\u2019t take too much off in this category because the story is amazing, and that is the real draw to a dating sim, I go deeper into that later. So really the gameplay can\u2019t be given much merit because I also find that replaying many times (I go deeper into replaying in enjoyment) can get challenging when skipping through the text and suddenly the game stops so it can give me a full monologue where the words are slightly different then my other play through. Also, as I go into in enjoyment, a ton of the achievements are convoluted and hard to get because the game doesn\u2019t even tell you what they are. To get all the achievements, I had to resort to a guide, not something I\u2019m proud of but I had to do it. I give the gameplay a solid 0.9/2.0. Even with it\u2019s flaws it still provides a game I feel I interact just enough in to consider it a game and not just a novel.\n0.9\n\nStory\nWhere this game lacks in play, it heaps on the story! Throughout the game you learn more about the characters and the whole magical situation you\u2019re in. And the characters! On my original first play through, I didn\u2019t see the whole picture of the game and almost immediately brushed off the characters as archetypes that you would select to go on dates with. Boy was I wrong! Every character feels real and have actual emotions that effect how I felt as a player. Next thing on the chopping block; the world. The game actually sets up a world of magical beings that are all inspired by Chinese and Taiwanese culture which really makes the game feel authentic. Last thing, the concept, I originally downloaded and played this game as a joke, considering I didn\u2019t think I would enjoy a game with cat men in it, but as I kept playing I went looking for a reason to not like it, but I kept finding more things that I enjoyed. The story is quite pleasurable and makes me not want the game to end. This gets a good 1.9/2.0\n1.9\n\nArt\nI like to look at graphics and music separately each worth one point. The graphics are adorable and don\u2019t make me grimace the fact that I enjoy the cat people on screen, however, the full character models don\u2019t seem to have enough expressions and almost sit there most of the time while their emotions play out in the corner. The close ups when the model zooms in a bunch, the pixels are easy to see, so that\u2019s a minus. Still, the full pictures are adorable and I love them, but I wish there were more and that most of them weren\u2019t locked behind very specific endings. The art is respectable but easy to see the flaws\n0.6/1\nThe music is easily forgettable, but does provide a good background noise for when your playing, it does get repetitive when replaying, which gets annoying. The sound effects are perfectly timed and usually are used at appropriate times. I surprising enjoyed this game\u2019s music when I think about that\u2019s why it gets a 0.7/1.0 which makes the art have a 1.3/2.0\n1.3\n\nEnjoyment\nNever did I think I would enjoy a dating sim with cat people, but I sure did. I don\u2019t know what caught me, but this game continues to make me want to come back for more. I came back to it so many times I 100% completed it in 1 weekend. So yes, this game is highly addictive to the point where I can look past all the things that I didn\u2019t like  about replaying the game. But this is also the kind of game that leaves you with a lot in your stomach, knowing that there is no more you can do to squeeze the content out of this game, yet you still will want more. However, is this not the greatest king of game? Either way I enjoyed this game probably more than I should have. I can only give it a 2.0/2.0 on this one.\n2.0\n\nInnovation/Bonus\nThis is the category in which I award points for things I liked about the game that don\u2019t fall under anything else\n+0.3 Inspiration from Chinese and other cultures to create game world\n+0.2 Bringing me into a game genre that I would never have known before\n+0.3 A surprising depth to a game that seems like it was a concept before a story\n+0.1 Changed my opinion entirely from the start of the game\n+0.5 How could I forget? It\u2019s FREE\n+0.2 Charm\n+0.4 It made me feel actual emotions\nI don\u2019t have much more to say about the game without spoilers. So, I have to give this section a 2.0/2.0\n2.0\n\nConclusion\nGet this game. It is enjoyable to even the most hesitant, even though I critiqued the heck out of this game it has a charm I cannot shake off. I suggest completing this game all the way. So my final rating, with all the categories added up is...\n8.1/10.0\n(This is a good score, I am a very hard grader)\n\n-Adam\n", "timestamp_created": 1522027502, "timestamp_updated": 1522027502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697760403156280518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41011740": {"recommendationid": "41011740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818517761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 633, "last_played": 1564566952}, "language": "english", "review": "I found the characters appropriatly varied, and found that even though the protagonist was very clearly a furry it wasn't obnoxiously so and the writing was mostly kept non-fury specific apart from where appropriate rather then being super overdone. \n\nwith the variation of endings I found it very much did matter what I did in the game rather than my choices being meanigless. \n\nI also appreciated the glossary, and found it very useful for leaning about the mythology being referenced.", "timestamp_created": 1521883296, "timestamp_updated": 1521883296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514285683631896973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41006915": {"recommendationid": "41006915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067231278", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1538, "last_played": 1524529186}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly thought this was going to be another furry-bait dating simulator, but this has an amazing balance of story-telling and choice-making that it drives you forward to curiously want to know what all the possible outcomes are with each playthrough that you finish. And this game offers you several different endings for that reason. The characters each have an unique personality and backstory that makes the plot flow smooth and naturally as you progress, making it a very enjoyable read with every passing scene that you reach. It's amazing how many times the game went to such an unexpected twist from \"silly and goofy cat guys doing shenanigans for the sake of filler chapters\" to \"their lives are at stake because of you and the subtle choices you've made that progressed or stagnated their relationship and trust so far\". For some, the twists can be predictable and aren't as exceptionally exciting as you would expect, but for someone like me who was playing it in good faith and went through the story with a naive perspective, it can be enjoyable. They don't mention any topics that are too heavy or too complex that require precise and specific Shakespearian levels of intellectual reading to understand. The writing is simple, and anyone can read, play, and enjoy if they're looking for something light.\n\nSo if you like cat guys and a dating simulator who knows the balance of humor and drama, you should definitely give this one a try. If you're easily sentimental like me, it'll hurt. A lot. But it'll be something you're definitely not going to regret trying out.\n\nOnly critique is that unfortunately the MC is a big idiot, so good luck with that.", "timestamp_created": 1521861696, "timestamp_updated": 1582805462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40982915": {"recommendationid": "40982915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272366186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1521985194}, "language": "english", "review": "Not gay and played this for the jokes and honestly I dislike gays but this game got me hooked and now I feel mentaly damaged.

Though I can try~ Nekojishi is the first Visual Novel style of game that I've played, and while I'm no where near done with it, (I've only just gotten two achivements of the 23 as of writing this), but I love it to death. I think my main reason why I've been spending so much time playing it lately is because I'm still writhing from breaking up with my second boyfriend, and having time alone to immerse myself in a friendly and even somewhat familair, yet refreshing, time or place has allowed me to reflect on my feelings. I'll so ask my next boyfriend, whenever I find him, to play this game with me~ This is one of those games, using that term a little loosely, that you should play and talk about with others. Don't spoil anything, preferably! But, this is an experience that frankly DESERVES to be enjoyed. The music is beyond chilling, espeically when things get intense. I think the one thing that may disuade someone from playing NekoJishi is if they're straight, as the game is centered more towards a gay player, but even then, its more of a taste-kind of thing. My best friend is straight and I'm still joyfully reccomending this game to him. It's free, and it's unimaginably well done. The English translation is a little on the rough side every now and then, but I'm gracious and thankful that there IS an English translation at all! I haven't cried yet, but I've come darn close. Oh, also, if you find yourself with an errection/feelings of arrousal while playing, don't worry, you're not the only one~ Play this game, buy the soundtrack, and try to see if you can afford some of the merchandise!

Also reviews made it look like this was actually a PG-13 visual novel (it is--as long as you keep to the Steam version), which is important to me. I play VNs for the story and characters, and it can be tough to figure out if that's what you're getting sometimes :| I'm a PG-13, PG, or G kind of player.\n\nI expected it to be short and cute/fluffy. It is, in large part, but I *didn't* expect to learn a bunch about Taiwanese religion/folklore/spirituality and about Taiwanese ethnic groups and tensions. Which was awesome! I love unexpected cultural knowledge. There's even a glossary where you unlock new terms as you play.\n\nI was pleased to see that the fact one of the characters creeped me out was because he was actually intended to creep me out. A lot of the time, VNs will pass off a disturbing/emotionally clingy/brokenly needy character as 'cute,' and while there's some of that here, the character who comes off as creepy--is actually intentionally written as waving red flags, I think, given the way the story goes. And there's some nuance and twist in the \"perfect\" ending that I wasn't expecting.\n\nIt's *too wordy,* though. It really shouldn't be a 10-hour game, and with some editing for better pacing, it wouldn't be. There's a fast-forward feature, which does help a lot--but it also makes it clear how long some of the sections between choices actually are.\n\nOverall, don't be scared off by it. If you like cute art, bonus cultural knowledge, and a story that goes a little bit beyond the blandness of many VNs, give it a go. Slog through the first long stretch with no choices, and it gets more interactive. You'll probably need a walkthrough to get the final \"perfect\" ending, which gives you the most information on what's motivating all of the characters.", "timestamp_created": 1519512477, "timestamp_updated": 1519512512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537685632705688477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40345771": {"recommendationid": "40345771", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961743591", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1519446843}, "language": "english", "review": "I got big gay", "timestamp_created": 1519446966, "timestamp_updated": 1519446966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517786562442779541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40324535": {"recommendationid": "40324535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197635786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1615756494}, "language": "english", "review": "LIN-HU !1!!!!1!11! <3", "timestamp_created": 1519383153, "timestamp_updated": 1519383153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40319741": {"recommendationid": "40319741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209080265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1525070422}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este juego me engancho muchicimo, es un muy buen juego, tiene drama, tiene momentos tensos e incomodos y graciosos.

I've played a few VNs, enough to have a pretty good grasp on the concepts. They often lean either toward being a game and offering a lot of player choice, or an interactive multi-path story; Nekojishi was a bit different, in that it played out its own story without much player input, and also that it offered an... interesting set of circumstances where you were required to complete specific paths to get specific endings. Some may call it gameful, I could stretch to call it a chore. It was fun, at least.\n\nI managed to get 1/3 of the endings unintentionally while enjoying the story, and 2/3 (GT1-4, CL4, LC1-2) on purpose. At first, I wanted to see how interactive the endings were so I chose what I thought were the best answers, but these choices did not bear much fruit. Nekojishi forces you to replay to find each of the endings, and I feel like there's too much happening in the story and too many choices to have this few endings. If some of the paths were more lenient in your choices, it would be better. Additionally, some of the major plot points always happen regardless of the path you take, and sometimes it feels a little contrived.\n\nI do enjoy however, what the story seems to try and teach. No matter the ending except for the \"perfect\" one, can you make everyone happy. The three main paths you can take with the characters allude to family (Guardian Tiger), self (Leopard Cat), and responsibility (Clouded Leopard), in my judgement. I saw some people define it slightly differently, but that's what I got out of it. I think the story is interesting enough for these reasons alone, and even if it's not the most believeable story, it's certainly entertaining.\n\nI would recommend this to people that enjoy entertaining stories and mysteries, because after finishing the bad ends for LC I had more than a few questions that drove me to continue playing. If you don't care about the story and are just here for cute furry boys, the story will probably get in the way of that, in my opinion; but I'm not into any of the characters both physically and emotionally, so I can't speak on that. If you hate furries and the entire concept, you might still be able to enjoy the game if you like interesting stories. Otherwise, the story and characters are written well enough for a good few hours of free entertainment.\n\nI would [b]not[/b] recommend this if you want a more cookiecutter VN romance experience, and don't want a lot of story or exposition getting in the way of your bear bara ball busting. If you're fine with the story and want some boy butt bumping, you'll need to get the [i]Limited[/i] version from their store, but it's clear it was not the focus and the story suffers from it in that version; a lot of exposition and emotional writing is simply wiped out. And even then, there's not much additional content.\n\nConsider supporting the developers by buying the soundtrack or buying their game through their site, due to this overall being a quite high quality release. There are a few continuity, spelling, and grammar issues in the English translation at least, but they are few enough to be ignorable and don't really detract from the overall experience.

It's free, it's charming, it's funny and it's heart-warming.

Right off the bat, I wasn't disappointed with this game. It's easy to use with a PS4 controller which was how I navigated through it while binging through all of the endings for one specific character.\n\nAlthough I am disappointed it's not so much as a dating sim in the way of \"you end up with whomever you choose\" it's more a fate-deciding game when it comes to choosing how you will deal with your religion, your family, and three cat-god/spirits watching over you. (As well as approaching accepting your orientation, I suppose, and it was pretty great to find out this was basically an m/m dating sim.) I was super excited with every little twist and turn and surprising event in between and the characters alone (and all their art, ALL the art in general), so I generally can't recommend this enough.\n\nThere ARE a few spelling / grammatical errors but that's to be expect with a game that's being translated into English from another language.

Last, the Art of this game is so cute and very fit my kind of taste(Except NSFW...i don't know why I choose to play 18+ but wow. the sound.. I'm speechless hehe.HELP)\nWhen I first played this game I have no idea what it will be like and after \"dating\" senpai and got crushed emotionally and physically(WHYYYYYYY) I feel really empty inside and got depressed and sad, so I cried on my bad for 10 minutes...until I determined to get all other endings and say no to senpai... and after a while I finally got the grand finale(pss I said that NSFW isn't my taste but oh man, wow finally something good take that senpai. ;3c.\nsome negative thing about this game is really due to its religious background. it may be hard to understand the game sometime but dev did try to solve it by inserting a Wikipedia.  also, the translation could use some more improvement(even I can play the game with Chinese but hey it has English so why not.) and about the ending, it isn't bad but it's purely black and white means either you gonna be happy about it or just depressed about it. however, it's true that not every story has a happy ending and it even has an achievement about it.\n\n>I really liked the game but if you are not a FURRY and not GAY AF.

At first I was utterly confused but as I went along it gained that one aspect that I find most games lack these days: A connection. Sure, theres the appeal and attractiveness of said main characters, but I am meaning a deeper connection. For example, while the other two bickered and battled each other on a dayly basis, Likulau was just there, and was always there when the protagonist needed him to be, just helping him as best he could despite not understanding completely some scenarios. There were ups like the dancing session with him and downs such as when he started trying to take the power from Liao, but all in all the game developed a connection for me to the character specifically. This is just one playthrough from the limited edition, and I have yet to finish every ending, but as far, each one of the 3 felines has things that I can relate to and sympathise with. It's not a game for the unsympathetic or speedrunners the communities have generated today, and it is more a game where you look at the decisions you can make, and realise that unlike many games that have things work out for everyone, your decisions have consequences. And some of the decisions can kill you inside when you realise what you have done. All in all 10/10 for the execution and plotline, but 7/10 for some things like story flow, as sometimes thee dialog doesn't quite feel like it flows well about halfway into the game, but that is just me being a flow critique. 9.5/10 overall for this quite frankly great game that had me in literal tears at some points when I realised what I had done when I did something wrong and I couldn't fix it.", "timestamp_created": 1515583485, "timestamp_updated": 1515583485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50361943244934082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39221662": {"recommendationid": "39221662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171497801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1531808074}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, wish there were more like this.

Well , honestly i have a feeling to travel to Taiwan now , consider it as a goal for me in the future .\n\n- This game is FREE . I still can't believe it ...  I feel like voluntary to buy Nekojishi's products and donate and yes I did .  i think its worthy . Expect to purchase more from the Nekojishi's Store to support the DEV .\n\nOverall : 10/10 \nI love both Lin-Hu and Likulau , they definitely are kind of man to love that you are looking for , but if i have to choose one *shy*, definitely Lin-Hu ...\n\nIn addition , visit Nekojishi's wiki page : [url=http://nekojishi.wikia.com/wiki/Weekend_Show] http://nekojishi.wikia.com/wiki/Weekend_Show\t[/url]  to read the Weekend Show , see how Liao gets along with life when 3 Big Cats are around ( Weekend Show is also available on facebook , but in Chinese traditional language ) , translated in English so easy to read as well as you can find more information about the characters too . \nDone playing game , finished all the endings and found all Glossaries , achievements , what to do ?

Yet despite my thought, I was curious what it was about and the trailer actually hooked me up to try it especially the music, I would not mind buying the soundtrack of it to support the developers because this game is something. I'm not exaggerating by saying this but this might be my top visual novel game in 2017 (not the best game ever in 2017). What I mean is this game had left me in an emotional spiral plus the game Oneshot that I felt. When I heard the game Doki Doki Literature will have the same emotional tug that I felt I refuse to play it cause I heard it pulls your emotion so hard, though I will have an update of the review of what I think now Doki Doki Literature when I finish watching a LP. \n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nI absolutely love almost everything it presented this visual novel, the music, artstyle, characters and story very well written. Keep in mind yes it's still a yaoi game, but I guess it does not feel that is in your face type of game where the protagonist does a giggity move on the beastmen....weeell maybe senpai but don't worry the romance is subtle including the protagonist's lust for beastmen. I love the art style, the cultural setting which the game takes place in Taiwan, heck even their mythology are represented well even share a glossary book for people to learn some terms. The characters are pretty convincing even the protagonist has some form of realism to it, he is just a college student trying to have a normal life and three beastsmen shows up and stuff happens I can't spoil it. I know what you may be asking and yes why did I say this game pulls your heart around, well for one thing is because you'll get invested your characters more as you dive deeper into the story. Another thing is I can't tell you all of the plots as much as I really want to because I would ruin the experience for you. The only description I will make from this game, but only because to save you the heartache to perhaps prepare you for what is to come, but if you absolutely want to play it blind well go ahead and play it now. [spoiler]This game is depressing despite the cutesy look, maybe in hindsight I did not look at the glossary to put one and two together. The whole experience of the three beastmen at first was nice but it goes down deeper as you take different endings to see how it makes sense each ending represent the path you chose.[/spoiler]  I will say just for personal preference that if I have to pick the three beastmen base on looks, backstory and character I would choose 1.Clouded Leopard, 2.Leopard Cat/Senpai, and 3.Guardian Tiger.\n\n[h1]Wait this isn't right?[/h1]\n\nThis game may be a really great piece of work that I will give major kudos to the developers who made this game and hope they will continue their work in the future, but I encounter a common problem that visual novel games does and is spelling errors. They are easy to spot and sometimes can be a bit distracting. What is distracting that almost ruin the experience is some scenes plays out in the wrong moments, mainly in the 18+ patch.\n\nYes, I played the 18+ version of the game which here is a tip, please play the vanilla version because if you want to have a good experience story the vanilla plays the story better, if by playing with your *ahem* joystick then sure go ahead though I have an issue even on the vanilla version. The main is plot issue both the 18+ and the vanilla, though the 18+ is much worse in time placement on the \"juicy\" scenes. I know what you may be asking and not just because is an 18+ version, it does not mean to make the story less convincing to attach the characters. I have played Nekopara and other visual novels with 18+ patches for.....research, but this one is missing an important story element and is time placement. What I mean is, there are major scenes that play like you feel you should be taken serious but instead  it place the X-scene in an odd moment which ruins the moment and character of the protagonist...especially how the protagonist portrayed in some moments with the beastmen which makes me dislike him. It kills some moments and even made me uncomfortable of how some of the scenes play out instead of something that comes naturally like in Nekopara (you'll see what I mean if you decide to play that version.) It kills the mood and makes the protagonist less likable and makes you feel some wtf moments in times where it should not be placed in that scene atleast not yet. \n\nThe vanilla version brushes up the developement of the characters better especially the protagonist, though one ending still made me feel odd due to the atmosphere it gave out which I don't know if is me but if you find it please tell me if you agree with me on this. ([spoiler]is the true ending[/spoiler]) Perhaps is because the game trying to remind me is still a yaoi game but eh, it could have brushed it a bit better, the rest didn't affect me too much especially the ending it left me satisfied.\n\n[h1]Yay Forever Beastmen![/h1]\n\nThis game I enjoyed the experience it gave me and for how much it left me of an impact of it. This game deserves a 9/10 and for the 18+ 8/10, for a free game with good simple decision route though I will say some of the multiple endings are sort of tricky to find each ending. You will replay this game multiple times which will come somewhat tiring when hearing the same dialogue, but when opening a new path you will stop and enjoy some of the additional dialogue it adds to the story. I hope you will enjoy these few hours of reading as much as I do because at the end of this game you will start questioning your orientation........enjoy. >:)", "timestamp_created": 1513057244, "timestamp_updated": 1575149312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481751799583435059", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38248521": {"recommendationid": "38248521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427269922", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1525, "last_played": 1525294390}, "language": "english", "review": "Right now im sad cause i finished it. but any way i think its great and you did very well so i think you should  just add more artwork and paths with more endding.

I've already played through Ace Attorney, so I'm basically a visual novel professional, right? Not knowing what I was getting into, I downloaded this game (free for me at least) plus the additional \"18+ adult patch\" that was sent to me by my friend. I'm very mature AND an adult, if I do say so myself, so I thought the patch would be a great addition to my experience! Noticing some of the pictures & trailers on the steam page, I focused in on the fact that many of the tiger men were buff and dressed in particularly \"revealing\" attire! This is of no concern to me, however, for I have read through all 5 parts of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure! I thought \"maybe this will be something along the lines of Jojo but crossed with Tony the Tiger!\" I loved frosted flakes as a kid, so this was a HUGE upside for me.\n\nWhat I would soon discover is that these characters weren't merely JUST buff tiger men having some fun! They were furries! I already had my suspicions that some of my friends who recommended this to me were furries since they always seem to have profile pictures displaying anthropomorphic animals in seductive poses, but this was what opened my eyes completely to such a revelation! However, I don't know much about furries in the first place. Maybe they're just members of a friendly community that happens to adore animals! I have an adorable cat named \"oreo\", for example. In that case, I can absolutely see why they might like these types of games!\n\nPowering through many lines of dialogue I really couldn't due to being wired on \"Earl Gray Bergamot-Flavored Black Tea\", I eventually discovered that the scenes in this game were no ordinary display of friendship! These \"tony the tiger\" doppelgangers had sexually explicit relationships together! I couldn't believe my eyes, my purity was draining by the second! I'm already gay for Griffith from the hit manga \"Berserk\", but this was way too much for even me to handle! After force-closing my game just to get a grip on my sanity, I pondered for a bit. Is this what all those 'furries' on my steam friend list are getting into when I see them playing games like \"Amorous?\" It's just not right!\n\nI decided to do what was right for the whole Steam community! I reported my \"friend\" who recommended this game to me to Gaben himself and scheduled him a surprise therapy visit (I covered the expenses out of generosity)! You cannot do this to tigers! If I ever went to an arcade with a tiger, it'd surely rip into my jugular within 1.5 seconds, even if I was given a head start to run away from it!

Each choice contains weight to it and watching the reactions to the other characters based on each choice makes you want to replay the scenario later to see what happens when you choose differently. Not to mention the endings are emotional roller coasters that really play with your emotions, especially if you get one of the bad endings and makes you want to try for a better ending. The characters are memorable and enjoyable, leaving you with a sense of guilt anytime you disappoint one of them. The music is very well done and heavy amplifies the feeling in major scenes. Despite having heavy moods sometimes, it still manages to find appropriate times for moments meant to give you a chuckle and doesn't lose sight of the spirit aspect to the beast-men. The only minor complaint I can think of is the translation errors, but after having done about half of the endings, I only had 1 time where I was unsure of what they meant to say.

Fruthermore the game doesn't look track of the whole \"spirit\" portion, which is a nice touch! \n\nThe music: Music quality is nice!

It's well crafted with a lot of love from the creators despite its obvious fan-base being geared toward the furry community.

They grew on me gradually., and also develop relationships with each other. The contrasts between their characters were more complicated than the too-common manga \"the crazy one, the smart one, the tomboy\" etc. choice. Each of these charcters is both appealing and annoying, in different ways.\n- The fast-forward (hit CTRL) is VERY useful!  Wish I'd noticed it earlier.\n\nBad things:\n- The opening feels like a typical manga \"loser guy suddenly has a harem of hot babes competing over him\" scenario.  It gets better quickly, but it's bad to have the opening feel so generic.\n- Characters never ask two crucial questions: why [spoiler]can't Leopard Cat fix his own temple or get somebody else to do it, and why can't Spotted Leopard find somebody else[/spoiler].  Liao is trying to make his big decision without getting the information he needs to make it.\n- There was no 'G|PG|R|X' rating anywhere--no way of knowing whether I was going to see pictures I didn't really want to see. It turns out there's a paid version that has such images, so you're safe if you don't pay. But nothing on the Steam store webpage or in the game said anything about it.\n- The English translation had extremely bland, just-the-facts writing. The writer or translator needs a can of \"Show, don't tell.\"\n- The plot points, where you get to make a decision, were chosen for game mechanics reasons--as places to adjust the emotion scores for each cat--rather than for story reasons!  So you get to decide whether to go on a date with a cat or not, but get no say in some of the most-important decisions your character makes, like [spoiler]whether to kill someone[/spoiler].  The entire story is framed as you deciding between the 3 cats, [spoiler]but you never get to, at least not directly![/spoiler]  It's very weird that you have to figure out the game mechanics and beat them over weeks of story time just to accomplish something that your character could do with a few words.\n- This is made worse by your narrator-character being a total wuss, so he sits back and watches things unfold a lot of the time.  Seriously, Liao is annoying.\n- The plot points are VERY far apart. We're talking hitting the space bar over a thousand times between decision points sometimes.  Spend less time painting backgrounds and more time writing dialogue, guys.  Personally, I think this game would have benefitted if each separate location were an adventure-style world, so you could type commands like \"TALK TO LEOPARD\" or \"DANCE\", and feel like you had some control.\n- I wish that the controls let you set the printing to be instantaneous.

Cloud Leapord is my shiz, but I enjoyed Lin Hu's company and anger but his feelings are also nice if you get the right ending. Thus we are left with Senpia Shu Chi.... it took me a bit to start to not be anoyed by him but in the end I fell in love with him... hes nice but I do think getting hit by the car was a setup but thats just me... I'm still confused about what happend in the first two endings after getting hit by the car it was very upsetting to me... but its fine I love him none the less. \n\nI think that they should allow you to get closer to Randolph and Ragoo more since I feel like there is potentioal for them in the game.

I initially downloaded Nekojishi with the expectations of a cheesly written romance novel with no real direction, but I was pleasantly taken aback as to how fleshed out and well [i]good[/i] it truly was. \n\nThe gist of the story is that we follow Liao, a college student living a hum-drum life who is granted the power to see cat spirits who all happen to need his help in one way or another. It's here where the player must guide Liao down a path with one of these spirits and make choices that are difficult, funny, saddening, and the rest of the whole nine yards. It's these choices that make the game particularly awesome only because the writing is so good and it makes you consider the shades of grey within' each scenario, sort of like Night In the Woods. \n\nAs for the visuals? There's very little to be said beyond stunning, one can tell that heart and soul went into the making of this novel. All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone as an endearing story worth remembering and playing many times over for all the different paths and endings.\n\n\n\n[spoiler]Shu-Chi Senpai best boi[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1512361548, "timestamp_updated": 1512615775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743874073028564453", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38046891": {"recommendationid": "38046891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152666920", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1515209353}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game!", "timestamp_created": 1512348651, "timestamp_updated": 1512348651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483870983123779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38045433": {"recommendationid": "38045433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040025951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1521406278}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm officially gay now.

At first some people may pass this off as a basic interactive story about dating furries, but as you get deeper into the game the plot can take many twists and turns, it becomes far more deep and will have you thinking of the characters in a variety of different ways depending on your choices. You may come to care for each of the characters, you'll feel sorry for them, feel happy for them, feel disappointed, hopeful, and more. The writer does a fantastic job fleshing out the characters in ways which makes you like them without giving away the whole truth behind them.\n\nThere are many endings in this game, some good, some bad. One of the things which made me play through he game multiple times is that I wanted things to be better, to make the right choices so everyone could be happy, and each ending made me see the characters in a completely different light.\n\nThe art in this game is quite good, though except for changes in facial expressions you'll only ever see the characters in the same few poses through the whole game and it will leave you wishing for something different after a while.\n\nThe beautiful music helps to enhance parts of the story really well, the soundtrack is one of the main things which will play with your emotions, the happy bouncy tune when characters are being silly makes you feel good. The slow soft tunes in some of the more sad and serious moments make you feel sorry or sad for the characters, and it will tug at your heart strings more as you get deeper into the story.\n\nI understand that this type of game may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're not into the whole furry scene, but I would highly recommend it to people who do find these kinds of games fun.

There are few characters that doesn't change much during gameplay and several backgrounds that might not be the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen. Even though it is visible that devs tried their best to make it attractive - characters slides (which imitates their movement) and, in some points, lightning changes giving backgrounds and characters different hue.\n\nThe most important part of visual novel is a story, and the story of Nekojishi is truly solid. There is lot of fun, but also sadness and uncertainty in this game. Choices truly matter and they are not always easy. If you play visual novels for sexual content, you will be surprised how little amount of it Nekojishi includes. Especially that the game is about big furry cats. It rather focuses on feelings of the characters and their relations between each other.\n\nAs much as long texts of visual novels make me usually bored, it was absolutely different in case of Nekojishi. It took me long hours to get to the first ending and I was surprised how easy it was to read. I will definitely try to reach rest of endings in the future.\n\nSo far... I can recommend this game, even for those, who are not into visual novels.\nAnd one of the reasons why they should try Nekojishi is because it is for... free.

The english translation is decent, the story is good, and the characters are wholly likeable. The competition for best boy in this game is definitely real, and finding the path to all good endings is, for the most part satisfying.\nMy biggest gripe about the game is that the characters, especially the protagonist himself, follow specific tropes and stereotypes that define them. These traits are subverted or played upon a few times at most, but let's be real- it's a game about unreasonably attractive cat man spirits and that's why you're playing the game in the first place, right?\nThe most impressive factors to this game, to me, is the consistent, strong art style as well as the awesome character design. The three cats are designed each quite beautifully, balanced well with their personalities and stories, and the art for particular scenes is of notable quality (so yes, gay eye candy. Which you probably should be prepared for if you're playing this game).

You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.\n\nYou see, this conundrum begun on a bright sunny sunday afternoon. I was Netflix n chillin', catching up on my favourite anime, Bojack Horseman, while browsing the interwebz. Could not have gone any better. While scrolling Reddit, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. I see some familiar words. I quickly scrolled up and lo and behold, I see a post about this game being greenlit. Suddenly, I had a fuzzy feeling inside, and deep down I knew that, I can see something in this game, but I don't what it is. Was it potential? Possibly. I waited patiently, like a loyal doggo, checking if there's any dev update on Twitter, this Steam page, trying not to forget this game, and it's release date. In the end, my enthusiasm died out, and the wait has taken it's toll on me.\n\nSome months pass, and it's already November 2017, time flies, I told myself. Things were quite good, but I had not much personal time. As a result, I had forgotten about my life online. But today, today is the day that changed everything. I was just checking Reddit, and I notice a familiar name. [i]Nekojishi.[/i] And it has just been released on Steam. Then it all comes rushing back to me. [i]The furry cat game.[/i] I get that same fuzzy feeling from last time, but it's greater. My inner-furry has been awoken. I rush to my computer, navigating swiftly pass open Word documents, PDF files, Firefox windows, handy text files filled with copypasta, Discord and finally reached my destination; the Steam app. My fingers raced across the keyboard, typing the game's name, and Steam, as always, knows me well enough to suggest it in the quick search results. Clicked it, hit 'Play' and waited some more for it to download. It's as if I haven't waited long enough. \n\nAfter the painstaking waiting, I saw the game's icon on my desktop. It seemed as though it was gleeming, standing out from the monotonous-looking desktop. I thought to myself for a while before playing the game, was it worth waiting this long for a simple game like this? I had conflicting thoughts, and started the game, not expecting much, maybe even begining to regret my decision to dedicate this much time thinking about it. But as soon I saw the charcters in their full personality(or shall I say, fursonality) I was blown away by how cute they were. 5 seconds later, I found out that, yep, it's the furry effect that's going on, making me embrace it. I play some more, adore the characters even more, take a look at the time, and decide to say bye to my husbandos for now. \n\nProceeded to have some emotional & existential thoughts about how I will never meet anthro kitters or anthro anything in my life. Accepted this world is cruel and decided to find a way to express my feelings. I studied online on how to meditate. I meditated, imagining what a world with anthro creatures will be like. I researched on lucid dreaming, in an attempt to get closer to my husbandos. Feeling spiritually enlightened, I decided to write a review about this wonderful game, which was probably the easiest method to begin with.

[/h1]  \n\n\n     I was never interested in the dating sim genre. However, this one appealed to me, for personal reasons. I can't give away any information about the story; for this truly is a masterpiece. But I will say that this has one of the most amazing, no, the most amazing and heartfelt stor(ies)y I have ever seen. That whole \"No, the most\" stereotypical praise for a work is so common, but I cannot find any other words to describe this game. It is the interstellar of dating sims, if you understand. (Another great thing you should see [movie]) And before I begin, it's 6:00 am. I've been playing it since 1:00. As I first downloaded it in my own self-pity and cringe for what I thought would be a cheesily written cringe-fest. I was wrong. Since I have been up for so long, I will try to make these paragraphs meaningful, but not exhausting on the already overworked human-mind.\n\n     There are spelling and grammatical mistakes, but PLEASE, and I do not write in all caps ever, but PLEASE do not let this deter you from the game. All grammatical and spelling errors are easily grazed over and mentally corrected by the mind; also posing no immersion breaking after-effects. Whether there errors or not, you have to give the game the benefit of being just released, and free.\n\n     The writing is phenominal, as aforementioned above. I have no idea how long this game was in development, something I will look into, but I know this took love and dedication to write. There are at least 70 paths you can take in this game. I took me 4.2 hours (with mistakes and reloads [I got some endings I didn't like at all.]) to finish one ending. I will continue playing this game until I have all (23?) achievements. There are some things the main character (you) does that I didn't find relatable and would piss me off, especially in some my endings with [spoiler] Cloud Leopard HES SO FUCKING HOT OMGOMGOMG [/spoiler] The ending I actually took with him was very mentally [strike] and physically [/strike] satisfying.\n\n     The characters are lovable and [i] will [/i] grow on you. Like them or not [i] they will [/i]. I cannot express how amazing this game is. Developers, if there is any place or way I can financially benefit you, I need to know. This game is too good for you to not be paid for it. I don't care if this is/was a passion project, I truly want to give back for what you have given me and so many others to come. \n\n     [h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\n[b] This game is not your usual dating sim. Like a lot of other games, this is a shining star. And it now holds a special place in my heart. Please play this, once. You might even become a furry, I guess. But you're still a human in the game, what do I know? [/b]\n\n\n     [h1] UPDATE; IMPORTANT [/h1]\n     After looking around, (really not hard, really.) I've found the developers' websites. https :// nekojishi . tw/ (spaced just in case Steam freaks the fuck out about links.) You can donate twn dollars and get the [b] NSFW [/b] version (It's limited edition, so get it now! [excuse my use of exclamation marks, I have always found them unnecessary and rambunctious]) Or get the [b] NSFW [/b] version free, they're just nice, I guess. I donated already.

A lot of the English could use some polishing, but the script is still readable and doesn't detract toooooo awful much from the flow of the story. I like the fact you can save on any screen and quit on a moment's notice if you have to step away. My only feedback on that is to offer more save slots than what is currently offered; there are so many options, it's tempting to save a lot. There are multiple endings too, which gives this story a good amount of replayability.\n\nThe artwork is pretty phenomenal and greatly enhances the story, too. It's clean, polished, and professional-looking. You can even go back and see the art itself in the gallery after you initially find it in the story.\n\nI hope this team continues to develop more stories.

While speaking from the position of a fur-fag and being the games target audience, this game definatly hits its mark. But, by having the experience of playing through the game a few times, I can say with certainty that as long as you take the game somewhat seriously, and play it with an open mind, you'll at the very least leave with a strong connection to one or more of the characters that will leave you wanting to know more. \n\nAs far as visual novels go, knowing nothing about this is definatly the best way to go about playing it. The diologue, while a bit rough here and there due to translation, is mostly fluid andunderstandable, but most importantly, it's impactful. One could easily become attatched to certain characters or just choose whichever character's path to follow just to see what happens. Nekojishi certainly reels you in from the beginning and doesn't let go until you're caught and served at Red Lobster with a side of butter, and to me, that's its best quality.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\nIf taken at the very least, semi-seriously, it's a fun and emotion-provoking experience\n\nThe art is very well presented, nothing is too exaggerated or over the top\n\nThe choices are a bit maze-like if trying to go for all of the endings, but most seem to be varied and different, leading to a semi-decent amount of replayability\n\nCons:\n\nIt's a Visual Novel so be prepared to read. A lot. If you care.\n\nIt's centered around Gay/Furry type stuff, so if that's not your thing and you don't wanna open up to it, you won't miss a whole lot.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511393301, "timestamp_updated": 1511393301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36847393": {"recommendationid": "36847393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424111217", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 618, "last_played": 1510711265}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gatos grandes, dragones musculosos, yaoi, lindas historias.

Tal vez haya que probar los cambios, pero este an\u00e1lisis es para la versi\u00f3n de steam.\n\nReconozco que me lo he jugado por la p\u00e1rte gr\u00e1fica de Takemoto. \nComo novela visual es bastante pobre. La continuidad de la historia es incoherente, los personajes no siguen l\u00f3gica de desarrollo alguna...\nQue le hayan puesto la etiqueda de\"Choices matter\" es una verg\u00fcenza, ya que lo que tu eligas no tiene que ver con lo que pasa pr\u00e1cticamente en ninguna ocasi\u00f3n. Hay que darle demasiadas vueltas para \"complacer\" a cada uno de los dioses, no porque sea dif\u00edcil per se, si no porque no hay otra forma que no sea probar una y otra vez cu\u00e1l es la elecci\u00f3n correcta (cosa que no sabes hasta mucho m\u00e1s adelante de la elecci\u00f3n, ya que el personaje con el que dialogues va a seguir interpretando lo que decidas como le venga en gana).\nEsto por no mencionar que el protagonista es el cateto m\u00e1s petulante del universo. Aunque por otro lado, al estar rodeado de supuestos dioses ego\u00edstas cuyo \u00fanico objetivo es abusar de \u00e9l y tomar decisiones en su lugar a base de zalamer\u00edas, tampoco es que pueda llegar a mucho m\u00e1s. Esto tambi\u00e9n lleva a que los finales no sean particualmente positivos.\nPara m\u00e1s inri, hay referencias que se contradicen.

Es entonces cuando tendr\u00e1 que tomar decisiones... ayudar a alguno o no, ayudarlos a todos y renunciar a sus sue\u00f1os o seguir su vida... \n\n[h1]Vale... pero que te pareci\u00f3 el juego como tal[/h1]\n\nDejando de lado los gustos furrescos puedo destacar que la historia est\u00e1 muy bien hilada... la gente se queja de escasez de finales pero yo creo que es mejor as\u00ed y no enmara\u00f1arlo todo. \n\nPese a su tendencia furry homosexual, no se centra tanto como podr\u00eda (porque hay otras novelas que telita...) en el tema sexual sino en la interacci\u00f3n y la afinidad entre los personajes la cual denotara no solo en como avanza la historia sino como entre los mismos los diversos di\u00e1logos que se dan y como los personajes tendr\u00e1n en cuenta las vivencias a la hora de implicarse entre ellos.\n\nLos personajes principales (quitando el prota porque es muy est\u00e1ndar el pobre XD) no voy a decir que son aqu\u00ed grandes descubrimientos pero consiguen llegarte a la patatilla de alg\u00fan modo... quiz\u00e1 hay escasez de personajes secundarios... y pese a desarrollarse en un mundo humano no se ven m\u00e1s que 2 en todo el juego (El prota y senpai en cierto punto) pese a que se mencionen m\u00e1s a lo largo del mismo (pero quien quiere ver humanos teniendo tigretones no? XDD) \n\n\nLa m\u00fasica es espectacular, tanto el opening (que tuve que traducirlo por mis cojines <3) como la que se usa in-game consigue encajar a la perfecci\u00f3n con los sucesos en especial en momentos alegres y tristes... *Ojito spoiler* Como cuando [Spoiler] Esa sonrisa que me sali\u00f3 tras ver que tras dar mil y una calabazas al pobre de Senpai y decirte que se ir\u00e1 para no volver pero aun as\u00ed va y te pide una \u00faltima cita no se me olvidara, o las lagrimas cuando vuelves y ves al leopardo hecho polvo TwT[/Spoiler]\n\n\n[H1]En definitiva [/H1]\n\nCreo que los desarrolladores pueden estar contentos con lo que han creado, se nota el mimo y el trabajo que han invertido... Hac\u00eda tiempo que no me sent\u00eda tan apegado a un juego y consegu\u00eda empaparme tanto (eww... no es lo que pens\u00e1is >:1, me refiero a la historia y personajes). \n\nMe gustar\u00eda apoyar a los desarrolladores (Por ejemplo si sacaran un dlc con la ost del juego, cromos, etc... ) y de ese modo ayudar al juego que aunque aun sea pronto me encantar\u00eda ver si se plantear\u00edan una secuela o algo.

While the appeal is niche, at least gay but into furries helps too, Nekojishi does have a good story that provides some insight into Asian culture, allowing this game to also provide a bit of a learning experience, should you choose to look into it.\n\nAs a visual novel, the actual gameplay is pretty light, limited simply to reading and making decisions to reach a happy ending. However, that's all this game needs; the main character, Liao, is the same person regardless of how you play. Your decisions throughout the story affect which passions he chooses to pursue, but we ultimately have little agency on who Liao is. There is a golden ending to aim for, and I'd honestly recommend trying to work your way to that ending without a guide, as getting there does require a combination of getting to know each of the characters pretty well and getting the right information. While said golden ending is the only one where everyone gets a happy ending, the other endings you'll be likely to see while trying to find it are also heartwarming. Multiple playthroughs are both easy and encouraged. In addition to figuring out how to get the golden ending, there are also a few tools to use that makes things easier; a fastforward button that can skip through the parts you've already read, a glossary that keeps track of terms and other such things so you can review the concepts whenever you like, and a gallery to keep track of the events you've seen and review the great artwork that accompanies this game. Said artwork is actually quite interesting. Pretty much all of the character designs seem a little different than the usual furry art, giving the characters' an attractive appearance as well as a sort of otherwordly mystique due to their slightly non standard features. That could just be the artists' own personal touches, but they fit regardless.\n\nOverall, Nekojishi is an amazing visual novel to experience. A great cast, heartwarming story, and outstanding visual appeal all contribute to a good game worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1510944518, "timestamp_updated": 1510944518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36575567": {"recommendationid": "36575567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269318979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1510941881}, "language": "english", "review": "i wasn't quite sure what to expect but i think i just awoken the furry inside of me.\n\nim not complaining about it or anything it's just,, really love this game? especially the guardian tiger-- i mean im year of the tiger and all--- totally not bias,, i just love how bara he is\nim totally gay and i love furry beastmen now thank u very much", "timestamp_created": 1510936744, "timestamp_updated": 1510936744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36575412": {"recommendationid": "36575412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026350285", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1571772832}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game with so interesting characters and nice plot.", "timestamp_created": 1510936300, "timestamp_updated": 1510936300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36574474": {"recommendationid": "36574474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153145243", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 777, "last_played": 1527468877}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't played any visual novel game for 4 to 5 years... This one, although, is for people who are into furries characters, anyone can try to play it. (If you are not the person who dislike gay furry stuff) Actually, the stories are short but good. It focuses on building the image of three big feline furry characters, manage your relationships with them, introducing cultural background, and tell you not 100% trust a person even he is extremely passionate to you. Some little regrets are: I hope the game is not free, thus the game developers can put more different emotions on character's standing pictures (instead of the portrait on left button) and more important, adding more CG for certain scenes, then the players can enjoy the stories much better.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u5f88\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u57fa\u65bc\u50b3\u7d71\u6587\u5316\u7684\u8996\u89ba\u5c0f\u8aaa\u904a\u6232\uff0c

In China being \"furry\" is sorta frowned upon in my knowledge, so making this game is a big leap for furries over there in hiding, so all you guys have my support.\n\n[i]Now the real review[/i]:\nThis game is on par with Morenatsu in it's homosexual content, but WAY more upfront about it. Suggesting the protagonist is indeed a furry himself, but just a fantisizer like us in the real world. I do love the slapstick humor and the cuteness, and adds a lot more realism to the situations for the protagonist. Morenatsu was a rich experience, and no doubt this should be one too. \n\n[i]Also, stop rating this a psychological horror game, this game was painstakingly made and deserves credit where it is due.[/i]\n\nIn short now, brilliant play, Asian made so not as crappy as Major/Minor, but except sexual content, so play when you're home alone and such.

Playing through multiple playthroughs while maintaining the \"No Homo\" mentality is a wonderful way to pass the time as you relentlessly buy things for your cat BFs (Best Friends) on your numerous (play) dates.\n\nThe intimate lifestyle of multiple guys living under one roof and sharing numerous interests and main characters is a genre not fully explored by mainstream developers; And indeed, those that do explore this genre tend to push the recent trend of diversity by making the main character of games engage with numerous individuals of numerous backgrounds, such as:\n\n[list]\n[*]White\n[*]Black\n[*]Asian\n[*]Indian (India, not Native American I'm not a bigot ok)\n[/list]\n\nAs you might expect, this leaves the characters to develop only on a rudimentary level without much thoughtfulness put into their character besides sweeping generalizations that feel almost unnatural.

Specifically the:\n[*]Japanese\n[*]Chinese (Han)\n[*]Some Mongol-Tribesman or something? I dunno.\n\nThis is important, because it leads us to learn more about the cultures of each of the main characters, rather than the sweeping generalizations mentioned prior. One of the specific things I was interested in was how the diets and food choices of all the main characters differed. The Chinese Tiger liked succulent roasted pig for his daily meals, whereas the nubile Leopard enjoyed a more refined pallete of tubed rice.\n\nBut even then, deeper levels of culture are revealed in this game; for example, the Chinese Tiger and the Japanese Yaokai are natural enemies and befittingly, the Japanese Kitten is ruthlessly rutted by the Chinese Tiger as sufferance for his many crimes throughout the series and in the nation-states history.\n\nI give it a purrfect 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1510683689, "timestamp_updated": 1510683689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579172849655151367", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36515086": {"recommendationid": "36515086", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996617936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1515508403}, "language": "english", "review": "Just FYI, the original name for Guardian Tiger in chinese is \u864e\u723a\nwhich can be translated to tiger(\u864e) grandpa(\u723a).\n\nSo he is literally your tiger daddy ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\n\nSource: an actual taiwanese here.\n\nEDIT: \nTo clarify further, it shouldn't be translated literally.

The story seems so-so and pretty disconnected from each other. I did some trials to see if the choices truly make any differences. It appears that even you \"impress\" one character but choosing the same choice that led you to the bad ending,you will get bad ending regardless how \"impressive\" you can do for a single character,which I think it's nonsense. \n\n\nOne of the nonsensical things in this game is choices. In my opinion,how choices matter when most of the choices don't really matter but just one choice near the ending that does change the game. I don't know why but this is not even a triple A game like Deus ex that the developers have to put their funds to be divided and separate the funds to different teams like R&D,creative division,coders,etc. I really feel that this storyline is like a triple A game but without other kinds of interactive:confusing and does not connect to the old choices that players chose.\n\nNo. It is possible to make old choices that do matter later in the late game. Look at \"The Snake\" and Elohim from Talos Principle. The choices are far more complex than just \"should I go with this guy/what should I do to this or that\" such as the questions about Elohim,towers,your existence,Gehenna,etc.,yet,the conversations really connecting to the choices that the user chose in his/her playtime. You trust the snake? Elohim is looking for you closely. You prefer the voice in the sky than archive in the computer? That snake will feel pity to players and may shutdown itself. Etc. Because all I see is this: Choices you made in the early decisions just don't really matter much. A single choice near the end does matter and ignore all choices players did...unless it may have conditions like if you \"impress\" a leopard and a tiger the same,it may not lead to leopard's bad ending.\n\n=============\nThese are examples from me about the choices I did in this game,spoiler alert of course. Also I have edited something to make it funnier to read,\nSome algorithm-alike examples: Impress Tiger only,go to \"The city of Gods\",forgive him,bad end\nDon't \"go to the city of Gods\" Got \"Coup de grace\"ed by a leopard. \n2. go with leopard,then go with tiger,buy a book,don't ask dad,convince them,go to forest with the cat,ask tiger about romance,go back actually,don't go out with a cat,talk with a leopard,find a cat,don't date with a cat,don't pack up,talk with tiger about a cat,do the cheating,tell him about requesting a leopard to commit cheating,not interviewing,don't go with a cat [LC's tip: Don't trust small cats,lol],go to the city of Gods,forgive: same ending to the leopard gone.\n\nSenpai,don't buy a hat,buy a book for tiger,asked his father,did not convince them to get along,get along (confession)\n,call other members,don't put the folding table away,talked to tiger,accept interview,did not confort the cat,\nstayed with the cat longer,got \"Phaselock\"ed end from a cat\n2-confort the cat,stay with him: same ending,this subversive plottwist sponsored by Dahl and Deande,the spymaster.\n3-Buy a hat,did not wash a hat,chose same choice to the first one: Same ending\n3.1 did not go to the cat's home--->did not go to City of God,go after that ,forgave the leopard:same ending to the tiger.\n4 vote in favor of a cat,led to Tiger's choice-->bad ending by either got assaulted by leopard or leopard ranaway like a B*...Cheers love,the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is here.\n\nLeopard,go with him,did not buy a book for tiger,convince them,don't pack it,don't go to the city of god twice\n:attacked by leopard-->he brings the protagonist to a cave,take the opportunity (mountain)--> new ending but in favor to Tiger\n.1 Stay here,did not go back to leopard: new ending\nstay,go back:new ending,in favor of leopard\nVote in favor of a leopard then vote for a tiger:a tiger is attacked by a leopard but then later it's nothing but good things are in favor to a leopard (led to the same good ending for leopard)...Penultimo will remember this.\n\n(That is all I found. I am too lazy to figure out the good ending of a cat. He is also extremely annoying and does not really care about protagonist. Like Olivia \"Central\" Gladstone said,no one should trust the cat) \n=================\n\nCharacter design: I think other than a tiger's cloth,all characters are just so generic. I also heard from my friend who happens to be furry that according to a guy name Vorusu,he,my friend,found that the red dragon has the exact same design to a dragon in a website called T-walker. He showed a now deleted tweet and it's so true. His newer design to replace controversy? An ugly,unfit to the theme,fish-net tank and a loosely inspired from Ryu from Street fighter (tore and dirty shorts). A fox's design is also generic too. \n\nI do think that they just focus on the main trio too much that they trash the rest. It's like they put R&D funds on the trio and give 1 Euro to the rest. Not to mention another illogical thing: If you can \"impress\" a guardian and other unknown spirits,why not able to let the players interact with the dragons and a fox??? I replayed so many times and they ends up just being clowns and nothing else. I also found that that red dragon is much more interesting than the annoying cat and a psychopath leopard. The protagonist said that he is in love with males but I don't think I ever see him ever try to \"impress\" with dragons and a fox. What are the true purposes for them to be even included in the game other than story-telling? It just lame in my opinion.\n\n\nMusic and sound effects: IS CL4P-TP IS IN MUSIC DIVISION??? Seriously,the music just makes me fall asleep that I have to play Gaga's music,Mozart,or even Hevisaurus' to remove the lifeless and the boredom of the soundtrack. The effects especially when that annoying cat pop-up is also annoying very much. I do know that this is not Remember Me/Life is Strange or other games but I do think if you can't find anything better then just use ambient sounds (such as nature sounds or just something that can go along with the theme of the game).\n\nBut I have to admit that the Chinese-English translation team is pretty ok.There are some errors but it's rare,unlike most of the non-corporate funded games that has excessively bad translations.\n\nAlso one more thing,I browse the forum and found something about \"the hidden patch\". I don't really know why but it's like if the non-techy guy/gal wants any extra secrets,they have to mod it.  My friend said that it's for the adulto \"impressivo\" pinturas...But players have to risk to download from someone that they may have virus in it? It's weird. Why don't you just either don't do it in the first place or make it for the secret forum community? It just reminds me of how weird is it for most of the open world game that requires excessive unofficial modify to make the game more interesting.\nAlso my friend said that someone post pictures that may have direct conflict with Steam in screenshots,moderators better take a look at that too.\n\nAll in all,for the indy graphic novels,there are plenty of things that I think it would be best to develop furthermore. Even the story seems to be mostly following the current character gaming trends with plenty of what is this moment,I would say it can be better than just a graphic novel for \"impress\" the cats,you know,there are some games that just has more than \"impress\" the fans like Daddy simulator or the others. Consider making the new graphic novels after this,try something less random and more logical with maybe good \"impressing\" the character features. That could be nice. \n\n[By the way before I decided to play for more than 2 hours,my \"furry\" friend claims that please review nicely or they will hurt me. I don't know but this is what I think.

It's like Nier in the sense that you don't see the true ending until you do every route. \n\nI actually cried 100 times, I played the 18+ version, which is currently free for a limited time, you can find it on their twitter or here , just look up Nekojishi 18+ english, though obviously there is some NSFW scenes in that!\n\nThis game is surpringsly well written, the dialogue is very real, every conversation feels true and not over the top like most VNs. I cried a lot, my face hurts. I also had to play through like 10 different endings (including the bad ones) to see what would happen, even the bad endings were well written though depressing obviously. Also lot's of save slots! I had to actually look up an ending guide to get all the endings then the one true ending, which I guess is a con but the true ending made it worth the hassle by far. There's a built in glossary of all the Taiwanese culture lingo used, a gallery, and below the gallery a collection of endings you've completed. Music is actually pretty impressive and some were even very powerful and emotional. If you take the time to run every ending, there is easily 20-30 hours of gameplay, which is a lot for a free VN.\n\nThe only cons I can think of is; Some messy translations throughout the game though with some imagination you can connect the dots and figure it out for yourself. Going through the story 10+ times to get every ending was a little tedious, but if you hold Ctrl down you can skip dialogue you've already read, if it stops and ctrl doesn't work, it means you are on text you haven't read yet, which was a nice indication of new text to look at, which helped greatly seeing some major and even minute differences in choices.**minor spoiler**  I wasn't a big fan of the Nier type rushed blog/computer endings, i wish they took the time to flesh those out and make them cutscenes.

Probably disappointing if you were expecting a more traditional route structure with happy endings, but I thought it worked well. It took me about seven hours to fully complete, but it'll take a bit longer if you read slowly and/or don't use a walkthrough.\n\nThere is an R18 version with a few explicit scenes, which is a nice bonus, but I'd recommend reading the all-ages version as well, since those alternative scenes touch more on the emotional and romantic side of the relationships.\n\nThe translation isn't bad (certainly much more readable than the translation of the store page), but there's lots of small errors (mostly forgotten capitals and misplaced punctuation) which can get kind of distracting. EDIT: The translation has since been updated and corrected, but I haven't checked out the new version yet.\n\nThe art is great and the animated chibi cut-ins are just adorable. I'm not a big fan of the style where the main character sprites have a single facial expression and all of the emotions are just shown in the side images, but the art direction is dynamic and expressive enough that it still worked for me.\n\nEven if you're not into furry art or bara, I'd recommend [i]Nekojishi[/i] to any VN fan interested in the setting. I knew nothing about Taiwanese folk religion before, and I appreciated having the in-game glossary so I could learn some interesting new facts.

I've been waiting for this game to be released for 1 full year! And now that it's officially now released on Steam, I'm able to play it! Well, except a bit before, I played the 18+ version for a bit, so... ye. But yeah, it's officially on Steam now! I was genuinely afraid that it got lost in the depths of Greenlight, overlooked, but it still stands <3\n\nBut anyways, enough rambling; let's go review it... at least from the experience of playing the game in the non-Steam 18+ download, and the demo.\n\nI know that after playing the demo before, it was pretty bare-bones as heck. There was sound, but it lacked background music, and the character portraits, mostly never change, aside from the botton corner, beside the dialog bar, for the characters other than the character you play as; Lin Tian-Liao. But now, in the official release, a TON of things were added into the game, such as the character portraits sometimes moving, having a few different portraits for each character, so you're not looking at the same portrait of the character for the entire game, more emotes for the character mugshots, the camera zooming in and moving, to make it feel a bit more engaging and fun to watch, especially when paired with certain sound effects. Heck, background music is now given this time. Though, to be fair, the demo mostly demonstrated the dialog of the game, and the translations of the game, so I couldn't complain too much on the demo.\n\nNow, on the game's story, and its general gameplay; you play as Lin Tian-Liao, a college student who can suddenly see three \"furry-beast men\" spirits/gods; a tiger, a leopard, and a leopard cat. The story, well, Liao sees the three cats, they ask him things, and want to do something for Liao, depending on the spirit/god you go for. Each of the tigers you will choose to help, or go and hang out with, will increase your bond with them. Well, at least being a romance visual novel, that's how it'll usually go, right? But yeah, each of the three cats do have their own distinct personality and appearance, along with their reasons with what they want you for, and are cute in their own way.(At least not them typical anime girls you see in almost every visual novels nowadays this time, haha) :3\n\nBeing an artist myself, I do love myself some nice artstyles in games, and Nekojishi is mainly no exception. The anime style of visual novels isn't anything new, but being of anime furries, or Kemono as they call it, is kind of an interesting sight to see, instead of the usual anime. Not to diss on them anime styles, I love myself some anime(because I'm a fucking weeb), but the Kemono style is more fresher to see than the usual nowadays, since kemono games, or Kemono in general, are comparatively rare.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game, is that it gives a description of some things that are said in the game, mostly about the history, description, and other interesting trivia about Taiwanese and Chinese culture. Kind of a nice touch for the game, especially to learn more about the above cultures, that are even lesser-known. Now while I did say it's the most interesting part of the game, there's not a lot to say about it, unfortunately. Nothing new, much like the Kemono style, but it's a very interesting thing to have to just learn about the Chinese/Taiwanese cultures.\n\nDespite many ups of the game, the game isn't exactly really that complex in its way of its relationship/bonding with the cats, especially compared to Doki Doki Literature Club. However, it's not really something to overlook, being generally cute of a game to play, and still that you can feel some bits of change for the cats, on the choices you make. Again, nothing complex, but still simple enough to understand the game, but has some moments where it's still interesting, cute and likeable.\n\nThe translation of the game, isn't really so perfect, but is still readable to understand what is being said. It's very obvious in the English translation(the game can allow you to change the language ingame, so yee), with a few spelling errors here and there. Once again, not really a problem, since there won't be any words that have too much errors to be unreadable. \n\nOverall, while I haven't played many kinds of visual novels nowadays, I find this visual novel game to be very interesting of its genre, and also a great visual novel game to play; it's cute, funny, and enjoyable! Just do be prepared for them adorable beast men... especially if you do try to play the 18+ version~ (which can be downloaded from their offical website. Don't worry too much if the 18+ version brings you to the store page of the game, the 18+ version is still free, don't worry; since the payment is meant as a form of donation, if you enjoyed the 18+ version :>)\n\n***Also, had to post a short review, just for it to process much faster, and then I edited my longer detailed review in***\n\nI do also feel that the game would make for an anime, too, I suppose as a kind of slice-of-life anime :>", "timestamp_created": 1510607009, "timestamp_updated": 1512868973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597560524940490723", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36499351": {"recommendationid": "36499351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033604768", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1510810260}, "language": "english", "review": "The CIA should play this too.", "timestamp_created": 1510606128, "timestamp_updated": 1510606128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444119095802307129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36499229": {"recommendationid": "36499229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079654887", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1510605463}, "language": "english", "review": "lol fucking furries", "timestamp_created": 1510605711, "timestamp_updated": 1510605711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469798654317855835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36498698": {"recommendationid": "36498698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014401507", "num_games_owned": 2558, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1510604292}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a good feline about it.", "timestamp_created": 1510603946, "timestamp_updated": 1510610786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577726244926452637", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36498634": {"recommendationid": "36498634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972461505", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1512694687}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever played 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1510603675, "timestamp_updated": 1510603675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36498374": {"recommendationid": "36498374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061551771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 518, "last_played": 1571512422}, "language": "english", "review": "Has a gay furry porn version on their website ;^)", "timestamp_created": 1510602840, "timestamp_updated": 1510602840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545465350151062012", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36497966": {"recommendationid": "36497966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163513339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1527200886}, "language": "english", "review": "Have kept an eye on this game since it was in development.

And that for free, so there's no reason not to give it a read... even though I'm not very fond of the ending, but there should be several so hopefully the others are more \"what just happened, I have the main menu, so that was it... whaaaat?\"\n\n+Visually great. While the big portraits only have 2 stances, they do have many emotions in the little icon next to the text, and the CGI's are amazing. Only unlocked 4 of a lot more this run, so you know there's plenty to come back for.\n+Story was pretty good up until the end, but maybe that's just the plot I've chosen.\n+Many choices to make. So expect that 5 hours from run #1 to extend to quite a few more with re-runs.\n+Relaxing music that never bothers and helps set the mood or give an upbeat while playing.\n+Absolutely totally free!\n\n-While I like the music, same can't be said for the SFX effects. While most make sense (telephone ringing, knocking on door etc.) there's some really annoying ones like the \"ding\" or thunder each line when they fight which are grating.\n-No real way to set auto-speed that I found, and if you missed something the text will continue going reading the log. You need to remember stopping auto-play, then read the log, then auto-play again which isn't too friendly.\n-The ending as mentioned, though that can just be the choices I made.\n-A few typo's or grammer errors here and there.
