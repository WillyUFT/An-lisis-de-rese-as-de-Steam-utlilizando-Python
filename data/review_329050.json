The combat is extremely smooth and responsive, and with Turbo Mode enabled it's fast paced to the point of feeling like an anime fight in almost every single encounter when you're styling hard on enemies.\n\nThe first half of the game is great. Nero is an easy to pick up character for newcomers to the series, while still offering an enjoyable skill ceiling for sweatlords, thanks to MAX-Act. Every single one of his special moves is intuitive to use and every single one of them serves a useful purpose, his glowy devil arm is fun as hell to use, he has ways of handling the enemies that you must to figure out on your own, but tend to be pretty straight forward most of the time, and he gets to fight one of the best bosses the series has. Really not much to complain about here (except for Chimera Assaults lol), the game shines the brightest during this half.\n\nHowever, the game's second half is severely lacking due to the fact that it's just the same stages and bosses but played in backwards order (and the worst crime of all, you don't even get to fight the best boss in the game again, you only get to fight him in a single mission per difficulty, excluding the Bloody Palace mode...) ...and the playable character during this second half, Dante, is by far the jankiest character out of the 5 available in the Special Edition. He gains new mechanics/weapons at an incredibly overwhelming rate during your first playthrough, you most likely won't figure out their full potential as you'll have about half of Nero's missions to get used to him. But if you end up sticking with the game for a while longer, either to try and beat Bloody Palace or to beat the harder difficulties, DMC4 offers incredible depth and complexity in its combat system in a very much classic Capcom fashion, it honestly feels like one of their fighting games in this regard. DMC4 Dante, in particular, thanks to his ability to cancel most actions using his Block ability, his insane mobility with Trickster style, his ability to manipulate his own falling speed, and the versatility of his 3 melee & 3 gun arsenal, is the series' peak when it comes to pulling off completely insane wacky stylish shit if you're willing to grind a little more after you've beat the game for the first time.  Don't get me wrong though, even without diving into the (frankly excessive) tech skill rabbit hole, the game still offers a satisfying experience on a casual playthrough (I guess like a 7.5/10 overall? If I had to put it into numbers) but messing around with what the characters can do on subsequent playthroughs is where this game truly shines, in my opinion.\n\nOh yeah, and the music's fantastic.

Vengo de jugarme la colecci\u00f3n de los tres primeros juegos que hay en Steam, y Devil May Cry 4 supone un cambio que te puede gustar, o no. Lo primero m\u00e1s notable es el cambio del protagonista que llevas durante la mitad del juego, Nero. He de decir que, aunque al principio se me hizo raro, Nero me ha encantado como protagonista, pues me recuerda en parte al Dante de Devil May Cry 3, el cual es mi versi\u00f3n de Dante favorita (sin contar el del 5, que a\u00fan no lo he jugado). \n\nSe introducen nuevas mec\u00e1nicas como: la posibilidad de rodar para esquivar ataques y el poder rotar la c\u00e1mara a placer en seg\u00fan qu\u00e9 situaciones, entre otras. Nombro estas dos porque son las que me causan controversia. Te dan la libertad  de rotar la c\u00e1mara pero no siempre que quieras, la rotaci\u00f3n completa a tu voluntad es solo en ciertas partes y en las partes que no, la puedes mover de forma muy limitada o ni siquiera eso. Esta caracter\u00edstica, junto a la posibilidad de rodar, es un poco lo que me ha jodido la experiencia. A ver, rodar est\u00e1 de put\u00edsima madre, pero no cuando los \u00e1ngulos de c\u00e1mara son tan jodidamente raros, van cambiando a veces como les da la gana y la direcci\u00f3n a la que tienes que mover el joystick cambia, haciendo que a veces hagas una acci\u00f3n distinta a la de rodar por error. \n\nTodo lo anterior se podr\u00eda considerar realmente como un problema de mi habilidad como jugador, soy consciente y por eso he aguantado tanto ese aspecto. El caso es que el dise\u00f1o de las misiones tampoco es nada del otro mundo... Los jefes se basan en exactamente lo mismo y para nada son una experiencia estimulante. La mayor\u00eda de los niveles se basan en puzzles en los que te puedes caer y, si te caes, para volver a subir te obligar\u00e1n a superar un combate; dichos combates no tienen un l\u00edmite, siempre que te caigas estar\u00e1s obligado a hacer uno. Este punto me lleva a la siguiente cosa que no me ha gustado, los enemigos. Me gusta el dise\u00f1o de estos, pues es muy fiel a la est\u00e9tica que ten\u00edan los anteriores Devil May Cry, pero es que todos se basan en lo mismo: esquivar (de forma regulera por el problema que mencion\u00e9 antes) y atacar. \u00bfNo te apetece esquivar? Pues recibir ostias y atacar, al final acaba siendo lo mismo. No es que est\u00e9 mal... Pero siento que en anteriores Devil May Cry, al carecer de esa mec\u00e1nica, buscaban otras maneras de convertir en reto tanto a los jefes como a los enemigos normales. \n\nTambi\u00e9n le veo 0 sentido que no puedas bajar el nivel de dificultad. Si me lo estoy pasando en normal, deber\u00eda ser capaz de poder acceder a la misma misi\u00f3n en f\u00e1cil. Entiendo que la intenci\u00f3n es que alguien no se pase el juego en f\u00e1cil y luego juegue la \u00faltima misi\u00f3n en dif\u00edcil, pero podr\u00eda haberse hecho que si juego en normal, desbloqueo tambi\u00e9n las misiones en f\u00e1cil, pero no al rev\u00e9s. Intent\u00e9 bajar la dificultad m\u00e1s que nada para ver si todas estas sensaciones negativas se mitigaban y al menos me lo pasaba para ver la historia, pero es que me niego a empezar de cero, especialmente porque otro detalle negativo a mi parecer es que han alargado much\u00edsimo las misiones. \n\nLa gracia de los DMC, en mi opini\u00f3n, es que eran misiones cortas pero intensas; aqu\u00ed pueden ser intensas, s\u00ed, pero es que de media cada misi\u00f3n dura 20 minutazos o m\u00e1s. Cierto es que no es tanto, pero viniendo de juegos anteriores en los que las misiones duraban 5-10 minutos de media... Pues bueno, es un aspecto que tambi\u00e9n me ha acabado aburriendo porque encima muchas veces el juego parece m\u00e1s una pel\u00edcula que un juego, vamos, que hay demasiadas cinem\u00e1ticas dentro de las misiones y encima algunas de ellas largu\u00edsimas. Hay muchos otros juegos que son as\u00ed, de ahi el meme de \"jugar una pel\u00edcula\", pero sin duda no es lo que esperaba de un hack and slash y menos de un DMC. \n\nEn fin, entiendo por qu\u00e9 le gusta a la gente, no es un mal juego, de verdad; si lo pillas en una buena oferta, muy seguramente sea una buena compra, pero simplemente la cuarta entrega de la franquicia no es un juego para mi por los aspectos que ya he mencionado.", "timestamp_created": 1699401502, "timestamp_updated": 1699497505, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

"language": "english", "review": "Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a remastered version of the 2008 classic, breathing new life into the demon-hunting series that has captivated fans for over a decade. This Special Edition brings several enhancements to the table, making it a must-play for both newcomers and longtime fans of the franchise.\n\nGameplay (9/10):\nThe heart and soul of Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition lies in its fast-paced, combo-driven combat system. Players can choose from a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique playstyle. Dante, Nero, and Vergil are back, and Lady and Trish join the roster, adding variety to the already impressive character selection. The combat mechanics are finely tuned, offering a deep and rewarding experience for those who take the time to master the game's intricacies. The style meter returns, encouraging players to perform stylish combos while dispatching waves of demonic foes. The gameplay is a spectacle of acrobatics and destruction, and the Special Edition offers even more options to experiment with, providing additional depth and replayability.\n\nGraphics (8/10):\nWhile Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a remaster of an older game, it still looks impressive. The character models, environments, and animations have been updated to match modern standards. The game runs smoothly, even during intense combat sequences, and the special effects and particle work enhance the overall experience. However, some of the textures and background elements show their age, reminding players that this is a remaster of an older title. Still, it's a testament to the original game's art design that it holds up so well.\n\nSound and Music (9/10):\nThe soundtrack of Devil May Cry 4 is legendary, and the Special Edition preserves the same iconic tunes that have become synonymous with the series. The voice acting is top-notch, with characters' personalities shining through, adding depth to the narrative. The sound effects are satisfying and make every hit, slash, and gunshot feel impactful.\n\nStory and Narrative (7/10):\nThe Devil May Cry series has never been known for its deep, complex narratives, but rather for its stylish, over-the-top action. Devil May Cry 4 is no exception. The story revolves around a conflict between demons and the enigmatic Order of the Sword, with Dante and Nero caught in the middle. While the plot may be somewhat convoluted and melodramatic, it serves as a backdrop for the game's frenetic action and memorable characters.\n\nReplayability (10/10):\nDevil May Cry 4 Special Edition excels in replayability. With multiple characters to choose from, each with their own playstyle and abilities, players can approach the game in various ways. The Bloody Palace mode offers a challenging arena for testing your combat skills and competing for high scores. Moreover, the desire to achieve higher style rankings, unlock new moves, and discover hidden secrets will keep you coming back for more.\n\nOverall (8.5/10):\nDevil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a worthy remaster of a beloved classic that remains a shining example of stylish action gameplay. It doesn't just rest on the laurels of the original release; it adds even more variety and depth to the experience. While the story may not be the main draw, the addictive combat and high replayability make this Special Edition a must-play for fans of the series and anyone who enjoys thrilling, combo-driven action games. Whether you're a seasoned demon hunter or a newcomer to the franchise, Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition has something to offer, and it's sure to provide hours of demon-slaying entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699273733, "timestamp_updated": 1699273733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149621425": {"recommendationid": "149621425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283457832", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 883, "last_played": 1580680023}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is so good half way in you play it a second time.", "timestamp_created": 1699228150, "timestamp_updated": 1699228150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149619526": {"recommendationid": "149619526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108933151", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1039, "last_played": 1699225280}, "language": "english", "review": "starts really slow but gets really fun", "timestamp_created": 1699225305, "timestamp_updated": 1699225305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149564135": {"recommendationid": "149564135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803216090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1699206635}, "language": "english", "review": "playing it like back in 2008 al over agian", "timestamp_created": 1699159811, "timestamp_updated": 1699159811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149557743": {"recommendationid": "149557743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340373211", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 447, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1699845790}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si", "timestamp_created": 1699150657, "timestamp_updated": 1699150657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149490612": {"recommendationid": "149490612", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018753082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1699070274}, "language": "spanish", "review": "7/10.

Movement speed feels kinda slow to me, but it's not bad once you get used to it. Proud souls suck though.

4383, "last_played": 1698281254}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil May Cry 4 is a very interesting game since it came to known as an unfinished masterpiece and that may be confusing to process as you would find yourself frequently asking: \"How could an unfinished game classified as a masterpiece?\" and you'd be surprised to know that such a thing indeed exists. It was the summer of 2008 when I first got to try out this game and I was frustrated with the fact that it introduced a new lead called Nero. He struck me as a smug and unlikeable bastard at first but progressing further and witnessing his cries after Kyrie, I found him quite relatable real fast. Now I can't really decide between Dante, Vergil & Nero for they are all equally cool in their own ways. \n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Nero is going to be his demon arm. It's never been explained why he has that arm in game or why it's so powerful but if you're looking for a lore explanation, I'd suggest reading its book. However, if you're wondering how it plays, I got you covered in the next few sentences. He doesn't have depth like Dante but he's very fun to play in his own way. The whole game is designed around him hence you may find him even better than Dante and you probably will. The Red Queen, his beloved sword, has a motorcycle-like grip and when twisted, you can perform powerful combos with it and strike the finishing blow by grabbing enemies with his arm. He has different finisher animations for each enemy and even bosses thus, you'll find yourself trying to execute each one. They deal huge damage and increase style meter real fast, too! It can also be used for some platforming sections.\n\nAfter the 11th level, you'll start playing as Dante and his levels are going to show you the very reason why the game is crowned the title unfinished masterpiece. You'll be basically backtracking Nero's levels but at least they were generous enough to give you new weapons after defeating the same bosses again. So, what's different from DMC 3? You get to switch styles on the fly and that is freaking awesome! You don't have to grind experience points for them too! However, Dante's gameplay may be a bit difficult to get used to since almost all enemies are designed specifically for Nero. If you find yourself having a hard time, know that there are many options for you to try out since he's quite flexible compared to Nero. One thing I hated about Dante's levels was the only unique level of his featured the most annoying boss I've ever faced in any game: The Savior. The arena you fight it is quite confusing and it may take a while to get used to and what you exactly need to do isn't that obvious at first. Most people find Sanctus quite annoying, but I personally didn't have as many problems with him as I had with The Savior. \n\nSo, I hear you ask what's so special about this Special Edition? Allow me to explain. You get to play as Vergil, Trish & Lady! Lady's gameplay is focused on guns, and she is basically the easiest character to play despite being quite distant from other characters. You just need to charge her shotgun to third level and start blasting! Your style meter will get to SSS real quick, and your enemies will melt in no time! If you're having difficulty on higher difficulties with other characters, Lady is the way to go. Vergil is also another GOD if you want sword gameplay and feel like a total badass while cutting and slicing your enemies. No further explanation necessary. Trish is... strange. While she's solely based on staggering and stunning enemies, her damage output is quite low hence you may find playing Bloody Palace as her quite difficult. Normal levels are not that bad, and I'd go as far to say playing as her is actually a lot of fun! Unfortunately, all new playable characters only have 2 cutscenes at the beginning and at the end of the game. Lady & Trish's storyline may fit into the canon, but I don't know much about Vergil's. \n\nThe overall level design of the game is bigger compared to previous entries, but you'll get used to it. I don't know if I should talk about the story at all because anything I say could be a spoiler so, I think it's best to keep my mouth shut on this matter. Let's talk about DLCs instead. I personally wouldn't recommend buying anything other than extra costumes for they are all unlockable in game by normal means. It's also best to keep in mind that super characters give huge score penalty this time around thus, it's impossible to get an S rank from levels using them and cheesing your way through levels. They're quite fun to use, though. Especially Super Vergil. Bloody Palace becomes a breeze if you equip them which you will most likely need after a few failed attempts. Good luck with Trish, though. She lacks a super costume and taking her low damage output into account, you're in for a treat! \n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nAn unfinished masterpiece with a new lead and a refined gameplay with several characters to play as such as Lady, Trish & Vergil. I personally like its storyline a lot and it's also the hardest Devil May Cry game to 100% without a doubt so, good luck!", "timestamp_created": 1698352951, "timestamp_updated": 1698352951,

Aunque el juego ofrece una experiencia s\u00f3lida y emocionante, tiene algunos problemas que afectan su calificaci\u00f3n.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos y Dise\u00f1o Visual (8/10):\nLos gr\u00e1ficos han sido mejorados desde la versi\u00f3n original, con personajes y entornos detallados que lucen impresionantes. Los efectos visuales durante los combates son din\u00e1micos y emocionantes. Sin embargo, algunas texturas y modelos de personajes pueden parecer un poco desactualizados en comparaci\u00f3n con los t\u00edtulos m\u00e1s recientes.\n\nJugabilidad (9/10):\nLa jugabilidad es el punto fuerte de Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition. Los controles son precisos y responsivos, lo que permite a los jugadores realizar combos fluidos y elaborados. La variedad de personajes jugables y sus estilos de lucha \u00fanicos a\u00f1aden profundidad y replayability al juego. Sin embargo, la curva de aprendizaje puede ser empinada para los nuevos jugadores debido a la complejidad de los movimientos avanzados.\n\nContenido y Variedad (8/10):\nLa Special Edition trae consigo tres nuevos personajes jugables, cada uno con su propio estilo de lucha. Esto agrega variedad y horas adicionales de juego para aquellos que ya est\u00e1n familiarizados con la historia principal. Sin embargo, algunas misiones pueden sentirse repetitivas, y la trama puede resultar confusa para los reci\u00e9n llegados a la serie.\n\nDiversi\u00f3n y Duraci\u00f3n (7/10):\nLa diversi\u00f3n en Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition radica en la satisfacci\u00f3n de dominar los complicados movimientos y derrotar a enemigos desafiantes. Sin embargo, la repetici\u00f3n de ciertas secciones y la falta de innovaciones significativas en comparaci\u00f3n con las entregas anteriores pueden hacer que la experiencia se vuelva mon\u00f3tona para algunos jugadores.

Obviously, graphics were great for 15 years ago but now it is not great, though it was playable for me. Music is fantastic, especially the one at the beginning of the game. Writing style was enjoyable with the comedic touch and being weird as a fun way. Even though story was decent, there were lots of holes in it. Most of the time, I did not get why I am going to a certain place for looking Dante or doing something. Still these weren\u2019t big problems for me. The most important part was the gameplay for me: Sadly, this was the problem for me. Although, there were a lot of combos with different characters, only Nero/Dante part was canonical which means you have to play the same game without story to experience the other characters which makes it a bit repetitive and senseless. Plus, the achievements require you to complete the same game over and over for at least 7 times. Even without the other characters, game uses the same places and the same bosses for multiple times (there was a problem with the budget I think). Last two chapters were horrendous for me, with the dice parts for no reason and annoying boss. I had hard time dodging the enemy skills, since it was hard for me to see with the old graphics. However, most important problem was the tutorial and the keys. The game gives the tutorial with the PlayStation keys and when you check the skills, you can only see those keys which makes learning a trial and error with weird key mapping or research from the web. Lastly, I can say that controls were a bit unresponsive and the camera angles were really bad also. Therefore, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially with this expensive price for 15 years old game.", "timestamp_created": 1696483160, "timestamp_updated": 1696483160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147637382": {"recommendationid": "147637382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276336489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 597, "last_played": 1696441999}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0434\u043e\u0445 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b", "timestamp_created": 1696442348, "timestamp_updated": 1696442427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39682537317276001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147608498": {"recommendationid": "147608498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275592676", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1112, "last_played": 1696402676}, "language": "english", "review": "This is why I'm not religious", "timestamp_created": 1696402847, "timestamp_updated": 1696402847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147593460": {"recommendationid": "147593460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181262455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 786, "last_played": 1594704068}, "language": "english", "review": "The time has come and so have I.", "timestamp_created": 1696375353, "timestamp_updated": 1696375353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147583687": {"recommendationid": "147583687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061180231", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1696609682}, "language": "english", "review": "won't launch;

favourite out of the 5. It is also the first DMC game I've ever played. I remember watching the trailer when it was first announced for PS3 and I was so enamoured watching the reviews (I never had PS3).\nWhen I realised it came out for PC, I had to have it and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. It delivered on everything I wanted - a sappy love story, great action (made only better with the Nero's demon arm), okayish story... and all that a whole decade later \u2014 as I originally played it back in 2018.\nWith the Special Edition, I've just finished it for what I believe 3rd time \u2014 it is still one of the best action games I've ever played.\nI wholeheartedly recommend DMC4 if you are looking for some fun action. Game has higher difficulties (unlocked after finishing the game on easy or normal) which are quite the challenge!", "timestamp_created": 1695083489, "timestamp_updated": 1695083489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146523363": {"recommendationid": "146523363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344424019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "playtime_at_review": 1123, "last_played": 1699817978}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the only DMC game I hadn't played, growing up playing 1-3 and later visiting 5. I honestly think it's a good game, though it also has very noticeable flaws. Granted, depending on who you are you can overlook them to varying degrees. I beat the main campaign on my initial run-through in around 17 hours give or take with some downtime AFK - leaving room for a short story but a lot of replayability as with other DMC games.\n\n\n[h1][u]I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.[/u][/h1]\n\n\n[b][u]For the good points:\u00a0[/u][/b]\n- The game has a fun combat system, Nero is a very good character introduced into DMC4 with a fun move set and his buster is cool. Dante's weapons are cool as well, I prefer Gilgamesh compared to Balrog in 5 for example, and Lucifers concept is sick.\n- The music is good; Berial's theme is nice in my opinion, as well as The Time Has Come are two songs that stand out to me. Overall good soundtrack especially if you enjoy more religious, church-y music with a twist.\n- Story is nice. Dante takes a backseat, allowing Nero to shine - and the voice acting Nero provides is PHENOMENAL as well as the emotion portrayed by him for Kyrie. Plot wise, I really enjoy what this game brought to the series - even though it may have plot holes. Their relationship is very cute and I enjoyed it a lot.\n- 5 playable characters is a nice touch, Vergil is a popular character that returns in this game as well as Lady and Trish making their debut as playable characters which we don't get anywhere else. In the main campaign it's split between Nero and Dante, with Nero's missions being more engaging, so if you're a fan of Nero then the gameplay will be good for you.\n- The visuals of the game are very nice especially for the original release being in 2008 prior to the Special Edition, and I really love the aesthetics each area provides. Very pretty for its age, and I adore Nero's character design as this is my favorite design of his between 4 and 5.\n\n\n[b][u]For the bad points:[/u][/b]\n- The game is very repetitive, half the campaign is going through the same levels and bosses you've already done, fighting them a total of 3 times, and backtracking into the same level design per Nero and Dante. This is where it varies - if you're like me, I don't particularly mind backtracking, so this doesn't turn me off much. If I love the aesthetic of the level, I don't really mind. This will be different for everyone.\n- A lot of enemies are designed around Nero and Dante's kit was not fully thought out, so some enemies are tougher on characters that aren't Nero and may be frustrating (Example: Cutlass/Sharks) I personally think this game has a lot of enemies that are annoying or frustrate me, but I can also see the appeal of them being fun for others. Dante's combat in this game with these enemies isn't always favorable.\n- Compared to Vanilla, Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition has some input lag and performance issues that make it sometimes difficult to load up. I didn't have this problem, in regards to crashing, and I didn't notice the input lag my first run through, but I know it's an issue for some players and has been mentioned a lot by the community. For a casual run I think this version is fine.\n\n\nOverall, while a flawed game, it's a fun one and definitely a game I recommend any modern-day DMC fans or Nero fans to play, especially if you enjoy more heartfelt stories. The combat overall feels pretty smooth, especially as Nero - I would include Dante with practice on him as he isn't easy - and fun to play with. If you like more unique enemies then the design in this game will be more for you as you can't just wildly swing at them either. Overall it's pleasing to the eye, but also repetitive if that isn't your thing.\n\n\n[h1][b]TL;DR:[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - 4/5 [i]Nice for its time. Very pretty.[/i]\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - 3/5 [i]Very good combat but repetitive level design.[/i]\n[b]Audio[/b] - 4/5 [i]dmc soundtracks are good and dmc4 delivers, though I think it's outclassed by 3 and 5. Nero's voice actor did an amazing job in this game as well.[/i]\n[b]Difficulty[/b] - Medium, [i]some enemies require more brainpower but the game isn't hard on Human/Devil Hunter.[/i]\n[b]Grind[/b] - No grind [i]unless you want to do the rest of the difficulties or Bloody Palace. [/i][b][i]First runthrough isn't a grind at all.[/i][/b]\n[b]Story[/b] - Good. [i]Nice emotional story but short. Establishes a relationship between Nero and Kyrie.[/i]\n[b]Price[/b] - if it's on sale, it's worth picking up. [i]I got it on sale for $7 CAD and I don't regret it at all.[/i]\n[b]Bugs[/b] - Moderate, some may encounter ones other do not. [i]My experience was bug-free, but your mileage may vary.[/i]\n[b]OVERALL[/b] - 7/10, worth on sale, good but flawed game.

As hard as I try to like the story and locations of the game, it just doesn't end up feeling satisfying, unlike DMC1 or DMC3 for example which I personally think did their job way better years prior.

Barring the second game, of course, DMC 2 doesn't exist.\n\nAt first, I didn't like the main character change. Nero seemed much simpler than Dante in every way... and he was. But by the time I made it to the second half of the game, I realized the entire game was designed around Nero. Playing as Dante wasn't the same, he felt tacked on. Especially when the second half is pretty much a rethread of the first.\n\nGameplay is still phenomenal, don't get me wrong, but there's something missing in this one. I'm not sure what it is. Bosses are okay, not too memorable. There are a couple that outshone the rest, though. But the moment to moment gameplay kinda lost me nearing 70/75% of the game. Puzzles were inoffensive, not bad but not really good either.\n\nThe reused locations and bosses from the first half made this even worse. I don't like using the word 'lazy' when talking about game development but it really feels like it. It was probably a time constraint issue. It REALLY affects the overall quality. I almost dropped the game because of it. \n\nThe plot might be the weakest across all games imo. I never cared about whatever the main villain was babbling about, and I felt tempted to skip some cutscenes because of sheer disinterest. But honestly... Who cares lmao it's Devil May Cry.\n\nAesthetically it's pretty good. It looks clean and aged pretty well. No complaints here.\n\nI'm still recommending it, there's a lot of fun to be had.

But it actually does. It's just invisible and you can't interact with it. So if you're hearing weird music and sounds it's because the steam overlay opens automatically when you open the game and it's playing a trailer from the DMC 4 store page, invisibly. I'm not joking.\n- Alt+Tab makes the game go on windowed mode. Like seriously?\n-Performance Issues for no reason. I have a beefy PC and this game came out on 2008. It runs even worse on windowed mode. Didn't have any problems on DMC 1-3 and 5 when it comes to performance.\n-When you go to \"PC Settings\" to change the graphical settings, the game just crashes. And you have to troubleshoot it to get it to work. Bruh?\n-Hotkeys don't work. So you can't change the volume of the game while playing it nor alt+f4. If you wanna change the volume you gotta alt+tab... which causes problems as stated above.\n\nThe actual game:\n\nBad and annoying enemy design (Faults, Faust, Frosts, Blitzes, Chimeras, Assaults...), obnoxious gimmicks and pace-breaking puzzles, the platform is based on timing (grappling hooks) instead of actual platforming, lame boss design (one of the bosses is a window, another one is a giant frog), lack of story, repetitive and bland level design, mind blowing technical issues (steam, pc), grindy achievements (irrelevant for most people, not me), poor character balance (the character you can most easily S rank on is also the most straight-forward and boring... and it's supposed to be *STYLISH* ranks btw). Pardon me if I'm forgetting something.\n\nIt's clearly unfinished. The game has 20 missions. If you play up to mission 11 you've seen all of the areas, the rest of the missions are backtracking with a few additional assets. Even the same boring bosses are the same. If you want all the achievements you'll be doing about 8 playthroughs. Now, I and many people already got bored with the 2nd half of the game on the 1st playthrough, so just imagine my despair upon this realization.\n\nThe game was clearly designed with Nero in mind. He has gap closers (both player displacement and enemy displacement), easy aerial combos, a ranged weapon that supports melee combat (just charge it and use it once in the middle of a combo), and the Devil Bringer (only grabbing attack in the game), which can be used on bosses, has unique interactions with each enemy and it's sick. He can do everything.\n\nThen you have Dante which clearly was supposed to have his own campaign, but instead he's put against the same enemies and areas as Nero, which just feels uncomfortable with Dante's moveset. The 1% of the playerbase are gonna argue that it has an extremely intricate combat system, etc etc... But how many people are gonna realistically master this game? First you need to *like* the game and it's core mechanics, then you master it.\n\nVergil is cool tho. However missions like mission 6 are a disaster as Him.\n\nAfter getting all of the achievements on DMC 4, I felt pain and dread.

Todo el juego est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado para estirar artificialmente su duraci\u00f3n de forma rid\u00edculamente frustrante. Y es una pena porque inicialmente estaba muy bueno, los combos de Nero me parec\u00edan una evoluci\u00f3n muy bien lograda del juego y el devil bringer me pareci\u00f3 una adici\u00f3n excelente, aunque al final tambi\u00e9n lo jodieron, m\u00e1s de eso despu\u00e9s. Hay muchas cosas buenas obviamente, adem\u00e1s de la jugabilidad de Nero me encanto la forma en la que se explora a los personajes, me record\u00f3 mucho a dmc3 por eso, y tambien me gusto que lo hicieran una historia rom\u00e1ntica, por que la verdad me encanta el romance, y de eso va esto. El protagonista salvando a la chica que ama, lo de salvar al mundo es solo parte del proceso. Pero hasta ah\u00ed llega lo bueno.\n\nEl primer error que note es que el devil bringer es demasiado corto y lento, solo te sirve con los enemigos m\u00e1s in\u00fatiles con los que realmente no importa si lo usas o no, pero cuando realmente lo necesitas, como en las batallas de jefe contra el cuarto de contenci\u00f3n o Sanctus, resulta casi inutil, Y si logras agarrar a Sanctus, \u00a1Ni siquiera te deja en una ubicaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptima para atacar! Tambi\u00e9n Nero es lent\u00edsimo para recuperarse de las ca\u00eddas y, el mayor insulto, ya no puedes recuperarte desplaz\u00e1ndote en alguna direcci\u00f3n, el bicho te pega, te hace volar y te recuperas en donde ca\u00edste, pero como media hora despu\u00e9s. Valla retroceso m\u00e1s garrafal en ese aspecto\n\nLo segundo que not\u00e9 es la nerfeada tan brutal que le metieron a Dante, es que es insultante. No solo la pelea contra Dante es la m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil del juego, siendo \u00e9l m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y fuerte que tu y adapt\u00e1ndose a tus movimientos lo que la hace una pelea no dif\u00edcil sino injusta, sino que cuando lo manejas disparas confeti y golpeas con un pitillo pl\u00e1stico. Y no es que los enemigos sean m\u00e1s fuertes ni nada de eso, porque compar\u00e1ndolo con Vergil, a quien ya hab\u00eda comparado en dmc3, se nota la diferencia de dps tan abismalmente exagerada. El da\u00f1o que hace es rid\u00edculamente bajo a tal punto que el modo DMD se me hac\u00eda eterno. Y para a\u00f1adir m\u00e1s insulto los combos que hacen un da\u00f1o m\u00e1s o menos decente, tienen una posibilidad rid\u00edcula de fallar, haci\u00e9ndolos in\u00fatiles, no los puedes cancelar, dej\u00e1ndote vulnerable al da\u00f1o, pero los enemigos si que te lo pueden cancelar, lo que es probable ya que estas vulnerable, por lo que son b\u00e1sicamente un bonito adorno con una utilidad pr\u00e1ctica casi nula. Es de lejos el peor personaje del juego.\n\nPero lo peor, la raz\u00f3n por la que deje de jugar el juego en el modo DMD, es el cambio del sistema guardado que hicieron. Un cambio que el \u00fanico objetivo es forzarte a grindear. En los primero 3 dmc en las dificultades m\u00e1s altas siempre guardaba antes de los jefes porque sab\u00eda que iba necesitar objetos y no quer\u00eda desperdiciarlos. Asi tambien iba a cumulando las gemas rojas del nivel, por lo que cada vez que llegaba al jefe iba un poquito mejor preparado. Sin importar cuantas veces muriera no sent\u00eda que estaba perdiendo el tiempo, ya que cada muerte me dejaba un poquito mejor preparado y de paso pod\u00eda gestionar cuantos y que objetos estaba dispuesto a invertir en cada pelea. Aqui no, aqui si te mueres, te jodes, perdiste todos tus objetos usados. Y para empeorarlo todo, gracias a la porqueria que es el men\u00fa, consid\u00e9rate afortunado si por accidente no selecciona la opci\u00f3n errada, lo que me paso muchisimas veces, aumentando a\u00fan m\u00e1s el desperdicio de recursos y la frustraci\u00f3n.\n\nY ese es el \u00faltimo punto, lo jodidamente frustrante que es este jugeo. No s\u00f3lo est\u00e1s luchando con la maldita c\u00e1mara que a este punto ya se que es una caracter\u00edstica cl\u00e1sica del juego, pero joder, ya arreglenla. Sino que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 el desperdicio de objetos, que si crees que no fue deliberada, me sorprender\u00e9 si te graduaste de primaria. Y tambi\u00e9n tenemos enemigos que no te dejan atacar por minutos enteros. Esto se hace rid\u00edculamente eterno en DMD donde el tiempo que requiere matar enemigos se alarga. Las Chimeras son un ejemplo de esto. Utilizan su ataque de mover las lianas al azar tan a menudo que pr\u00e1cticamente tienes que matarlas con armas de fuego y con Dante eso se echara una eternidad, aun con Pandora, sin mencionar que arruina por completo el dinamismo y variedad del juego haci\u00e9ndolo repetitivo y aburrido. En la batalla del cuarto de contenci\u00f3n pasa lo mismo, hay tantos enemigos que simplemente no hay tiempo de atacar haciendo la batalla larga y tediosa y no hablo de la pelea con Sanctus porque ah\u00ed si me da una embolia. \n\nY para finalizar, abuso m\u00e1s descarado: los logros. Mientras que en los primeros dmc me saque todos los logros pasandomelos en cada dificultad y el palacio sangriento y ya, aqu\u00ed se esforzaron por hacer los logros lo m\u00e1s tediosos y frustrantes que pudieran, un gran logro en un juego de devil may cry debo decir. Debes matar a los jefes con estilo SSS, pero no hay forma de enfrentarlos solo a ellos, por lo que divi\u00e9rtete repitiendo todo el nivel si por casualidad los matas con SS, como me paso tres veces, y lo de pasarte todos los niveles en rango S en DMD, la gracia de ese reto en el DMC3 era que lo pod\u00edas hacer en facil, asi que si fallabas solo habr\u00edas desperdiciado algunos minutos, y eran minutos de juego muy divertidos, r\u00e1pidos y fren\u00e9ticos, pero con lo frustrante, tedioso y repetitivo que se hace el modo DMD por s\u00ed mismo, bueno, desde un principio decid\u00ed ni molestarme en sacarlos. Claro que el juego result\u00f3 ser a\u00fan peor de lo que esperaba, por lo que al final ni me molest\u00e9 en sacar logros que ya hab\u00eda planeado obtener, como el de completar el juego en todos los niveles de dificultad. Ah, por cierto, en que porqueria de juego cuando te lo pasas el modo normal no sacas el del modo f\u00e1cil de una vez? De verdad, que vagancia de los programadores, es que ni se esforzaron por disimularlo.\n\nY aqui termina mi biblia de rese\u00f1a para este juego. Una verdadera decepci\u00f3n para mi que era un gran fan de esta saga. Realmente espero que dmc5 me recupere. Si llegaste hasta aqu\u00ed, realmente me sorprende que alguien se moleste en leer todo lo que escrib\u00ed. De verdad muchas gracias por tomarte el tiempo para hacerlo.", "timestamp_created": 1691733802, "timestamp_updated": 1691733802, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143840991": {"recommendationid": "143840991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066563551", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1691728215}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty raw, i'd say it's as good as DMC3", "timestamp_created": 1691728297, "timestamp_updated": 1691728297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143826662": {"recommendationid": "143826662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108601676", "num_games_owned": 648, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 2997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2997, "last_played": 1691710808}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, not as good as 3 (haven't played 5 yet).

my favourite game of the series. I love the music, Nero, Kyrie and Dante in my opinion plays better in this one than in any of the previous ones, only DMC3 may come a little bit above this(in terms of Dante's gameplay). Some boss fights are kinda of anoying and the variety of these is kinda mid, to be frank. But the visuals, the direction, the story, the character and enemy design, the enviromental design and the music are without shadow of a doubt my favourites of the whole series, only DMC5 comes close to rivaling that statement, specially in the music department, where I think DMC5 takes the cake by a long shot. \nSo yeah I really like this game even though I recognize that in some aspects, it can feel flat or uninteresting. But because of some nostalgia and love for this type of game and general aesthetic I still feel very passionate about this.\nAnd hope you will find something of a similar feeling after playing it.

Achievements that is another annoying story get stylish rank and defeat boss that is way too much even for experienced players and i'am not  that good at devil may cry series, and also obtaining s rank on every difficulty that is also way too much but i guess it is possible to do it.

If you interested in gaining all achievements and burning a lot of nerves i cannot recommend you this game, because you gonna need to have at least five extra monitors keyboards and mouses, because

Do you understand how embarrassed i was the entire time? Do you know what it's like to be taunted so hot like, and then falling for it? multiple times? Let me give you graphic detail. There i was in call, streaming the game my bromeo got me, and then.. it starts a tutorial. So i got the basics down (i loved that he kept getting angry when i just spammed my gun and he would spam back) but soon.. Tragedy had struck, i couldn't figure out how to do a gay ass combo. So the whole time im being rooted on while this bot claps at me constantly like a damn dog (i don't mind) , and in my fit of anger i just kept falling for it, over and over and over. Until i spammed my keyboard and got it down. So, my villain arc began. He continued to taunt me until i just started shooting him, and soon we were face to face just angrily shooting each other, i found it hilarious until he then rammed his hot sexy sword into me.

many platforming sections and the lock on doesnt work well at all, so half the time bs having to do with these blue orbs that act like sonic orbs you hone in on work like crap, they fill like they just are there to bloat the gameplay. This game also suffers from annoying puzzles that are just a drag, the pacing of this game just gets so bad as soon as you reach the castle, and after that it just drags on and on. The story isnt important, say hello to Nero and then goodbye. Nero is pretty boring honestly.

This is most definitely one of my personal favorites in the series with (unsurprisingly) extremely fun gameplay mixed with loveable cornball writing and cheesy one liners. Having that in one package of pure stylistic badassery, and where\u2019s better to start a review of any DMC other than the Smokin\u2019 Sexy stylish combat, I\u2019ll start off with Nero \nThe devil bringer arm is badass as all hell, probably one of my favorite tools in the game, using it to snatch an enemy to you do a delay hit combo B whilst revving the Red Queen hit after hit EX-streaking them, snatching them again and using the bringer arm to slam them into the the ground violently is so badass and satisfying, really makes you *feel* like a hot-headed teenager with the exaggerated swagger of Sparda. Red Queen & blue rose are both also great tools, even if a little limiting at times and not really being able to stagger enemies with blue rose, (which is a change they made in DMCV\u2014and a great one at that, but that\u2019s a review for another day.) it\u2019s still mountains of fun.\nWhile Nero isn\u2019t as technically robust as Dante i think he still has a great level of control and variety\u2014especially when you start using charge shots, jump cancels, and start nailing those perfect EX-act\u2019s with the Red Queen, the timing is brutal & unforgiving but puts a heavy skill ceiling on him in that regard. The timing and split second decisions of playing any DMC game just feels like a big puzzle with multiple options on how to style the everliving f*ck out of your opponents and what certain weaknesses to exploit and if you want to do that and have your style meter go down. \n\nNow, As much as I love playing as Dante it just didn\u2019t entirely work for me at times personally due the reused levels, it makes your time with him a lot less special. I know the devs didn\u2019t really have time but hey, what can you do (+it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore since DMCV exists) I absolutely love Dante in this game, cocky as always with an unprecedented level of skill in kicking demon ass, not only does this game have the classic \u201cWhat the hell is this?!\u201d Line, but introduced switching styles on the fly with the D-pad, which opened his gameplay massively in being able to string together fun yet complex combos. I can\u2019t really give any examples of combos that I enjoy doing like I was able to do with Nero due to dante being much more\u2026well, Dante. I will try my best though: playing as Dante is like making a playground or building a set you made with a massive bucket of loose Lego\u2019s, there\u2019s no other feeling that can compare to using the rebellion to combo someone, upper slicing them hit em twice drop it jump cancel rapid fire guns to rainstorm finishing it off with a full Rebellion combo B and taunting. Dante isn\u2019t fun because he\u2019s Dante, Dante is fun because he is a playground of tools to do whatever you want and s|-|itpost on demons because you can. \n\nMoving to the story I don\u2019t really have much to say, I\u2019m really glad Nero was made and introduced for this game, ever since I played it as a kid I loved him and how he acted. He\u2019s righteous, funny, and filled with a level of loyalty to kyrie I don\u2019t think that can be replicated in another game for me\u2026.or maybe my rose tinted glasses are still on and I refuse to take them off. Dante & Nero interacting is always a real treat, they managed to write them both decently well and map a blueprint that was eventually used for the writing in DMCV to a great effect imo. Dante at the beginning felt like this final boss with unpredictability Nero would never be able to catch up with, having the loveable goofy pizza munching demon Hunter posed as a cold blooded killer at the beginning was both shocking and intriguing, I like how the story and the characterization was handled here.\n\nAfter hours of gameplay and two play throughs, I think it\u2019s a good game despite \u201cnot being finished\u201d, I don\u2019t really have much else to say about the game aside from minor nitpicks and pacing issues I had (and the mentioned reused Dante levels). I can\u2019t really score this game at all due to those rose tinted glasses. but, can say: if you can get it, and you like DMC. you should, it\u2019s good. \n\n\n\nAlso: FUCK DICE GAME.", "timestamp_created": 1687718014, "timestamp_updated": 1687718014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140663335": {"recommendationid": "140663335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431768598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1687684099}, "language": "english", "review": "The time has come, and so have I\nI'll laugh last 'cuz you came to die\nThe damage done, the pain subsides\nAnd I can see the fear clear when I look in your eyes", "timestamp_created": 1687685033, "timestamp_updated": 1687685033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140649189": {"recommendationid": "140649189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227887476", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 7889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2544, "last_played": 1689712922}, "language": "english", "review": "the name of the game is Devil May Cry, but it was me who cried", "timestamp_created": 1687660029, "timestamp_updated": 1687660029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785162985324859619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140623426": {"recommendationid": "140623426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196927495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1687623305}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game man", "timestamp_created": 1687623416, "timestamp_updated": 1687623416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512922465801239014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140595304": {"recommendationid": "140595304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154745351", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1689562930}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game", "timestamp_created": 1687581774, "timestamp_updated": 1687581774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140524540": {"recommendationid": "140524540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299405836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1758, "last_played": 1688516090}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tremendo juegazo, DAnte siendo dante y Nero solo gritando Kyrie!!!, en fin muy buen special edition, eso si al juge con una sola mano con Lady y Trish, la jugabilidad con Vergil es Dios.

Una jugabilidad basada en un sistema de lucha muy pulido y profundo en tipos de armas y multitud de combos, con exploraci\u00f3n y puzles demasiado poco frecuentes. La narrativa es mucho m\u00e1s elaborada y compleja que en las tres entregas previas, aunque sigue sin ser un punto fuerte. Un dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico acorde a la saga, pero m\u00e1s refinado y detallado, el cual destaca por un potente acabado t\u00e9cnico. Destacan la solidez de los escenarios, los modelados de los personajes y la fluidez de las animaciones, siendo visualmente muy llamativo.\n\nEs un juego m\u00e1s largo y variado que los anteriores, aunque algo menos exigente en la dificultad de combates y plataformeo, destacando los dise\u00f1os de escenarios diferentes donde la jugabilidad va cambiando ligeramente de enfoque. La 2\u00aa mitad se hace algo pesada al repetir algunos niveles y enemigos con Dante, a\u00fan con ciertas variaciones, elevando la duraci\u00f3n de forma un poco tosca e innecesaria, algo que ya ocurr\u00eda con Devil May Cry 3. Una entrega muy continuista que perfecciona la acci\u00f3n y el gui\u00f3n, pero que ya mostraba s\u00edntomas de repetici\u00f3n y una necesidad de cambios para mantener fresca y relevante la saga.\n\n8\u20192\n\nAn\u00e1lisis completo: https://yexreviews.wordpress.com/2023/06/19/devil-may-cry-4-2008-special-edition-2015/", "timestamp_created": 1687213703, "timestamp_updated": 1687213703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140356281": {"recommendationid": "140356281", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013458535", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1687210856}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1687211052, "timestamp_updated": 1687211052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140327946": {"recommendationid": "140327946", "author": {"steamid": "76561199388562279", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1687267184}, "language": "english", "review": "i am the storm that is approaching!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1687174099, "timestamp_updated": 1687174099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140322172": {"recommendationid": "140322172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048061387", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1688782280}, "language": "english", "review": "this game fucking sucks", "timestamp_created": 1687163099, "timestamp_updated": 1687602077, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140318486": {"recommendationid": "140318486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018818592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1691294843}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who played the Xbox360 version of this game back in the day, I must say, the fact I made the effort of beating Hell and Hell difficulty and used a not-super character to complete the Bloody Palace speaks volumes about how enjoyable this game's combat system can be.

As the Goddess of Water and a lover of action-packed games, allow me to share a review that highlights the positive aspects of the game while acknowledging its flaws.\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is an exhilarating addition to the iconic Devil May Cry series, offering fans and newcomers alike a chance to immerse themselves in the stylish and fast-paced combat that the franchise is known for. The game's visuals are simply breathtaking, with detailed environments and character designs that truly draw players into its dark and haunting world.\n\nThe combat mechanics are where Devil May Cry 4 truly shines. As Dante and Nero, players have access to an array of flashy and impressive moves, unleashing devastating combos on hordes of demonic foes. The combat system rewards skill and precision, making every battle feel like a dance of blades and bullets.\n\nMoreover, the inclusion of Nero, with his unique Devil Bringer arm, adds a refreshing twist to the gameplay, allowing for a mix of close-quarters combat and long-range attacks. This dynamic duo of playable characters ensures that the game never feels repetitive, keeping players on their toes throughout the adventure.\n\nAdditionally, the level design is imaginative and varied, showcasing stunning set pieces and challenging platforming sections that demand both wits and reflexes. The seamless transition between battles and exploration keeps the pace exhilarating, ensuring there's rarely a dull moment.\n\nHowever, even in this demon-slaying masterpiece, there are a few flaws that must be acknowledged. One of the game's most significant drawbacks is the backtracking. Players are required to replay several levels with the other character, which can feel repetitive and hinder the game's pacing.\n\nFurthermore, the storyline, while intriguing, can be convoluted at times, making it challenging to fully grasp the motivations of certain characters and the overall plot direction.\n\nLastly, some may find the difficulty spikes a bit too steep, leading to moments of frustration, especially during boss battles, where mastering the intricacies of the combat system becomes crucial.\n\nDespite these flaws, Devil May Cry 4 remains an exhilarating and visually stunning action game that's sure to captivate fans of the genre. With its stylish combat, imaginative world, and memorable characters, it delivers an experience that's well worth diving into.

The other thing is they did the dante section dirty. You just have too repeat the same level you came across with nero literally repeat. Also the secret missions are bs too. Some are impossible to finish. Lastly most of the boss fights are just not that good. Feels like the game is not fully finished because of the dante section.

You have Nero, Dante, Vergil, Lady and Trish. The character roster is the highlight for me, it's a shame that Trish or Lady did not return as playable characters in DMC5, I feel like that was a huge missed opportunity.\nOverall this game is insanely fun and I absolutely love it even though it feels a bit like wasted potential", "timestamp_created": 1684356282, "timestamp_updated": 1684356282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138423220": {"recommendationid": "138423220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144164931", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1684203783}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fine. \n\nI think personally out of the DMC games I have played (1, 3, and now 4) this is the most whatever. I'm excluding 2 because that game sucks way more but I'm not allowing professionals.\n\nLets start with the pros:\nI think the combat is really good in Nero's campaign. I think devil bringer is a very cool concept and the ways you can extend combos on smaller mobs makes the fights less monotonous, and the special moves on bigger boys is always nice to see.\n\nI think the concept of story is pretty good with how instead of these religious people worshipping an angel or something, it's a demon. I enjoy that idea how you have a very basic religion and slowly you uncover the dark folds you aren't meant to see.\n\nDante's combat is also good with style-switching being a great idea since in 3 the single style you get until you can switch at a statue really promotes a boring system of mainly using only 1 style.\n\nI think the upgrades are cool and a good few of them actually have cool impacts in fights.\n\nAgnus is a cool antagonist, and Credo is a cool psuedo-protag for the short time he has.\n\nAnd that's all I can think of! Now onto the cons:\n\nNero and pretty much all of the beginning character designs are REALLY basic and feel more like basic JRPG party members than DMC characters, it lacks it's sense of identity and it even shows with some of the other designs like Dante (why does he have cowboy boots or whatever those are?)\n\nEven though I spoke of how Dante's combat was fun, it's too short lived since you basically just do a reverse of Nero's journey with few upgrades, and you never really get the time to use them.\n\nBosses in this game are atrocious. There never feels like there's a point where they get good. You beat them relatively easily as Nero, then do the same with Dante. \n\nSpeaking of boss fights, who gave the okay on the Sanctus fights? The first fight wasn't fun, THE SAVIOR FIGHT WAS A SLOGFEST, and the second fight inside the savior is just as boring except Sanctus gains some bullshit homing sword attack that basically kills you after spending your time trying to break a shitty forcefield and actually HIT the cunt. \n\nPart of playing something like DMC is to have a fight that engages you and actually challenges you, NONE OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN HERE.\n\nSide note: I know there's a second phase. I couldn't be fucked to even take the time to beat the first phase.\n\nThe landscape makes no sense. You want me to believe that Nero goes through an abandoned mineshaft and just shows up at a massive ice castle? Sure whatever. But then you want me to believe he goes through another and winds up in a FUCKING JUNGLE??? \n\nI know DMC3 had very similar fuckery with it's tower, but it wasn't nearly as bad at all here. in 3 you could be like \"yeah it's weird but the tower is really big\" here it's just plain silly.\n\nOverall, I can see why capcom wanted to reboot after this game, it's all over the place and wants to do more than it has. If they stuck to more stylized designs, potentially made the game a bit longer, and made the bosses better, there would be a really great game here. Too bad there isn't and it came out in like 2008 with SE coming out in 2015.\n\nDecent game, but do not expect much, this game does not have it.", "timestamp_created": 1684306981, "timestamp_updated":

The new main character is Nero who may a bit of a decisive character as he lacks the charisma and charm that Dante had and honestly just isn't as funny. Furthermore, Nero has a completely different set of weapons and combos that are simpler making them better for newer players, but not as engaging for experienced players. This can be a make or break for some as you are stuck with Nero until the end of the game where you get to play as Dante again. The big selling point I'd say for this game is the gameplay which has improved upon the third games combat making it even better. I recommend this to anyone interested in getting into Devil May Cry as this is the start of Nero's story.

The game is also quite short unless you plan on playing all the characters. You still get your dosage of insane cutscene action but the fights, even with a much better combat than in DMC 1-3, leave much to be desired.\n\nWhen it came out it no doubt looked the best and had the best combat in the entire series, but DMC 5 came out a few years ago. A game which is better in every department and is also similarily priced for some odd reason.\n\nIf you'd like to buy another DMC game, get this one for sure. It goes on sale sometimes and on sale it's quite easy to recommend. However. If you don't really crave for more DMC and just want the best - get DMC 5.

He has a unique combat style based on grabbing and beating the shit out of demons with his buster arm. He has a sword that revs like an engine that you can do special fire attacks with if you time it right and a revolver that shoots 2 bullets. Nero is a very simple character but an incredibly fun one too! His DT is one of the most unique in the series and is very awesome, plus the buster animation on bosses while in DT are godlike.\n\nDante is also extremely fucking cool in this game and the full weapon wheel plus the style switching system is truly revolutionary for the series. His weapons take a while to get used to compared to the other games and are a bit weird to combo into eachother but I have played the game only once so maybe I just suck,\n\nThe combat, in general, is really smoking good.....BUT\n\nTHE BAD:\nThis game is filled to the brim with problems. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.\n\nThe enemies suck. I can't put it any other way. When playing as Nero it is not that big of an issue since you can just buster them as a solution to any problem. When you play as Dante tho, HOLY SHIT. Almost every enemy either ignores your attacks,  perma blocks them or just keeps running/teleporting away. While Dante is way more powerful than Nero, he actually feels worse to play, because the enemies were never meant for him in the first place.\n\nWhat do I mean by this?\n\nThis game is so blatantly unfinished.\nYou fight the main bosses not once, not twice....BUT 3 DIFFERENT FUCKING TIMES. WHO THOUGHT OF THIS???? The bosses in general are pretty generic but have great buster animations, with the exception of Credo which might be one of the best fights in the series. \nThe worst part and the DEFINITIVE PROOF this game is not finished is that Mister Dante has no unique levels and has to replay trough all of Nero's levels.......BUT IN REVERSE. He only gets one unique bossight and it is one of the worst bosses ever made in DMC history: THE SAVIOR. Fuck this thing.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are just shit and kill momentum, there is no fun to using beyblades to break walls or spinning a dice to get trough a door and I especially dislike the shitty platforming with spikes everywhere .  I like puzzles and platforming! Good puzzles and good platforming, not this shitty excuse to artificially extend the game's length. \n\n\nThe story\nThe story is there??? I mean it's not necessarily bad....but nobody inside the game really seems to care about it either?!?!? Why is anything happening? Why does the evil pope guy try to make people believe he is a hero by summoning demons to attack them and then be saved by him? I thought the church already controlled the entire city??\nThis story can be summed up as : Dante goes to vacation and kills a cringe religious group with his nephew.\nThe characters are pretty forgettable, except for Dante and Nero. Credo is cool but doesn't do that much and everyone else is just an evil villain/demon or evil scientist. Kyrie is also just a generic love interest.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game?\n\nBecause the combat is that good. \n\nIf you are looking for an action game just to kill things,you will enjoy DMC 4 a lot! The game is also very replayable liike most DMCs with additional difficulties that change up the gameplay and Lady, Trish and Vergil waiting for you to try them out.

Mejoraron el gameplay de Vergil de forma incre\u00edble compar\u00e1ndolo con el DMC3 Special Edition.\nEl poder jugar con Lady y Trish es una idea muy buena y hace que el juego se sienta mucho mas completo jugablemente que el DMC4 original.\nPuntos malo: La verdad es que aunque me encanta el juego, se vuelve muy repetitivo. Ya que algo de lo que pecan las ediciones especiales de esta saga es agregar a Vergil (junto a Lady y Trish en este caso) en todo el recorrido de la historia principal sin su propia historia fuera de las cutscenes de inicio y final. Si ya de por si el juego se siente repetitivo por el backtracking que es toda la parte jugable con Dante, ahora es el triple de repetitivo.\n\nLo recomiendo? Si.

You also have the option to play as the beautiful Trish and Lady but there are a lot less lines. I would recommend playing as them after you completed the story. Dante is still Dante with a lot more lines. The characters from before are a lot more fleshed out now in this game. The puzzles are still there but are not bad. A far cry from dmc 2 which is a good thing. The weird camera angles are still there but not as bad. The soundtrack is a banger and really good. This game was a lot of fun to play.

I know the Devil May Cry series is difficult and prides itself on getting over that hump and getting great at the games with stylish play but the foundation here is iffy. Nero is really fun to play as and the enemies and boss fights he has are a blast but everyone else is where the game suffers with the exception of Vergil. Dante, Trish and Lady are all landlocked and when the enemies are built around being grabbed and either being brought to you or bringing you to them then it becomes a big problem. Vergil has his summon swords so playing as him has no problems but everyone else is frustrating. Whenever I see Dante mains pull off stuff with inertia and all that jazz in their style vids it's always the same three enemies and I'm not gonna play a game that requires a character with such mastery to be cool some of the time and blast dudes with the best shotgun in the series the rest of the time. Also the proud souls system is totally unneeded. DmC: Devil May Cry does something like this and while it's still unneeded when four outta six of the games in the series use red orbs for everything I can at least say I know when I'm getting upgrade points there and the prices are justified in the single digits, making it easier to know how many I need to grind out for upgrades there. DMC4 is really frustrating in how half baked it is and the special edition only makes me sad knowing there's a lot of potential that DMC5 goes hard at when all the changes made we're just adding characters that still struggle with problems that only Nero and Vergil are equiped to deal with. I'm gonna hit yes on the recommend if you wanna playthrough the entire series, but if you're the type of person who's okay with watching a playthrough and moving on to better games in a series so you have context for things that move over between entries and storylines then I'd suggest you just open a new tab and go on YouTube.", "timestamp_created": 1680272260, "timestamp_updated": 1680272260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575815439224243164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135773627": {"recommendationid": "135773627", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014051582", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 613, "last_played": 1687132559}, "language": "english", "review": "dante is in this game", "timestamp_created": 1680223754, "timestamp_updated": 1680223754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596404910087585449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135768382": {"recommendationid": "135768382", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088368087", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1679624451}, "language": "english", "review": "ass", "timestamp_created": 1680215945, "timestamp_updated": 1680215945, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458276331424713135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135717381": {"recommendationid": "135717381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839427870", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1272, "last_played": 1680146237}, "language": "english", "review": "has nero\n", "timestamp_created": 1680146296, "timestamp_updated": 1680146296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135696700": {"recommendationid": "135696700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041783853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1680389533}, "language": "english", "review": "You Should've Been The One To Fill My Dark Soul With Light!

The mechanic of getting enemies to you/teleporting to them easier is rad, but it feels more like an arcade-y entry and the two campaigns added to the special edition really highlight that where there is no story, just new movesets on the same maps. It's fun though, and it still has some excellent vibes.

This of course doesn't change the fact that this is still an unfortunate step down from DMC 3 that clearly suffered a lot from a lack of development time along with having a plethora of weird gimmicky ideas that only serve to drag down the overall experience. On the other hand though, I cannot think of many examples this is a prime example of a game that's carried so hard by one element being insanely good that it can make you somewhat overlook the fact that almost everything surrounding it doesn't really do anything for you.\n\nThe movesets of both Nero and Dante are really sick in this game, Nero playing in a very different way that appeals to me perfectly, and Dante showcasing just how you can cram even more avenues for chaining absurd combos together into a system that already had a lot of that. Nero's greater focus on air mobility and enemy juggling just appeals to me perfectly, giving the player enough tools to stay airborne for way longer without having to become a god at the game to do so. The way the vast majority of his moves flow into each other so cleanly further adds to this and provides a certain sense of smoothness to his fighting style compared to the more jagged, visceral edge that defines Dante's playstyle. Speaking of Dante's playstyle, it absolutely rules here with the amount of tools you get at your disposal along with the absolutely deranged things you can chain together if you really want to get the most out of his capabilities. While I'm not good enough to take full advantage of it, the ability to change styles on the fly is nonetheless insanely cool and would make me want to keep trying to improve if not for the fact that actually interacting with the obstacles thrown your way are just not very engaging.\n\nCrafting such an in-depth, complex and fun combat engine and then making its only use cases 7 levels which are entirely reused, complete with enemies clearly not designed for Dante and anything new added being the worst thing ever is heartbreaking. The gimmicks introduced for this latter portion of the game are never anything that come across as interesting at all, with any challenges they introduce stemming more from being inconvenienced than providing an interesting shakeup to the formula. It's obviously made worse by the fact that these extra painful gimmicks are, as stated, located in stages that you've literally already fully gone through as Nero and are now just backtracking through for the 2nd half of the game. The enemies also suck to fight a lot of the time, with a lot of them not really having clear and simple counters with Dante, despite the absurd power he packs. This leads to a situation where each encounter takes place on one of two extremes, either everything is eviscerated in seconds, or you're stuck having to do something really finicky and awkward, grinding the pacing to a halt.\n\nMaybe I'd have been fine with this if not for the fact that it's not as if the level design was especially engaging the first time around anyway. Everything just feels a bit too small and lacking in any real setpieces or even atmosphere in a lot of cases that really made me love how 1 and 3 handled its stages. A lot of the extra mechanics and \"puzzles\" don't really feel good either, with a lot of them either feeling weirdly artificial or just janky (not in a fun way) to use. The gyro blades especially come to mind with the latter issue, where the player just had to push these big spinning blades through destructible walls and all that, but actually moving them where you wanted was a constantly imprecise pain. The dice sections also are just bad, no further explanation needed.\n\nThat said, one other thing I actually did like about the game was the narrative and cutscenes, as was expected. Whether it's the first half being dead serious but in this really goofy way mostly where everything feels super over the top, or the 2nd half which is just a lot of Dante being Dante but to an even greater extent than usual, it's just a great time. In the end it's really just like, DMC 4 is damn lucky that just swinging a sword around in it is one of the coolest things ever and that Dante is who he is, because these two things are really the main things stopping me from disliking the game. I was going to mess around with some of the other playable characters in this afterwards, given how cool I was finding certain aspects so fun for a while, but the 2nd half of the game really, really hurt my desire to replay this anytime soon, even if I'll still say that I enjoyed it to an extent regardless.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1679528023, "timestamp_updated": 1679528023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135144087": {"recommendationid": "135144087", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219629668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1684110624}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun no duh it's DMC.

"review": "(actual game time is 2 hours)\nAvoid this.\nI haven't played the other Devil May Cry games, except the reboot which I recommend. Devil May Cry 4 is bad, not as bad as Devil May Cry 3 which I couldn't even get past the first boss. But still bad, suffers with different problems.\nTo get the good out the way, the graphics are alright, the cutscenes are insanely good rendered in game, although there is an overabundance of gameplay cutscenes (Room locking and stuff) for some reason, to the point of not enjoying them. Some parts of the combat are okay, but it feels underwhelming.\n\nNow the bad, and there's a lot of it. The story and dialogue. I felt like there wasn't anything being explained. Having never played the first three stories, I had no clue what was going on here. I also assumed because it was a later game it would be more accessible, but no. Nothing was explained. There's barely any dialogue so the world feels empty (This is objective). \nThe tutorials whilst okay, they're not great, there's also an automatic combo system which is nice, but for some reason I think this disables the actual use of combos and actual moves? I wasn't able to dodge at all despite the game showing me how to (Hold R1, Press A and move left or right). Then the combat doesn't really hit any strong notes. The audio design is fine, but the style points system makes no sense, and the enemies feel extremely tanky despite this being on easy difficulty. \n\nAnd now the arguably worst part that made me stop playing. It's open world but you can't return to some areas after a certain point? Even more confusing is, there's no direction. You enter these random door areas, to find items or puzzles, but there often isn't any, or it's locked behind another thing (A problem I had with the reboot too, to be clear, all this is). The lack of direction, or just, objective markers, made this completely unplayable for me. I somehow had to magically get this Gyro power thing to this one place, but there is none around to do it? so...??? \nIt's actually hard to see how this has a 90% positive review score. This feels so undercooked. Also the settings menu is terrible, and the game requires a gamepad to be playable (they didn't bother changing the control scheme for Keyboard).", "timestamp_created": 1679133860,

Nero is really beginner friendly as he does not have styles like Dante and no other weapons besides his sword Red Queen and his gun Blue Rose. It may seem like Nero is boring to play, but his defining feature is his Devil Bringer, which using the right trigger, Nero uses a kind of finisher type move, with it having a cool animation once executed. It does not actually insta-kill enemies (Besides a couple fodder enemies) but it deals good damage and can even be used on bosses. It also acts as a grappling hook for level traversal and even combat, being able to grab enemies and close the distance. His devil trigger is literally a stand, but it has a cool design plus adds new Devil Bringer animations so that's nice.\n\nDante has some great changes too, in DMC3 the player was limited to just 1 style, with leveling up being difficult when it can take half a play through just to level it up to max. In DMC4, Dante can switch to all of his styles in a flash and has a 5th style called Dark Slayer he acquires later on in the game. Plus, leveling up styles are now tied with red orbs, so leveling them up is easier to do. In my opinion, DMC3 had the superior arsenal for Dante, but DMC4's array of weapons aren't so bad themselves, Rebellion being the basic sword, Gilgamesh being the hand to hand combat weapon, and Lucifer which summons explosive red spikes. Rebellion is nothing new, having all it's move set from previous games. Gilgamesh is a lot like Beowulf, even sharing some moves it had in DMC3, but it has some of it's own special moves. Lucifer is a cool idea, but its move set is lacking in variety and doesn't really feel all that nice to use. Dante may not have the best weapons in this game, but his style switching is a massive improvement and really adds more depth to playing him.\n\nThere are other playable characters, those being Lady, Trish, and Vergil. They don't have any new levels, but the option to play them is at least there. However, the biggest flaw this game has, is the fact that Dante doesn't even get his own levels. What I mean by this is that once you are given control of Dante, you literally just go backwards through the entire game, playing all the levels Nero did, facing 3 of the same bosses Nero already fought (This is how Dante gets his devil arms, but it is still weird to not give him is own bosses), and the final fight is fought with Dante, but the final fight is pretty trash comparable to the likes of Arkham in the last game. Nero may be the main focus of the game this time around, but to not give The Legendary Demon Hunter is own levels in the main campaign is pretty lazy and lowers the experience of playing as him. Bloody Palace though makes Dante worth playing for sure.\n\nThere are a lot of enemy types that are WAY too annoying to fight unless you spam a certain move. The enemies are okay though but it is just annoying that there are so many that make the game less enjoyable. The bosses are a step down compared to DMC3, but most of them are good for the most part. Although some bosses seem a lot easier as Nero than Dante but that's mostly due to Nero's Devil Bringer. The Savior is the final boss of the game, and is pretty bad. It's designed to incorporate platforming, but it just feels like a chore to go to one platform to hit this specific part and then repeat that like 6 times.\n\nNow for the story, it is pretty lack luster. Introducing a whole new cast of characters are great, and all the characters have their own motivations and kind of have personalities. Nero is basically just a Dante rip off in this game, but thankfully he has his own moments that can't be performed with Dante. Nero's love interest, Kyrie, is a pretty stale and under developed character, barely speaking even though it seems like something should be said in that moment, and what she does say is pretty bare bones and generic. Dante is his usual self, although he is a lot more mature and professional. The actual story I won't talk about too much for the sake of spoilers, but it is pretty simple and again, lack luster with a few cool moments in between, the introduction of Nero and his development moments are easily the highlight of the story.\n\nOverall, Good game-play, good bosses for the most part, lack luster story, and is worth a play.", "timestamp_created": 1678942066, "timestamp_updated": 1679530554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134732331": {"recommendationid": "134732331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003846865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1679033063}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm 10 missions into this and I gotta say, it's awful compared to DMC3. No matter how good it is after this, it's not worth a buy simply based on how incompetent the general design is. To put some bullet points out:\n\n- Camera is just terrible, always at a bad angle, never frames fights properly.\n- Enemies attack from offscreen constantly. This was NOT a problem in DMC3, the only time it ever happened to me was when an Enigma began firing but the camera angle changed. Here? Every enemy does it.\n- Nero's \"delay\" inputs on ground are like twice as long as DMC3 Dante's and it's a giant pain when trying to combo. Seriously, you need to wait like three quarters of a second to do the RQ combo 2 and 3. It's absurd.\n- Bosses universally bad so far, Dante in particular is just the laziest input-reading crap I've ever seen. He even has iframes in neutral when you're not supposed to hit him, and can inexplicably ignore damage from things like Nero's level 3 charge shots when he feels like it. Just bleh.\n- Two enemy types that are tolerable: Scarecrows and the basic Angelos, everything else is some variety of cancer. Even the basic Angelos are annoying because of the shield and their offscreen attacks, but they're at least slow enough that they're not a pain to kill.\n- - In particular, the Mephistos and Fausts are genuinely the worst enemies I've ever seen in one of these games or anything in the genre.\n- - Also, every enemy has way too much health and it makes combat unsatisfying. Know how many hits it takes to kill a basic Pride Hell in DMC3 on normal with Rebellion? Like 5-6 depending on your moves. How many to kill a scarecrow here? Try 10+ unless you're hitting exceed on every move with Nero. Yes it makes combos easier, but at the same time it makes you feel WEAK.\n- Level design is boring and sometimes outright confusing. They literally had to add a sprint because of all the time you'd waste running around at normal speed. The game also really wants to be Zelda sometimes and every time it tries to I feel my soul dying.\n- [strike]Visual style pales in comparison to any other game in the series yes even DMC2. It's just boring to look at. It reminds me of Darksiders 1, but with less visual detail.[/strike] I finished DMC5, it's even worse in this respect, so much so that I actually think 4's environments are good in comparison. So, I can't honestly say this anymore.\n- Not being able to grapple with lockon is the dumbest control decision I've ever seen. There are literally forward+input combos specifically to avoid needing to fumble the lockon constantly mid-combo.\n- Speaking of lockon, it sucks. Every time I hit R1 and there are more than 2-3 enemies onscreen it will always pick the enemy I am not intending to attack. Even sometimes when there are just two enemies, it decides that the one WAY over there is the one I want to attack and not the one right in front of me.\n- Sometimes Nero will just decide to run in the literal opposite of the direction I'm holding on the stick, even adjusting his angle to continue moving the wrong way if I tilt the stick a bit. This isn't a controller problem because I can see on my second monitor that the controller is giving the correct input. Sometimes this even happens in combat.\n\netc. etc. I could go on and I'm barely halfway through the normal story mode. Do not pay for this, not even on sale.\n\nEDIT:\nBeat the rest, it's even worse overall. Only good part is Dante when the camera works and the enemies aren't built specifically for Nero. Everything else is trash. Good god those last two levels. I even knew the dice trick going in (using devil bringer on it always lands it on the number it was showing when you hit it) and mission 19 felt like a test of patience. Not because it was hard, but because it took FOREVER. Both of Sanctus' fights suck too. Jesus what were they thinking on this. I think the gameplay gave me brain damage because I can't even remember the story, gonna watch through it on youtube again before playing V.\n\nDo not buy this. I don't care what DMC superfans say about the \"technicality\" of this game and how it has the \"highest skill ceiling\". The story mode sucks, the characters aren't fun except for Dante sometimes, any non-hardcore player will be continually annoyed by the incompetent controls and design, and worst of all it's not even really a challenge on normal like 1 or 3. I died one time to lasers because I got juggled for literally seven hits in a row while laughing at the absurdity. Despite all the offscreen attacks, despite all the crap controls, despite the Blitz trying its hardest to be a figurative gameplay tumor in the 2 times I encountered it, nothing really got my blood pumping.\n\nCompare to DMC3, where I died at least once on every boss but Worm, Vergil 2, and Arkham (because I used items on Arkham since he's about on par with the bosses from this game). Where the bosses were almost all engaging enough that I at least cared to learn their mechanics. Where even regular enemies were sometimes a bit scary in the beginning due to their numbers and damage. Where the story was interesting from the start. Where when I finished my first run, I went \"Damn I can't wait to go back to this after 4 and 5\".\n\nFor this game? I'd return it if I could. I paid $8CDN and I feel like I was ripped off. Just buy 3 and play that. I hear 5 is great too.

[/h1]\n[h3] - Dante upon seeing trees. [/h3]\n\n[b] Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition [/b] is a 2015 re-release of 2008's Devil May Cry 4. Despite that date, this game has a worse PC port than DmC: Devil May Cry(which came out in 2013, two years earlier), and in fact might be the worst PC port I have ever played. This is a port so bad, I am providing this review with 12 MINUTES of play time. I only got past the first MISSION before I decided \"nah fuck this game\". I generally judge various aspects of the game in my reviews, but 12 minutes isn't enough to judge. \n\nNOTE: I have decided to change some shit, you'll figure out which below, and I'll try to get through this game. Money was used to acquire the game, I'll play the game dammit.\n\n[h2] The port [/h2]\nThis port has various issues with it. Actually fucking stupid issues that DmC did not have. For example, the game will randomly stutter, which I don't think should be occurring in this game on a system that can run games like Modern Warfare II and DOOM Eternal.\n\nNow the elephant in the room; the controls. In DmC, the menus are keyboard only but that is countered with the GOD-TIER in-game mouse and keyboard controls. Here, the mouse works in menus(with weird implementation), but the mouse is outright NOT supported in game. And the default keyboard controls themselves are weird. Space isn't even to jump, it is to lock on. To jump, you press something like K, which is right next to I, the default melee attack bind. Sure, you can rebind these, but there's five fucking characters there are controls for, so you'll need to rebind for EVERY SINGLE ONE. It is very clear this was made for controllers(and I do have one myself so I could just pull one up if I wanted to, however not every PC player has one), but so was DmC, and that game had really good PC controls. Furthermore, the tutorial prompts only show the Xbox 360 buttons, not even the keyboard ones.\n\n[h2] Verdict [/h2]\n\nI hereby declare Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition as \n[h3] MAYBE GOOD GAME, SHIT PORT.

controlled using the devil arm is fluid and dynamic the other characters are okay but having the grapple arm in this one is way better then devil may cry 5, really enjoyed the gameplay with Nero mostly but  you can play it over and over not get bored of playing with Nero just be nice if there was more bosses to use Nero's grappling arm that would of been fun, gameplay is super smooth to, Dantes move sets are a little awkard compared to Nero's if you like action games this is the game to play, overall great game.", "timestamp_created": 1678312889, "timestamp_updated": 1678312889,

on GitHub just to explain my position on the cursed game.\nHere's a short list of what I recommend if you're thinking of buying this game:\n\n[olist]\n  [*]DON'T BUY THIS GAME\n  [*]Buy DMC5 if you didn't\n  [*]Buy DMC3 and download DDMK mod if you didn't play this game\n  [*]If you have one or both of these games, DONT BUY THIS GAME\n  [*]It's half baked\n  [*]And feels very stiff to play

etc, however the DMC team over at Capcom seem persistent to give you blurry AA in the case of DMC5 (TAA) and forced depth of field and motion blur with DMC4 with no option to disable them, whatever the case your getting blurry image quality whether you like it or not with the DMC team, I would also expect the same with the next DMC game too.\n\nIt's little cheap having to fight the same boss twice and have lots of backtracking with reused levels, also if you previously purchased items and use them (Purchased from the statue or found in a level) you will have to start over right from the start of a level without those items, same is true if continuing from a checkpoint, you only get one chance to use them despite having to fight all the same enemies/bosses again if you die, which is only that way to extend the game, if we wanted extra challenge to begin with we could just not purchase the items.\n\nUPDATE: you fight the same bosses THREE TIMES which is not only frustrating but really cheap that they could not come up any new ones, they even make you roll a dice to fight the same bosses you fought, if the dice lands on a position that's not white you have to fight hordes of enemies to fight the boss and if you die during the boss fight you will have to roll the dice again.\n\nBased on this I do not recommend the game.\n\nIn saying that the first half of DMC4 is good despite the mentioned issues, but maybe wait for a sale and expect plenty of frustration with the second half if you do decide to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1676189889, "timestamp_updated":

I heard the levels aren't good but I actually enjoyed them and they mostly had enough exploration that I got lost sometimes. The way the levels have various breakable objects that give you money for upgrades and the way that beating enemies gives you points for skill upgrades reminds me of the feeling I get while playing my favourite CastleVania games and breaking candles for hearts and money. The castles and haunted forests and caves fit well with that series as well. I saw a review that mentioned the best way to play this game is by not using healing items and I agree, it doesn't send me too far back when I die and the game is too easy for if you use them so I recommend not doing so if you want to be challenged. My issues with this game is that the first levels are boring and you can't save the game half way through a level and the game doesn't tell you how to do some cool things that will really help you out with combat vs some enemies. But it is also fun to play a game that lets you figure out the weaknesses of enemies on your own again.

Along with three other characters that're unique but really let you reach new heights of character action.\n\nThe problem, I'd say, is that the missions tend to run on a bit long. While the areas and camera angles are absolutely stunning (especially for 2008), it's a bit easy to get turned around if you don't know where you're going. There are some frustrating puzzles and enemies (I'll never understand who thought the Dice Roll and Gyro blades were a good idea).  Half-way through the game you have to backtrack through the entire map and fight all the same bosses you did before-- then leading into the second to last boss which is... the worst boss ever. Which then leads into a boss rush where you fight all of the boss (except the best one) for a third time. Then you fight a pretty alright final boss. \n\nThe game... is a mixed bag. But I think it's totally worth it for the full Devil May Cry experience (if you're like me and like to play through all the games in order). As I said before, the combat is something unmatched until the fifth game, Dante being the most versatile action game protag there ever was and Nero being absolutely savage with his Buster take downs. Most of the bosses are great, ESPECIALLY the fight against Credo (that fight alone makes revisiting this game always worth it for me) and the second fight against Dante. The cut-scenes are some of the best we'll ever get in the series.\n\nWorth the buy.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1674983125, "timestamp_updated": 1674983125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131772727": {"recommendationid": "131772727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342165187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1690252071}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1674962356, "timestamp_updated": 1674962356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131762888": {"recommendationid": "131762888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294203516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1689224420}, "language": "english", "review": "Its more of the funny game", "timestamp_created": 1674949580, "timestamp_updated": 1674949580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131754191": {"recommendationid": "131754191", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131148587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1676175561}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Intento jugar este juego y no va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la pantalla de inicio del juego y se cierra, alguna idea de como solucionarlo", "timestamp_created": 1674939879, "timestamp_updated": 1674939879, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131735874": {"recommendationid": "131735874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103346032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 788, "last_played": 1675650466}, "language": "english", "review": "Atomic!", "timestamp_created": 1674922495, "timestamp_updated": 1674922495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131691252": {"recommendationid": "131691252", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233070323", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 4398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2613, "last_played": 1676478338}, "language": "english", "review": "reasons why special edition is better than original game\n-has vergil", "timestamp_created": 1674870254, "timestamp_updated": 1674870254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477184206247329712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131681508": {"recommendationid": "131681508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800789811", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1193, "last_played": 1674938752}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Nero, playable Lady, enough said.

new character Nero which might upset some people not having Dante as the main protagonist,\nbut it goes well with how Nero get's introduced to the series.\n\nNero in this game is a bit like DMC3 Dante but more hot headed.\nNero also plays completley different compared to Dante having only 1 weapon his Blue Rose and his sword Red Queen which he revs to give a fire like ability to his sword, that's not all\nnext to that he has the Devil Bringer, as he is a demon as well his right arm is a demon arm giving him multiple abillites, his arm can do for one called the Buster move, \nhe basically grabs the enemies and throws them or smacks them with each enemy having a unique throw or smack animation, he can also use the Buster Move to bosses which gives a whole new move to it,\nthat also differs from each boss. Nero is also more new player friendly compared to Dante.\nOverall i enjoyed Nero as a character and his gameplay alot. \n\nNow how does Dante do in this game well.......\nI'm gonna be honest, Dante in my opinion feels so wasted in this game and that sucks a lot considering his gameplay is amazing and very technical and complex compared to the other DMC games, this is the first game where he can switch styles on the fly having still the OG 4 styles Trickster, Swordmaster, Gunslinger and Royalguard and also \nhaving [spoiler]Vergil's style Darkslayer giving him access to some of Vergil's moves while wielding the Yamato[/spoiler]. \nSaying all this you're still thinking as to why i feel that Dante is wasted?\nHe just doesn't fit in this game at all, we get introduced in the beginning that[spoiler] Dante comes out of knowhere and kills the leader of The Order Sanctus,\ngoes around killing some guards as well, which we later find out that they're actually demons and not just human beings makes us think there is something going behind The Order[/spoiler].\nDante overall in the story doesn't do a lot at all as he basically is a [spoiler]backtracking character actually replaying Nero's missions and fighting his bosses as well (why) and after that to go fight a underwhelming boss in mission 18.\nand he also obtains the Devil Arms from the bosses Nero fought which suck imo[/spoiler], \nit's such a downgrade to what his weapons were in DMC3 which just makes playing as Dante with those weapons not so fun to me, he had more viraity in DMC3 with his weapons, \nwhich he just doesn't have in this game, Rebellion is like the only weapon i can have fun with as Dante with [spoiler]Gilgamesh[/spoiler] being second but also being a downgraded [spoiler]Beowulf[/spoiler].\nOverall Dante doesn't do it to much to me in this game, is he fun to play as? Yes, are his weapons fun to play with? No, and it's really sad.\n\nHow is the overall game?\nOh boi, so it's definitely not DMC2 level bad by any means, but boi does this game have a lot of flaws.\nThe missions are decent at best while still fun to play with as Nero, they are just a bothersome to[spoiler] play again as Dante[/spoiler].\nSome missions do have some major issues, being the puzzles which are for Nero and only for Nero as well, you got some platforming is this game\nwhere you use your Devil Bringer to grapple to different places, some stuff where you use blades to open a door in mission 3 or crush a closed gate which you have to go through,\nor you play a dice game........ yes a dice game where you have to roll the dice in the steps you want to move, some of it being enemy spawns some laser dodging and some where it gives you a lot of red orbs.\nMan do i hate that mini game funny thing is that none of these stuff happen when you play as Dante, matter a fact when he approaches the dice mini game [spoiler]he slashes the dice and literally skips it lol[/spoiler].\nThose are some puzzles in the missions but now we have the missions themself and eh?? to me the missions feel weird, \nso you are Nero and your target is [spoiler]capturing Dante so you go out in these missions to different places one being a castle and the other in a forrest[/spoiler], you fight some bosses and you move on to next mission? i don't know man the bosses feel like they don't have to be in the story they just feel so disconected, except for some bosses and one boss which is also the best boss in the game lol who you also only get to fight as Nero yay -_-.\n\nThose were the missions, \nhow about the story and soundtrack and what about the characters?\nThe story is decent it's definitely not a DMC3 level story and not even DMC1, funny thing is this game feels like a mix of DMC1 and DMC3 but worse. \nThe sad thing is that DMC4 isn't even a finished game hence why [spoiler]you play Nero's missions again as Dante and why the enemies don't feel right to fight against as Dante[/spoiler],\ni think you can find a whole story about it on the web of why the game became like this and how it was actually meant to be.\nThe soundtrack is good i had a lot of enjoyment in Nero's battle theme and Dante's and some boss themes, while also a lot of missions had some interesting ambience like feel to it.\nThe characters are good like Nero who i really enjoyed a lot in this game, Dante has some cool and funny moments but still a bit lacking storywise,\nsome of the other characters like Credo and Agnus are also some good characters. Credo being the caring brother of Kyrie and Agnus being a scientist who does science on demons.\nKyrie is also a good close love interest to Nero while still having a damsel in distress like role she is important to Nero's character.\nThe villain was alright his boss battle being a bit fun as well, after the horrible mission where you do a [spoiler]boss rush with the damned dice game[/spoiler] man i hated that mission what a waste.\nSome known characters are also in it like Trish and Lady, while they don't do a lot to the story either, they do something else....\n\n\nDMC4:Special Edition\nThat's right, in this version of DMC4 you get to play with three more characters including:\nTrish, Lady and Vergil.\nHow do they play you say?\nTrish is a huge upgrade from how she played in DMC2, she is really fun to play with having an insane amount of new moves, wielding Sparda and her guns Luce and Ombre and the [spoiler]Pandora Box that Dante uses[/spoiler].\nLady is fun as well but considering that she is a human her gameplay is alright and is more of a gunslinger having shotguns, pistols and grenades, she also slashes with the Kalina Ann which has a blade attached to it.\nVergil, oh boi it's time to get motivated!\nVergil is an insane step up compared to his playstyle in DMC3, he is so fun to play as and honestly my most played character in this game \nwhile still having his old weapons from 3 Yamato, Force Edge and Beowulf, they have been updated insanely as they have more moves now then ever before!\nHis summoning swords are also a lot better then 3 being way more powerfull now, Vergil in this game is so goddamn powerfull it's insane how much care was put to his playstyle.\nThe newest edition to his style being the Concentration bar, when you actually play as Vergil as intended which means no running or jumping, and being locked on to the enemy\nyou fill up his Concentration bar which makes you motivated as ever when filling the bar being able to do his ultimate move\nThe Judgement Cut End.\nHe also get's a new battle theme that for some reason is only played in his beginning cutscene????? Just why.\nThere is also something new to this addition a whole new mode named Legendary Dark Knight mode which spaws a ton of enemies in a Son of Sparda like difficulty\nhave fun with that!.\n\nOh almost forgot Bloody palace also returns in this game this time having the rounds go single times to 101 instead of 9999 with round skips like DMC2 and DMC3, and it's very fun to play in it as all the playable characters!\n\nOverall my thoughts are it's a fun game but very flawed, would still play sometime\n(8.5)", "timestamp_created": 1674513322, "timestamp_updated": 1674514109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603960394859313965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131415469": {"recommendationid": "131415469", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067941390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1674495823}, "language": "english", "review": "Tis Good", "timestamp_created": 1674495861, "timestamp_updated": 1674495861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503448247909545898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131393383": {"recommendationid": "131393383", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113067847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1150, "last_played": 1674466095}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the most gamer ever", "timestamp_created": 1674466564, "timestamp_updated": 1674466564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492641538381576538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131375094": {"recommendationid": "131375094", "author": {"steamid": "76561199243198531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1681436071}, "language": "english", "review": "Deadweight fr fr \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1674435238, "timestamp_updated": 1674435238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521716952323913574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131368248": {"recommendationid": "131368248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989267770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1674255981}, "language": "english", "review": "Dumb story, weak characters; it's nonsense, but not even enjoyable nonsense.

you'll be a bit disappointed as the focus is more on Nero instead when it comes to story. I can't really say much because it wasn't that special. I do remember there being that evil priest guy. \nGAMEPLAY:\nNero is a fun character, some of the enemies are annoying against him. Like those ones that have vines and immediately break your style with no way of telling you. Nero uses his arm to grab and use a buster move with it too which is really fun. Dante on the other hand, has a fun moveset but all of the enemies do NOT feel designed for him. That one enemy that literally teleports with lightning was so annoying, every time you'd attack it it would hurt you. Idk even know how i beat those but i did. Idk about vergil, lady and trish as im only talking about the main story. \nLEVEL DESIGN:\nIt's ok. Point a to b half of the game with Nero then backtrack to the start as Dante. There are BARELY any checkpoints if you die. Only until you get to a boss. The puzzles were stupid and do not feel special. The dice one was incredibly stupid, literally laid out like a monopoly board. Like if u land on red u fight and that one colour where you get rewards. WHO THOUGHT OF THIS AND THINKS THAT IT WOULD BE FUN\nOVERALL: Game is a 7/10, there were some enjoyable parts like Dante being Dante.

Game is not hard so you will enjoy it and you basically have lots of red orbs there so you don't have to worry about that, i didn't like the fact that as Dante you just make some backtracking where you used to go as Nero but it's hella fun to play as Dante. You can also play as Vergil and Lady/Trish that means if you play as Lady/trish you first play as Lady and then Trish you cannot choose. Story is also good and soundtrack is bad ass.

However, the game features one of the finest stylish action combat systems ever made. With the special edition, you now have 3 more playable characters to play with, new character costumes, and a new game mode called \"legendary dark knight\".\n\nLegendary Dark Knight mode is unlocked right from the beginning, and it's a welcome addition. It increases the enemy count up to 10 times as many, overwhelming you from the get-go. It's different from the normal campaign, instead of methodically taking on each enemy, you're encourage to use as many hard hitting moves as possible. The interesting thing about Devil May Cry 4, due to the quirks and the mechanics of the combat system, is that it is easily one of the most busted games out there. Whether intentional or not, it's the kind of game that lets you straight up kill big bosses with 1 hit. Legendary Dark Knight mode seems to be designed just for the intricacies of the combat system.\n\nWith that said, Devil May Cry 4 is not exactly an easy game. Enemies quickly swarm all over you, forcing you to take on each enemy encounter methodically and stylishly. It's not just about quickly killing your enemies, it's about doing as many different combos to your enemies as possible to get high score rankings. The higher rankings you get, the faster you get new weapon movesets or health upgrades.\n\nReally the only thing that brings this game down is the campaign, or rather, the unfinished quality of the campaign. The campaign starts off strong. It leads you through various distinct environments and features probably one of the best boss fights in gaming. You can tell a lot of money and effort went into the first half of the game... and then the game pretty much just copies and pastes that first half into the second half of the game. Even the story is almost non-existent in the second half, it's like the game ran out of budget mid-development and the developers had to quickly scrape something together to have a finished game. \n\nIt's a shame, the story wants to depict angelic, holy figures as evil beings hellbent on destruction. It's an interesting theme but the story just ends up under-cooked due to the half-finished nature of the game.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1667373263, "timestamp_updated": 1672551058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668116629123687744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124811746": {"recommendationid": "124811746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442623402", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 964, "last_played": 1681686852}, "language": "english", "review": "So swag", "timestamp_created": 1667362551, "timestamp_updated": 1667362551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124802201": {"recommendationid": "124802201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045140638", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1666920098}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not as good as 3 or 5 but it's got a lot going for it still.", "timestamp_created": 1667346106, "timestamp_updated": 1667346106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124790402": {"recommendationid": "124790402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111343619", "num_games_owned": 655, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1667422074}, "language": "english", "review": "What a sad excuse of a Devil May Cry game. \nIt does not have either the seriousness nore the ridiculousness od DMC and DMC 3. \nIt does not go to the low points but also does not accomplish the great things of DMC 2. \nIt is nothing.

Starting off the annoying and frustrating puzzles that interrupt from the gameplay are way more present in 4 than in other titles I understand why puzzles like this are in the game but the other abundance of them is just unnecessary. Next I don't find many of the enemies of this game to be particularly fun to fight because a lot of them interrupt combos without warning and they are just annoyingly gimmicky in general that just exists to punish the player prime example being the Fault. Also the story in this game isn't that good but this is a DMC game so that's not that crazy. I do think Nero is over hated in this game but I wish for a new protagonist in the series they made him more unique in 4 because he feels too similar to Dante. Lastly the amount of backtracking in 4 is absurd I am aware of the development issues this game had but it's extremely unfortunate that Capcom rushed this game because it would have been cool to see a larger boss variety.", "timestamp_created": 1666319424, "timestamp_updated": 1666319424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124126923": {"recommendationid": "124126923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411792864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 660, "last_played": 1666293198}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a romance game...", "timestamp_created": 1666293243, "timestamp_updated": 1666293243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124123033": {"recommendationid": "124123033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141223155", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4673, "last_played": 1696360545}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Logros.

Definetly a game to pick up, but there are just a few little problems with it.\n\nFirstly the story, it is really bad but not to the extent of Devil May Cry 2 thankfully, it just simply lacks anything cool or motivating to drive you forward. It comes off as very boring and generic. You mainly play as the new protagonist Nero, who from a personality point doesn't offer a lot. He's no dante and doesnt have to be but he acts like every other shonen anime protagonist but can have his fair share of lines every now and then. He is tasked with hunting down dante who kills a pope in his order but you don't even know why? You later find out why but it was typical and expected. Nero has no driving motivations other than a girl he loves known as Kyrie, who offers nothing compared to other female characters like trish and lady. Kyrie is the damsel in distress through and through. The order of the sword is also a interesting antagonistic faction with motives but they are very strange and dont make sense as you progress. Dante is essentially neglected and is shown to have made 0 progress to fighting the big bad boomer. Most of the best moments in the story is when Nero isnt on screen, which is ashame as I do want to like this character but I cannot for now. \n\nGameplay is quite fun though. While Nero isn't as complex as dante with his styles and different devil arms, Nero can serve as a more 'friendly' less combo heavy character. He mainly has his sword, the red queen which has the most anime like ability of revving the sword which can have charges on it. however it is mainly good to use when you perform your combos as if you do it idle, it makes gameplay come to a halt and is very boring to play. learn the rev skills and he becomes more fun to play.  His gun is not as good and is more of a situational use. His devil bringer, the skill he mainly has is great for more combos and busters which allow nero to do big damage to his target and even use some of the enemies as a body shield. \n\nDante plays great, just like in Devil May Cry 3. He has less weapons than 3 but the weapons themselves arent half bad. I especially like the crazy weapon they added in, Pandora, which is a suitcase that turns into a bow missile launcher, a legit tri barrel missile launcher, a minigun case, a laserbeam and a literal sphere to barrage rockets (though not as cool as it should be). Lucifer is a fun fast needle spawner weapon and Gilgamesh is another variant of the past gauntlet weapons like Ifrit and Beowolf focusing on hard hitting combos and some fast speed combos. In addition, you have the good old fashion rebellion, ebony and ivory and Coyote A, his shotgun. \n\nWith the special edition, you get access to Vergil, who plays the same as the previous title, being more focused on ruthless aggression and speed, spamming summoned swords on one hand, creating sword barriers, cornering them on your enemies, as well as yamato being speedy and fast, force edge being a dual wield and similar to rebellion and of course, Beowolf. Lady is also another playable one, utilizing her guns and grenades a lot. Shotgun, dual 9mm pistol and her infamous Kalina Ann. Trish also becomes playable too, utlizing the Sparda sword, her guns, pandora and her own barehands infused with lightning. Trish in fact is very fast with her barehand moves and is very fun to play along with using sparda as an ability.\n\nLevel design for DMC4 is not half bad either. Sure platforming is still as bad thanks to the fixed camera but there is something even worse than that and it is my least favourite mission moment ever in DMC4, the board games. It's a board game essentially with a dice you can manipulate and roll to get to your objective. If you land on gold, you advance to purple and complete the objective. If you hit blue, you get spammed with red and green orbs and you collect as much as possible. If you land on red which is a lot of times, you fight enemies which can be completely random. This isn't as bad the first time you do it and sure you replay it as dante but Mission 19, you have to do it at least 5 times and more red appears so more enemies to fight and it goes in a circle till you hit a gold or purple spot. In addition, you refight the bosses again. Bosses arent half bad but lack any charisma and charm DMC3 bosses had. They are ok but not as memorable, except the one cutscene with dante and Agnus, the best moment in the game ever. \n\nOverall, DMC4 is a solid game and still worth picking up but ultimately has weaker story than DMC3. If you want to play for story, dont pick it up. If you want lots of gameplay and action, in addition to playing vergil, trish and lady, but this game.", "timestamp_created": 1663421553, "timestamp_updated": 1663421553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467741936445236206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122356005": {"recommendationid": "122356005", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060478732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1663388680}, "language": "english", "review": "Want to play this game?

Yes! I think if you enjoy other DMC games and other Hack and Slash like games then I think you will enjoy this. \n\nNow for the long version. \n\nI am a relatively new fan of the Devil May Cry series. I have played both 1 and 3 via the HD collection over the past summer. I am also really bad at games where I have to learn combos or remember button inputs for attacks. That being said the game is pretty easy to learn and was a really fun experience overall! I am not gonna really go into the story for this review to keep it relatively spoiler free even though the game is over 10 years old at this point. However, I think the story was fine. While I was not amazed by it, I found it entertaining which personally is all I want. I also often had a little trouble hearing what the characters were saying to the point where I had to have subtitles on (highly recommend). I am not sure if this is a known issue with this version of the game but could have just been me.\n\nSome people may have an issue with the new protagonist, Nero. This may be due to how we just spent 3 whole games as Dante so they may feel it kind of questionable that we gotta play as this guy for like most of the game. I personally don't have much of an issue. I don't mind Nero, I prefer Dante like I assume many do but Nero is fine to me. Nero is very fun to play as and an excellent character to start off with because he is relatively simple to learn since he has only one main weapon being the Red Queen (motorcycle sword is honestly a really stupid yet badass weapon and yes I will take your entire stock). He also has two side weapons his gun, the Blue Queen, and his demon arm which is tool to grab and deal major damage to enemies and bosses with a unique animation for just about every enemy in the game. While I haven't played Lady and Trish mode yet the other playable characters are super fun to play as too but if you played the other DMC games you already know what to expect kind of for Dante and Vergil (more on Vergil later)! Due to how Nero feels to play and the game feeling super easy after the first boss it is kinda clear this game was meant to be an introduction game for new fans which is totally fine! However, one major gripe with the difficulty is the handicap mechanic. If you die to a boss then the game will automatically adjust the difficulty of the boss and lower your score. If the game simply asked \"Do you want to make the boss easier?\" before making it easier for you that would be fine but the game does not do that. I want to be able to play the game and learn from my previous death and then get better at fighting the boss rather than the game forcefully giving me a baby rattle cause I messed up. \n\nMy biggest issue with the game is that it feels very unfinished at times. I personally think this is most apparent in the last section of the game where the plot just kinda stops and you can finally now play as Luig-I mean Dante. Dante is incredibly fun to play as and I love his arsenal in this game. However the game only lets you play as him for a few missions of the whole game and then that's it no more Dante. During the time you play as Dante you re-fight multiple bosses that you did as Nero. Now while I normally do not mind re-fighting bosses it is such a let down that during the time you play as Dante you are essentially just doing the same thing again, nothing new other than the levels to actually fight them which are just the same maps but with new objectives like portals you have to take to progress. Then you have to refight the same bosses AGAIN in mission 19 (but I can give this a pass since it is similar to the boss re-fights in 3). This makes the game feel noticeable unfinished like they ran out of time, ideas, or something to make new stuff for the last part of the game (I don't exactly know what happened but I have been told the game was not 100% finished). I would have much preferred the game had a separate mode for Dante and a separate mode for Nero or maybe a choice to play as whichever you want after completing their mode OR SOMETHING. Granted the Bloody Palace mode you can play any character you want so I guess there's always that. also whoever did that last dice level is my sworn enemy \n\nQuick thoughts on Vergil mode: It's fun cause I mean come on it's Vergil he's awesome. I really like the concept of the concentration meter but the execution is very weird. I get its supposed to be in character for Vergil's tactful personality but I dunno I think you gain way too little meter for actually attacking and you know playing the game and you gain way too much meter for standing around like an idiot. It is also feels a little too punishing if you even mess up even once. I know it may sound contradictory but it is also kinda OP. I have crushed nearly every single boss I fought with him with ease. I beat the first boss in what felt like seconds due to the sheer damage output of  having high meter and Judgment Cut End while super cool I don't really see a downside? I think the idea for the meter is genuinely really good but it needs a little more balancing in my opinion. I need to play a bit more to get more full thoughts on it, maybe I'll make a follow up review to this including my thoughts on Lady/Trish mode. I am also looking forward to playing Devil May Cry 5 which I have been told is really good!\n\nOverall while I did have some issues with the later half its still a really fun game that is worth your time and money to play! I actually kind of prefer the gameplay in 4 over 3 personally but I think that may differ from person to person. I can totally see myself going back to the game to try and improve and get better style ratings and mission rankings!\nScore: 7/10\n\nThis was my first ever real review other than the one sentence one for Yakuza Zero.

So, for now, this is my favorite DMC game in the series. The story is a classic experience and holds up well. The gameplay is nice and fresh with the addition of Nero's abilities. Getting to play as all the characters is a welcome addition, with the only downside being that the only story for any of them besides the main Nero/Dante campaign is at the very beginning and very end of their campaigns. None of the bosses offer any additional dialogue to enjoy. I will say I probably had a better time from obtaining all the currency included with the Demon Hunter Bundle. I always make sure I can enjoy a story before anything else about a game.

I would like to preface this wholw rant with that. DMC4 is good. However, it personally pisses me off. \n\nSo, the story of DMC4 follows new character in the franchise Nero. He is a angru kid with anger issues that thinks he is way cooler than he actually is and I love him for it. He grew up in a city of Fortuna, that is controlled by a cult that worships demon Sparda as a god. One day a \"mysterious\" assassin attacks the church of this cult and kills it's pope leader. Nero is tasked with tracking down this \"mysterious\" attacker and apprehending him. What no one knows is that Nero has an ace up his sleeve, a demonic hand that gives him incredible power. The story of DMC4 is not as good as DMC3 was. While DMC3 was a family drama with characters having all sorts of trauma over their relatives, DMC4 is a love story with kind of flawed execution. Nero is very angry and angsty protagonist, but it works for this story overall, since him failing again and again to save the love of his life and then angrily punching the floor until it breaks is a powerful visual. But that's where some people might disagree, since seeing this kid's overdramatic reaction to everything might be annoying, especially seeing \"too cool to care' attitude of a seocnd protagonist Dante, whose role of rival and a mentor for Nero kind of steals the spotlight. \n\nBeing the first game on a new set of hardware since PS2, DMC4 has a huge jump in graphics over previous games, making probably themost betiful game in the series visually. Characters have this almost 3D anime design, the environments are bright and colorful, and enemies never looked this detailed in DMC before. Even compared to newer DMC5 I probably prefer the visuals here. \n\nBut the main issue with DMC4 lies with it's gameplay. Overall, the game is pratically unfinished in a state that it's in. Half of the levels are repeats from the first half but with stupid annoying gimmicks on top. The enemy roster consists of annoying creatures that do not allow you to freely style on them, and the game really likes to overuse them. The bosses are frequently repeated two to three times and it probably has one of the worst bosses in the series on a level of a freaking \"Infested Chopper\" from DMC2. The levels always have some stupid time-wasting gimmick with them, and the game almost seems getting worse as you go futher until character switch in the middle of the game shakes things up.\nAs for the characters, Nero leaves a strong impression as a newcomer. You will be controlling him for the majority of the game, but his moveset is pretty limited. He has only one sword, one gun, and his powerful demon arm. Despite that, each of those have their own gimmicks associated. The sword \"Red Queen\" has a motorcycle revving mechanism attached to the handle, allowing to increase the power of attacks with it. The gun \"Blue Rose\", is giant double barreled revolver, that in it's base form is just another DMC gun, but really shines if you manage to get used to it's Charge Shot, that in it's highest level can do ridiculous amounts of damage. Nero's devil arm is what makes his whole kit work, it's a context sensitive \"I win\" button that is really satsfying to use and animations that you get as a result of a succesful attack, especially in Devil Trigger, are a blast to watch and very satsfying to land. on bosses it is a reward in itself for good gameplay, since the boss needs to get stunned first before you can buster them. And there are situations where your reaction and use of the arm can really make or break situation. it's more rewarding than any QTE.\nDante on the other hand. Well, he has three different melee weapons, three \"guns\", and access to five different styles. Trying to utilise all of them effectively is the real challenge with Dante and all of it combined make DMC4 Dante one of the most complex characters in action games. He doesn't have Nero's cool demon arm, but he makes up for it with amounts of style and swagger that is never seen. The guy knows that he is strongest thing alive and is not ashamed for it. \nThe Special Edition of DMC4 also adds new characters, female demon hunters Trish and Lady, and fan-favorite motivational speaker, katana weilding, sword summoning Vergil. All of them have their own moves and skills, but the problem is, there is still no new content for them. It's either running Bloody Palace, or running over the old and tired levels with the same annoying enemies and stupid useless gimmicks and puzzles. \n\nLike I said, DMC4 is good, but it should have been much better than it is. It is already a tall order following up probably the best action game of all time, but the lack of actual content, annoying puzzles, and worst enemy roster since DMC2 really make this game almost kind of a letdown. i both love and hate coming back to this game. And th fact that it was followed up by one of the most tone-deaf, pandering and insulting reboots in history make everything feel worse, while we got actual good closure for franchise after 11 years of waiting.", "timestamp_created": 1660464859, "timestamp_updated": 1660464859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

"review": "Bien, tras haber por fin terminado el juego tras mucho tiempo, puedo decir que cambiar\u00e9 radicalmente mi rese\u00f1a anterior. Por cierto, para ser un juego del \u00a12008! es impresionante. \n\n1) \"El sistema de guardado es inexistente\". Bueno, en este punto creo que si tengo raz\u00f3n. Es una cagada el sistema de guardado, a veces te mor\u00eds y el punto de control es el principio de la misi\u00f3n. Muy malo.\n2) \"El combate es lento, se siente pesado y los enemigos son poco llamativos, variados o cuanto menos interesantes. Los combos se basan en apretar determinado bot\u00f3n en determinado orden, y  luego de haber jugado otros juegos de acci\u00f3n similares, este sistema me parece bastante simple y tosco, por no decir inc\u00f3modo\". En cuanto al combate, tengo que decir que es lo mejor del juego por diferencia. Si bien se siente algo torpe, no es ni de lejos malo. Los enemigos si son muy malos, los jefes tambi\u00e9n. Y los combos la verdad que son bastante llanos. \n3) \"La historia no es nada entretenida, los personajes son todos iguales, adolescentes prepotentes que no tienen la m\u00ednima idea de nada m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de dar volteretas...\" Bueno ahora pienso diferente. Si bien la historia es mala, no es tan mala. Entretiene. Es verdad, el antagonista final es mal\u00edsimo, pero bueno es DMC tampoco esperamos Lotr.\n4) \"La c\u00e1mara es ciertamente insoportable. Creo que quisieron darle un aspecto cinem\u00e1tico, pero lo volvieron muy tedioso\". De acuerdo con mi antiguo yo, es lo peor del juego, lejos.\n5) \"El men\u00fa y las opciones son horribles y poco intuitivas\". Me parece incre\u00edble que a lo largo de los a\u00f1os hayan dejado ese sistema de entrar al men\u00fa para curarse, es muy raro \u00bfY lo de las gemas para revivir?\u00bfQu\u00e9 significa eso?\n6) \"La banda sonora es siempre la misma y cansa muy r\u00e1pido\". Ciertamente es mal\u00edsima.\n8) \"El dise\u00f1o de nivel es realmente feo y poco entretenido de jugar\".

Playing as the new character Nero adds a fun level of depth to the usual standard Dante affair these games tend to offer. However you get to play as Dante through the later half of the game but essentially it's just a trek back from where Nero originally came including previously defeated bosses (of which you fight 4 of the 10 bosses repeatedly, very lame) which can make the 3rd act feel a bit like a slough to get through. On top of that you have some confusing level design choices which will leave you wondering around areas (Fortuna Castle & The Forest being the worst) muttering \"where the fuck do I go?\" as you cycle back through the same area multiple times. It's not bad, but it can be a bit frustrating sometimes. \n\nCombat and pacing are for the most part stylish and high octane with some neat, small additions to the arsenal (including Nero's own unique move set and weapons) that makes the game stand out from its' predecessors. Some moments spent solving environmental puzzles that are nothing more than reprieve from the combat sections scattered throughout the levels. All the while everything is in glorious HD 3D visuals courtesy of the 7th generation of consoles and while some of the textures can be low res in game, the character models and cutscenes look amazing with a rocking sound track to boot that gives us a sample of what we would later hear in 5. Good stuff.\n\nAlong with the rockin tunes, the game's tone and atmosphere is hilarious as ever and watching Dante monologue in a Shakespearean manner with a boss before fighting him is not only funny but why you come to play DMC games. Nero in contrast is a much more serious, brooding character but still has his charms and can be pretty cool himself at times which makes him not completely unlikable. He's unintentionally funny though so be prepared to cringe at some of his more \"dramatic\" moments. Dante is as he's always been which is irreverent, sarcastic, and wildly nonchalant about yet another impending doomsday scenario involving demons, destruction and calamitous peril. He never fails to not put a smile on your face. \n\nOverall, you're gonna love this experience if you've played through the previous titles and loved them. Having played through all 4 back to back and 5 upon its' release I can't say this is my favorite (that's a toss up between 3 and 5) but I can say this is still a DMC game at its' core and it's damn fun to play and really pretty to look at visually as well. Definitely worth a purchase, especially if on sale.

DMC3 had great gameplay, enemies you had to plan out how to fight, brutal bosses, and was just overall fun. This game is the complete opposite. Unlike DMC3, there is no strategy to this game. The gameplay boils down to button mashing the triangle button. There is no strategy. The game is design is poor and boring, there\u2019s no variety to your gameplay, the level design is sh*tty and tedious, and the bosses are just embarrassing.\n\nI would not recommend this to any new DMC fans. The only saving grace about this game is Nero, he really saved the game for me with the story. And especially Johnny Yong Bosch\u2019s voice-acting for him. Johnny is such a great VA, so convincing, I almost cried at certain points.\n\nOverall, this game is terrible.

This time, we follow Nero, a young man that is part of a religious order that worships Sparda, the demon that sealed the two worlds, betrayed his own kind, just to protect the humans. Sparda is also Dante and Vergil's dad as you might recall from previous games. Not to spoil much, but the events of the game kinda force Nero and Dante to cross paths which leads into Nero discovering a big conspiracy and seeing himself fighting against the people he fought side by side with while also trying to protect his loved ones.\nI honestly think that Nero is a great character, he is young and impulsive and extremely emotional and his flaws are what make him great, at least for me. Also the fact that he has a demon arm that he can use to throw them around like Invincible throws bags of trash. \n\nAbout the gameplay, a lot changes. Not only do we get a new character with new mechanics but this Special Edition also gives us 4 more to play with. That's right, not only are Dante and Nero playable but also Lady, Trish and Vergil are a part of the roster too. Their gameplay differs a lot from eachother, making each character unique and fun. You will be playing as Nero most of the time, but his mechanics are very fun to compensate for the hours he steals from other characters. His sword can be revved up like a motorcycle, which gives it more power, and he can use his Devil Bringer arm to act as a grappler and grab demons around, with each demon having special animations for being grabbed. Dante is amazing here too and he shares the campaign with Nero, his gameplay is just crazy fun once you get the hang of it and his personality makes it all the better. Unfortunately, you only play as him for less than half of the game (about 4 hours) so you might be left wanting for more. Lady and Trish work the same, you play as Lady first and then Trish (which is a shame because I really like her gameplay here), with Lady doing justice to the name \"The Walking Arsenal\" by having her whole gameplay based around guns and charged attacks while Trish is a lot faster and more versatile while still being really fun and powerful.\nVergil is back from DmC 3, this time having a whole mechanic based around precision and concentrated gameplay. He has some really fun moves that he can use and he is overall just a really stylish character. Unfortunately, his gameplay is hindered by the game's enemy design. It really took a drop from the third installment and it could make you annoyed at times. Some enemies are just outright stupid for what they are, but if you are playing on Devil Hunter difficulty and just going through things normally, that shouldn't annoy you too much.\nOverall, I think the gameplay really got better based on the previous games even if the enemy design didn't.\n\nAbout the characters, I gotta say I enjoyed Nero. He is young and impulsive as I mentioned before and those flaws are what make him interesting. Dante is even more laid back than before, only ever going serious mode when shit demands it and it works amazingly. His interactions with other characters are really fun to watch, and the way he interacts with Nero really shows some growth, He is not just a kid anymore, he is wiser and older and with that comes some responsability. That isn't stopping him from being cool as fuck, though. Nothing is, really. The secondary characters, more specifically the ones from the cult are interesting and actually show some personality.\n\nThe soundtrack is again a banger, and while not as good as maybe DmC 3 or 5, it definetly deserves some praise. It's good and it's gonna get you pumped for battle.\n\nOverall, this game improves a lot of stuff from DmC3, even if making some mistakes that the previous games didn't (at least not as much) but I think the new story is interesting, the gameplay is amazing and full of variety and Nero is a great character.

Cry 3.[/b]\n\nIt's a rushed-out Nero game with Dante forced in because they were supposedly afraid of angering Dante fans according to an open interview, so you end up just backtracking through Nero's path with Dante halfway through the game and fighting most of the same bosses again as soon as you get to use him.\n\nCompared to DMC 3's extremely well-structured story, this game's plot feels like it's just there where the only interesting parts are the crazy Dante and Nero stuff.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's an overall improvement over 3, featuring better controls and general camera-work.\nBoth Nero and Dante play great, but originally being a Nero game, Dante feels out of place as there are loads of enemies that he fights that feel very awkward to deal with as him. Dante's also the hardest character out of everyone in this game to be stylish with due to his huge arsenal of movesets, though you don't have to worry too much about that if you're not trying to get too fancy with combos and such.\nDifficulty-wise, this is probably the easiest DMC game since DMC 2, with only some uncommon enemies that are there to be more annoying than difficult. Most of the bosses are real slow and have extremely simple movesets too, even on the highest difficulty settings.\n\nThe new characters you can play as in SE are Trish, Lady, and Vergil. Just like in DMC 3: SE, you're only playing through the game's base missions as these characters. Story-wise, the only important cutscenes are Vergil's, but he only gets two, which are just him showing off his motivation & power, and making a couple of comments about the game's villains.\nTrish plays similarly to Dante with some odd controls you'll have to get used to, but has fun traps you can set-up around the field.\nLady is probably the easiest to use as she's the slow-attacking, heavy-hitter type with some agility to boot. She can't do crazy combos like everyone else, but her charged attacks are extremely strong and versatile, which bring up her stylish ranks a lot easier than everyone else.\nVergil is perhaps the absolute strongest character in this game, and his power scales real hard with how good you are with him; a massive improvement over his DMC 3 counterpart. He's strong, agile, and can clear rooms full of demons instantly & constantly with efficient use of his Judgement Cut End.\n\nAs a product, the game's only real value is in the new characters that you can play with, and maybe that new difficulty mode where enemies are in huge abundance.\nThe Special Edition part mainly adds more to what was originally a rushed-out game as well as some gameplay tweaks, which are unnoticeable to people who play casually, but very much more-so for the worse for those who've gotten real good at the original, as some crazy techs and combos are either no longer possible here or have become really inconsistent.\nAs a PC port, it's not perfect. It features some general PC settings, but for example, you can't turn off the main things that cause common stuttering problems without editing the game's .exe file through a hex editor.\nMost of the DLC is just for lazy losers who'd rather pay for rewards that are originally meant for people who actually play and get skilled at the game. Terrible practice, especially considering that you could unlock all bonus stuff via cheat-code inputs in the previous game.\nIf you're in it just for the base-game Dante & Nero stuff, you might be better off just getting the original non-Special-Edition version for cheap, though it may take a bit of tweaking to get that running; the Special Edition's graphics are barely an improvement anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1658335052, "timestamp_updated": 1658431453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119124043": {"recommendationid": "119124043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865163040", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1661923306}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1658305841, "timestamp_updated": 1658305841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119116935": {"recommendationid": "119116935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025422582", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 916, "last_played": 1659141533}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game falls short in level design, combat feels fluid.

You recognize that the original released in 2008 and you are willing to deal with it being a little clunkier than the Steam release date makes it seem\n\n2. You want to go play DMC 5.\n\nNow, addressing the main issues of the game come down to the age of the game. This game is over a decade old and some things have changed with time. The controls are kind of clunky compared to modern games kind of like it, but the big issue is the camera. Sometimes you get 3rd person control, but it's generally for short moments. Otherwise, you get fixed camera angles, which throws off you movement direction until you get used to it and makes dodging and directional inputs kind of a pain at first. This is honestly my only real complaint.\n\nOn the other hand, the game is fun and easy enough to pick up, but if you want those SSS ranks, you're gonna have to get good at it. You feel yourself improving in ways I've really only seen in something like Sekiro, and it makes you feel like a badass. In addition, if you don't like the default controls, you can rebind them however you want.\n\nThe final thing of note is the story. Is it the greatest story ever told? No. Are you gonna go play DMC 5? If yes, you'll want this. Otherwise you'll just be like, \"Who tf is Nero? What's with his arm? How did it become a sword? wtf?\" Honestly, I'd recommend playing 3 and 4 before 5, but whatever. In addition, playing through this game will get you ready for 5 mechanically. Other than a few things, DMC 5 plays very much like a smoother, more refined 4. A lot of combos are still there with a lot more added. Being mediocre on this for you 1st playthrough will get you ready to get those S-SSS ranks in DMC 5.\n\nEssentially, the game is good enough on it's own, but the following game makes this an easy recommendation just purely due to how it will affect your experience in the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1658150841, "timestamp_updated": 1658150841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119000280": {"recommendationid": "119000280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061354507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1678389370}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the best in the series, but still a CUHRAAAZY game.", "timestamp_created": 1658134749, "timestamp_updated": 1658134749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118989568": {"recommendationid": "118989568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376220240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1666446640}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Mi primer juego de consola.

You see, you spend around half the game as Nero and then half of it as Dante. Nero is interesting but hard to get a hold off because Exceed and Ex-Act can have some tricky timing, but once it clicks it clicks hard and you absolutely demolish the demons. Then, around mission 12 you switch over to dante which plays like DMC3 Dante at first, but you get 3 new devil arms and wield ALL of them at once. Very overwhelming for a first time player I think, but extremely fun as someone who has played DMC3.

I would put more hours into this game to play as the other characters but I have other steam games in my library calling out to me first. \n\nFirst of all  let me tell you about something, CAPCOM sucks on PC. You think you should patch a fix that it literally doesn't crash when all I want to do is play the game.... I only got into the main screen but whenever I tried to load it just crashed the whole thing, way to go CAPCOM in your terrible optimization didn't even bother to fix something as BASIC to START to play the game without it crashing... honestly just what the hell. I even downloaded a HxD editor to mess with the games exe launch with the instructions online but even that didn't work. At the end of the day though, I figured out the problem was apparently the overlays I have on my game like Discord and Geforce Experience applications... so I disabled the overlays on those and I was finally able to play it but that's just a really annoying workaround just to finally play this game. Keep in mind though this isn't the only CAPCOM game that's effected by this kind of crashing just to point out that they don't check well what they are porting to PC. \n\nThat being said though, I think this is actually one of my favorite DMC games, even more than DMC 1 yes shocking I know.... but I actually liked nero as a protagonist and I though his girlfriend was okay too despite her just being the damsel in distress in this game. And yes I would argue that playing as Dante in the later half is extremely satisfying also, the briefcase gun he has is so cool but the game play was definitely revolved around nero considering his devil arm is used to solve some puzzles and deal with specific enemies... neros sword is also really cool, like the idea that he ramps up his sword like a motorcycle to deal additional damage its really awesome. Both of them are really cool, though this dante just feels like they ported all the moves from DMC 3 over to this game and didn't change any of the styles for dante just his weapons a bit.... but its cool now we get to switch styles on command instead of a menu and be able to change ALL the weapons for some epic combos. So at least you can be safe, that the core game play is really good. \n\nI don't really think I had much negative points to the game, I actually enjoyed the bosses. Nero could have used a bit more different weapons though, and there is a hint of that the game does feel unfinished and that's true... Lady and Trish are here and they barely have anything to do with the actual plot expect with Trish going undercover in an overly sexual outfit.  \n\nThe Special Edition lets you play as Vergil and also Lady/Trish to give some additional story context which is mostly why the game feels unfinished as it is but as I said I enjoyed it. Oh but screw that dice mini-game, who though that was a good idea to put in nero's campaign to lead to not just one boss, but also the final boss? its completely random so you have 0 hope where that dice even lands on.. even Dante didn't like the dice game. \n\nOverall though I recommend it... is it a silly plot? Yes, but I think when you read through the FULL DMC timeline (with the added official manga/novels added) it really adds to the overall plot of DMC and your going to enjoy this one. \n\nNow if you excuse me I have a more... erm... emo dante to playthough, wish me luck on that.", "timestamp_created": 1657607460, "timestamp_updated": 1657607460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The tyitle of this review wasn't a lie, starting the game you are like \"ok this guy looks like a younger Dante and got a Devil arm for some reason, let's see how they explain who he really is and why he got that arm out of nowhere\", and ending the game you end like \"ok, so... who the fuck is Nero? They never explained anything about him and his boring ass Devil arm!!!\".\nI can only say ONE good thing about Nero: he fucking suplex some enemies (only \"gold angels\" tho) and Dante has never done that, it was so sick the first time I saw it I laughed hard lol\n\nMost of the campaing (the canon one: Nero & Dante, you have Lady & Trish and Vergil solo BUT THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME LEVELS) is played by Nero, and the damn kid only has one really bad gun (that you can't even upgrade it's damage) and a normal sword, his Devil Bringer is a joke, most of the enemies die if you grab them 2-3 times, and that mean pressing the B button a couple of times, wow, so hard, also he has no styles, his abilities suck and are very few so you can't go crazy like you can with Dante on DMC3.\nAnd speaking of Dante, his gameplay is \"kinda\" like DMC3 with styles and all but nerfed in every single way, you can BUY his habilities the very second you get to play with him because they give you like 20k Proud Souls and there isn't a \"real\" level system so you feel no proggersion, like, you can max out all the style level just by buying them, while on DMC3 you had to fight a loooot of enemies and shit to just get 1 lvl making for a good reason to replay that game, but it really is sad, and also he gets a new ranged weapon that is so fkng dumb it's not even funny, and his other \"swords\" are horrible. \nOh yeah, and that fkng Proud Souls thing, why??? Now the Red Orbs are useless because they are only used to buy items and other than the life and trigger upgrades you will not buy anything else since the game is not even that hard.\n\nIn terms of difficulty I think this is about the same as DMC1, some parts are hard but onse you begin to spam the same attacks it turns into a joke, not as easy as DMC2, but far from being hard like DMC3. Most of your fails (if you do die) will be because of the cheap desings of the bosses and enemies, or because of the bad level geometry and camera, not because of the game actually being hard.\n\nThe core of the story goes around DMC3 and Yamato wich is really sad, specially considering the canon order up to this point is DMC3-1-2-4 so that means they skiped 2 entire games like they never happened, all you need to know from those games is that Trish from DMC1 is back... yay? No one cares about her!!! \nOther funny thing about this is that in case you haven't played the past games you will not understand most of this story, Who is Dante? Who is Trish? Who is Lady? What the fuck is a Yamato? Vergil? What does Sparda even mean???, to fix this you can watch \"The Story of Devil May Cry\", a short video explaining in detail the plots from DMC1,2&3, it is actually pretty helpful for a newcomer, so I HOPE YOU LIKE BEATING THE ENTIRE GAME AND WATCHING A STORY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND JUST TO UNLOCK THE VIDEO YOU LITERALLY M.U.S.T WATCH BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nOther things I want to complain are the fact this game setting and artstyle makes it look like a damn Final Fantasy, the enemies are all boring and uninspired, the \"angels\" look more like humanoid mechas, and there are this \"ghost\" like enemies that keep going trought the walls again and again so you have to stop and wait for them to come back to keep fighting and that takes A LOT of time, they are the worst enemies by far, most of the time you have to fight like 3 at the same time and it's terrible! \n\nAnd the final boss, man, what a fkng joke that was, legit, he is the weakest most easy motherfucker I've ever fought as a final boss, and his 2nd phase is an ever bigger joke since you literally beat him in 3 attacks, really, 3 attacks that you have to time correctly, and actually you don't even need to attack him, just press B (Devil Bringer) at the exact time 3 times baby!!!\n\nALSO, HOLY SHIT THOSE DICE LEVELS MAN, WHY THE FUCK DO WE HAVE TO USE A DICE TO PROGRESS ON A LEVEL? THAT IS THE WORST THING A GAME COULD HAVE, I HOPE THE ONE WITH THAT IDEA ON CAPCOM GOT FKNG FIRED, IT'S HORRIBLE, THANKS TO THAT MISSION 19 MAKES ME SICK, I SWEAR TO GOD THIS ALONE MAKES THIS GAME NOT WORTH YOUR TIME, FUCK THE DICE LEVELS MAN!!! AND THE LABYRINTH FOREST ONES TOO!!!\n\nAfter DMC3 I was so hyped for playing this, I was finally going to see who the fuck was that Nero guy from DMC5 so I can play that game with no problems, I really wanted to like and recomend this game because is still DMC, but I just can't, compared to DMC3 is worst in every aspect, it even has more loading screens than that game. As I said, this felt like a chore, and the last game that made me feel like that was fkng DMC2... I legit prefer to play that one over this, no joke, or the DmC failed reboot, that game is fucking awesome in terms of gameplay, while this one is absolute trash.\n\nIf you are like me and want to play every DMC game (I'm doing it in order, just one to go...) then obviously grab this one (ON SALE PLEASE) and play it, it's not the worst game ever made, but I can 100% guarantee you this: [b]you will NOT have fun with this one.[/b]\n\n[b]2/10 Fuck this game, I don't wanna play it ever again.[/b]\n\nPD: sry if my english is bad, also Kyrie has dat ass tho, had to be said.", "timestamp_created": 1657087411, "timestamp_updated": 1657087411, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418473124504089355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118299572": {"recommendationid": "118299572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006061583", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 783, "last_played": 1657427359}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game :D best in the series *5 is mid*\n", "timestamp_created": 1657077562, "timestamp_updated": 1657077562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118295074": {"recommendationid": "118295074", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055149279", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1694815172}, "language": "spanish", "review": "increible :deadrat: steam mamahuevo dejame poner emojis", "timestamp_created": 1657071149, "timestamp_updated": 1657071149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118292911": {"recommendationid": "118292911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963847973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 681, "last_played": 1694735929}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1657067844, "timestamp_updated": 1657067844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118247725": {"recommendationid": "118247725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868613500", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1270, "last_played": 1683424983}, "language": "english", "review": "worst final boss ive beaten in my life.", "timestamp_created": 1657012247, "timestamp_updated": 1657012247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118239227": {"recommendationid": "118239227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385063621", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1673400466}, "language": "english", "review": "power", "timestamp_created": 1656997255, "timestamp_updated": 1656997255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118237638": {"recommendationid": "118237638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147082464", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1656094451}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil May Cry 4 keeps the action going with yet another solid installment in the DMC series. Starring Nero, a new protagonist who boasts a youthful brashness and a powerful *literal* Devil Arm, you'll go on yet another hack and slash adventure of combo-mastery and boss-fights. I did a singular playthrough of DMC 4 on normal (Devil Hunter) difficulty with Nero, and I had a pretty good time with it. Despite there being less Dante (he's still there for a little!), the game still kept its charm for the most part. Nero has some very satisfying gameplay with very fun-to-use combos. The game keeps its over-the-top nature throughout, though I would argue the sexualization of the women in this game was really pushed too far, to the point of ridiculousness (looking at you, \"Gloria\"). In terms of gameplay, I think my main con was that the boss diversity in this game is a little low. Because of how the story is told, you end up fighting the few bosses you encounter several times over and over, and while some change slightly with each instance, others are literally carbon copies of themselves from earlier in the game, which I would imagine gets a little boring on repeat playthroughs. This was one of my primary reasons for not replaying the game on higher difficulties or with other characters (I also started DMC 5 shortly after finishing DMC 4 and holy shit that game is so good I don't know why I'd ever go back). Overall, DMC 4 is pretty solid, and while it's definitely the weakest of DMC 3/4/5, I'd still play it if you're gonna play those three games, but maybe wait for a small sale.", "timestamp_created": 1656994561, "timestamp_updated": 1656994561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118231087": {"recommendationid": "118231087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268475949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1657051473}, "language": "english", "review": "Corny ass one liners", "timestamp_created": 1656984222, "timestamp_updated": 1656984222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118215365": {"recommendationid": "118215365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260521460", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1656963383}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el juego esta piola pero jugar con teclado es una patada en la punta de la japi", "timestamp_created": 1656963445, "timestamp_updated": 1656963524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118214636": {"recommendationid": "118214636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079711087", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 963, "last_played": 1656962524}, "language": "english", "review": "I avoided buying this for years because I had the original DMC4 and I didn't care for playing as the other characters, but this is a version that lets you skip the tutorials and as a guy who goes for trying to get top ranks it made it worth it for me.", "timestamp_created": 1656962649, "timestamp_updated": 1656962649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118197882": {"recommendationid": "118197882", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181839271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1690602832}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun and highly replayable.

Cuz it's just Dante being a badass as he always is, Trying to clean up the mess Nero made.\nGraphics: Really good for it's time and the art is amazing to look at\n\nAs far negatives go:\nBoss fights are not that good except for a couple stand out ones like Credo which is an insane fight.\nBosses get repeated too much especially by the end of the game.\nSome mobs are made around Nero's combat and not the other characters.\nA couple achievements are a bit too challenging if you are an achievement hunter, They can be done with an insane amount of practice or you cheese them if there is a cheese for the achievement you wanna go for\n\nFinal rating: 9/10 - It could definitely be a 10/10 if the bosses weren't repeated too much / Bosses were better designed and i think the game is slightly too

This has been a monumental and brutal journey in not just my quest for getting all the achievements in every Devil May Cry game, but for completing all the games I own at large. (skip to the last paragraph for my rating of the game and closing thoughts)\n\nThis game leaves a wonderful impression on the player in its opening sequence and the first few missions. The graphics are a massive step up from the previous installment, Devil May Cry 3; the environments are very diverse and gorgeous to look at and explore, the cinematography and direction of the cutscenes are both exciting and engaging, and the voice acting and animation (general presentation) are the best the franchise had seen up to this point.\n\nFor the first half or so of the game, you play as Nero: an entirely new devil hunter and the main character of this story. He\u2019s reminiscent of young Dante from DMC 3 in terms of appearance, but he tends to be more emotionally expressive and prone to anger, making him more vulnerable and readable. The name of the game here is still being stylish and flashy, but this added layer of personality that Nero boasts makes him an even more transparent character than Dante, which helps with getting us to identify with his emotions and motives, thus making for a much more engaging experience overall.\n\nDuring the first 11 missions of this game, you practically get to experience all of the environments and significant boss battles this game has to offer. The boss battles overall are about as good as they were in DMC 3. Nero\u2019s signature move, the Devil Buster, has different effects based on which boss you\u2019re fighting and the state they\u2019re in. The first boss for example, Berial, has three separate states: his normal state, his weakened state, and his stunned state. He progressively transitions from his normal state to his stunned state as he takes more damage. In his normal state, Berial is immune to getting grabbed by your Devil Buster; however, as you keep hitting him, he\u2019ll lose his flames and go into his weakened state, which opens him up for a grab animation. Keep hitting him and he\u2019ll transition to his stunned state, leaving him open for you to deal more damage via your combo attacks and/or another grab move (the grab move here would be a different animation given that Berial is now stunned, not just weakened). Most boss battles have similar mechanics to Berial with minor alterations, which makes them compelling to replay and dissect.\n\nAfter the first 11 missions are done, you stop playing as Nero and switch into playing as Dante, and that\u2019s where most of the issues I had with this game start to rear their ugly heads. Dante, in my opinion, feels like a shell of his former self in the gameplay department. His arsenal of weapons is drastically reduced from DMC 3 and a lot of style-specific elements from DMC 3 (like his ability to run up walls using Trickster) were abandoned. However, the single coolest addition to Dante\u2019s moveset is the ability to change styles using the D-Pad. Changing styles is now no longer the arduous commitment and pace-killer it was in DMC3, you can now change between styles freely while fighting. This really helps cover up Dante\u2019s reduced weapon variety by allowing the player to switch up the style of gameplay on the fly, essentially maximizing the freedom and creativity afforded to the player with the current selection of weapons, regardless of how small it may be.\n\nUnfortunately, my gripes with Dante\u2019s section aren\u2019t limited to his gameplay; the worst aspect of his section are the missions he goes through. Backtracking in DMC is nothing groundbreaking or new; however, it has never been as blatant and offensive as it is here. In Dante's section, you have to go through all the environments that you went through as Nero, fight the same types of enemies, and take down the same bosses again.\n\nAgain, fighting the same boss battles and backtracking is nothing new in DMC, but even the first DMC did this way better. In that game, every time you fought the same boss battle for the second and/or third time, the environment was different and the mechanics of the boss fight were altered. I\u2019m not just talking about giving the boss a bit more health or making them hit harder or more frequently, I\u2019m talking straight up giving them *new* moves, changing up their pattern of attacking, and giving them new strengths and weaknesses \u2013 all of which allow for a familiar yet distinct experience that makes it feel like the boss evolved and grew stronger in tandem with your growth and evolution as a player. This couldn\u2019t be farther from the case in this game. When you fight these boss battles again as Dante, you\u2019re fighting the EXACT same bosses you fought as Nero. Same environments, same strengths and weaknesses, and same attack patterns. The only difference is you get to fight them as Dante this time.\n\nEventually, you move on to mission 19, which is one of the worst DMC missions I\u2019ve ever experienced. Mission 19 is a boss rush mission; you go through 5 unique floors with each floor taking you to a different zone. This mission is utterly lazy garbage. You fight the same boss battles you JUST beat as Dante just a couple missions ago, which already were entirely recycled bosses you previously beat as Nero, AGAIN. To make matters worse, they\u2019re once again the same environments, same strengths and weaknesses, and same attack patterns; all recycled for the 3RD TIME in the same playthrough. This was utterly baffling to me when I first played it, and going through the game more than 7 unique times to get various achievements only hammered home how lazy and redundant the repetition of these fights were.\n\nThis is why it took me so long to finish the achievements for this game; this game\u2019s structure isn\u2019t fun to replay at all. This game does have the highest amount of playable characters in any DMC game, thanks to the fact that the Special Edition brings over 3 totally unique and fun characters in Vergil, Trish and Lady. This also really helps with getting through the redundancy of the game and its missions.\n\nWhen I first started playing this game last year, it was a few days after I had beaten DMC 3 completely, which was one of my favorite gaming experiences of 2021. The first 11 missions of this game were breathtaking, and it made me very optimistic for the journey I was about to experience. However, everything following mission 11 really soured the overall experience and made me grow to hate this game. The achievements went from being a thrilling challenge to an unbearable chore, and I had to put this game away for months because of it.\n\nAfter taking a break and then coming back and learning the new characters with their immensely unique gameplay styles, my desire to finish this game was rejuvenated and I somehow sat down for 40 hours over the span of a week and finished the remaining achievements.\n\nI think this game benefits a lot from having a desire to learn and improve. If you\u2019re in it just to beat a set of achievements, this game will bore you to death and it will be intolerable. If you play through this game just once, I believe the issues I brought up would still be a hindrance to your enjoyment, but it won\u2019t be nearly as bad as what I had to experience due to my plethora of playthroughs. Overall, this game is good and has a lot of gameplay diversity through its many characters and their respective unique gameplay styles, but the game\u2019s overall bad aspects really drag it down.\n\nOverall, I give it a 7/10. It\u2019s a good time as long as you stay away from achievement hunting. I also recommend you try out all of the characters at least once; it is truly tragic that superb characters like Lady and Trish can only be experienced through the poor missions of this game, but their movesets make the experience fun regardless.", "timestamp_created": 1653692889, "timestamp_updated": 1653692889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116087056": {"recommendationid": "116087056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198957962424", "num_games_owned": 924, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 748, "last_played": 1659062943}, "language": "spanish", "review": "SIIIIIIIIIII", "timestamp_created": 1653658657, "timestamp_updated": 1653658657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116058929": {"recommendationid": "116058929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135717209", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1576, "last_played": 1652550487}, "language": "english", "review": "It is safe to say that this is a game.", "timestamp_created": 1653601656, "timestamp_updated": 1653601656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116057710": {"recommendationid": "116057710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096075818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1653609183}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1653599561, "timestamp_updated": 1653599561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116011410": {"recommendationid": "116011410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334164657", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 914, "last_played": 1653517994}, "language": "english", "review": "2nd half of the game is just the 1st half backwards so it seems rushed and lazy but it's still a good and fun game... and it has Lady - now playable.\n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1653518182, "timestamp_updated": 1657232568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115883175": {"recommendationid": "115883175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970805186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1670910527}, "language": "english", "review": "Right so i've been binging this series and so far I have very much enjoyed my time with it.\n- DmC 1 I enjoyed and my god what an incredible game for 2001\n- DmC 2 I actually enjoyed to some extent because it was short and kinda cool ngl, though Dante was mega edgelord and the game was mad repetitive\n- DmC 3...

Literally the second half of the game is you just retracing your steps and re-fighting all the previous bosses. The game also includes Trish, Lady, and Virgil as playable characters but there is no point as you just get to play through the story again but as different characters, no new cutscenes besides their

I wasn't a fun of Dante's gameplay, I found it overwhelming remembering to switch and execute the moves in succession, and it doesn't introduce enough new elements to the game since its essentially a backtrack of all the levels. Still, the story is all right and the combat is fun. Try out Legendary Dark Knight difficulty for an overwhelming number of enemies.

The story is just not my kinda thing, but the gameplay is 150% solid and more than makes up for it. If you decide you do enjoy the game, you can extend the hell out of your mileage with the cheap Unlock All Modes DLC for some real challenges, and you can look up the ridiculous amount of special techniques people have found or 'created' to see just how high you can push your skill ceiling with each playable character.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nI've had DMC4:SE on other platforms and played it significantly more on those. It's got fantastic gameplay, a silly story, 'teenager-cool' characters, and it's the first game that comes to my mind when someone says \"Character Action\", aside from maybe ULTRAKILL (which itself is greatly inspired by DMC).\n\nThere's only two criticisms I can really make about DMC4, and one of them is just personal taste:\n\nYour mileage may vary on the story. It's silly campy schlock, which is a tone I've only ever enjoyed in a handful of games (Destroy All Humans and Duke Nukem 3D come to mind). Thankfully you can skip all of it and still enjoy the fantastic gameplay perfectly fine.\n\nThe other criticism is the DLC situation. One DLC to unlock all of Special Edition's extra gameplay modes is pretty necessary, thankfully [b]very[/b] cheap but still scummy. There's also a bunch of what I call \"Pay to play less\" DLCs, where you pay a premium for a kickstart in resources - a move that hurts the experience in my opinion, damaging the curve of unlocking things and getting to grips with each new unlock, naturally and smoothly getting better at the game over time.\n\n\nDMC4:SE is still a fantastic game over a decade later, definitely worth the time of anyone who likes the Character Action genre (considering the DMC series codified the genre), likes a good challenge, and wants a smooth and visually striking experience with cathartic melee combat at its core.", "timestamp_created": 1651891514, "timestamp_updated": 1651891514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true,

And if I become a demon, so be it, I'll endure the exile.\" <----- Most hype moment in any game :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\n\nDMC 5 was about Vergil's rebirth and DMC 4 is about Nero's. There are some Jungian references in the early portion of the game (as boring and painful as the map/levels can be). Essentially, this is Nero's path of individuation as the hero and savior in the franchise (to accept both the good and evil within his soul/psyche; \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" by William Blake). There are a lot of references to classical literature that the whole theme of the game is built off from (Both in DMC 4 and 5). I never would've imagined the series would be so deep after looking at how chaotic and silly it can be. \n\nIrritating to get used to at the start and there a lot of moments in the game where you're just suffering because you don't know what to do. Like a lot of trail-and-error which kind of kills this particular game's mood.\n\nStill just as badass as DMC 5 if not more imo. But the characters are a lot more lovable in DMC 5 except Dante. Another series that identifies with everything I love about life and this world. Reading as much as you can makes everything surprising even videos games so much more enjoyable.\n\nLong live Capcom!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnvruIkuhRw", "timestamp_created": 1649567980, "timestamp_updated": 1649572245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113549631": {"recommendationid": "113549631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067747552", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 749, "last_played": 1649462806}, "language": "english", "review": "It's half a game.

Base DMC 4 let's you play through the game with the first half being Nero's campaign while the 2nd half is Dante's. Nero only has a small moveset but compensates with having the buster move which is a dedicated grab button. He was made with new players in mind as an introduction to the series. The exceed system also differentiates new and expert players. Expert players will have no problem hitting EX-Act at the right moment and basically maintaining Red Queen's gauge. On the other hand we have Dante, the main star of the DMC games. His kit is complex and hard to get used to. Style switching on the fly is a new mechanic in DMC4 that allows Dante to have 4 different functions on the Circle/B button. His new styles feel a bit weaker than they did in 3 but that was probably done to compensate with having style switching. Dante can also switch between 3 guns and 3 melee weapons making him really versatile. With that said, combat is also where the games suffers its flaws. The enemies really feel like they were designed for Nero which makes fighting these same enemies with Dante a bit tedious. The other problem with the game is that there aren't really a lot of areas. Dante's campaign is just Nero's but going through the stages backwards. \n\n Dante feels really weird to play here but this is probably his most advanced iteration yet even with DMC5. There's just a lot to learn with the techniques in this game which drastically affects gameplay. Personally I still have not gotten used to Dante's DMC4 combat style. It's really fun to see his full potential when watching players like donguri. \n\nSpecial Edition adds Vergil, Trish and Lady. I haven't tried the other two but I can speak for Vergil. He is the most fun character to play in this game, I dare say he is also the most broken. Vergil's damage is just insane not to mention his heavy rain sword stun mechanic. He can also cancel any move he does with his trick teleport. His combat is just stylish, clean, and elegant. I advise you to beat the game ASAP just to get to play him in Bloody Palace. You won't regret playing as him.\n\nDMC4 is a great game with a few flaws that if you can overlook, will guarantee that you'll have a great time.", "timestamp_created": 1647452663, "timestamp_updated": 1647452663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112276705": {"recommendationid": "112276705", "author": {"steamid": "76561199249270067", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1690535554}, "language": "english", "review": "awawa\n", "timestamp_created": 1647413671, "timestamp_updated": 1647413671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112255418": {"recommendationid": "112255418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891759780", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 2575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1649860513}, "language": "english", "review": "how to jc cancel dmc 4 tutoriale\n", "timestamp_created": 1647376887, "timestamp_updated": 1647376887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112239922": {"recommendationid": "112239922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107734470", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1647285117}, "language": "english", "review": "7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1647356541, "timestamp_updated": 1647356541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112232505": {"recommendationid": "112232505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289778406", "num_games_owned": 609, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1685141585}, "language": "english", "review": "Great action!", "timestamp_created": 1647345383, "timestamp_updated": 1647345383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112218906": {"recommendationid": "112218906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057760670", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1779, "last_played": 1655312799}, "language": "english", "review": "Agnus: It was my assumption that those demons would prove far inferior...

This character has limitless potential; if it takes 100 hours to master Nero, it will take you 2000h to master Dante (if there even is such a thing...)\n\n-Gameplay is top notch : precise, fast, flexible, creative, challenging and motivates you to keep playing and slowly mastering the mechanics. \n\nCons : \nStarted with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and the game had a hard time with the analogue stick threshold to switch from \"Walk\" to \"Run\". I had to push the stick against the rim with a lot of pressure to get it to register a \"Run\". I quickly understood I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game fully with my controller because of that problem, so I switched to Keyboard. No other games gave me this issue yet, be warned.\n\nVerdict : If you're looking for a fun 20h single player action game, DMC4SE will satisfy you. If you're looking for a game with replayability, you can experience the story and the Bloody Palace (arcade mode/boss rush) with 3 characters (Trish, Lady & Virgil) other than the main two (Nero & Dante).

I'd argue the combat system is done better than DMC3, but the enemies don't mix with some of the characters, specifically Dante. It feels like Nero was made to be the sole protagonist, and they slapped Dante in halfway through because what's a DMC game without Dante? My biggest gripe with DMC4 however are the missions themselves. This game is by far the worst when it comes to level gimmicks and puzzles, which were present in DMC1 and 3 but were handled much better in those games. The sole culprit as to why these levels leave a sour taste in my mouth is because they are meant to pad out game time. DMC4 is notorious for being rushed and unfortunately it feels like an unfinished product. I wish the special edition did more for this game than add new playable characters. I think this game leans towards a 7.5/10, which may seem harsh to some, but if I'm ever going back to this game, it's probably with the Bloody Palace mode because the main campaign was not a

I can count with one hand the amount of enemies we get for Nero\u00b4s campaign and Dante's, i would be ok with this seeing how DMC3 had a few re-skins but the fact is, the enemies are not very enjoyable or interesting to figth, so combine this with the lack of variety and you will be figthing the same repetitive, boring enemies multiple times, yay!\n\n2. The enviroments are bland and uninspired, remember DMC1 and DMC3 and how memorable and unique the levels and puzzles where? Well guess what? Do you enjoy linear hallways and bland looking enviroments that are a chore to get trough? Well this game is for you, oh and the itens placement, side missions are also garbage so yay for stripping what made DMC3 levels fun rigth.\n\n3. Story was only ever good in DMC3, this one is even worse than 1 ( LMAO ) i played DMC1 and V before as well so i wasn\u00b4t expecting anything groundbreaking but god was this a chore, Nero is a bland nothing charater that litterally has 0 relevance to the story, i guess hes Vergil\u00b4s kid and all that but they do nothing with him, he is not only a bootleg dante but his backstory is so bad they dont even continue his story in DMC V he just tags allong..\n\n4. Music was meh couldnt remmeber any of the songs, and again guess what most Dmc games have a great Soundtrack Dmc1 and 3 specifically.\n\nAnd thats all i wanna talk about i wasted 10 hours of my life forcing myself to finish it, it\u00b4s so bad id rather give up honestly and play something actually fun, I don\u00b4t recomend it stay away from it (I learned a valuable lesson, being a fanboy to a franchise or a game is a sin ill never commit again lol.)", "timestamp_created": 1643652653, "timestamp_updated": 1644341230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4822501540184021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109183618": {"recommendationid": "109183618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071843857", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1643904806}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un Devil May Cry al puro estilo Devil May Cry.

No lo s\u00e9. \n\nQuiero empezar esta rese\u00f1a hablando de una de las mayores caracter\u00edsticas de este juego: tiene diferentes campa\u00f1as con personajes mezclados: tienes la historia con Nero, un personaje totalmente nuevo introducido a la saga en este juego, m\u00e1s Dante (es decir, empiezas como Nero pero al llegar a x misi\u00f3n debes seguir como Dante); tienes la campa\u00f1a con Lady y Trish, y la de Vergil (estas dos \u00faltimas no las he jugado). El cambio de personaje quiz\u00e1s pueda parecer duro, yo lo pensaba en un principio, pero nos encontramos con un factor decisivo: Nero tiene muchos combos y es el personaje principal en el que los desarrolladores han querido dejar el mayor peso, mientras que el Dante que nos presentan aqu\u00ed es como el que tenemos en el 3 con su Rebellion, pero no tenemos tantos combos al no disponer de todo el arsenal que ten\u00edamos en el anterior juego numerado, pero se le a\u00f1ade el factor de que puede cambiar de estilos en mitad del combate que cambiar\u00e1 el efecto del bot\u00f3n B o C\u00edrculo m\u00e1s a\u00f1adir ciertos combos al personaje (los cuatro estilos que desarrollamos en el DMC 3, siendo Trickster el estilo \u00e1gil; Swordmaster el estilo que nos permite hacer combos en el aire y lanzar ondas de choque de la espada; Gunslinger el estilo centrado en armas de fuego; y Royalguard es el estilo para aquellos que gusten de bloquear y contraatacar). En otras palabras, este Dante tiene menos combos pero sigue  siendo \u00e1gil y reparte bien. Algo que debo comentar es que he notado apresurada la ruta de Dante: si bien empiezas con Nero y \u00e9l tiene armas fijas, Dante sigue ganando nuevas armas al derrotar a jefes, pero su parte es tan corta y las mejoras de las mismas son tan pocas que siento lo anterior mencionado, no es un Dante tan completo como el que vimos en la entrega anterior.\n\nHay algo novedoso en la tienda, y es que en este juego tenemos dos monedas: las t\u00edpicas gemas rojas que gastamos en la tienda para los objetos y los cristales de vida y de Devil Trigger; y por otro lado las gemas valientes (no recuerdo si se llamaban as\u00ed o de otra forma) que te dan al acabar cada misi\u00f3n o bien si te tienes que retirar y tienes que abandonar, momento en el que te dan varias gemas dependiendo de cu\u00e1nto hayas avanzado o combatido. Estas gemas son las que se usan para mejorar y aprender habilidades pasivas y de las armas. \n\nSe habla mucho de cierta pol\u00e9mica, y es la de que [spoiler] la parte del juego de Dante es el camino que ha hecho Nero pero al rev\u00e9s. De igual forma, los jefes a los que se enfrenta Dante en dicho recorrido son los mismos a los que se enfrent\u00f3 Nero. [/spoiler] Pienso que esto se puede haber hecho para amenizar el cambio de personaje, ya que estar acostumbrado a un personaje y que de pronto te hagan usar a otro distinto puede ser confuso, pero si has jugado al 3 la memoria muscular te puede ayudar, a m\u00ed me pas\u00f3. No obstante, opino que esto fue un tanto vago, adem\u00e1s de [spoiler] reciclar jefes en la ruta de Dante, lo cual no dice mucha cosa buena ya que DMC siempre se ha destacado por tener muchos jefes distintos. [/spoiler]\n\nHabiendo solo jugado a la historia de Nero/Dante, puedo decir que el juego est\u00e1 chulo. Al ser otro DMC no hace falta que haga varios p\u00e1rrafos detall\u00e1ndolo todo porque usa la misma estructura que los anteriores juegos. Hay alg\u00fan villano memorable que me hizo mucha gracia, y Nero me parece un personaje soso en cuanto a personalidad. No nos dice mucho de \u00e9l y tampoco suelta muchos comentarios. En definitiva, aunque fue un juego que me cost\u00f3 empezar por varios motivos y tambi\u00e9n porque Nero no es tan \u00e1gil como Dante al principio, puedo afirmar que los jefes me gustaron y es un juego divertido si te acostumbras. Pese a ello, siento que el 3 ten\u00eda m\u00e1s juego en cuanto a los combos. Recomiendo este juego para los que quieran seguir la evoluci\u00f3n (o quiz\u00e1s progreso) de la saga.", "timestamp_created": 1642326014, "timestamp_updated": 1642326422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108100425": {"recommendationid": "108100425", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054565735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1536, "last_played": 1659144775}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nashe", "timestamp_created": 1642293979, "timestamp_updated": 1642293979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108094626": {"recommendationid": "108094626", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053004154", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 898, "last_played": 1697974158}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil May Cry 4 is the 4th game in the series.

As someone who (at the point of this review) has only played DMC5 and just finished their first run in DMC4, this was kind of a rough task. Even though I've played Devil may cry 5 in every difficulty up to SoS and through the first half of DmD, I had my few struggles with this game. \nTo be fair it was mostly mission 3 with it's puzzle aspect, as well as the other puzzle missions which I didnt really enjoy, paired with some boss fights which were a big pain. \nBUT in the end I do not regret buying it. Cutscenes and Combat themes mostly made me think this way. I'm really glad we got to see such precious cutscenes and they often lived up to my expectations concerning the game. The music fullfills it's job and even a friend of mine ,who just briefly watched me play through the endgame ,commented on the good sound of Nero's battletheme. \nI'm looking forward to playing the game as the other characters too, but I cant yet say anything about their routes.\n\nSo, a small summary of my review and some extra points: \nPro:\n- GREAT MUSIC \n- good dmc style combat (but you would need to watch out for some habits if you played dmc5 first, mostly Nero's combat)\n- great cutscenes\n- a mostly interesting story\n- loveable, as well as hateable characters\n- lovely voice acting\n- a good amount of a challenge in general\n\nCon:\n- a weird way of pathing the missions in my opinion [spoiler] at least for the part where you switch to dante in the middle half and basically have to replay it all backwards [/spoiler]\n- I did not like most of the boss fights and how they were designed\n- enemies like faults and blitzes are just pure pain - truly hell's suffering if you dont watch out\n- can tilt you really easy sometimes\n- THERE IS RNG IN SOME LEVELS, which really got on my nerves. [spoiler] The whole dice rolling aspect in mission 19 just made the end a bit more painful than it could and should have been in my opinion [/spoiler]\n\nBut all in all: a worthy experience.

Itemki lecz\u0105ce s\u0105 praktycznie wsz\u0119dzie i kiedy gra\u0142em pierwszy raz zgin\u0105\u0142em tylko 1 od Bossa kt\u00f3ry jak cie z\u0142apie to po tobie (bez spoiler\u00f3w widzicie jaki mi\u0142y :P). Co prawda wrogom trzeba wpakowa\u0107 czasami 6 kul w morde \u017ceby padli ale to i tak nie to samo uczucie jakie by\u0142o w originale gdzie zombiaku mog\u0142y przyj\u0105\u0107 o wiele wincej ammo i dopiero padn\u0105\u0107. Jest jeszcze sprawa jak\u017ce znanego Pana X kt\u00f3ry w Originale dzia\u0142a\u0142 o wiele ciekawiej ni\u017c ten nam znany. Chodzi mi to najbardziej o to \u017ce nie goni\u0142 nas przez ca\u0142y posterunek a potem lab (warto te\u017c wspomie\u0107 o tym \u017ce pojawia\u0142 si\u0119 w jednym scenariuszu) tylko pojawia\u0142 si\u0119 w wyznaczonych miejscach i po jego pokonaniu pada\u0142 na ziemie i mo\u017cna by\u0142a zebra\u0107 po nim loot (w postaci ammunicji) warto te\u017c powiedzie\u0107 co\u015b o Super Tyrantcie kt\u00f3ry do gry zosta\u0142 wpakowany na si\u0142e. Skoro poruszy\u0142em temat scenariuszy warto powiedzie\u0107 jak Capcom zwali\u0142o ca\u0142y sens Scenariusza A i Scenariusza B. Dla tych kt\u00f3rzy nie kumaj\u0105 tematu kiedy pierwszy raz odpalili\u015bmy gr\u0119 mogli\u015bmy albo p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 Leonem Scenariusz A albo Claire Scenariusz B i te dwa scenariusze naprawd\u0119 si\u0119 r\u00f3\u017cni\u0142y a gdy przeszli\u015bmy Claire albo Leonem to mogli\u015bmy Leon B i Claire A a w Remake dostajemy jaki\u015b 2nd Run kt\u00f3ry zmienia 1% gry. Nie podoba mi si\u0119 te\u017c r\u00f3\u017cnica broni, w originale bronie by\u0142y troche ciekawsze np by\u0142a kusza, SMG dla obu postaci albo chocia\u017c brak tego s\u0142abego rewolweru dla Claire (chodzi mi o jej podstawowy).\n\nDobra koniec z rzeczami z\u0142ymi przejd\u017amy do rzeczy kt\u00f3re mi si\u0119 podobaj\u0105. Uwielbam rozwini\u0119cie osobowo\u015bci Marvin kt\u00f3ry w Originale pojawia si\u0119 raz na pocz\u0105tku gdy wchodzimy do RPD i odrazu nas wyrzuca z pokoju daj\u0105c nam tylko karte i drugi raz ju\u017c jako zombie gdy wchodzimy do tego pokoju innymi drzwiami. Kocham ale to Kocham Roberta Kendo w tej grze (ten kole\u015b ze sklepu z broni\u0105), tak jak w Originale gin\u0105\u0142 on odrazu na pocz\u0105tku tak tutaj nie do\u015b\u0107 \u017ce ma ciekawsze linie to jeszcze jest dodatkowy tryb z nim jak ucieka aaaaa jak ja to kocham. Capcom zrobi\u0142o te\u017c genialn\u0105 robote z Darmowym DLC \"Ghost Survivor\" zdecydowanie moim ulubionym jest \"Bez Wyj\u015bcia\" czy jako\u015b tak, tryby te s\u0105 sprawdzianem dla graczy czy umi\u0105 poradzi\u0107 sobie z hordami zombie b\u0119d\u0105c s\u0142abo uzbrojony, og\u00f3\u0142em musisz unika\u0107 zombiaki bo nie masz wystarczaj\u0105ca amma by je pozabija\u0107 i uciec do wyznaczonego miejsca nie jest to \u0142atwe zadanie ale napewno jest fajne.

Due to this the game feels as really repetitive and boring cutscenes have no real value other than to help you doze off to sleep. Later in the game you see a bunch of really good cutscenes that remind me of DMC3 feels like a ray of light showing you a better more compelling story and interesting characters. \n\nThe combat in this game is really good it's one of the reasons that kept me playing till the end with the carboard cutout main character and his poorly written and hard to connect to motivations. Combat is on the surface not complex and quite frankly appears if there's not a lot to work with, but there is there's a lot to work with and it's fun discovering and figuring that out especially when you get later in the game when it seems like it starts getting good. \n\nThe bosses in the game are fine, I guess they're really easy and you roll over them most of the time. there's a part near the middle of the game that (not spoiling) you have to go somewhere, but this was probably the most lazy padding I've ever seen in a game you spend all the rest of the missions doing things you've already done only in reverse with silly gimmicks that barely change anything\n\nOverall the game is good if you like pulling off cool combos and looking cool while doing it. I just didn't feel like putting more hours into the game because of how after the end I didn't feel like playing anymore due to knowing that the other 2 playthroughs are the same, but without cutscences oh and you play as stupidly op characters that make you roll over everything with barely any challenge. I believe this to be a good game, but if you can't handle that there's next to no story then I'd recommend not playing it. If you're a DMC fan or a fan of hack and slash games then this is for you, or rather hitting things and feeling good about yourself.

I don't really like Nero as a character. He's got no motivations other than a girl whom he loves, which isn't necessarily bad, but then again, the female interest is basically an anime cardboard cutout. Dante is Dante. Overall the narrative won't hold your interest and is really weak.\n\nThe graphics are good. Not spectacular, but good. Environments are ok, with some of the architecture that looks impressive. I like the character models, which feel a bit anime-esque. Enemy design could have been better.\n\nThe gameplay is the core reason why you should play the game. The combat system is great, though I wish there was more variety to the Devil Bringer Arm. You can chain combos, on ground, mid-air, parry even the ultimate moves of bosses, it's great. Nero has just one sword and gun, Dante has three. Some of the enemies feel not suitable for Dante. (Cutlass, Mephisto) Would have been nice if both characters were balanced. The puzzles and platforming sections feel disjointed, instead of what ideally should be an occasionally  breather from the breakneck combat.\n\nBosses are tough and visually imposing. Not DMC3 tough, but tough nevertheless. On harder difficulty, they unleash some additional moves, which is nice. Nero doesn't gain any weapons after defeating them, but Dante does sometimes. Also, why does Dante have to basically backtrack what Nero did? He doesn't have any unique bosses to fight, with the exception of Saviour, and that battle isn't that great. It kind of proves the-bigger-they-are-the-harder-they-fall theory, which shouldn't be the case. But I'm satisfied with the boss battles in DMC 4, and really enjoyed battling some of them.\n\nThis could have been an excellent game, but it's still good.

Series newcomer Nero has a half-campaign with well designed but faced paced levels. Upon hitting mission 12, the player changes to Dante, who has an insane movelist and freedom of player expression. The issue is that Dante retraces Nero\u2019s steps for his levels and sees 1 unique room and that\u2019s it. It really hampers the game. \nHowever, DMC4 has objectively the most complex mechanics of any DMC game due to the jank caused by it\u2019s rushed development. If you learn to exploit this, you can do fucking insane anime-fight movement and do dramatic and artistic combos. For most people though, it\u2019ll just be like the gameplay in 5.\n\nStage design is great and the game\u2019s presentation still holds up well. It\u2019s not pretty by any means but it doesn\u2019t look like most games from the late 2000s.\n\nEnemy design is unfortunately pretty bad. The basic scarecrow enemies are fine, but almost everything else isn\u2019t fun to fight, ranging from annoying to flat-out unfun. Mephistos and Fausts need to be shot a bunch to drop their shield to do real damage. Galdius\u2019 (Gladii?) and Cutlasses keep out of your reach and aren\u2019t that interesting. Frosts are very tanky and have powerful and frustrating freeze attacks. Alto Angelos boost the abilities of Bianco Angelos (which isn\u2019t a huge deal but typically they come in packs with 1 alto and 5 or 6 bianco angelos). Chimeras are unbelievably mean. Fuck the chimeras. I want to personally shit on and murder whoever designed this shit. Blitzes are frustrating and poorly designed but are pretty easy when you know how to drop their electric armor. Most enemies in the game are listed here.\n\nDMC4:SE adds a bunch of content. Vergil is playable, and is busted. Lady is really interesting. Trish is busted and super easy. Fun though. The new Legendary Dark Knight mode is a slightly less punishing Son of Sparta difficulty with a ton of enemies. Hell and Hell mode pushes the definition of masochism, especially with the enemies in this game. \n\nAll in all DMC4 is a niche title. If you\u2019re new to the series, play 5!

I think I liked 1 and 3 better overall still, but this one's still fun. I just liked the personalities of the other games a bit better, but this one still has everything that you'd expect.\n\nYou play through most of this game as Nero, who has a cool arm! He's really fun to fight bosses as, because when they're in a staggered state you can grab them and mess them up with your demon arm! Later on you'll swap to playing as Dante and basically backtrack through every level you played as Nero, but it's still fun. Dante has different interactions with bosses, plays much differently, and the levels are condensed and spiced up a bit for your return trip. I've seen complaints about how you're basically playing the same game twice, but I'd say that the levels you play as either character were definitely different enough for me.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the final boss and final few levels of this game though. No spoilers ofc, but it had one of the most boring boss fights I've ever played, and one of the last levels was just a filler episode where u moved along, maybe fought waves of enemies, and just had repeat bosses appear to fight for no reason before the end.", "timestamp_created": 1638597066, "timestamp_updated": 1638597066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105190812": {"recommendationid": "105190812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096856503", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 987, "last_played": 1685729477}, "language": "english", "review": "Dante raises a deadbeat father's son", "timestamp_created": 1638596920, "timestamp_updated": 1638596920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105181827": {"recommendationid": "105181827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294769701", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1649490908}, "language": "english", "review": "epic combo", "timestamp_created": 1638586077, "timestamp_updated": 1638586077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105173224": {"recommendationid": "105173224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892209743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1638573922}, "language": "english", "review": "el peor DMC.

pope of the catholic church from destroying italy by building a big statue\n\nyou first play as arm boy who is a 10 year old child who swallowed glowsticks as a baby and now has a luminous blue arm which looks like it is made out of bread crusts\nyour mission is to run from one end of italy to the other while fighting the devils who cry as well as destroying the entire membership of the vatican\nalong the way you will encounter roughly 10 unique enemies total 5 of which were actually designed with your character in mind\na boss fight which is literally a window \nand the dice that will make you cry on your first playthrough\nkeep note of the bosses you fight as you have to fight most of them 3 times total because the developers felt like it including the giant fly for some reason\n\nyou then get to play as the character the series is known for and get to play all of the levels you just played except you run the opposite direction yes that is how they designed his levels\ndante is unique as unlike nero he actually gets more weapons because capcom had 3 minutes to make the game and is thus one of 2 characters people like to play as \nalong the way you will encounter the same enemies as the last time you played the game except this time none of them were designed to suit your moveset so you will be fighting that one lightning guy for roughly 8 years\nafter running backwards through italy and fighting the same bosses you have already fought you go fight the big statue and realise what a horrible decision you have made getting this far as you engage in a boss fight almost entirely based on shooting the giant statues zits from very far away and sometimes you get to actually hit him\nthen you switch back to arm boy and kill the pope again after fighting all the bosses a third time except for the only good one\n\nhowever this game is the special edition they made 7 years after it first came out because they realised that people dont like dante when he looks like he is an 18 year old heroin addict so they made this to try and keep people interested while making an actually good game except they still forgot to finish it so everything i just mentioned still applies\n\nyou get 3 funky new characters\nbayonetta who has the golf club sword and is basically just a watered down version of dante who is kinda fun sometimes i guess\nwoman who has about 2 melee attacks and the rest rely on her guns so if you dont like ranged combat in this series then i dont know what to tell you\nand the funny motivation guy who is fluent in over 6 million forms of kicking your ass who they gave an almost instakill move you can spam because they thought it would be funny\nand they were right\n\noverall i cant afford dmc5 special

Despite a lot of assets (mostly boss fights) being reused in the story, Devil May Cry 4's Special Edition allows you to play with 5 different playstyles: Nero, Dante, Vergil, Lady and Trish. All of the characters have their own unique movesets and style of play, and it helps to distract from some of the game's flaws. The story, in my opinion, is actually decent as well. Unlike previous titles, the game actual starts by following newcomer to the series (at the time), Nero, who bears a strange devil arm (literally). While Dante is present, he doesn't come in and kill everything in one blow, like he probably would if you were playing as him. Instead he plays more of a mentor role for Nero, only really stepping in when things get serious. Generally, I'd say this is a good game, and people who want to get into Devil May Cry should definitely start here or with Devil May Cry 3.\n\nRedCrystal7x", "timestamp_created": 1638433053, "timestamp_updated": 1638433053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105034532": {"recommendationid": "105034532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837395157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1620070956}, "language": "english", "review": "Good combat, good story, Ps3/Xbox360 graphics, overall 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1638397728, "timestamp_updated": 1638397728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105023012": {"recommendationid": "105023012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880770196", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1690407867}, "language": "english", "review": "When its fun, its really fucken fun\nbut when its not fun, i hate it", "timestamp_created": 1638384972, "timestamp_updated": 1638384972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634159862995147705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104693291": {"recommendationid": "104693291", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092904478", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1643989936}, "language": "english", "review": "the hit video game about \"Italian for Black\", the angry teenage boy who goes on a mission using his weird but super cool right arm to save his non-blood related sister \"Basically Claire Redfield minus the badassery\" who is also his lover from evil Pope Francis and save the world from the evil Rio Jesus statue while his wacky woohoo uncle \"Sir SWORD-TRICK-SWORD-TRICK-\" watches with his two girl friends \"Ms Dark soul who should've been filled with light\" and \"Woman\"", "timestamp_created": 1638190116, "timestamp_updated": 1638190703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104686108": {"recommendationid": "104686108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069081763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1638389735}, "language": "english", "review": "The time has come and so have I...", "timestamp_created": 1638186338, "timestamp_updated": 1638186338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104678330": {"recommendationid": "104678330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930517666", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1671205338}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game is Flawed but very fun", "timestamp_created": 1638181282, "timestamp_updated": 1638434335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104640826": {"recommendationid": "104640826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044555983", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1697570612}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Porque buscas una rese\u00f1a mala?
